      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the approach adopted by him in his discussions with the Prime Minister of Malta on the institutional problems associated with EC membership for Malta; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Commission will address the institutional implications of Malta's application for EC membership in its forthcoming opinion on this application.  Ireland's approach to Malta's application will depend on the content of the Commission's opinion which will have to deal, in particular, with the important institutional issues arising.  I indicated this to Dr Fenech-Adami, the Maltese Prime Minister, in what were very useful discussions on Monday last, 3 May, while assuring him of our general goodwill to Malta as a small European country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the Commission, which comprises 17 members, is large enough to be effective and that from the point of view <Col N="1002" /> of it being an effective body in future we should be aiming towards having one Commissioner only per member state, certainly in the short term, to maintain the numbers at not more than 17?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Council is satisfied that the present proposals for enlargement can be contained within the present institutional arrangements.  I will not speculate further regarding the implications the Commission may see in publishing its opinion regarding Malta's application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Maltese have made it clear, in the context of their application for membership, that they are not insisting on a commissionership, that they would perhaps be willing to share a commissionship and that they may not insist on their right to the Presidency by rotation.  Will the Taoiseach confirm whether that is the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Prime Minister said they were flexible in regard to the type of issues raised by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not see institutional problems with an enlargement that does not include Malta in so far as if one adds the Scandinavian countries and Hungary and Austria, we will have 16 or 17 members?  A conventional <i>tour de table</i> at the Council of Ministers, in that event will take up to one and a half hours, even if each Minister speaks for only four or five minutes. Does the Taoiseach not see major practical problems in reaching consensus in that type of setting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been widely discussed, it was certainly discussed at Lisbon.  In regard to the question of the adequacy of the present institutional arrangements, it will certainly take up a greater amount of time, there is no question about that.  However, they can cope with the present enlargement applications and it will be interesting to learn <Col N="1003" /> their opinions and ideas, for instance, in relation to Malta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that members of the incoming French Government have expressed the view that the issue of enlargement cannot be settled until the institutional problems associated with it have first been settled by the existing members?  Will he agree there is a need to address the whole issue, not just the size of the Commission but also the institutional arrangements for the Council of Ministers, before binding and final decisions have been taken on enlargement?  What is the Taoiseach's view?  Which does he think should come first?</P>

      <P>The question deals with Malta.  We are now having an extension of the subject matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the views expressed by the incoming French Government in that regard but, as I said, the European Council has agreed that the institutional arrangements can cope with the present enlargement proposals. I am sure Deputy Bruton will agree that we have a vested interest in relation to institutional arrangements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that because Malta is a small country &mdash; of approximately 400,000 people &mdash; we have a vested interest in ensuring that small countries are not squeezed out in the context of an enlargement to perhaps 20 member states and that perhaps, strategically, we have a long term interest in ensuring that we side with Malta, as a small country, in whatever stand they take on the institutional question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  I accept we have a vested interest in that regard. We must be careful that larger countries do not avail of the opportunity to improve their position in relation to their <Col N="1004" /> standing at institutional level.  We have an interest in as many small countries as possible being included but we also have an interest in whatever institutional arrangements might be proposed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that it is not in Ireland's interest to have a large number of small micro states excluded from the European Community because they could become tax havens and operate in a manner which would undermine the objectives of the Community in regard to cohesion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept Deputy Bruton's comment in general terms. However, Switzerland is on the outside, it is not at present applying but I hope that will change.  It was one of the weaknesses of the taxation and investment package that finally put it to bed at European level as it was not possible to control what was happening outside the Community, the same point made by the Deputy.</P>

      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the present personnel available to the Parliamentary Draughtsman; the way in which this compares to five years ago; and the proposals, if any, he has to increase staffing.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are at present eight parliamentary draftsmen on the Attorney General's staff compared with four in May 1988.  In addition, the services of a former head of the Parliamentary Draftsman's Office and a former head of the Statute Law Reform and Consolidation Office are retained by the Attorney General on a full time contractual basis, as was the case five years ago.  It is considered that this number of drafting personnel is adequate for the State's current needs but I have asked the Attorney General to keep the position <Col N="1005" /> under review and to inform me if that situation changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the Moriarty group, which reported last week, pointed out specifically that there was a bottleneck in this area?  Is he aware that his colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, indicated at that time that the Government was reviewing the numbers available in the parliamentary draftsman's office?  Has that review been completed in three days and has the Taoiseach now decided that the views of the Moriarty group were wrong?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated at the end of my reply, the position is being kept under review by the Attorney General. He has said that his present staffing level is adequate.  Legislation is being returned to the Government fairly quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Can one take it that if there is an adequate supply of parliamentary draftsmen any delays in legislation do not originate in the parliamentary draftsman's office but rather are political and administrative delays, for which there is direct political responsibility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Deputy cannot draw that conclusion from what I said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, more than any other Deputy, should be aware that some legislation is straightforward while in the case of other legislation it takes a lot of time to tease out the constitutional and other issues which may arise.  The Deputy should not be seeking to point the political finger all the time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>If the staff available to the parliamentary draftsman is adequate, <Col N="1006" /> how does the Taoiseach explain the furore in the other House when we pirated legislation in order to keep the business of this House going?  If it was not the fault of the parliamentary draftsman, can the Taoiseach tell the House whose fault it was?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We had expected to receive a Bill from the other House but the debate on it was not completed. There was no shortage of work in the other House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach how many of the draftsmen are women?  In view of an earlier response to a similar question on the number of people employed in this area, may I ask the Taoiseach what procedures are in place within Government Departments to develop and train people so that they can be promoted to this position and carry out the jobs which need to be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Three of the eight draftspeople are women.  People need to be trained in the necessary skills and the Attorney General is considering the best way to approach this issue.  A lack of necessary skills was one of the reasons the backlog built-up in the parliamentary draftsman's office over a period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we take it that delays in the parliamentary draftsman's office are not an excuse for delays in the introduction of legislation here?  Does the Taoiseach consider that a case can be made for re-examining Cabinet procedure instructions in regard to the way heads of Bills have to be drafted and every Bill has to be circulated twice to all relevant Departments before being approved, to see if there are other ways in which the political intentions of Government and the House can be converted more quickly into reality?  The Finance Bill &mdash; the most complex piece of legislation brought before the House <Col N="1007" />&mdash; can be drafted within two months, while in the case of ordinary legislation it takes a minimum of two years from inception to delivery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy cannot take from what I said that any delays in future will be of a political nature.  As I have already explained to Deputy McDowell, some Bills are straightforward while in the case of others some very complicated constitutional issues can arise.  With regard to the other part of the Deputy's question, there are very good legal systems in some Government Departments which carry out much of the groundwork before a Bill is sent to the parliamentary draftsman's office.  Other Departments do not have the necessary facilities, and we are looking into this aspect.  With regard to changing the procedure for the circulation of the heads of Bills, I am not sure that there is a simple way around this, but I will certainly have a look at the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>As always, I will obey the Chair.  May I ask the Taoiseach how long it takes to train a parliamentary draftsman?  I have heard that this training can take up to five years.  In such circumstances, it would be wise at least to have trainees in the office at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how long this training takes, but it is a skill which take sometime to develop.  I will get the exact period of time and I will get the Deputy know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach accept that all the expertise in this area does not rest in the parliamentary draftsman's office?  Would he consider in certain <Col N="1008" /> circumstances contracting-out the drafting of Bills?  Is the Taoiseach aware that already in this Dáil more new Bills have been drafted by Deputy Shatter and Deputy McDowell than by the parliamentary draftsman's office?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach would agree that Government Bills often have to be substantially redrafted by Members on this side of the House to make them work.  Would the Taoiseach agree also that it would greatly speed up the legislative process if his Government changed its approach and stopped its kneejerk reaction to measures coming from this side of the House and automatically opposing them regardless of their merits?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the replies which I gave to Questions Nos. 18, 83, 85 and 86 of Wednesday, 7 October 1992 <Col N="1010" /> and to Question No. 2 of Wednesday, 17 February 1993 relating to the promotion of the Shannon Estuary.</P>
      <P>Formal arrangements have now been put in place within Shannon Free Airport Development Company, SFADCo, to co-ordinate and promote this project through the establishment of a staff project team, under the chairmanship of an assistant chief executive of SFADCo. The Secretariat is provided by SFADCo and membership also includes the Department of the Environment, the Department of the Marine, the IDA, Limerick Harbour Commissioners, Foynes Harbour Trustees and the University of Limerick.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the project team were agreed by me in consultation with the relevant Ministers in November 1992 as:</P>
      <P>To secure the integrated economic development of the Shannon Estuary as the focus for the establishment of Ireland as an economically strategic trading bridgehead between continental Europe and third countries.</P>
      <P>Arrangements have been made by SFADCo for consultation with a wide range of public and private sector entities.</P>
      <P>The strategic elements of international marketing of the European bridgehead concept will be more fully explored and the infrastructure provisions needed to underpin the concept are under review. An overview document, prepared by SFADCo, coordinating the various EC Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund submissions relating to activities within the Shannon Estuary area is currently being considered by the staff project team.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Work on a feasibility study, financed by the European Commission, in the context of the Euro-Quebec Hydro-Hydrogen Pilot Project is proceeding as indicated in my reply to Question No. 2 of 17 February 1993.  This is expected to be completed in late autumn 1993.  One of the aims of the study is to identify how the Shannon Estuary can exploit, and contribute to, emerging European policies <Col N="1011" /> on clean energy and clean production technology.</P>
    <P>In relation to higher education, a delegation from the Russian Committee on Higher Education visited Limerick and Shannon, including the University of Limerick, in January 1993.  General agreement was reached on areas of possible co-operation in areas such as technology transfer, management and administration of universities; mutual access to networks of academic and scientific information and related issues.  A return visit by representatives of the University of Limerick to the Moscow Institute of Aviation and the Russian Research Institute for Higher Education is being arranged.</P>
    <P>Limerick Harbour Commissioners are engaged in talks regarding possible importation in bulk of animal feeds for local use and for transhipment.  They are also considering a coal transhipment project.</P>
    <P>My Department's interest in the project will continue to be represented by Dr. Con Power under a contract with Nemesis Limited, a business development and public affairs consultancy of which he is a director.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>After that elaborate reply it is difficult to pose suplementary questions.  Will the Taoiseach say whether his Department is now responsible for promotion of the Shannon Estuary being transfered to SFADCo?  Was the impression he gave at the Irish Management Institute Conferences in 1992 and 1993 correct, which was that his Department was handling the overall promotion of the Shannon Estuary?  Will he also state whether the IDA land on the Tarbet/Ballylongford landbank is the main focus of his promotional exercise? Is he aware that at present the Louisiana Pacific Timber Company is seeking a location for a deep water port to set up a timber manufacturing project and will he use his good offices to ensure that the land bank in Tarbet/Ballylongford will be considered for this purpose?</P>

      <P>The landbank at Tarbet/ballylongford is part of the overall area being taken into consideration in formulating an integrated project for the development of the Shannon Estuary.  I am aware that Louisiana Pacific is looking at Ireland as a possible location before deciding where it will operate. The Minister for Agriculture will be following up that project within the next week or so and will have a meeting with them.  First, we must endeavour to attract them to Ireland and then hopefully within Ireland, they will later make a final choice in regard to location.  Certainly they will be shown areas with deep water facilities in which they are interested.  One area with excellent deep water facilities is the one to which Deputy Deenihan referred. SFADCo is putting all the bits and pieces together from the various Departments.</P>
      <P>In relation to the other part of Deputy Deenihan's question, the various Departments to which I referred in my reply are also contributing.  The interest of my Department is being maintained through the representation of Dr. Con Power.  I reiterate that the development of this concept is being assisted by the EC. SFADCo's involvement is in an endeavour to put it all together for examination in relation to Cohesion and Structural Funds for the future.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware that the EC is expending considerable funds endeavouring to devise alternative ways and means of producing energy from cleaner technology, stop further emissions into the atmosphere and to cut down on CO² emissions.  Consequently, the Euro-Quebec hydro-hydrogen pilot project forms part of it and is linked with Hamburg in Germany.  Furthermore, the EC foresee possibilities of the Shannon-Estuary being used as a transhipment point for new, clean technology such as I spoke of in relation to hydrogen for the future.  It is down the <Col N="1013" /> line but the Shannon Estuary may have a strategic role to play, dependent on what emerges from the studies being financed by the EC in that regard.</P>

Will that officer be paid specifically on the basis of work undertaken in promoting the Shannon Estuary, or will he receive a fixed retainer fee?  In addition, will he clarify his statement to the IMI Conference exactly a year ago in relation to there being a new dawn for the Shannon Estuary?  Will he agree that, in order to show something tangible, the Louisiana Pacific Timber Company would be an ideal firm to be involved?  Will the Taoiseach consider the County Limerick area on the basis of suitability of location and confirm that, while Limerick does not have a presence or representation at the Cabinet table, that will not detract from its being seriously considered?</P>

      <P>To determine the level of emigration accurately in any period it would be necessary to have comprehensive documentary or other administrative procedures relating to the movement of persons out of the State.  Such procedures would neither be practical nor in keeping with the principle of free movement of persons within the European Communities.  In the absence of administrative procedures the only reliable estimates are those for net migration, i.e. the difference between inward and outward flows, for the period between successive Censuses of Population.</P>
      <P>In the shorter term the only information available is the series of annual net migration and population estimates in respect of mid-April.  Estimates of net migration in the 12 months to mid-April are made in conjunction with population estimates taking account of appropriate data on births and deaths.</P>
      <P>The most recently published figure relates to the 12 months to mid-April 1992 during which it is estimated that inward migration exceeded outward migration by 2,000 persons.  An estimate of net migration during the 12 months to mid-April 1993 will, in accordance with normal practice, become available in the autumn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank supervises the building societies under the Building Societies Act, 1989.  The Central Bank wrote to all the building societies on Thursday, 29 April 1993 requesting that they forward to the bank reports on their compliance with the provisions of the Building Societies Act, 1989, concerning transactions by, and interests of, directors and their disclosure.  They were also asked to have these reports confirmed by their auditors.</P>
      <P>Following receipt of the reports, the bank will decide whether further action is warranted.  The bank is also examining whether the provisions regulating building societies under the 1989 Act could not be improved in the light of recent developments.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, my officials are continuing to monitor the situation with due regard, of course, to the statutory independent role of the bank.  I am awaiting the results of the bank's investigation.</P>
      <P>If, in the light of these results further action is necessary in this regard, the Government will consider the necessary changes.  Legislation in relation to building societies is a matter for the Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>Finally, let me say that the Central Bank has stressed that it has no concerns about the financial stability or soundness of any of the societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister share the sense of outrage felt by most members of the general public in relation to executives of building societies giving themselves payments of £300,000 in the form of a golden handcuff even though their <Col N="1020" /> renewable contracts have many years to run?  One executive gave himself over £400,000 to refurbish and improve his house.  Would the Minister agree that this was not what building societies were set up for?  Will he introduce measures to ensure that perks paid to management are itemised on an annual basis for shareholders and that there is a fair election system so that an outsider will have a real chance of success at the AGM?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that it is not in the best interests of the building societies or those who invest in them if something is not transparent to shareholders or policy holders.  As I have publicly stated, I join with those who have expressed reservations about some of the activities which have come to light in recent times.  I should mention that the Central Bank is examining the question of whether the provisions of the 1989 Act which regulate building societies should be improved in the light of recent developments.  It would seem that all the issues raised so far are covered by the 1989 Act, perhaps with one exception about which there might be some minor doubt.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank's questioning of some of the building societies moving towards PLC status was of assistance in bringing some matters to light.  The Central Bank has written to all the building societies asking them to comply fully with all sections of the 1989 legislation and to have this confirmed by their auditors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister indicate the one minor exception to which he has referred in regard to the 1989 Act? Does he believe that the payment of £300,000 in a golden handcuff ought to be legal in a mutual society?  Is he prepared to condone a situation where the constituents of every Member of this House are sometimes obliged to sell furnishing in order to prevent themselves being evicted, while somebody at the top of a building society can help himself to hundreds of thousands of pounds of a building society's money to furnish his house?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly, no one could consider it fair or reasonable that money should be expended in that way.  In due course, following the examinations, the contents of the agreements will be confirmed. The term &ldquo;golden handcuff&rdquo; is not mentioned in the 1989 Act, this practice has only developed since then.  The Central Bank and the Attorney General believe that under the 1989 Act the Central Bank has the power to question these arrangements.  The 1989 Act is broad and offers a range of areas of fraud but whether individual financial transactions that continue to be invented are covered is a matter that I will have clarified.  The legal advice to date suggests that they are covered but this is not specifically mentioned in the 1989 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says the 1989 Act is satisfactory.  Does that Act debar individual executives from receiving commissions which are due to the society?  Is he aware that under the provisions of this Act the Central Bank is forbidden to make statements in relation to particular incidents?  The Central Bank is renowned for dealing with liquidity and solvency but it does not have a press officer.  Its public relations is appalling. Does he agree that the law in relation to the Central Bank and to the payment of commissions needs to be changed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I said previously during the debate on the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Bill that it was unfortunate that we had the opportunity only to debate the Central Bank report. The Central Bank has not had a high profile but in fairness that does not mean that the prudential controls, regulations and transparency of financial institutions should not be examined.  We need to find a mechanism whereby the Central Bank can highlight the excellent work it does. Having said that, there were good reasons for legislation being drafted in that way, both here and in other countries. The intention is to keep the Central Bank separate from the political system. In France they are moving to bring their legislation into line with our 1989 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1022" /> I agree with the Deputy that the good work of the Central Bank should be aired in this House.  Often I as Minister for Finance would know all that it is doing.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister intend to amend the legislation to prevent practises of the kind we have seen in at least one building society in obstructing the election to the board of a representative of the ordinary members of the society?  Does he acknowledge that the general public expect him to take legislative measures to prevent the kind of practices we have seen in some building societies, where a self-perpetuating oligarchy helped themselves in secret to enormous remuneration?  Does he con done the practice whereby huge emoluments to directors are agreed in secret? Is there any reason that the emoluments paid to directors of mutual building societies ought not be made public and easily accessible?</P>

      <P>I will deal with the Deputy's last question first.  I should prefer the affairs of all financial institutions to be transparent and accessible to the public.  An important provision of the 1989 Act is that the Central Bank asks directors of institutions and companies to state precisely what and how they are paid and if such payments are in compliance with the 1989 Act.  Let me assure Deputies that if the building societies, for which the Minister for the Environment has responsibility, and the Central Bank decide that amendments to the legislation are required, they will be brought forward speedily.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the first quarter Exchequer returns indicated that 1993 expenditure was evolving in line with expectations at budget time.  I have no reason to expect that this trend will not be maintained throughout the year.  The improved economic outlook underpinned by the budget will clearly help the Government to meet its budgetary targets.  However, I am aware of some instances where supplementaries involving relatively minor sums will be required for technical reasons.  For example, in the Revised Estimates Volume, Vote 4 &mdash; Office of the Tánaiste &mdash; a token provision has been included in the grant-in-aid subhead for the National Economic and Social Forum and this will need to be increased later.  Because it is a grant-in-aid subhead, it can only be increased by way of a Supplementary Estimate; savings arising elsewhere on the Vote cannot be vired into that subhead.</P>
      <P>Decisions about Supplementary Estimates, other than technical ones, can only be taken when it is clear that additional expenditure is unavoidable and that no savings are available elsewhere in the relevant Vote.  There will inevitably be savings elsewhere on some of these Votes or in other Votes which will help to offset any excesses.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive schedule for dealing with Estimates has now been agreed by the new Dáil committees and details of any supplementary estimates required will be finalised as the Estimates come up for consideration in those committees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As the year progresses savings can be made under some headings but others will require Supplementary Estimates.  Naturally it is the intention of the Department of Finance to keep Supplementary Estimates to an absolute minimum.  To date we know of two or three areas that will require a Supplementary Estimate but none of the increases is too large.  In relation to Aer Lingus or other State agency, any large equity injection will have to be viewed against the expenditure position at that time.  This might require a tightening of the Estimates in other areas and this is something we have done for the past three or four years.  It is not clear at this stage if any such injection of equity is needed during 1993, although it is clear that it will be required over the next 12 months or so.  The matter will be reviewed again in every six-month period.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether the continued existence of a 1 per cent levy on income constitutes a real obstacle to the continuation of the consensus approach with the social partners in general, and the trade union movement in particular, in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> like its predecessor, the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> has proved the merits of the <Col N="1025" /> consensus approach to managing our national affairs in terms of both jobs and living standards.</P>
      <P>The introduction of an income levy on a temporary basis was necessary given the adverse consequences for the public finances of the recent prolonged slowdown in the international economy and the Government's concern to fulfil as far as possible the economic and social provisions and objectives of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  In these circumstances, I hope that the levy will not prove an obstacle to the continuation of the consensus approach.  I also hope that those in employment will see the levy as making a contribution towards catering for the exceptional unemployment and other social costs resulting from the slowdown in both the international and domestic economies. Furthermore, we should not lose sight of the fact that taxpayers have been asked to accept this limited sacrifice against the background of substantial gains in real take-home income and living standards under both the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  It is also the case that any realistic alternative to the introduction of the temporary levy would similarly have been subjected to such criticism which fails to take account of the overall budgetary context.</P>
      <P>The consensus achieved first under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and continued in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> has resulted in considerable benefits, not only for the economy but also for every man, woman and child in the country.  I believe that the whole country would lose a great deal if the consensus approach were discarded. We are all challenged, those in Opposition as well as the Government, and the social partners, to overcome obstacles to consensus and the progress which it brings &mdash; especially those thrown up by force of economic developments such as that to which the question refers. I am confident that we can all deal with this challenge as successfully as we have done with others over the past seven years.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that the 1 per cent income levy is a very crude tax, as it is an imposition on incomes as low as £173 per week?  Senior trade unionists have said explicitly to the Government that if it is not withdrawn immediately it constitutes an obstacle not only to the renewal of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> but to sitting down to contemplate it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the remarks made by senior trade union leaders. Naturally I hope that when the facts and circumstances are examined, following a review of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the various statistics and schedules produced by the Central Review Committee, the trade unions will see the benefits involved. I will give one example which I used previously to highlight this matter; a worker who is single and earning an average industrial wage will have experienced a real increase in net take home pay of more than 11 per cent between 1987 and 1993 in contrast with a decrease of 7 per cent in the period from 1980 to 1987. Considering the extremely tight budgetary position this year, which was acknowledged by all commentators, and the increase in the numbers on the live register during the period late 1991 to early 1993 of more than 30,000, with additional expenditure of £130 million &mdash; the Deputy is correct in that levies are blunt instruments &mdash; it was not unreasonable to claw back, hopefully on a temporary basis, a small proportion of that money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that it is as a result of tax reform that the figures on disposable income are so impressive?  The reason trade unions are signalling concern at this stage is that not only is the 1 per cent levy a crude instrument, as the Minister acknowledged, but it fundamentally reverses the thrust of policy to date.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to continue the consensus-based approach to managing our economic and social affairs which has served the country so well in recent years.  We will endeavour to maintain the present consensus as the most appropriate means of attaining the social, economic and fiscal objectives set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>
      <P>Clearly, attainment of a new programme to follow the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> would not be a matter for the Government alone. A renewed commitment to participation by all the social partners would also be eesential as would achievement of the necessary consensus on a wide range of policies, including pay policy, for the years ahead.  I would expect that such issues will be addressed by all concerned later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It goes without saying that any new programme to which the Government might subscribe would have to entail a widespread commitment to a continuation of all the measures necessary to maintain economic stability and improve job prospects including, in particular, improved international competitiveness <Col N="1028" /> and continued discipline in our management of our public finances to achieve the necessary reduction in the national debt-GNP ratio and conformity with the Maastricht guidelines.  Continued attention to such fundamental issues will be vital if we are to secure a high level of export-led economic growth consistent with maintenance of low single figure inflation so as to create the greatest possible impact on unemployment.</P>
    <P>In relation to the second part of the question, I am sure the Deputy will agree that it would be wholly inappropriate for me to speculate at this juncture on the pay policy which might form part of any such agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from what the Minister said that the Government will actively seek a renewwal of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> Will the Minister give the timeframe for a renewed programme; will it span two years, three years or four years?  Is the Minister aware that, in terms of exposed competitiveness, some people would prefer a pay deal spanning a longer period than a year to ensure competitiveness?  Will the Minister ensure that public sector pay increases, which have amounted to about 8 per cent per annum in the past two years, will not be the price of such an agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>While it is still early days the desire of Government would be to enter into a new agreement.  Deputies will recall that in negotiating the last agreement a ten year strategy was embarked on so as to work with the social partners to implement as many of the plans, proposals and policies over a longer period than the three years.  Such a timescale is necessary to ensure that long term plans are workable and I hope we will continue on that basis.  Pay is just part of what is involved and, naturally, it is a costly element both for the private and public sectors.  In our negotiations with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, particularly the public services committee of that group, I hope we can work out a new pay determination scheme.  It <Col N="1029" /> is unsatisfactory that a pay increase of about 5 per cent is already built into the system for 1994.  Such a system has been followed for ten to 15 years and if we were to move away from that system we would have to change the policies followed for many years.  I hope that discussions in this regard will be concluded prior to discussions on the next programme.</P>
      <P>The private sector was reluctant to take part in negotiations for the programme covering the period 1987 to 1990.  At that stage the arrangement provided for a 2.5 per cent increase, non-index related.  That was the kind of agreement that no Government in the western world would favour and we had to move away from that arrangement for the period 1990 to 1993. We must now negotiate a satisfactory agreement in relation to pay rates, taking into account competitiveness and inflation as well as what the public purse can afford. We are preparing submissions and data on what we believe the country can afford in the next three years.</P>

In relation to the non-pay aspects, will the tax element be included and what will be the relationship between the CRC and the new forum?  In other words, will the non-pay elements be discussed by everybody, including political parties, or will the non-pay areas be confined to the social partners in the CRC?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 46 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has overall responsibility for the holding of the national lottery.  However, as the National Lottery Act, 1986, specifies, it is for the Government to decide how moneys are to be allocated.  Once the Government has decided on the allocation of funds on a departmental and programme basis it is then a matter of the spending Minister concerned to decide on the criteria for the disbursement of those funds.  In regard to the distribution of funds to particular groups as requested by Deputy Harney, that matter should be addressed to the Ministers concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has had direct responsibility for the allocation of national lottery funds to Gaeleagras na Seirbhís Phoiblí.  The aim of Gaeleagras is to provide Irish language training for civil servants to enable them to deal with the public through the medium of Irish. Gaeleagras caters for the disabled and <Col N="1031" /> does not practice discrimination against women, travellers or the disabled.</P>
    <P>On the question of ensuring that national lottery, and indeed public funds generally, are not used to support groups or organisations which practice unfair discrimination it is, in the first instance, a matter for each Minister to decide on criteria for the disbursal of their Department's funds.  I would share the Deputies' concern that funds be granted to organisations which do not practice discrimination. It is fair to say that the Government is aware of the importance of combating discrimination, as can be seen by the appointment of a full Cabinet Minister with specific responsibilities in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it that the Department of Finance is not accountable to this House for the general allocation of lottery funds, and that we have to put down individual questions to Ministers to find out what is happening? Will the Minister of State confirm whether or not, with regard to helping out the disabled, she is acquainted with the fact that the activities of the national lottery are making it very difficult to raise money for the disabled?  The voluntary fund raisers for disabled groups are finding it very difficult to raise charitable donations because of the dominant position of the national lottery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Organisations representing disabled people have expressed concern in this area.  However, a very sizeable proportion of lottery funds is allocated to the health area and benefit organisations such as those referred to by the Deputy.  The Department of Finance and the Government, as part of the Estimates, decide on the departmental breakdown of lottery funds.  The spending of those funds in Government Departments is a matter for individual Ministers.  If the Deputy has questions, for instance, in relation to youth and sport lottery spending, it would be appropriate to table those to the Minister for Education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The three questions tabled were addressed to non-discrimination criteria in respect of the allocation of lottery funds.  Presumably there is some simple policy or document allowing or disallowing contributions to voluntary organisations which practise discrimination of the kinds described in the question.  Is the Minister saying that these are not known to the Department and that they do not exist as far as the Department is concerned, or are we to take it that the Minister is leaving it to us to ferret out this information by a series of questions to every Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would reassure the Deputy that money has not gone to golf clubs since 1990.  These organisations certainly practised discrimination against women.  In relation to the general allocation, the role of the Department of Finance is to allocate the funds to individual sectors.  The Government as a whole has a policy in relation to non-discrimination and has appointed Deputy Mervyn Taylor as Minister for Equality and Law Reform to deal with the issue. The Minister is very active in pursuing the issues within his responsibility.  The Department of Finance allocates a block of funding to individual departments.  I am sure the Deputy opposite would agree with the principle of subsidiarity and that it is a matter for individual Ministers to decide how their funds are allocated.</P>

It is a fairly simple question which deserves a simple answer.</P>

    <P>*As some taxpayers have a liability to residential property tax based upon more than one property, precise figures are not available on the number of properties to which the tax applies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that borrowings are not allowable and that there can be anomalies in this tax?  If somebody had a house worth £90,000 and had borrowed £90,000, he would have to pay the full tax.  Has the Minister given any consideration to allowing any relief up to a ceiling of £20,000 or £30,000 so that hardship will not be caused to people who are honest enough to come forward and explain their position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The tax is small and charged on the market value of the residential property at the rate of 1.5 per cent on the excess of the market value over the exemption limit.  The exemption limit for this year is £91,000.  The liability to the tax arises only where the household income exceeds £28,100.  In addition, two types of relief are provided.  The first applies where the household income exceeds the income exemption limit by £5,000 and the second reduces the tax payable by 10 per cent in respect of each dependent child.  These reliefs diminish the yield on the tax by about 20 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>On borrowings, if the Deputy knows of an anomaly or of a hardship case I will certainly look at such case.  The change was made to try to bring into the tax net people who were clearly defaulting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the value of the threshold has not significantly varied over the ten years in which it has been in operation and that <Col N="1035" /> therefore in 1992 the number of persons paying the tax has effectively doubled? What is the Minister's advice concerning the number of people who fall within this category and what is the problem about getting them into the category?  Would the Minister agree that this tax is being very selectively applied?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in number is probably a reflection of how few were in the category in the first place.  There is no clear estimate but 12,500 is only a small fraction of the number of houses over the limit in the State.  The difficulty is in relation to compliance and that is the reason I made some changes in regard to that in the budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it true that the Government is considering extending the scope of the residential property tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no truth in that. In relation to residential property tax the Government seeks to ensure that people who should pay this tax are in fact paying it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister expand on his reply to Deputy Yates in regard to property owners whose substantial mortgages on their homes exceed the limits on the residential property tax and result in their being liable for the double payment? From what the Minister said I gather it is not his intention that such people should be required to pay residential property tax where they are trying to meet heavy mortgage repayments on the same dwelling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In the calculation of this tax of £7 million &mdash; which is a small amount &mdash; if there is a case of hardship we will, as we have done about family size, income limits and marginal relief, be fair with those who have the decency to come forward.  As the Deputy will be aware one could plaster walls with the number of requests from property companies and others to give a valuation for the property.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister appeared to indicate that there was some appeals system but I did not realise there was such a system until the Minister referred to hardship cases.  How does a Deputy bring a hardship case to the attention of the authorities?  Is there an appeals system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understood it, Deputy Yates referred to the case of a borrower who faced major difficulties.  If such a case came to my attention I would certainly examine it.  The whole principle of this tax is to get people to comply.  I am not opposed to looking at hardship cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year and this year we introduced some amendments in regard to property tax and its collection. As the Deputy will be aware this tax has been in operation for the past ten years and, like me, I am sure he made representations many times about it.  The Revenue Commissioners are rather generous with people who come forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister's concession that only a small fraction of the homes to which the tax is applicable are in the net, and in view of the phrase he used that some people have the decency to come forward and acknowledge their liability for tax, would he agree it is time this tax was replaced by one which is fair to all and applies to everyone uniformly rather than rely on people's circumstances and their sense of honesty and the honesty of their advisers to determine the amount of tax they pay into the Exchequer?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the residential property tax the system has continually improved since 1982.  The changes in this year's budget and in the Finance Bill regarding people who are selling their homes, and the fact that the liability would carry on, will help to get more people into the system.  The number of people in the net has increased from 6,000 to more than double that figure in the past ten years.  The compliance regulations introduced this year will result in a substantial increase.</P>

      <P>There was no question of anyone being a Mr. Fixit.  There were <Col N="1039" /> extensive changes in Departments and in their structures.  The Department of Finance had responsibility for drafting the new orders.  Naturally, matters in relation to staff movement and premises had to be dealt with by the Department of Finance.  So far as I know a question in regard to the functions of each Minister was answered recently.  I had an input into that reply but I am not sure whether it included the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor.  As the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, said earlier, Minister Taylor is doing an excellent job on behalf of the Government in the area of equality.  If the Deputy wishes to table a question to him I am sure he would be only too glad to spell out the excellent work he is doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 33 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A key objective of the National <Col N="1041" /> Treasury Management Agency is to keep debt service costs to the lowest possible level consistent with the efficient and prudent management of the national debt.  Pursuant to this objective the agency has been set debt service savings targets in each year of its operation to date.  These targets were achieved in 1991 and 1992.  In 1993 the agency has been set a savings target of £100 million and I am assured by the agency that present indicators are that this target will be fully realised.</P>
    <P>The agency also inform me that it is not possible to specify in advance the precise mechanisms through which the savings of £100 million will be achieved as these will vary with market conditions throughout the year.  As Deputies will appreciate the details of the agency's plans for its activities in particular markets must be confidential and of their very nature cannot be made known in advance.  However, the experience since the establishment of the agency shows that it has the expertise in managing a debt portfolio of the size and complexity of the national debt to take advantage of opportunities to achieve savings which may emerge in any of the international markets while at the same time avoiding unacceptable levels of risk.  The broad range of currencies and instruments in which the agency borrows, its presence in all the major capital markets as well as its active use of modern debt management techniques ensures that opportunities to achieve savings have been successfully exploited in the past and will continue to be so exploited in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the dust has settled in relation to the currency crisis, exactly how much did it cost the National Treasury Management Agency to follow the Minister's instructions and borrow in hard foreign currencies from September 1 to January 1?  Will he agree that it was of the order of £180 million?  Second, is the Taoiseach aware that there is widespread criticism of the National Treasury Management Agency because of the low level of our foreign debt denominated in sterling and because it has put forward <Col N="1042" /> very lame excuses, such as the security problems in London, for not raising the money in London?  London is one of the big capital markets of the world dealing in every sort of bond and currency.  The taxpayer could have been saved a fortune in terms of debt servicing costs, given what happened in relation to currency and our level of trade, if more of our debt was denominated in sterling.</P>

      <P>What level of the national debt is denominated in sterling?  I think we will find it is extraordinarily low.  Let the Minister not labour any longer the point about economic miracles, inflows of money and lowering of interest rates. These are due exclusively to the strength of sterling, our relationship with sterling and the international trend led by the Bundesbank in reducing rates.  Nobody really believes the improvement was a result of the Minister's budget or his macro economic policies, which have <Col N="1043" /> increased borrowing by £400 million.

      <P>If Deputy Yates examined the facts he will see that it was not because countries devalued relative to the strength or weakness of another currency but belief in the market, the exchange rate and economic and fiscal factors within a country that decide whether markets invest.  That is true, not only of this country but of any country. What has happened is not because of the strength of sterling.  The money and resources that come back into the Irish market are not sterling related or from the UK markets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton's question seeks to establish the basis for the projection of the saving of £100 million by the National Treasury Management Agency.  Does the Minister not agree that of all the games we play in this House with official figures this is the most absurd?  How can one possibly measure what the debt service savings target will be in an agency charged with handling the State's portfolio over the period of a year?  If it can be measured and one plans for savings of £100 million, why not say what the target should be, minus £100 million?</P>
      <P>What is the point of this exercise?  This is the particular jar of honey into which we were to dip before the fall of the last Government to fund the county enterprise boards.  There was £60 million at that stage which was supposed to be left in the kitty.  That was soon swept away in the events to which Deputy Yates referred.  Can the Minister explain it to the House?  I certainly think it is absurd.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a perfect science because so many things happened in 1992, but the procedure is that the National Treasury Management Agency works against the benchmark of the JPR Morgan Index, a formula by which, when savings are achieved, the effect of the agency's activities can be proved or disproved <Col N="1044" /> as opposed to the effect of what happens in the market.  It may not be perfect but it is used by many countries. The system used in the National Treasury Management Agency is attracting attention from other countries and at least three or four are now examining precisely how we are doing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What basis is used to prepare the figures for debt service costs in the central fund accounts?  Is this saving of £100 million a saving by the National Treasury Management Agency as against the provision in the central fund accounts?  If a saving of that kind can be made, does it not suggest the original provision in the central fund accounts is inaccurately inflated?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If the figure for the year is calculated at, say £2.4 million, the agency must put forward its plans and mechanisms for making a saving on that figure, for example, if the agency suggests that £100 million can be saved, the J. P. Morgan benchmark is used to calculate how much of that saving would have happened anyway, had the agency not used any of its expertise.  That has been done for the past two years and it is an internationally recognised standard.  Under the J. P. Morgan index the saving would not be £100 million.  It might be £70 million or £75 million and it would be assumed that the £25 million would probably happen anyway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 14 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>Deputies will already be aware of my position on certain administrative expenditures of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development from my reply to a question from Deputy Bruton last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the EBRD that, from April 1991 to the end of 1992, a total of £200 million sterling was spent on the bank itself; this includes staff costs, overheads, fitting out the headquarters and <Col N="1046" /> travel.  I would mention that the UK Government has given the bank a subsidy of £40 million sterling to be spent on the headquarters.</P>
    <P>I have attended all the annual meetings of the governors.  The first was in Budapest in April 1992 and the second in London in April 1993.  The inaugural meeting of the governors was attended by my predecessor in London in 1991.</P>
    <P>The bank's authorised capital to ECU 10 billion of which Ireland accounts for 0.3 per cent.  Our total liability to the bank is therefore ECU 30 million &mdash; or approximately 23 million Irish pounds. Only 30 per cent of the authorised capital needs to be paid in and this over a period of five years from 1991.  Ireland is therefore required to pay in some ECU 9 million, or ECU 1.8 million a year &mdash; 1.4 million Irish pounds.  To date we have contributed ECU 3.6 million &mdash; or about 2.8 million Irish pounds.  Some of this is in promissory notes which have yet to be encashed by the bank according to a pre-agreed schedule.</P>
    <P>I am asked to consider withholding any further subscription to the bank. Ireland's next capital contribution is due later this month.  I do not propose to withhold this as I do not believe that this would be in the interest of the bank or the bank's countries of operation for whom the funds are intended.</P>
    <P>The bank has a serious task in hands in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.  It has already made significant progress in committing ECU 2 billion to projects involving total investment of some 8 billion ECU in the area.  Actual disbursements to date have been slow and I would like to see them speeded up.  I am informed that the board of directors is addressing this problem.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware, from an earlier reply to the House, that the audit committee of the board of directors is conducting a comprehensive inquiry into the administrative expenditures of the bank. I expect to be informed of the outcome of this inquiry and I will fully support any appropriate action which may be called for as a result.</P>

      <P>It would appear that there is a role for the NTMA to examine the EBRD.  How have the Minister and his fellow governors allowed a situation to materialise whereby the people responsible for this bank, which is charged with reconstruction in Eastern Europe, spent £200 million in equipping palatial offices for themselves, which is twice as much as that spent on the purpose for which the bank was established? A sum of £600,000 was spent on hiring planes and £52,000 on a birthday party for the staff.</P>

      <P>Detailed statements were given at recent meetings by the chairman of the governors, Mr. Waigel, regarding the attitude of the board of governors to the expenditure entered into by the president of the bank, Jacques Attali.  There was an extraordinary list of abuses of expenditure on some of the items mentioned by Deputy Rabbitte and other items, such as marble, lifts, special aircraft to take people to meetings which were totally unnecessary, and so on.  The president made the decisions and entered into the expenditures involved.  The controls, mechanisms and audits were brought forward by the governors but the president used the £40 million put forward by the United Kingdom Government and contributions from other members for an elaborate office.  While the board of directors was satisfied that the president would enter into certain <Col N="1048" /> expenditures, it did not believe that he would undertake such large expenditure. The bank was set up in 1991.  When the building was under construction a bomb exploded outside it in April last year and practically destroyed the building. Another bomb went off in the same area more recently, but did not have the same effect.</P>

      <P>The chairman, Mr. Waigel, and my colleagues as governors have introduced a series of strict budgetary controls.  The audit committee has commenced investigating the activities the president engaged in.  The existing three board committees will play a stronger role in the preparation and monitoring of the budget and consideration is being given to establishing a separate budget committee.  More structured and detailed budget documentation is to be supplied to the board in the future.  The senior management post of director of corporate planning and budgeting is to be filled on a full-time basis, with a clear and exclusive line of responsibility.  Up to now the president had responsibilities to keep down overheads. He was given a broad range of responsibilities and was able to deal with matters without checking with the committees. The board's audit committee, with external support if necessary, is to conduct a detailed and comprehensive inquiry into the procedures followed and the costs incurred in fitting out the bank's headquarters.  As soon as the expenditures and the procedures followed by President Attali came to light, a full investigation took place.</P>

Why is Jacques Attali still running this bank after what has happened? Surely the Minister should insist that Monsieur Attali return to France, where I am sure he will have many opportunities for other employment.  There should be a clear accountability, either by the Ministers or by the management, for what has happened.  An appalling example is being set to the countries of Eastern Europe in the way in which a bank, set up to help them, is being run. This level of extravagance would do credit to the Kremlin at its worst, yet this is an institution set up, supposedly, to reconstruct post-communist Eastern Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the general drift of Deputy Bruton's remarks, I made similar statements which were published widely over two weeks ago.  The decision of the board of directors and the 57 member countries, having fully examined the report and the expenditures, was to allow the audit committee to proceed with its investigation.  Monsieur Attali is employed on a contract basis and they have set up new arrangements and are appointing new people, as I have outlined, to deal with various aspects of the bank.  There is no doubt that the expenditure, in my view and that of my colleagues, was an abuse.  The role of the bank is to help countries who are in grave difficulty and all of these matters were investigated.  Governor Waigel, as chairman, has spelt out publicly what has happened and the plans for the future.</P>

Did the Minister, as one of the governors of a bank, insist that management accounts be furnished?

      <P>Is it not the case that this bank was established in London at a time when office property was at rock bottom prices in 1991 and that it would have made far more sense for them to locate the bank headquarters in an existing <Col N="1051" /> office building, of which there were many available in the London docklands, rather than going to the expense of building this monstrous headquarters which sets an example to Eastern Europe of the worst possible kind in terms of the optimum use of resources?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That certainly may have been an easier decision at the time.  It is not what occurred.  In December 1991, when the general budget of the bank's operation was approved for 1992, the board of directors approved a global provision for the new premises.  The fitting out of the new offices was entrusted to the management to be carried out within an overall figure.  As time went on it became clear that that did not happen. The type of refurbishment that was foreseen in December 1991 did not envisage a 200 lbs bomb being placed at the front door which would destroy the building. That changed the budget position and as soon as it became clear what had happened in the reconstruction of the building, the investigations took place.</P>

Is it good enough for the Minister and his fellow governors to tell the respective Governments who established this bank and whose taxpayers are paying for the costs of the reconstruction programme that an investigation has been conducted and the man responsible, while changing into his natty knitted pyjamas on his private flights, is still in office?  Surely any governors worth their salt would have sacked Monsieur Attali at this stage and moved on to the next stage of the bank's business?</P>

Procedures, and an audit structure have been put in place and warnings have been issued to members of management. Chairman Waigel, on behalf of the board of governors, agreed that the procedures would be amended but for the moment Monsieur Attali would be allowed to complete his contract before there would be a review.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say first that I fully understand the very real sense of concern which has prompted Deputies to put down these questions today.  I say this without in any way commenting on the <Col N="1055" /> positions which have been put forward by the parties immediately involved. Through the media, we have heard individual parties on both sides of this matter &mdash; by which I mean the new owners and the long-standing tenants &mdash; say, in effect, that they find themselves caught up in a situation which was not of their choosing.  While I have no special knowledge of the detailed circumstances which applied in individual cases, it seems evident that the individuals concerned on both sides genuinely regret the circumstances which brought these private transactions to the public eye.</P>
      <P>I have been asked to consider the introduction of emergency legislation.  As regards amending legislation, my immediate reaction when information on this matter came to hand was to inquire as to the prospect of tackling the matter by means of a reforming landlord and tenant law.  I will certainly listen to what Deputies have to say on this issue but, on the basis of the advice I have received, I have to say that the prospects of dealing with this matter by this means do not seem to be promising.  I will explain why this is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rights of tenants fall in the first place to be dealt with by reference to the terms of the lease or other tenancy agreement which they hold.  The Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980, gives to residential tenancies of 20 years standing a right of renewal of tenancy for up to 35 years.  The Housing (Private Rented Dwelling) Acts, 1982 and 1983, are also designed to provide a measure of protection for tenants. However, the provisions in those Acts, which are the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment, are confined largely to tenants of dwellings formerly controlled under the rent restrictions Acts.  There are no steps open to me under existing landlord and tenant legislation to intervene in this matter.  While I am, of course, considering whether new legislation is required and will listen carefully to what Deputies may have to say on this matter, I should point out that any amendments of the 1980 Act would <Col N="1056" /> normally apply only to leases made after the coming into effect of the legislation and would not, therefore, affect the rights of parties under existing leases or other tenancy agreements for constitutional reasons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms. F. Fitzgerald Ms. F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms. F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is disgraceful that tenants of long-standing were not given the opportunity to buy their flats and that it is completely unacceptable that Irish Life, at that time partly owned by the State, behaved in this fashion?  I concur with the comments by my colleague about the refusal of the Minister for Finance to take this question or the question I raised some weeks ago on this matter.  Questions arise about social responsibilities and ethical standards which the Minister for Finance should have addressed.  I am somewhat disappointed at the Minister's response.  Does she agree that there is a need for an overall review of the landlord and tenant legislation?  Some tenants who occupied their apartments for 19 years were moved from apartment to apartment in order to deprive them of the rights which the legislation gives them. Does the Minister agree that an examination should be carried out to seek to give these tenants some statutory right at least?</P>

      <P>I am considering, as a matter of urgency, what amending legislation might be possible and what could be done under it. Deputies will appreciate that amending legislation could not apply retrospective as this would create a constitutional difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, on behalf of the State, holds a 15.3 per cent shareholding in Irish Life.  I understand that even when the State owned in excess of 90 per cent of the shares, investment decisions were a matter for the board of the company, in the same way as they are for other State companies.  The annual general meeting of Irish Life is due to be held on 28 May and the Minister for Finance has the power to ask his proxy to raise this issue at this meeting and <Col N="1057" /> demand a report on the matter.  I have an assurance from the Minister for Finance that his proxy, on his and the Government's behalf, will raise the concerns of all Members in relation to this issue.</P>

      <P>I am alarmed that the Minister stated that she has no special knowledge of the detailed circumstances regarding the sale of the Mespil flats.  I am, perhaps, in a unique position in raising this issue in that the longest tenant in Mespil flats is my aunt who has been a tenant in this complex for the past 39 years.  She was changed to a new apartment after 19 years on the basis that the heating system in the complex was being changed.  Will the Minister take steps to give people like my aunt, who is 82 years old, security of tenure and peace during the final years of their lives?  Is the Minister happy that a company in which the State has a 30 per cent shareholding allowed what can be called a sub-committee of the golden circle &mdash; one could also call them the penthouse privileged &mdash; to buy the apartments for approximately half the price people like my aunt paid in rent over the past 39 years?  Did the Government know that Irish Life had proposals of this type; if it did, why did it not take steps to protect the tenants; and if it did not know, why did it not know?</P>

      <P>As I said in reply to Deputy Fitzgerald, the State has no function in relation to investment decisions and it only has a 15.3 per cent shareholding in the company.  The State has no role in relation to investment decisions; those matters are left to the board of the company.  I understand the State had no such role even when it had more than a 90 per cent shareholding in the company.  That is the position in relation to all State companies.</P>
      <P>With regard to the length of the tenancies, I have some information with me. As Deputies will appreciate, I do not have responsibility for Irish Life.</P>

One of those offers was made by New City Estates which I understand was made up of eight of the original people in the consortium.  The offer was £8.15 million but the currency crisis intervened and at the end of the day the 300 apartments were sold to 34 purchasers.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that her figures are highly misleading? She said, for instance, that 117 of the tenancies are between one and three years.  Does she realise that these take into account people who were <Col N="1059" /> shifted because they were approaching the 20 year period and that they fit into a different category?  Will the Minister agree that this 20 year protection is of no use to anyone when Irish Life and other landlords move people out of their homes after 19 years, depriving them of all statutory protection?  Furthermore, will the Minister agree that most of these people do not want a 35 year lease?  All they want is to be left alone paying a reasonable rent for their accommodation; they do not want the kind of protection the law affords them.  Will the Minister also agree that there is no constitutional problem with applying new protections to existing tenancies, since it was done in 1980, under the provisions of the Act to which she referred, when the 30 year limit was brought down to 20 years and applies to existing tenancies?  It was also done in 1977 when the provisions of the Unfair Dismissals Act were applied to existing contracts of employment.  Therefore will she agree that there is no constitutional reason for elderly and vulnerable people living in private rented accommodation, not getting protection and that this discussion, based on vague constitutional warnings from the Minister's Departmental officials, is not acceptable?  Will the Minister agree that it is open to her to introduce legislation to protect people from arbitrary evictions?  I suggest to the Minister that it is not good enough to come into this House with figures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>

      <P>I have no intention of misleading the House.  I am giving the information as it was given to <Col N="1060" /> me; that is the basis on which I gave it to the House.  The Government does not want to see elderly, vulnerable people being &mdash; as Deputy Michel McDowell describes it &mdash; dumped out of their apartments. It wants to give protection; that is why the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act is there.  That is why this Government, in the course of its preparations for a Programme for Government, set out very clearly that it wanted to introduce a charter of tenants' rights. That is why the Minister for the Environment and others are working very diligently to bring forward that charter which, in the light of what happened this week, is needed more urgently than ever. That work is continuing and the charter will be brought forward.  I am also examining urgently what amendments might be possible to the Landlord and Tenants (Amendment) Act, 1980, to provide protection in this case.</P>

      <P>The sale of these flats is a matter not only for the Minister for Finance but for the tenants and indeed is a matter of public concern.  Is the Minister concerned that Irish Life sold these flats at a knock-down price, a price for which one would not buy a dog box in <Col N="1061" /> Ballsbridge, much less an apartment in a desirable location?  In relation to the commitment the Minister has given the House &mdash; that these matters will be pursued at the annual general meeting of Irish Life on 28 May &mdash; will she say whether questions will be put in relation to them?  Have investigations or inquiries been made of Irish Life to date regarding the manner in which they conducted the sale with New City Estates?</P>

Will the Minister, in conjunction with her other colleagues in Government &mdash; within the context of the annual general meeting to which she referred &mdash; take steps to ascertain whether Irish Life is currently behaving in the same way towards any other tenants in investment properties owned by it?  Will the Minister make it known to Irish Life that it is not acceptable <Col N="1062" /> that elderly people, who do not know their legal rights, be deliberately disadvantaged in this manner?</P>
      <P>With regard to the constitutional issue, as the Attorney General has an interest in the matter, will the Minister indicate whether she sought any advice from him as to the constitutionality of retrospective legislation, or whether she may need to seek the advice of a different law officer in the unfortunate circumstances of this case?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government does not accept that elderly people should feel threatened or disadvantaged by any company, public or private.  This applies particularly to Irish Life because the Government owned in excess of 90 per cent of the company and still retains a 15.3 per cent shareholding therein.  We do not accept that the constant moving around of elderly tenants is a good practice. The concern expressed by Deputies on the opposite side of the House has already been expressed by the people on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>In relation to the position of the Attorney General, it is important &mdash; because of the innuendo by Deputy Shatter and another Member &mdash; that I should clarify his position.  He purchased two apartments, both of which had sitting tenants, who still remain in them.  He made no contact with them either to evict them or to raise their rents.  That will remain the position.</P>

Everything that can be done under the 1980 Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act will be done.  The Deputy can also rest assured that if action needs to be taken under the legislation for which the Minister for the Environment is responsible it will be taken.  As I said, in advance of the formation of this Government and its Programme for Government it was Government policy to have a tenants' charter which the Minister and a number of others are working on as a matter of urgency.</P>

At least two tenants have been lucky in that generous purchasers have made a humane offer to them.  Nevertheless, will the Minister agree that tenants may lose their homes because they are unable to meet the massive rent increase and that while Irish Life did not act illegally it acted immorally?</P>

There is nothing wrong with the hearing of the Minister for Finance and he heard what Deputy McDowell said.  I have dealt with that matter already.

The Minister for Finance has nothing to hide and we want a full explanation.  Members on this side of the House are just as concerned as Members of the Opposition about this matter and we want it clarified.  As I said, I am examining, as a matter of urgency, the question of whether amending legislation is necessary in regard to the Landlord <Col N="1067" /> and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980, and Deputy McDowell can be assured that all necessary steps will be taken.</P>

      <P>Though the Department of the Marine and the Department of Defence have the same Minister and the same Opposition spokespersons each is the subject of a separate committee. This causes a problem in that the Opposition spokesperson has to be appointed to both committees.  Given that attendance at the Select Committee on Legislation and Security and the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy will place heavy demands on time, that seems to be a poor arrangement. Would it be possible that both the Departments of Defence and of the Marine be dealt with by either of the committees, and not by both?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a problem in that the spokesperson may not be informed when matters relating to the Marine will be dealt with.  For that reason will the Minister of State agree that the Department of the Marine be within the remit of the Committee on Legislation and Security until such time as we see how the system works?  In effect the two committees could be sitting at the same time and it would be impossible to cover both. There could also be different sub-committees. While attending one committee, the Minister for Defence could be required to deal with marine matters at the other committee.  Indeed the Minister for fish and ships, agrees entirely with my sentiments on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason the Department of the Marine comes under the Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy is that the Government regarded it as an integral part of its enterprise and economic strategy.  It is not appropriate to have it under the Committee on Legislation and Security, as Deputy Bruton suggests.  Having discussed this matter a number of times, is Deputy Bruton prepared to let matters stand and see how they work out?  Once again I am giving an undertaking that if it is not working out I will, with the agreement of the Whips, change it.  I will undertake also to communicate with the clerks of the committees to ensure that both committees will not meet at the same time and that Deputy Barrett will be informed when marine matters come up at the committee.</P>

There are only seven days in the week and I like to take Sunday off, so if one is engaged in two committees one would be involved all week. Although equality spreads over the work of a number of committees, for obvious reasons the Department for Equality and Law Reform will come under one committee.  The same applies to the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  Only one other <Col N="1188" /> Minister covers two areas, that is the Minister for the Marine and for Defence, and that poor man as well, like me, is under severe pressure.  I am making this appeal on behalf of my constituency colleague as well as on my own behalf because we cannot be in two places at the one time.  Instead of this long debate, there should be a trial period whereby Marine and Defence matters would be dealt with by the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the Stock Exchange, which is now investigating the Greencore shares controversy, has no power under law to compel the giving of evidence to it by third parties outside the exchange and that this weakness undermines, in some respect at least, its investigation?  Is the Taoiseach aware that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, promised ten months ago to introduce legislation last autumn to grant such powers for investigations by the Stock Exchange? Why has this legislation been delayed and why did the Minister fail to introduce it before proceeding to sell, through the Stock Exchange, shares that belonged to the taxpayer without the Stock Exchange being properly regulated?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Finance Bill underpins the Government's priority objective &mdash; to maximise, on a sustainable basis, the job-potential of our economy &mdash; in two respects: in confirming the revenue dimension of the strategy of fiscal responsibility that was at the heart of the budget I introduced on 24 February last; and in providing for a number of important new initiatives aimed at encouraging, on a focused and target basis, investment in Irish business and industry.</P>
      <P>My primary and overriding purpose in the budget was to secure financial stability in difficult circumstances, thereby to clearly signal the Government's commitment to sound economic and budgetary management.  This was of particular importance in the aftermath of the period of unprecedented turbulence in financial markets set in train by sterling's steep decline last September.</P>
      <P>Overall financial stability is an essential condition for business development, for sound economic growth, and for job-creation. When all is said and done, the responsible fiscal stance adopted in the budget is of far more value to employment prospects than any specific measure that might have been in the budget or in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was a budget that confirmed and consolidated the progress made in the <Col N="1200" /> public finances of this country in recent years, and by so doing, contributed in no small way to the major improvement in interest rates and the financial markets in recent weeks; provided for a major boost in investment in the economic infrastructure of this country, preparing the ground for accelerating growth in the future while generating economic activity directly in the short term, and can combine with moderation in incomes to enable this country to continue to surpass the employment performance of our EC partners.</P>
    <P>The budgetary strategy went far beyond simply preserving the economic fundamentals necessary for growth in output and employment, vital though these are.  Apart from the major investment boost to which I have referred, it had at the top of the agenda the fostering of private enterprise and initiative, and the improvement of the availability of equity finance to Irish business, in order that job-creation would not be inhibited by lack of funds.</P>
    <P>Certain increases in taxation were proposed in my budget, both in the interest of responsible overall balance and to make possible other desirable reliefs.  It is understandable that the increases should evoke protest from those affected. However, I must challenge those critics who argue that I should now reverse those measures <i>en bloc</i> to spell out unequivocally what they would have me do instead.  The simple fact is that this means one of three things:</P>
    <P>Throw budgetary discipline to the winds, and thus put at risk the welcome downward trend of interest rates; cut out, or curtail public expenditure programmes to match, or raise the revenues lost in other ways, that is, to increase taxation under different heads or on different activities.</P>
    <P>So far I have seen many who are happy to jump on others' bandwagons of protest against the temporary income levy or the increase in certain VAT rates.  At the same time, I detect little willingness on their part to hitch their wagons to real alternatives to such measures, whether <Col N="1201" /> on the taxation or expenditure sides of the budget.  Is there not an onus on those who criticise to set out clearly where and how they would have things done differently and to recognise that these too would have implications which might not be well received?</P>
    <P>It is all too easy to pick selectively on limited elements of any budget, and to fault them.  It is a different matter entirely to put together and develop a balanced overall budget, and that is what, I remain satisfied, I put before this House on 24 February.</P>
    <P>I must reject emphatically the suggestion that this year's budget and Finance Bill represented a set-back for tax reform, and the view that the measures adopted are in conflict with the recommendations of the Culliton report. Those who would have us believe that tax reform means lower taxation all round are not being honest; lower taxation has, at the end of the day, to be earned by controlling public expenditure and, most of all, by relieving the pressure from debt service costs.  Real reform involves reshaping the system so that the necessary revenues are obtained in a way that is more in tune with our economic and employment needs.  This is the course that has been followed over the past five or six years, in particular in the 1992 budget and Finance Bill, and which has brought about a much better tax structure all round.  Despite the difficult circumstances of the 1993 budget, for reasons that largely lay outside this economy, I was able to consolidate that progress. Indeed, it was only through broadening the tax base, in such respects as the introduction of probate tax, taxation of certain welfare benefits and extending the coverage of the VAT standard rate, that it was possible to afford the general income tax improvements in the budget.</P>
    <P>I find it hard to take seriously those who claim to favour more radical tax reform, but never face up to the responsibility that implies: to spell out where the revenues to fund it should come from. Were I to proceed with the &ldquo;soft option&rdquo; version of tax reform I would rightly be <Col N="1202" /> accused of acting irresponsibly; indeed, I would be following a course that was ultimately unsustainable, as shown by previous efforts at relieving specific areas of taxation without making good the losses otherwise.  I will entertain criticism of our taxation strategy only from those who are willing to be specific as to how they would finance the type of general income tax improvements they profess to seek &mdash; to tell us all what reliefs they would abolish or curtail and what concessionary tax rates they would be willing to see raised.  I will not stand for the kind of &ldquo;double-think&rdquo; to which my efforts at broadening the income and corporation tax bases in 1992 were subjected &mdash; whereby the would-be tax reformers were quite content to criticise my plans for not being ambitious enough and, at the same time, to argue that those reliefs that were curtailed should not have been interfered with.  The failure of many erstwhile advocates of tax reform to support what was being done by the Government on that occasion was a chastening experience but one which will not deter me from pressing ahead with reform as circumstances allow.</P>
    <P>I must also reject emphatically that the new incentive measures in this year's Bill represent a &ldquo;u-turn&rdquo;<i>vis-á-vis</i> last year's approach.  Those critics need to appreciate that there is a basic difference between providing the type of limited and well-focused incentives that I have introduced on this occasion and the withdrawal of measures which, whatever good intentions lay behind them on their introduction, had been taken for a ride by the &ldquo;tax-planners&rdquo; to such an extent that they served little purpose other than to allow the well-advised few to have taxefficient remuneration at the expense of the many.  I would like to issue a warning to those who might be inclined to see these new incentives principally as such an opportunity.  I will keep the operation of these new measures under very close scrutiny and if it emerges that they are being subverted from their central purpose, I will not hesitate to take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that the focus on the key objective &mdash; to stimulate <Col N="1203" /> bona fide enterprise and promote job creation &mdash; is preserved.</P>
    <P>One of the Government's concerns is to increase the flow of Irish households' savings into the provision of equity capital for job-creating investment.  While the volume of available savings is ample, a number of factors, largely beyond the scope of policy to affect, have combined to reinforce the natural disposition of savers, and the institutions to which they entrust their savings, to favour safer media over those which assist more directly the creation of sustainable jobs. At the same time, there has been a major improvement in the climate for equity investment over recent months, given the dramatic fall in interest rates since the budget, the sharp recovery in Irish share prices since last autumn, and the general improvement in confidence in the economy. Notwithstanding these welcome trends, which taken together mean that the competitive position of equity investment in the savings market is now greatly enhanced, the Government has introduced a number of specific measures in the taxation area this year to assist the capitalisation of businesses and the funding of new business start-ups.  The availability to Irish industry of adequate equity finance, especially for start-up and development situations, has become of increasing concern over the last few years and this is a particular focus in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Taxation is, of course, only one aspect of Government policy in this area.  Other initiatives to aid and encourage the start-up and growth of indigenous industry are being developed by other Ministers. Indeed, taxation in general is a very blunt instrument, and the Culliton report came down very strongly against large scale tax reliefs and exemptions.  It is with this in mind that I have adopted a targeted and focused approach to each part of the package.  Each proposal is targeted on particular classes of investor and a particular type of investment, such that the overall package is designed to meet the various different needs of the economy.</P>
    <P>The main features of this package are: the BES extension already announced in <Col N="1204" /> the budget, with abolition of the lifetime cap and an increased company limit; the legislation for special investment accounts giving 10 per cent tax treatment to a range of investment media having a strong orientation to Irish equities; an entirely new seed capital scheme; relief for additional own-capital investment by original enterpreneurs; the encompassing within the BES of research and development activities; extensions to CGT roll-over relief for entrepreneurs; enhanced incentives for employee investments and a new initiative aimed at increasing pension fund investment in small and medium-sized companies needing venture and development funds.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a number of other measures which will assist various sectors in contributing to the Government's overriding objective of improving employment, for instance: a rationalisation of the tax treatment of &ldquo;script dividends&rdquo; issued by quoted companies, making them more attractive to certain investors, and so assisting businesses wishing to retain profits to increase their capital base; new arrangements allowing businesses which supply inputs to exporting companies to avail of VAT zerorating, thus putting them in a position equivalent to that of suppliers from other EC member states under the Single Market regime; in the interests of tourism, further measures to help improve the availability of hire-cars; in the construction area, an extension of the foundation-laying deadline for the urban renewal scheme &mdash; as was announced in the budget &mdash; and now a new provision for a reduction in the claw-back period for capital allowances for commercial buildings; in respect of the film industry, a new scheme for individuals investing in film productions, an increase in the amount of tax-relieved investment permitted for corporate investors and changes to facilitate the making of films under co-production agreements with other countries and a new scheme of stock relief for farmers to assist herd expansion or diversification of farm enterprises, together with the abolition of <Col N="1205" /> the clawback provisions of the previous scheme.</P>
    <P>In my explanation of the detailed provisions in the Bill, instead of proceeding <i>seriatim</i>, I intend to start with the sections relating to the employment package.  This Bill contains other measures which I consider will be of value to businesses and thus indirectly assist in the preservation and creation of jobs; these are dealt with under the relevant headings.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains the legislative provisions for two initiatives already announced and which I have mentioned above.  Section 18 provides for the renewal of the BES for a further three years, together with removal of the previous lifetime cap for investors, thereby giving access to a wider pool of savings. Chapter III introduces, from 1 February, 1993, special investment accounts, the returns on which are liable to tax at 10 per cent.  These accounts can be offered by life assurance companies, unit trusts and stockbrokers.  There is a requirement that a minimum percentage of the funds in these accounts be invested in Irish equities, 40 per cent in 1993 rising to 55 per cent in 1996, and a further requirement that a minimum percentage is invested in companies whose capitalisation is less than £100 million &mdash; 6 per cent in 1993, rising to 15 per cent in 1996.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the BES and special investment accounts, which cater to specific segments of the market, have the potential to make a significant contribution to improving the availability of equity funds to Irish business over the next few years, given normal conditions on investment markets.  Notwithstanding these provisions, and the improvement in the general climate for equity investment in recent months, the Finance Bill also contains a number of further specific measures to help encourage investment in those areas of the economy which are of vital importance to self-sustaining jobs growth.</P>
    <P>Section 18 also introduces a new seed capital scheme which is designed to encourage employees to move from &ldquo;safe&rdquo; employment to start their own <Col N="1206" /> business.  The scheme will work by allowing the enterpreneur to claim a refund of tax paid on previous income in respect of his or her investment in a new company. The relief on investments will be allowed on a retrospective basis against the income of the preceding three years, up to a maximum of £25,000 income relief per year.  This will in practice allow immediate relief on investments of up to £75,000.  The scheme will be of advantage not only to those currently in employment, but also to the unemployed, including persons made redundant.  It will be of particular relevance to those with taxable redundancy lump sums.  The main conditions of the scheme can be summarised as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  Relief will be given in respect of investments in new companies engaged in manufacturing and certain service trades.  To ensure that the relief is directed at areas where there is real potential to create additional employment, project approval from either the IDA or Bord Fáilte will have to be obtained to benefit from the relief.</P>
    <P>(b)  The investor must take up employment with the company in which he or she is investing and remain employed by it for a period of 12 months.</P>
    <P>(c)  The investor must hold at least 15 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital in the company for a minimum period of two years.</P>
    <P>(d)  The investor must not own either directly or indirectly more than 15 per cent of the shares in another company for a period of 12 months prior to the new employment.</P>
    <P>To provide a further boost to investment and employment, Section 18 also provides for an increase in the BES company limit from £500,000 to £1 million with respect to shares issued on or after 6 May, 1993.</P>
    <P>The BES currently excludes from relief anyone who owns more than 30 per cent of the company in which they are making an investment.  To encourage additional investment by entrepreneurs in their own <Col N="1207" /> smaller or start-up early stage companies, the section further provides for this restriction to be lifted where the total capital of the company does not exceed £150,000.</P>
    <P>That section also provides that expenditure on research and development related to certain BES activities can qualify for BES relief in its own right.  I am aware that some commentators consider that these incentives should extend to a wider range of economic sectors, notably to the general area of services.  While I would concur with the view that the services sector has the potential to make a major contribution to meeting our employment needs, I have also to take into account the reality that the demand for domestically-oriented services is, at the end of the day, constrained by the general level of domestic demand.  It would make little sense, therefore, to offer the same range of incentives to new businesses in this area when the main effect would be the displacement of jobs in existing firms, or indeed the firms themselves.  Not only would this be an ineffective and wasteful use of public resources but it would be quite unfair to businesses which have been built-up without such assistance, to have them contribute through their tax contributions to the subvention of their competitors. It is the substantially lower risk of displacement in the &lsquo;exposed&rsquo; sectors that, in the final analysis, justifies the provision of special incentives.</P>
    <P>Section 20 introduces a radical extension of the rollover relief for capital gains tax (CGT) in the interest of facilitating successful entrepreneurs wishing to embark on new ventures with the potential for self-sustaining job-creation.</P>
    <P>At present, such rollover relief is available to a trader who sells physical assets and then reinvests the proceeds in other assets of that trade or another.  Section 20 extends the rollover relief to situations where an entrepreneur disposes of shares in a company and reinvests them, on a similar basis, in an unquoted company in manufacturing or certain &lsquo;exposed&rsquo; parts of the services sector i.e. sectors falling <Col N="1208" /> within the scope of the BES.  For the purposes of this provision, the entrepreneur must be a person holding at least 15 per cent of the shareholding in an unquoted trading company who has been engaged full time in that company.  The effect of the provision will be to defer the CGT charge that would otherwise arise until such time as the entrepreneur leaves the new company.  The purpose of the provision is to facilitate entrepreneurs who wish to reinvest the proceeds of the sale of their stake in an existing company in starting up a new company in these sectors.</P>
    <P>Income tax relief is currently allowed for an employee who invests up to £750 in new ordinary shares in his or her employing company.  The limit for this investment is being increased four-fold, to £3,000.</P>
    <P>Members of the House will recall that in my budget speech, I indicated that I would be entering into discussions with representatives of the Irish Pension Funds with a view to their making, through their investment activities a greater contribution to the development of the economy and to job creation.</P>
    <P>Discussion with the Irish Association of Pension Funds have taken place over the last two months on this matter and are continuing.  I have indicated to the association during these discussions that what the Government has in mind in this initiative is greater involvement in the provision of development and venture capital, an area which is not well-served by institutional investors.  I have also emphasised that the Government is not interested in seeing investments in the venture capital area just for the sake of it and regardless of the returns that such investments might give.</P>
    <P>I have been assured by the Irish Association of Pension Funds that they fully support the principle underlying my initiative.  In regard to venture and development capital, they have pointed to pension funds' current portfolio of equity investments in unquoted Irish companies totalling some £200 million, some of it in the small/medium companies to which the Government is <Col N="1209" /> anxious to improve the availability of capital.  However, the discussions have also brought out not only the limited expertise and experience among pension fund trustees and their investment managers in this area but also the mixed performance of such investments. Accordingly, it has been agreed, in the interests of redressing this difficulty and other issues, that a detailed study will be carried out and completed within three months under the auspices of the Irish Association of Pension Funds supported by the Irish Association of Investment Managers, the Irish Insurance Federation and my Department.  This study will, <i>inter alia</i>, assess the opportunities for investment in this area and its suitability having regard to the prudential requirements of pension funds, examine the criteria to be applied to such investments and determine whether existing structures for channelling and managing such investments are adequate and, if not, recommend how this inadequacy can be addressed as quickly as possible.  The IAPF will also use the opportunity afforded by the study to examine the potential for increasing pension funds investment in other suitable areas.</P>
    <P>Given their lack of experience in this specialised area of investment and the varying asessments of need in the venture capital field currently available, the pension funds trustees, while agreeing with the principle involved, are understandably cautious about committing themselves to any specific target for investment in advance of completion of the study. However, based on my discussions with the industry the Government propose that the pension funds will work towards a target investment of £100 million in venture or development capital, subject to the outcome of the study and to sufficient suitable projects being brought forward.  This increased investment will be additional to the existing level of pension fund investment in unquoted comanies and will be pursued on a phased basis over a period of five years.  Such a sum, while very significant in terms of overall venture/development capital requirements, would represent not more <Col N="1210" /> than 1 per cent of pension fund assets assuming normal growth trends.  It is my intention that pension funds will achieve an investment level of £15 million by mid-1994, also subject to the same provisos.</P>
    <P>I recognise that this initiative assumes that the study will confirm that pension funds trustees, who are required by law to invest in a prudent manner, can increase exposure to the targeted area.</P>
    <P>I am confident, however, that the initiative will redress some of the structural problems which are an impediment to investment in this area so that it will provide a worthwhile avenue of investment for pension funds and help address the funding problems of developing indigenous business and thereby promote employment prospects in the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the area of Corporation Tax.  Section 26 redresses a position in relation to the 100 per cent capital allowances for the IFSC and Shannon which was never intended and indeed is contrary to the corporation tax policy pursued since 1988.  Capital allowances of 100 per cent are still available in the IFSC and Shannon as an incentive to promote the development of these two areas.  The wording of the existing legislation could, however, permit an Irish lessor located outside these areas to obtain accelerated capital allowances on assets leased to companies within these areas.  The section ensures that an Irish lessor located outside the IFSC or Shannon who leases assets to IFSC or Shannon companies will be entitled to the same capital allowances that would apply if the lessor leased the assets to a lessee outside these areas.</P>
    <P>Section 27 deals with the treatment of grants for the purposes of capital allowances. Since 1986 the general position has been that any State grants in respect of capital assets are deducted from the expenditure on those assets for the purposes of determining the associated capital allowances.  This covers both grants paid directly from State funds or from the funds of any board established by statute or any public or local authority <Col N="1211" /> and grants paid from an outside agency such as the EC but routed through a Government Department, statutory body, or public or local authority.</P>
    <P>The section clarifies and extends the existing legislation to ensure that the capital allowance entitlement is restricted to the net-of-grant expenditure no matter how or by whom the grant aid is made. The need to tighten up the legislation in this regard is reinforced by the fact that Ireland is likely to receive very substantial EC Structural Fund aid over the medium term, much of which will be capital in nature and which will be routed through various State agencies.  I would point out that it is not proposed to alter section 25 of the Finance Act, 1987 which specifically exempts companies in the food processing sector who purchase their own plant and machinery from the &ldquo;net-of-grant&rdquo; approach to the calculation of capital allowances.</P>
    <P>Section 29 deals with the taxation of scrip dividends in the case of quoted companies. A &ldquo;scrip dividend&rdquo; is the issue by the company to the shareholder of additional shares instead of the normal cash dividend.  Scrip share issues enable a company to increase its equity while avoiding transaction costs normally associated with share issues.  Under existing tax legislation, for historical antiavoidance reasons, scrip dividends are taxed more severely than cash dividends. The section changes the existing taxation treatment and taxes scrip dividends by reference to the reality of the situation. Thus, instead of the existing income tax charge on the shareholder on the receipt of scrip dividends, the shareholder will now be regarded as having received an asset for tax purposes.  This means he will be taxed under the capital gains tax code if he later sells these shares.  The abolition of the income tax charge will act as an incentive for individual and corporate shareholders to take up the scrip dividends instead of cash dividends.  This will benefit the company issuing the dividends since it will mean an increase in its share capital and allow it to retain a greater amount of profits.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1212" /> Section 30 of the Bill gives tax exempt status to employment grants made by Údarás na Gaeltachta to international service industries.  The tax exempt status is analogous to that applying to similar grants made by the IDA and will benefit the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>Section 31 of the Bill gives a tax exemption in regard to payments from the market development fund and the employment subsidy scheme in the hands of the recipients.  The exemption will have retrospective effect to the commencement date of both schemes.  As Deputies know, the market development fund was designed to assist manufacturing companies to put in place an action plan to improve their international competitiveness and employment levels following the European currency crisis and devaluations last autumn.  The scheme terminated at end-March 1993. The employment subsidy scheme which was agreed with the EC for a one-year period and which terminated for applications on 26 February, 1993 offered employers a wage subsidy in respect of extra workers recruited from the live register and retained for at least 18 months.</P>
    <P>Sections 32 to 34 of the Bill implement my budget announcement that the payment date for corporation tax would be aligned with that for advance corporation tax, the change to take effect in respect of all accounting periods ending on or after 1 May 1993.  In practice, a substantial amount of corporation tax is paid after banking hours on the latest day for payment of the tax and at the end of the year this can mean that payments may not actually be lodged to the benefit of the Exchequer until the following year. In order to safeguard the £37 million yield in 1993 from this budget measure, it is now being provided that where the payment date for corporation tax and advance corporation tax for an accounting period fall after the 28th day of the month concerned, the tax should be paid not later than the 28th day of that month.</P>
    <P>Sections 35 and 36 of the Bill provide for the bringing of the Trustee Savings Bank into the corporation tax net for <Col N="1213" /> the first time.  The taxation of Trustee Savings Bank has been under consideration by the Government for some time on the basis that it is unsatisfactory that a bank with assets of £1.1 billion and a good annual surplus of £8 million in 1991 and £9.6 million last year should be effectively free of tax.  The Trustee Savings Bank will be taxed at the standard rate of 40 per cent on an increasing level of its trading income over four years.  A total of 25 per cent of trading income will be taxed in respect of the year ended 31 March 1994, 50 per cent in respect of the year ended 31 March 1995, 75 per cent for the year ended 31 March 1996 with taxation on 100 per cent of trading income each year thereafter. As the Trustee Savings Bank is in competition with all the other licensed banks in the State, the imposition of corporation tax puts them on the same footing as their competitors.</P>
    <P>Section 37 of the Bill makes a number of changes to section 39 of the Finance Act, 1980 which defines goods for manufacturing relief purposes.  Paragraph (a) ensures that the general exclusion from the scope of the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax of goods sold to the Intervention Agency does not apply in the case of subcontracted deboning services carried out by a meat processing company for the agency.  To allow the present legislative position to remain would put at risk the commercial viability of these beef deboning services which are a bona fide manufacturing process and are of considerable importance in generating added value and employment in the meat processing industry.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) of section 37 amends the legislation introduced last year allowing certain co-operatives to qualify for the 10 per cent rate in order to deal with certain problems that have arisen.</P>
    <P>Section 38 and 39 make a number of amendments to section 84A of the 1976 Corporation Tax Act.  Paragraph (a) of section 38 provides that where, on or after 6 May 1993, the repayment period of a section 84 loan is extended, the lender is to be regarded as having received repayment of the loan and as <Col N="1214" /> having advanced a new loan which will now qualify as a section 84 loan.  This ensures against such loans being extended beyond the original termination date.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) of section 38 changes the section 84 rules to allow a company connected with the IFSC company to obtain a section 84 loan when such a loan is included on an approved IDA list.  This will ensure that a project which was intended to have access to such loan facilities is not deprived of that simply on account of being associated with a company in the IFSC.</P>
    <P>Section 39 provides that the currency exchange gains on high coupon section 84 loans are to be treated as income from the sale of manufactured goods, thus making them taxable at the special low 10 per cent rate.  The provision will have retrospective effect to when the gains on such loans first arose.  These particular loans are section 84 loans in a highinterest rate foreign currency, where the borrower obtains a capital gain through foreign exchange transactions and offsets this gain against his interest cost, thereby achieving a very low net interest rate on the loan.  The Government approved in 1991 the issuing of such loans in the case of two lists of loans for specified IDA projects and this change in the law is necessary to ensure that these borrowers obtain the desired low interest rate.  If the gains were taxed at 40 per cent or higher as non-trading income, or under the capital gains tax code, this would considerably increase the cost to the borrower. Since other high coupon loans, which are not on these IDA lists, could also have been used for projects involving increased employment, it is proposed to apply the 10 per cent trading income treatment to all high coupon loans.</P>
    <P>I intend to bring proposals to Government, for inclusion on the Committee Stage of the Bill, about extending the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax to the advertising income of newspapers.</P>
    <P>Let me now turn to personal income tax, which is dealt with mainly in Chapter I.  Income tax reform has made significant progress during the currency of the <i>Programme</i><Col N="1215" /><i>for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>; the standard rate was cut from 35 per cent to 27 per cent and the higher rates consolidated in a single 48 per cent top rate.  In addition, the tax base was broadened to make the system more equitable and consistent with the economy's needs and, of course, to provide funding for the tax improvements.  Significant improvement was also made in the exemption limits and the standard band was widened.  Further such improvement is contained in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 1 to 3 provide for the implementation of the income tax reliefs announced in the budget, which will cost an estimated £37.6 million in 1993.  The main personal allowances are raised and the standard band is widened.  There are also increases in the general and age exemption limits, and in the child addition to those limits, which will benefit many low-paid persons, especially those with families.  Overall, the changes will remove an estimated 13,500 taxpayers from the tax net, and bring a further 18,000 taxpayers from the higher marginal rate to the standard rate.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for an increase in the interest ceiling for mortgage interest relief from £2,000 single and £4,000 married to £2,500 and £5,000 married.  In recognition of the higher mortgage rates that prevailed over the period since last autumn, it also provides, as an exceptional temporary measure for 1993-94 only, for an increase from 80 per cent to 90 per cent in the percentage of interest qualifying for relief.  In addition, to assist first time purchasers, the percentage of interest allowable is increased to 100 per cent for the first three years in which they claim mortgage interest relief, subject to the general interest ceilings.  To help offset to some degree the cost of this overall package of improvements, a <i>de minimis</i> exclusion for mortgage interest relief is introduced.  This will disallow for the purpose of relief the first £100 single-£200 married of interest currently allowable. The estimated net cost of the package is about £17.5 million in 1993.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1216" /> As I indicated in a press release on 26 November last, section 6 of the Bill provides for the taxation of severance payments to outgoing Members of the Oireachtas and former holders of ministerial parliamentary offices from the commencement of the new payments.  In addition, the legislation makes severance payments to certain public servants subject to the same tax treatment as applies to similar payments in the private sector.</P>
    <P>I will be bringing forward a provision on Committee Stage to amend the tax treatment of redundancy payments. Employees receiving non-statutory redundancy payments qualify for certain tax exemptions; the exempt amount is determined either by reference to length of service and rate of pay or to flat rate cash figures, essentially the £6,000 allowance for <i>ex gratia</i> payments.  The former provides a substantial exemption for employees with long service.  The latter is of more relevance to employees with shorter service but currently does not take account of the length of service. Accordingly, I propose to introduce an addition of £250 per year of service with the employer to the current cash figure; I intend that the change will be effective from 6 May, the date of publication of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 22 extends tax relief for heritage gardens.  Tax relief has up to now been available in respect of the cost of the maintenance, restorations, etc., of significant buildings and of gardens attached to such buildings.  The Bill provides for the extension of this relief to gardens which are not attached to significant buildings where the gardens are determined to be of significant horticultural, scientific, historical or aesthetic interest.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the new temporary income levy announced in the budget.  The new levy will apply for the year 1993-94 at a rate of 1 per cent on all income on a similar basis to the existing health and employment and training levies.</P>
    <P>The levy is payable by all individuals over 16 years of age but with a specific income exemption in order to protect <Col N="1217" /> the lower paid.  In the case of the self-employed, exemption will apply where income for the year is not greater than £9,000.  In the case of employees, the levy is payable in any week where income is greater than £173.  In addition, all medical card holders, including those whose income is above £9,000 per annum, are exempt from the levy.  All social welfare payments are also exempt and such payments will not be taken into account in determining whether an individual qualifies for an income exemption from the levy.  Unlike the existing levies and the income levy which applied in the early eighties, employers are not liable to pay the new levy in respect of their employees who are medical card holders.  To ensure that the levy is in fact paid this year by all liable taxpayers, the Bill further provides for an appropriate amendment to the rules governing the payment of preliminary tax by the self-employed.</P>
    <P>As regards the particular criticisms made of the levy of course the Government would have preferred not to have had to introduce the temporary 1 per cent income levy, if the quite exceptional budgetary pressures allowed of any realistic alternative.  However, to describe this levy as a tax on employment, as a number of critics and commentators have done, is nothing short of misrepresentation.  In fact, the same superficial reasoning can be advanced in respect of almost all taxes, including income tax.  PRSI, indirect taxes and corporation tax, which between them account for more than 90 per cent of revenue in every country in the OECD. However, as we all know, without these taxes no country could aspire to providing civilised levels of social and public services and facilities which are essential to economic infrastructure.  The levy will only impact on employment if taxpayers seek to compensate themselves through higher charges and wages &mdash; rather than accepting that they should make a limited contribution towards the exceptional unemployment and other costs imposed by the protracted slowdown in the international economy.  We should not lose sight of the fact that taxpayers are being <Col N="1218" /> asked to accept this limited sacrifice against the background of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and earlier years of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which have seen progressive and substantial increases in real take-home incomes.</P>
    <P>Chapter III provides for the new scheme of taxation of life assurance companies which has already been announced by the Government and come into force on 1 January 1993.  The provisions include a single 27 per cent annual charge on the returns from life assurance products, whether income or capital gains, which is payable by the life companies.  The capital gains tax will be charged without indexation.  Realised gilt gains and both realised and unrealised non-gilt gains will be subject to taxation, the latter on seven-year spreading basis.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Bill introduces a tax on the net proceeds of foreign life assurance products which are sold here.  This change is necessitated by the gradual liberalisation of the life assurance market under the various EC life assurance directives which has already commenced and which will be completed by July 1994. Since an annual charge on the return from the funds of the life company is not feasible where the company is not operating in the State, the charge on foreign life assurance products will apply when the net proceeds are paid to the policy holder.  The net proceeds will be subject to a 40 per cent tax charge; the higher rate, <i>vis-á-vis</i> the annual charge on Irish policies, is necessary to compensate for the deferment of the tax until the policy is redeemed.  As is the case for Irish life assurance products, there will be no indexation relief, the annual small gains relief will not apply and the product will be ring-fenced from any other gains or losses which the individual might have.</P>
    <P>I will be introducing changes in the taxation arrangements for unit trusts on Committee Stage of the Bill.  These changes will be broadly in line with the changes in the taxation of life assurance products which I have outlined above.</P>
    <P>Section 21 provides for changes in the stock relief arrangements for farmers.  As <Col N="1219" /> a result of the changes in the Common Agricultural Policy and other factors, it was considered that the old stock relief regime was no longer appropriate. Accordingly, the old stock relief scheme which lapsed on 5 April 1993 is not being renewed and is being replaced by a new scheme of relief from 6 April 1993 to 5 April 1995.  Having regard to the changes in the Common Agricultural Policy and to avoid the related difficulties that could arise for farmers with declining stock values, clawback arrangements under the old scheme are being abolished, which should benefit a considerable number of farmers.  The new relief give an incentive for developing farmers and for farmers diversifying into new areas of agricultural activity and there are no clawback provisions.</P>
    <P>In regard to urban renewal there are five changes to the tax reliefs for the designated areas; three of the changes are designed to assist in the development of these areas while the remainder deal with tax avoidance loopholes.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides that where a life assurance company locates its new business activities in a new or refurbished rented building in a designated area, the seven-year spreading of expenses rule for such business will not affect the full immediate availability to the company of the double rent allowance.</P>
    <P>Sections 23, 24 and 25 provide for an extension of the time limits associated with the urban renewal scheme in the general designated areas.  The reliefs available are capital allowances for commercial buildings, owner-occupier allowance, double rent allowance and relief for rented residential accommodation.  The deadline for the expiration of the reliefs is being extended by six months to the end November 1993 in the case of &ldquo;new-build&rdquo; projects, and by two months to 31 July in the case of the overall deadline for the reliefs.  Section 23 also introduces a thirteen-year clawback period for capital allowances on all commercial buildings in the designated areas.  This measure will bring the tax life of the buildings, which was previously 25 years, <Col N="1220" /> into line with the 13-year period over which the accelerated allowances would normally be fully claimed.</P>
    <P>Section 23, in addition, closes off two tax loopholes.  Firstly, the double rent allowance, in the case of a refurbished building, will from now on be conditional on the capital expenditure on refurbishment amounting to at least 10 per cent of the market value of the building before the refurbishment took place.  The section provides for the closure of a loophole in relation to the cross-leasing, of property by means of controlled companies; under such cross-leasing, both firms can obtain both the accelerated capital allowances for lessors and double rent allowance for leasees.  This effect was never intended and is now being rectified.</P>
    <P>Three important changes are being made to section 35 of the Finance Act, 1987 which is the section which provides relief from corporation tax in respect of investment in Irish film making companies. At present, in order to be a qualifying film for the purposes of the relief, at least 75 per cent of the production work of the film must be carried out in the State and not more than 60 per cent of the cost of producing the film may be met by section 35 investments.  In order to facilitate the making of films under co-production agreements with other countries, section 40 provides for the waiving of the 75 per cent Irish production test for a film to qualify for the relief subject to certain conditions.  These conditions are (a) at least 10 per cent of the production work must be carried on in the State; (b) the approval of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht must be obtained for this 75 per cent criterion to be waived; and (c) the percentage of the cost of the production of the film allowable to be met by section 35 investment cannot exceed the percentage of production work carried out in the State, subject to the overall 60 per cent cost of production ceiling referred to above.  For example, if 50 per cent of the work on the production of the film is carried out <Col N="1221" /> in the State, then not more than 50 per cent of the cost of producing the film may be met by section 35 investments.</P>
    <P>The other changes in the relief will be made on Committee Stage of the Bill. The present ceiling for investment under section 35 is £600,000 per corporate investor.  This will be increased to £1.05 million which can be invested either as a £1.05 million investment in a single film production in any one year in a three-year period, or as £350,000 each year for three years in one or more film projects. In addition, individuals will in future be able to avail of the section 35 relief up to an annual limit of £25,000; in the context of this new relief, films are being removed from the scope of the business expansion scheme, but an individual will be able to avail of both the section 35 relief and the BES generally.</P>
    <P>These three changes are designed to boost investment in the Irish film and audiovisual industry, an industry which has realised exciting advances in recent years and which, I am confident, has the potential for further imaginative and dynamic growth.</P>
    <P>The maximum acceptable degree of freedom from tax for foreign trusts is provided for in section 41 in order to facilitate the generation of employment in Ireland from the management of such trusts.  &ldquo;Foreign trusts&rdquo; are those where the settlors and beneficiaries are not domiciled or resident in the State, the assets are located outside the State, and the income is from sources outside the State; only the professional trustees, who must be licensed banks, authorised trustees for collective investment undertakings or similar persons, and approved by the Central Bank as suitable trust managers, may be located in the State.</P>
    <P>Legislation allowing the Central Bank to give such approval does not exist at present.  New legislation is required and will be prepared as quickly as possible this year.  In view of this, the Finance Bill provisions enable the Minister for Finance, by order, to bring these provisions in relation to the taxation of foreign trusts into effect when the necessary regulatory legislation is in place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1222" /> I now wish to deal with customs and excise.  The Bill confirms the changes announced in the budget with regard to the increase in duty on cigarettes and certain other tobacco products and on cider and perry.  It sets out a single rate of duty for heavy fuel oil which is necessary to comply with EC rules.  It provides for the duty reductions on certain low alcohol products (e.g. spritzers and coolers) and on auto-LPG.</P>
    <P>The Bill confirms the combined high season/week-end category of licence for amusement machines introduced in the budget.  Also in this general area and reflecting representations from the trade, the Bill provides for an amendment of the gaming licence regime so as to treat certain gaming machines as a single machine, irrespective of the number of playing positions.  Moreover, in order to facilitate operators of these machines, this change was effective from the date of publication of the Bill.  Other technical amendments to the gaming duty system are also included in the Bill to align its licensing and operational aspects with the amusement machine licensing arrangements.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware of the importance of the short term car hire sector within the tourism industry and of the shortage problems that can arise at peak demand periods.  This Government has decided to tackle these problems in a fundamental way through reshaping the fiscal environment for such cars.  The Bill contains a number of significant initiatives to increase the availability of cars for short term hire.  In addition to confirming the scheme of partial repayment of vehicle registration tax (VRT) for cars in the short term hire fleet announced in the budget, a further relieving provision is proposed in regard to the arrangements for paying VRT on such cars.  The duty liable on new cars purchased by car hire operators in the period from 1 December to 31 August will be deferred until 15 September and the duty on purchases in the period 1 September to 30 November will be payable on 15 December.  In proposing these measures, I believe I have fully addressed the representations made <Col N="1223" /> by car hire interests and have created a framework and climate which should allow for a substantial increase in the hire fleet during the summer season and which should underpin the financial viability of the sector generally.  In response to the very many requests made to me, I have decided to defer the proposed introduction of standard VAT rating for short term car hire originally proposed for 1 September next.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for other minor adjustments to vehicle registration tax by providing for (i)  the alignment of the taxation treatment of minibuses with the Carriage Office's licensing arrangements in this area by reducing the passenger seating requirements to 12, thus maintaining the present flat-rate vehicle registration tax charge on such vehicles and (ii) an adjustment of the vehicle registration tax arrangements in relation to demonstration vehicles to restore the pre-1993 position as regards the amount of input tax that can be deducted.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the enactment of certain residual matters in the vehicle licensing (road tax) area set out in the &ldquo;Government Proposals for Legislation to be included in a Second Finance Bill&rdquo; published last November which were not subsequently enacted.  These deal with underpinning the legislative basis for the national vehicle file; the provision of a framework for the renewal of road tax and driving licences at any motor tax office in the State; updating road tax penalty provisions and enabling local authorities to pass information to the gardaí about cars that have been registered for vehicle registration tax but in respect of which an application for a road tax licence has not been received within seven days.</P>
    <P>Internal Market obligations require that we cease using the intermediate prefermentation works system as the basis for levying excise duty on beer; instead, a system based on taxation of the end-product must be adopted.  In connection with this changeover, which I intend to introduce on 1 October next by means of <Col N="1224" /> ministerial order, the Bill provides for a new rate of duty on beer, based on the end product.  A revenue neutral rate of £14.62 per hectolitre per cent alcohol in the finished product is proposed.  As part of the new regime, revised deferment arrangements are also proposed for payment of excise duty on beer.  It is proposed that duty on deliveries made in one month may be deferred to not later than the end of the following month, and duty on deliveries made up to and including 20 December will be paid by the end of that month.  These revised deferment arrangements will also apply to the payment of excise duty on wine.</P>
    <P>Before I leave this area of taxation, I would like to thank sincerely the Irish brewers for the way in which they cooperated with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners in dealing with the many complex issues involved in formulating the above changes.</P>
    <P>The Bill clarifies the position of certain minor categories of spirits retailers on licences to ensure that they will be subject to the appropriate licence duty and the associated tax clearance requirements.</P>
    <P>Finally, as far as excises are concerned, the Bill provides for certain other technical amendments to Customs and Excise law in order to align domestic law with EC requirements.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill gives effect to the legislative changes relating to VAT.  As regards the rate changes announced on budget day, the Bill confirms all of these apart from one, the proposed application of the standard rate to short term car hire which was to take effect from 1 September next.  In response to the many representations received from tourism interests, I have decided that this change should be deferred.  When taken in conjunction with the proposed reliefs for the short term car hire sector in relation to vehicle registration tax, this concession should further underpin the financial viability of the sector, thereby facilitating an increase in the size of hire fleets.  Thus, short term car hire remains at the parking rate of 12.5 per cent for the moment. Ultimately, however, it will have to be <Col N="1225" /> taxed at the standard rate, in accordance with EC law.</P>
    <P>As regards the VAT rate increases on clothing and footwear, I want to state clearly that I have no intention of reversing my decision to place these items at the standard rate.  Every other member state of the European Community applies the standard rate to clothing and footwear.  Our standard rate, at 21 per cent, is not significantly different from those of most other member states. Indeed, taking account of the application of a zero rate to children's apparel which is unique to ourselves and the UK, this category of expenditure is still treated favourably.</P>
    <P>There is no question of my hiding behind EC provisions in this matter.  I have made it quite clear from the outset that, while the 16 per cent rate had to be abolished because of the provision in EC law, which permits the existence of only one rate in excess of the agreed standard rate minimum level of 15 per cent, the primary purpose of placing adult clothing and footwear at the standard rate this year was for the purpose of raising revenue. It was part and parcel of overall budgetary strategy, which was framed with the need to give Irish industry conditions in which jobs could be protected firmly in mind, and which has now paid off in terms of creating an environment of currency stability and substantially lower interest rates.  In all of the debates on this matter I have not heard one good suggested alternative as to how the additional revenue could have been raised in order to keep the budget on target.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that the difficulties being encountered in the clothing industry are wholly or even largely due to the VAT rate increase.  Without labouring the matter, I want to repeat that the two-thirds of the output of the Irish clothing sector which is exported will not be affected by the change; moreover given that the higher rate applies equally to the 80 per cent of consumption here that is imported and the 20 per cent which is domestically sourced, the relative position of these supplies has not been disturbed. <Col N="1226" /> It should be evident from these figures that not only would preferential VAT treatment do little for the producing sectors, but also that, were I to respond to these demands and shift the burden elsewhere in the VAT area, the net effect on employment would most probably be unfavourable.  I am satisfied that the balance struck in the budget, whereby the increased revenue arising from the standard-rating of adult clothing and footwear helped finance an alleviation of VAT on labour-intensive services, was the right one from an overall employment standpoint.  Let me also repeat, however, that I am concerned as to how to improve the cost competitiveness of the manufacturing side of the industry here and I have already announced the following measures aimed at addressing that question: (1)  temporary assistance will be directed to manufacturing firms in the sector who can demonstrate that their viability and employment levels are threatened by the effect of the application of the standard rate of VAT to their domestic sales.  The details of the assistance and the criteria for granting it will be announced shortly by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment; (2)  an urgent review is to be carried out in consultation with the Department of Social Welfare of the impact on low paid manufacturing firms of the operation of the employers' PRSI system, and (3)  the criteria under which the IDA assist technological development in the clothing and footwear sector will be reviewed.  In the meantime the advice and assistance of the relevant State agencies will be focused on the firms which are identified as being particularly at risk.</P>
    <P>I will continue to monitor the situation and keep in touch with the sectors representing footwear, fashion manufacturing and retailing, led by IBEC.</P>
    <P>There are two measures provided for in the Bill which are designed to offset, to a considerable extent, the major cash-flow loss to the Exchequer arising from the abolition of VAT at point of entry on intra-Community trade.</P>
    <P>The first involves a special advance <Col N="1227" /> payment in December by the larger tax remitters, equivalent to one-twelfth of their annual liability, to be set against actual liabilities in the following January's normal VAT return.  This initiative, on the basis proposed &mdash; that is, restricting the measure to those taxable persons whose VAT liability exceeds £120,000 per annum &mdash; is estimated to yield £145 million in cash-flow terms. Provision is made to impose a surcharge where a taxpayer fails to make the advance payment by the due date.  I believe that, overall, this initiative is a balanced one, as it gives the business community the benefit of the cash-flow gain arising from abolition of VAT at point of entry for most of the year.</P>
    <P>Another cash-flow proposal contained in the Bill involves a change in the method of charging VAT on the removal of alcoholic goods from bonded warehouses. The Bill provides that, in the case of all taxable transactions involving such duty suspended goods, that is, sales made within warehouses, acquisitions from other member states and imports from outside the Community, VAT will be charged on the last sale, if any, within bond and on the duty inclusive price as the goods leave bond.  It is estimated that this measure, which is designed specifically to counter certain tax evasion practices which have been found in the drinks trade, will yield £15 million in cash-flow terms to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes granting zero rating for supplies made to companies the bulk of whose output is supplied to other member states or exported outside the Community.  This initiative will represent a significant improvement in the trading environment for companies authorised to participate in the scheme, who, up to now, would be in a repayment position in relation to VAT.  Many Irish exporting manufacturing companies, for example, will be able to participate in the scheme and should benefit from a cash-flow gain and savings in administrative costs arising from simplification of the system.  While the cash-flow effect on traders supplying authorised companies will vary, depending <Col N="1228" /> on credit terms, they will, however, gain the very significant commercial advantage of being able to zero rate their supplies to the companies concerned, and thus, from the VAT point of view, will be on a level playing field, so to speak, with out-of-State suppliers of the same type of goods and services.  Irish hauliers, who transport goods of authorised companies to other member states, will gain a similar advantage.  And, finally, the Exchequer will improve its cash-flow position by an estimated £20 million as a result of the measure.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in the Bill to enable a flat-rate farmer, who purchases goods in other member states above the threshold of £32,000, to register in respect of those acquisitions but remain a flat-rate farmer in all other respects.  The farmer will, of course, be required to pay Irish VAT &mdash; without deductibility &mdash; on such acquisitions.  It will, as always, remain open to individual farmers to opt for full taxable status, should they wish to do so. This measure will represent an important facility for all flat-rate farmers, but particularly those in the horse-breeding industry.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the abolition of the threshold relating to certain services, including accountancy and advertising, supplied from abroad.  Under existing rules, it is only if a trader's expenditure on such services is in excess of £15,000 that he is obliged to account for the VAT on them.  In contrast, all similar services being supplied by a domestic practitioner would be taxable.  Abolition of the threshold will eliminate this anomaly and remove any potential distortions of trade for Irish providers of such services.</P>
    <P>Electronic storage of records is permitted, subject to Revenue approval, for a wide range of business records in relation to most taxes.  The Bill extends the relevant provisions to the VAT area, responding to requests from traders for the facility.</P>
    <P>I indicated last year when I introduced the arrangements regarding the VAT monthly control statement, which traders with a turnover of more than £2 million must issue to their commercial customers, <Col N="1229" /> that I would keep the threshold under review in the light of the anti-evasion objective sought by the measure and experience with its operation.  I am satisfied that it is too early at this stage of the scheme, which has only applied from 1 November last, to decide whether any changes may be necessary.  Accordingly, I have not made any provision in this year's Finance Bill to amend the threshold; the position will, of course, continue to be kept under review.</P>
    <P>With a view to alleviating the compliance costs for traders, in particular in relation to administration, postage and stationery, the Revenue Commissioners will, however, be amending the operational arrangements concerning the monthly control statement.  In future, the supplier will continue to be obliged to hold all information relating to each individual customer in a single record, to complete the record on a monthly basis in a &ldquo;monthly control register&rdquo; and make it available on request to the Revenue Commissioners at short notice. However, the control statement will need to be issued to customers only on a quarterly basis.  Of course, if they wish, traders may continue to issue the statement on a monthly basis.  Some may prefer to do so, for example, where the information has now been incorporated into the monthly commercial statement of account to customers.</P>
    <P>Part VI, Chapter I, of the Bill contains the detailed provisions of the new probate tax, the broad outline of which was announced in the budget.  The tax will apply in respect of deaths occurring after the date of enactment of the Bill and is estimated to yield approximately £11 million in a full year and approximately £3 million in 1993.</P>
    <P>The main features of the tax are as follows: the tax will be charged at a rate of 2 per cent on the net value of all estates over £10,000 passing under will or intestacy; there will be full exemption for the family residence where there is a surviving spouse; where there is no surviving spouse but there are surviving dependant children and &mdash; or dependant relatives of the deceased, the share of the <Col N="1230" /> family residence passing to such dependants will be exempt; the £10,000 exemption threshold will be indexed and marginal relief will also apply; liabilities of the estate at the time of death and funeral expenses will in general be allowed for the purposes of calculating the net value of the estates; there will be exemptions for pension benefits, charitable bequests, heritage property and the proceeds of assurance policies used to pay inheritance tax and-or probate tax; there will be a special relief to exempt property in certain circumstances from a second charge to probate tax where spouses die in quick succession; property not passing under a will or intestacy &mdash; for example, joint property which passes by survivorship &mdash; will be excluded from the scope of the tax; the tax will be allowed as an expense for inheritance tax purposes; the executor or the administrator of the estate will be the person primarily accountable for payment of the tax; however, the incidence of the tax will be apportioned among the beneficiaries of the deceased's estate to the extent that they acquire property which is not exempt; as a general rule, payment of the tax will have to be made at the time of lodging the Inland Revenue affidavit prior to the granting of the probate or administration of the estate; however, there are special provisions for postponing the payment of tax in cases of illiquidity &mdash; that is, where there are insufficient liquid assets in the estate to pay the tax &mdash; and hardship &mdash; where payment would cause excessive hardship; a discount will be allowed where the tax is paid earlier than nine months after the date of death; the discount rate will be 1¼ per cent per month of the amount of tax due; and interest, also at the rate of 1¼ per cent per month, will accrue on unpaid tax commencing nine months after the date of death.</P>
    <P>The Government has given careful consideration to the detailed provisions of the probate tax.  Having regard to the reliefs and exemptions proposed, the relatively low rate of tax and the special arrangements which cater for problems with payment, the Government is satisfied <Col N="1231" /> that the provisions contained in the Bill are reasonable and equitable and that the probate tax will not place an unreasonable burden on any taxpayer. On the basis of data compiled by the Revenue Commissioners, it is estimated that the probate tax charge should be less than £1,000 for over three quarters of all estates and less than £500 for over half of all estates.  Moreover, about a quarter of all estates should qualify for full exemption from the tax.</P>
    <P>To grant additional concessions over and above those provided for in the Bill would erode the base on which the tax is to be levied and would reduce the Exchequer yield.  As such it would undermine the intended purpose of the tax which is to broaden the base for taxing inheritance and thereby increase the yield from capital taxes in line with the commitment in this regard under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>In line with my announcement in the budget, the Bill provides, at section 118, for an increase in agricultural relief in respect of capital acquisitions tax on gifts from 55 per cent of eligible assets with a ceiling of £200,000 to 75 per cent with a ceiling of £250,000.  In so far as the farming sector is concerned, this will considerably reduce the tax on gifts as compared to inheritances and should provide a positive incentive to the early transfer of farms.</P>
    <P>Section 123 provides an exemption from capital acquisitions tax in respect of benefits accruing under life assurance policies issued by companies based at the International Financial Services Centre where such benefits are the subject of gifts or inheritances and where both the disponer and the beneficiary are foreigners. This measure will enhance the potential of the IFSC as a location for international life assurance business.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for a number of amendments to existing capital acquisitions tax legislation which are designed to safeguard against the avoidance of tax on the transfer of assets.  These anti-avoidance provisions are contained in <Col N="1232" /> Chapter II of Part VI of the Bill and, as announced in the budget, are effective from 24 February 1993.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of changes to stamp duty, some of which were announced in the budget.  In particular, section 91 provides that the stamp duty on new houses over 125 square metres shall be levied on the site value only, subject to the site being a minimum of 25 per cent of the total house value.  This measure, which is effective from 25 February last, will benefit families needing more spacious accommodation and the building industry.</P>
    <P>Section 95 will close off an avoidance loophole in the case of the exchange of immovable property.  At present, if two people exchange rather than sell houses to each other, the stamp duty charge is based only on the difference in value between the two houses.  The potential revenue loss arising from this loophole could be as high as £4 million per annum. Accordingly, to prevent further ongoing loss to the Exchequer, stamp duty will be charged on the total value of the immovable property passing on conveyance in such situations.</P>
    <P>Section 96 provides that, in determining the value for stamp duty purposes of property transferred by gift, no allowance will be made for certain rights with which the property is charged, except where such rights are reserved in favour of the transferer or the spouse of the transferer.  The type of rights involved are rights of residence, support, maintenance or other rights of a similar nature and, where such rights are reserved in favour of the transferer or the spouse of the transferer, allowance will be made for those rights up to a maximum of 10 per cent of the value of the property being transferred.  There is no change in the position regarding bona fide life interests attaching to a property.  These will continue to be allowed in full for stamp duty purposes.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes legislative provision for two extensions of the tax clearance system announced in the budget, to cover the issuing of various excise licences, to which sections 70 and 130 relate, and to <Col N="1233" /> ensure that the residential property tax liabilities have been discharged when houses are being sold, which is in section 97.</P>
    <P>Finally, Part VII of the Bill includes a number of provisions in relation to debt management.  Section 128, which extends the ways in which assets of the Post Office Savings Bank fund may be invested, will allow the secondary trader of the National Treasury Management Agency to trade in gilt futures on the Irish Futures and Options Exchange.  This should improve liquidity in the gilts futures market.  Section 129 provides the statutory basis for opening foreign currency clearing accounts and will streamline and improve the administration of the foreign currency debt portfolio by the National Treasury Management Agency.  The text of the section ensures that the Comptroller and Auditor General will have full control over disbursements of moneys from the new accounts.</P>
    <P>As is traditional, I have endeavoured to cover those areas of interest to many groups.  Professional, legal, accountancy and tax experts have submitted long submissions and detailed views to me.  As my colleagues in the House will be aware, the Second and Committee Stage debates are examined mostly by practitioners in their offices.  I thank all the bodies &mdash; some of whom I met a number of times to tease out certain points &mdash; for their time, effort and commitment.  I hope that the Bill and the explanatory memorandum will be of assistance to them.</P>
    <P>I also want to thank Members of the House, of all parties, for their co-operation over the past three months since I introduced my budget, and various groups of professionals, experts and people with an interest in particular sections of the Finance Bill.  We have endeavoured, in so far as we can, to deal with all the relevant issues and questions. Some have been left in abeyance for debate on Committee Stage, the relevant data not having been ready for publication of the Bill and with which we will deal in due course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first occasion <Col N="1234" /> on which I have had the opportunity of contributing to the debate on the Finance Bill as my party spokesman on finance. Obviously it is a <i>magnus opus</i>.  My only relief, when I looked at the thickness of last year's Finance Bill, was to note that this year's has 133 sections only.</P>
      <P>We will be opposing the Second Reading of this Bill on Thursday next because of a number of its detailed provisions. While there are some provisions we would welcome, its overall thrust falls far short of what we contend is required at this time.</P>
      <P>My first and most serious criticism of this Bill is that it fails to address the need for radical tax reform.  For example, the Culliton report was published in January 1991.  In addition, there has been a detailed report on strategy into the nineties drawn up by the National Economic and Social Council.  The authors of those reports come from a very broad spectrum of our society, for example, the social partners, the trade union movement, some of the finest economists, experts, industrialists, outstanding people, picked by the present and previous Government because of their high repute.  Those reports spell out a central focus, which is that the tax treatment of work reduces our competitiveness, stifles enterprise and creates poverty traps; that is the fairest summary I can give of it.</P>
      <P>I must admit to being shocked at the Taoiseach's comments &mdash; I have a copy of his script here &mdash; speaking at the sixth Fianna Fáil women's conference in Jury's Hotel on Saturday last, 8 May, at 3 p.m. I might quote what he had to say about tax reform, which should be seen in the context of both the Culliton and NESC reports:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another quack cure for unemployment is to put all our eggs in the basket of 'radical tax reform', though the Culliton report itself is careful not to make exaggerated claims about the effect of this on jobs.  Fianna Fáil have carried through in the last few years, more real tax reform and tax reductions than any of our predecessors. But the effect on unemployment <Col N="1235" /> has at best been limited.  In fact, as the experience in Britain in the late eighties and indeed in Ireland in the late seventies shows, a sudden, dramatic easing of the tax burden, primarily for the benefit of the better off, is economically disastrous.  I suggest it is not enough for Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats and Democratic Left to call for radical tax reform. Let them advocate clearly what it involves...</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach went on to say, in another startling remark, &ldquo;The campaign of opposition against such reform would know no bounds.&rdquo;  That is quite extraordinary. What the Taoiseach is saying is that he is a Taoiseach of least political resistance; a Taoiseach with the largest majority in the history of the State, with the potential of a five-year term ahead of him, with a free rein of power to do what he likes to meet the challenges presented by the 300,000 people unemployed, the highest rate of unemployment in Europe. What does he do? He says he will not countenance reform because it is a quack cure and because there would be a campaign of opposition to it.  It is clear that the Taoiseach has no economic policy, is happy simply to implement, when in Government with the Progressive Democrats, their political philosophy and, when in Government with the Labour Party, their political philosophy, which, in this case, is increased public spending, particularly current spending, resulting in higher taxes.</P>
    <P>We should never lose sight, in the important minutiae of all of this, of the principal features of the budget.  What this budget and Finance Bill give effect to is an increase in taxation of £575 million. Given the Exchequer returns for the first quarter of the year, I would predict we are talking about a greater tax take from all taxpayers of approximately 7 per cent, at a time when inflation is likely to be under 3 per cent.  That is a real doubling of tax.  Is that what this country needs?</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that this Government sought office for power's sake rather than <Col N="1236" /> to implement any real agenda.  This Government wants to increase the dependency culture.  When I come to some of the detailed, much vaunted and heralded bonuses for entrepreneurs we will see the dependency culture; not only does one have to have all ones &ldquo;i's&rdquo; dotted and &ldquo;t's&rdquo; crossed, one must resort to the State agency to get one's tax break.</P>
    <P>To avoid accepting the thrust of Culliton's proposals the Government established a task force, comprised primarily of civil servants, the Moriarty task force.  This neutered the tax reform proposals. Instead what we have are <i>ad hoc</i>, piecemeal, miniscule changes, many of which seek to not even reverse last year's decisions.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael will be opposing this Bill also because of the insistence on the iniquitous 1 per cent income levy, despite its negative effect on jobs.  We are totally opposed to the general thrust of increased taxation by 7 per cent provided for in this Bill.  Specifically, and I shall go on to detail my objections, we reject the probate tax and the failure to reverse the VAT rate on clothing and footwear.</P>
    <P>My central thesis in examining this Bill is tax reform.  I should like to make my case for tax reform in some detail.  It has been argued by the Government and Civil Service that cutting taxes will not increase employment, that cutting taxes, as did Nigel Lawson in Britain, did not do so, that tax cuts will simply increase profits and not be reflected in more jobs. This line of thinking entirely misses the point.  Ireland's tax consumption is of the order of 35.5 per cent of GNP, heading for 36 per cent of GNP.  The scope for reducing taxes must be seen in the context that, if public expenditure was cut by an enormous figure say £600 million, this would reduce the tax take by two per cent of GNP only.  Even I, who am a keen advocate of cuts in public expenditure am not aware of the potential for expenditure cuts on that scale.  The issue is how tax policies within 35 per cent or 34 per cent of GNP impact on employment.  It is not the case that we are talking about wholesale cuts in taxation.  We are talking <Col N="1237" /> about how our present tax regime impacts on employment.</P>
    <P>We have the highest unemployment rate in Europe.  There is irrefutable evidence that our present taxation system places an intolerable tax burden on payroll costs and creates a disincentive to work.  Let us examine the relevant facts. On average &mdash; and this is the average only; if one takes £1 of overtime it is much worse &mdash; every £1 of net pay costs an employer, in gross wage costs, £2.55. For gross pay in excess of £25 per week, there is a PRSI charge of 19.95 per cent which is not graduated.  Our gross labour costs relative to those in Britain are 4 per cent higher, yet the net pay of the average Irish worker is lower than that of his or her counterpart in Britain.  Because of the difference between the social welfare treatment of child dependants and the lack of tax-free allowances for children, as well as other fringe benefits, a married man with three children requires a gross pay level in excess of £173 per week to justify going to work.  If one throws in a medical card, differential rent and all the other fringe benefits, that is the figure; if he has more children the figure would be higher.</P>
    <P>After the provisions of this Finance Bill will have been enacted we shall have five taxes on work &mdash; PAYE, PRSI, the health, youth and, now, the 1 per cent income levy.  A single person with wages in excess of £70 per week will start paying tax at 36 per cent, when one takes PAYE, the levies and PRSI together.</P>
    <P>I have here the relevant section of the <i>Fianna Fáil and Labour Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997</i>, comprised of six very bland points which read as follows:</P>
    <P>We will continue the process of tax reform.  Our priorities will be:</P>
    <P>To remove the low-paid, especially families, out of the tax net altogether;</P>
    <P>To broaden the standard tax band, so that, as in other countries, only relatively high earners pay the higher rate of tax, and to further reduce tax rates, especially the standard <Col N="1238" /> rate, when economic conditions permit;</P>
    <P>To maintain the basic tax reliefs, such as mortgage interest and VHI, and to consider measures in the 1993 budget to relieve the position faced by mortgage holders, while the present situation of high interest rates lasts;</P>
    <P>To improve collection and enforcement, and to ensure equity as between those on PAYE, the self-employed, and those with substantial investment income;</P>
    <P>To study in consultation with the social partners the integration of tax and social welfare codes;</P>
    <P>To structure the whole tax system so as to support employment and to minimise financial imbalance and outflows.</P>
    <P>There are no targets set and no timetable is specified.  Therefore the Minister should not go through the ritual of saying that he is committed to tax reform when there is no tax reform programme in existence.  The Finance Bill worsens the situation through the imposition of the 1 per cent income levy while higher VAT rates on indigenous industries, such as clothing, footwear, construction and tourism, directly depress demand and output of those sectors and will jeopardise over 4,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>There is a range of options which the Government can pursue to implement a phased reduction in the taxation of work, particularly for the lower and middle income sectors.  The Taoiseach's paranoia about mortgage interest and VHI relief is only marginally relevant.  To abolish reliefs on income tax is as ineffective as focusing exclusively on the rates of tax, which is what the last Government did when we heard the mantra about the need to reduce rates to 25 per cent and 44 per cent.  But all that people are interested in is gross and net pay and the tax take and wedge; it does not matter how the rates and allowances are calculated.  One will make no progress <Col N="1239" /> if one freezes the allowances and bands and reduces the rates.  Similarly, if one abolishes mortgage interest and VHI relief the burden of income tax will increase, or if one decides to reduce personal allowances by the amount one reduces special reliefs one will not solve the problem.  All that matters to the employee is gross and net pay and gross wage costs to the employer.  If one changes allowances and rates on their own one may increase the tax take on work and direct personal income.</P>
    <P>PRSI reform cannot be deferred.  The most significant international comparison one can make in terms of competitiveness is with the United Kingdom.  The Revenue Commissioners have very kindly given me some detailed figures.  The Minister has informed us time and again that our rate of PRSI is the second lowest but I have to say, having looked at the figures, that this seems to be erroneous. As I said, our most important trader, in geographical terms and in terms of indigenous industry and trade with any other state, is the United Kingdom where the employer rate goes from 2 per cent to 9 per cent and the employee rate from 4.6 per cent to 10.4 per cent, giving a total range of 6.6 per cent to 19.4 per cent.  I am told that for the majority of labour intensive sectors the rate is about half.  Therefore what they are doing in Luxembourg is not that important in comparison with what is happening in Northern Ireland and in the rest of the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>To be honest, I do not understand some of these figures.  Some of the income tax rates go as high as 50 per cent; but on the other hand in Belgium the employer rate is 40.1 per cent while the employee rate is 12.07 per cent, giving a total of 52 per cent.  If the PRSI rate goes as high as 52 per cent I fail to see what is left for the employee.  It seems that the figures are being juggled.  In Denmark PRSI is incorporated with income tax.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the argument that our rate is the second lowest.  It seems that the interpretation of the rules, in terms of the amalgamation of income tax and <Col N="1240" /> PRSI, may lead to a different situation; but I have no doubt that the tax rates have a more severe impact on low incomes than the European average.</P>
    <P>The rates of PRSI are not graduated. One pays the same rate of PRSI on £19,000 as on £2,000.  This is destroying low paid jobs.  I am aware that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions do not like to talk about low paid jobs, but the fact is that there is a limited demand for brain surgeons in this country and many people cannot get their first job because low paid jobs do not exist.  We are not going to succeed if we are exclusively a high wage and high-tech economy.  We need every job that we can get and if this means in some cases that someone's first job is low paid, under £150 per week, I say it is better that he has a job than draw £45 to £50 per week on the dole.</P>
    <P>In relation to the PRSI fund, one pays a contribution to ensure that workers have certain rights.  Workers in receipt of long term unemployment assistance visit me at my clinics to say that when they took up a job in New Ross, for example, for 13 weeks, with a farmer or at the docks, they lost their child dependant allowance for a child over 18 years of age who is still in full-time education.  They also lost their butter vouchers and fuel vouchers and were paid less money.  In effect, they were worse off.  In other words, they were better off on long term unemployment assistance.  In an effort to improve the lot of persons in receipt of long term unemployment assistance they have overshot those in receipt of disability and unemployment benefit.  Therefore, it amounts to a penalty to pay PRSI at class A1 or class A7.  What we should do is amalgamate PAYE and PRSI, which is what happens in Denmark.  This would lead to the removal of many inequities in the social welfare code.  These issues must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The Minister has derided the Opposition parties, invited us into his spider's web and asked how we would pay for this tax reform, by which I mean that the first £100 of income would be exempt and that various allowances would be targeted exclusively at the low paid and not at <Col N="1241" /> those with incomes of up to £400,000 to which the Taoiseach referred over the weekend.</P>
    <P>Let us say that the bill for tax reform is £700 million.  There is scope for cuts in public spending in a number of Departments. For instance, there is substantial scope for cuts in spending in the Department of Defence; I do not think we obtain value for money in relation to the figure of £335 million.  I also think that the amount of money spent by the Department of the Marine is greater than the entire fish catch.</P>
    <P>When people examine public spending they say than that pay accounts for 50 per cent, social welfare X per cent and so on and that we cannot do anything about it; but there is ample room for cuts on the pay side which has to do with numbers. There is no employer in this country who has not reduced numbers, mainly on a voluntary basis, through computerisation and the introduction of technology. There is scope to look for greater value for money.  The steps taken by former Deputy Ray MacSharry during the period 1987 to 1989 in relation to numbers can lead to substantial savings and a better focus on redeployment.  I would be happy to go into detail in this regard. There is a menu of public expenditure cuts of the order of £200 million.</P>
    <P>The next issue I would like to deal with is the need to widen the tax base.  If we are to tax low income earners less unearned income will have to be taxed more heavily.  I do not believe that a 10 per cent rate on savings can be justified. The Minister was sold a pup by the banks about the mobility of capital.  It could bear a 15 per cent rate.</P>
    <P>In relation to local government financing, I have grave difficulty in explaining to someone the reason a person living in the Minister's constituency pays no household charges while someone living in Dún Laoghaire has to pay £125.  I cannot justify this.  Because of the variations in relation to local government financing there is a need for greater autonomy for local councillors.  This need could be addressed with a view to reviewing the domestic rate support grant so <Col N="1242" /> as to reduce the dependence on central Government.</P>
    <P>At European level a strong argument has been made in favour of a carbon tax. This could be considered.  There is also a possibility of a major reorganisation of the VAT code.  It is our principle consumption tax and there is scope for a radical reorganisation.  I have mentioned several items from which the £700 million could be raised.  I do not accept that this is off limits and nothing can be done; it is a political issue.  The way we burden work with tax and the way pay attracts tax makes employers ask how they can minimise the number of jobs as well as minimising the monthly returns of PAYE and PRSI.  I know that is the way employers think, from the largest to the smallest.  I know employers see this as a surcharge for giving someone a job.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his army of public relations consultants have created the impression that this Bill provides attractive incentives by way of tax rebates for people to become entrepreneurs. However, now that we see the fine print the message should go out loud and clear that potential entrepreneurs have as much chance of getting the six numbers in the lotto on a Wednesday or a Saturday as of qualifying for £38,250 tax relief.</P>
    <P>There are the most extraordinary bureaucratic limitations on the seed capital scheme.  First, it applies only to companies on the 10 per cent corporation tax regime, despite all the arguments that the growth in job creation will come from the services sector &mdash; and from international experience, particularly in America, that is where the jobs have been created. However, we have restricted it mainly to manufacturing industries, a small element of tourism and a small element of research and development.  That basically wipes out 90 per cent of all employment opportunities.  In addition the entrepreneur has to obtain State agency approval, but this is subject to its decision on surplus capacity in the marketplace and there are a series of areas where it is deciding not to grant-aid the sector further because of surplus capacity.  That makes the system even more rigid.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1243" /> Second, the individual must subscribe at least 15 per cent of the share capital of the company, hold the shares for five years and not dilute the shares in the first two years.  The entrepreneur cannot always foresee what will happen and this means he cannot take in an extra partner. When I was chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses we conducted a detailed study of the reasons only three out of every ten businesses succeeded.  We found that this was not because they did not have a full order book or were not making money, but that they ran out of cash and did not have sufficient cash flow because they had incorrectly estimated the cost of setting up in business.</P>
    <P>Third, he or she must become a full time director or employee of the company. Very often one has to spend time researching and doing other work in setting up a business which does not provide an income.  Indeed, sometimes a person is employed to run it, but that disqualifies one from the scheme.  Fourth, the vast majority of potential entrepreneurs will be disqualified by the rule that not more than 10 per cent of their income over the past three years can come from a trade, business or rental income.  We had all kinds of leaks.  One cannot read the <i>Irish Independent</i> without seeing a strip lead on how people with expertise in engineering or accountancy can now set up in business.  They should forget about it. They have been disqualified because if more than 10 per cent of one's aggregate income in the past three years came from a trade, profession or rent, that means good night and rules them out.  Effectively, this excludes all professionals.  The Bill goes even further because existing entrepreneurs who are involved in another company are excluded also.  Indeed, anyone in contract employment is also excluded.</P>
    <P>Despite the lavish PR and the eulogising of the Minister's imaginative seed capital scheme in <i>The Sunday Business Post,</i> I venture to suggest that not even 200 people will be able to avail of it as it presently stands.  In fact, I do not know <Col N="1244" /> if 20 people will, but I predict safely that fewer than 200 will avail of it.  The Minister has not given guestimates or ranges of the number of jobs it will create or even the loss of revenue to the Exchequer.  We are told that it may cost somewhere in the region of £25 million down the road.</P>
    <P>If the Minister really wanted to make an impact on employment by helping entrepreneurs he would have reversed two of the decisions made last year which were particularly unhelpful to entrepreneurs. The first was the allowance in tax terms of interest on borrowings to companies or an individual and the halving of the tax free allowances made on capital gains on start up businesses. This is reduced for a married couple from £4,000 to £2,000 and for an individual from £2,000 to £1,000 &mdash; in other words, capital gains applied to the increase in the capital value of the shares when one sought to sell them.  We could have done without this PR and the raised expectations it generated.  People thinking of setting up a business may think this will work, but it will not.  The Culliton report was right.  The question to ask if one wants to find out if one is suited to being an entrepreneur is: &ldquo;Will I kick myself for the rest of my life if I do not do this particular thing because I really want to do it?&rdquo;  That is what motivates most people who set up in business.  Everything that can go wrong will go wrong, so one really must want to set up in business as well as make a profit at the end of the day.  People will not be interested in this bureaucratic nonsense.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party will be opposing totally section 7, which imposes the 1 per cent income levy.  As I said already, this represents a fifth tax on work.  It impacts on people earning only two-thirds of the average industrial wage and thereby creates another disincentive to work. Past experience has shown that it is not so temporary.  A levy was retained from 1983 to 1986, inclusive.  Of all budgetary measures this has created the most hostility. It is seen not only to fly in the face of tax reform but treats the PAYE sector as a soft touch &mdash; in effect &ldquo;a smash and <Col N="1245" /> grab raid&rdquo; on pay packets.  A further national pay agreement, the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> seems to hinge on its abolition.  The most unjust aspect of this tax is that it is non-refundable in all circumstances &mdash; for example, seasonal work where one pays the levy if one earns £180 per week for three months of the year.  If one is unemployed for the remainder of the year one can claim a refund of income tax, but there is no refund of the levy contribution.  There is the inequity that people who are supposed to have an income of over £9,000 per annum can have a lower income and pay the levy because the weekly pay was over £173 per week.  That is wholly unjust.  In addition there are no reliefs for people with high mortgages or large families.  The Minister should state in his concluding speech when he will abandon this levy because it is totally unfair. Indeed, the social partners may oblige him to do so, and the sooner the better.</P>
    <P>As well as dealing with the aspects of tax on work it is important we look at the role of the spouse working in the home on a fulltime basis.  I understand there are 600,000 women working fulltime in the home as parents.  Some people call them housewives, but I tend to think they are financial wizards.  Not only is there no special allowance for them but the carer's allowance and the dependant relative's tax free allowance schemes are simply paltry.  The thrust of income tax policy should be to convert the exemption allowances, including those for children, into tax free allowances and to encourage and foster care for the elderly relatives in the family environment rather than in institutions.  I believe the dependant relative's allowances should be greatly increased.  Health expenditure is now in excess of £2 billion.  This worries me greatly because I do not believe the quality of management in the health services is as good as that in industry.  I believe the drug companies are ripping us off.  We are paying far too much for drugs.  Contrast the £110 a year tax free dependant relative allowance with the minimum cost of the lowest level of institutional <Col N="1246" /> care of £230 a week.  It makes no sense.</P>
    <P>In relation to VAT, the Minister has failed to reverse the budgetary measures despite clear evidence of clothing and footwear factory closures on a daily basis. I understand that IBEC has produced a detailed analysis of employment in this sector.  It is quite clear that after the abolition of protection in this area following our EC membership and multifibre agreements there were huge job losses.  It is clear that those who remain in the industry are in it for the long haul. They have come through the pain barrier and they deserve our support.  This is a labour intensive industry.  We have had an extensive debate on this matter.  I fear that what has happened in the grocery trade will happen in the retail trade.  We have the most concentrated multiple retail market in Europe.  Britain has a Big Six chain of multiple retail outlets whereas we have two.  In Germany such outlets were never allowed become so concentrated.</P>
    <P>I envisage that the average draper and retailer in provincial towns will not exist in five year's time.  This VAT measure will hasten their departure.  IBEC has reported that 1,000 jobs have been lost in this industry and another 2,000 may be lost before the end of the year.  In this case make-believe schemes will not be announced through seed capital or entrepreneurial vision of what might happen. Real jobs will be lost and people will receive their P45 forms between now and Christmas.</P>
    <P>I noted the way the Minister handled this matter, very cutely and skilfully.  He met the manufacturers separately from the retailers and the fashion and design industry and promised them some concession. However, when their expectations were raised and they thought there would be some relief in terms of PRSI, we find that more deliberation and consultation is needed.  That is a Social Welfare Bill measure rather than a Finance Bill measure.  At the end of the day when all the PR exercises have been exhausted the EC will probably debar any permanent benefit scheme.  The <Col N="1247" /> market development scheme was allowed, only on the basis that it was temporary, for the short period of the currency crisis.  The people in this industry have a serious grievance.  A tortuous mirage has been put before them and they will never see results.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the increase in VAT on concrete products and blocks from 10 to 21 per cent.  It has been estimated by the Construction Industry Federation that 800 jobs will be lost as a result.  There is surplus capacity in the commercial sector, although there probably will be some buoyancy in housing with the reduction in mortgage rates.  The VAT increase in this area was unwise.</P>
    <P>The VAT increase in newspapers to 12.5 per cent, together with the changes in the Broadcasting Act, will make it more difficult for them to generate advertising revenue.  Many provincial newspapers are hanging on by their fingernails.  Changes in technology have enabled local radio to receive news instantly and that is to be welcomed. During the time Mr. MacSharry was Minister there was special recognition of the need for a low rate of VAT for newspapers.</P>
    <P>In regard to the new VAT payments method for companies whose liability exceeds £120,000, it is proposed that by 1 December one-twelfth of the VAT liability must be paid.  Initially this was to be a once off measure but, as it is termed in the Bill, it is now a permanent feature.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to two small matters in relation to VAT which have minimal revenue implications.  In the Cork area four or five sales businesses have been developed and under this measure their VAT rate will be increased to 21 per cent.  This is entirely a labour intensive industry for which different VAT rates apply throughout Europe &mdash; for example, in Germany the rate is 15 per cent;&mdash; in Italy, 12 per cent; in Luxembourg, 15 per cent; in the UK and the Netherlands, 17.5 per cent and in <Col N="1249" /> Spain, 15 per cent.  These companies fear a loss of market position and have a genuine case.</P>
    <P>I have been inundated with correspondence, as I am sure have my colleagues, from health and fitness clubs.  I do not frequent these clubs or massage parlours&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>To classify these clubs as private enterprises is unacceptable to them.  Perhaps the Minister would consider putting them on a level footing.</P>
      <P>I regard probate tax as wholly unjust. At present a deceased parent may will assets to a child free of capital taxation to the value of £171,750.  In considering probate tax no account was taken of hardship or inability to pay.  The exemption limit of £10,000 represents nothing but cruel begrudgery against home ownership and thrift.  It is significant to note that fewer than one-third of family businesses go to the third generation and this measure will reduce that number.  It fails to recognise that many inheritances relate to paper money where assets which are transferred are worth only as much as the income they can generate.  I understand that in Germany in the case of paper money assets only a fraction of their value applies for capital tax purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a condition in relation to a dependant child: where a widow or widower dies, the dependant child will have to pay the full 2 per cent tax &mdash; for example, on a £70,000 house, £1,400 will have to be paid &mdash; if the person's income is more than £3,890 or if they are not resident in the house.  The Minister should clarify &mdash; I presume life assurance benefits are not included &mdash; whether <Col N="1250" /> there will be an exemption for all bona fide family transfers of the house.</P>

      <P>Last week I outlined my concern at the implications for the provision for genuine refugees arising from the unrestricted entry provisions in the Bill.  The Minister indicated that the Department had consultations with a view to reviewing the situation.  Before the debate adjourned I had mentioned Deputy Carey's interest in refugees and complimented him on his attempts on their behalf.  Unfortunately, Deputy Carey misunderstood one of the points I made in relation to the cost implications of the provisions outlined in this Bill.  I was merely pointing out that unrestricted entry would have enormous cost implications for the State and would also reduce the amount of State provision for genuine refugees.  We all recognise that State provision must be made for them and that there is a need to update the procedures used in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the tribunal system has some merits.  I welcome that.  The greatest weakness in our system to date has been the doubt about whether people who entered the country were refugees and the fact that they were forced to leave the jurisdiction before it had been established independently and to the satisfaction of people who have taken an interest in the case, that they were not refugees.  This points to the <Col N="1251" /> necessity for the tribunal system in the immediate short term.  Of course, any unilateral action by this country in relation to unrestrained access would be counter-productive and would have enormous social implications.</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy allow me to make my own speech?  Maybe I am like a red rag as she constantly interrupts me.</P>
      <P>This is a serious problem which affects peoples lives.  People like Deputy Shatter and I, who belong to a minority religion, realise what it is to be in a country where, irrespective of race, religion or creed, if one deserves an honour one gets it, but it behoves us not to forget minorities who are persecuted in other parts of the world.  We must care for such people. The Minister has applauded the spirit of Deputy Shatter's Bill.  If the Bill has succeeded in doing anything it has hastened the introduction of legislation from this Government, which was outlined in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regardless of whether it is deserved, the perception of the Department of Justice is that it is unsympathetic to foreigners. Over the years I made representations to the Department on behalf of people from Libya, Sudan and Pakistan and I was disappointed not to get a response from it.  I made representations once on behalf of a Pakistani lady who was attempting to get her husband into Ireland.  I got no response despite further representations and, finally, one day the lady showed me a letter sent to her husband by a Member of the British House of Commons from the Irish Ambassador to the Court of St. James stating that the Department of Justice had refused a visa to her husband <Col N="1253" /> to come to Ireland.  I was furious and wrote to the Secretary of the Department of Justice stating it was obvious that the Department paid more attention to Members of a foreign Parliament than to Members of our Parliament and that whereas the British MPs' queries were answered, I had been ignored.  I got a letter of apology and the lady got her visa.  It indicated that it was a stroke of good fortune for her that things had happened that way and that the Department has the capacity to make decisions, apparently on no basis other than the humour of the person on a particular day.</P>
    <P>With regard to a lady from South Africa who had been living here for eight years, her file got lost.  She had made representations to the Aliens department where, according to her, she had been treated with great indifference and a lack of understanding and warmth.  The case was reopened and a new file prepared but I did not hear whether that person was granted Irish citizenship.  I assume she is a naturalised Irish citizen.</P>
    <P>The number of foreigners allowed to remain here is growing and one wonders whether it is because they have money. Obviously the State is much more sympathetic to people who can support themselves and, therefore, will not be a burden on the State.  It is well known that many people who come here are put into prison.  If somebody arrives with forged documentation or attempts to deceive officials here I agree they cannot be accepted as a refugee in the true sense of the word.  If people disembark at Shannon or Dublin Airport and plead asylum for fear of being executed or put in prison if they return to their own country they must not be put in prison.  Of course it is different if they are illegal, have been caught with forged documentation and are making a plea to the courts, I would not argue that case. However, we must create new perceptions. The feeling is that the Department of Justice is a state within a state, that, irrespective of what Members of this House say or do, it does not really matter.  One gets the feeling that even Ministers of the day are limited in what <Col N="1254" /> they can do within their own Departments.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when we are on other business but not on this Bill because it is not funny for people who are trying to get to this country to escape the horror of war.  It is not the intention that anybody who is not a refugee would be allowed in.  I have a jaundiced view of how the United Nations High Commission for Refugees applies the laws.  A Palestinian who has been in Ireland for more than five or six years called on me and was seeking Irish citizenship.  Under a United Nations resolution these people cannot be naturalised by any other country because the people who vote for this <Col N="1255" /> resolution each year want them to be political pawns.  The United Nations has much to answer for in that regard and many of their decisions are political. Where a person has been allowed to live in a country for more than five years he or she should be accepted as a naturalised citizen.  I am not saying Ireland should open the floodgates and allow thousands of people in when we already have in excess of 250,000 people unemployed. Unfortunately we cannot do that.</P>
      <P>The generosity of the Irish people was demonstrated recently in their desire to welcome the children of refugees from countries where there is so-called ethnic cleansing.  I hope something will be done soon to allow these people to move to countries where they can be with their families.</P>
      <P>Deputies who have not done so should read <i>Ireland 1939-1989</i> by Professor Dermot Keogh which deals with emigration and the acceptance or non-acceptance of refugees to this country and in which he outlines some grave injustices.  I hope when a book is written on <i>Ireland 1989-2039</i> that similar injustices will not be listed.</P>
      <P>I am glad that this Bill is before the House and that the Government has taken it seriously.  I compliment the Minister on her intention to introduce a Bill, following consultation with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, containing similar provisions to those in Deputy Shatter's Bill.  I am sure Deputy Shatter is not too vain to accept it may be possible to improve on this Bill in the interest of humanity.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to interrupt Deputy Briscoe in a malicous way, <Col N="1256" /> I merely wanted to give him an opportunity to tell us that he would support this Bill because his contribution was positive.  It is reprehensible that the reasons advanced by the Minister and other spokespersons for the Government for not supporting this Bill are that it contains flaws and inadequacies and does not go far enough.  This Bill is not being accepted because it was brought forward by a member of the Opposition.  The Minister put forward the case that it was not the practice to accept Bills from the Opposition.  That is blatantly untrue because Deputy Shatter &mdash; as Deputy Briscoe said &mdash; has had the honour of having two of his Bills accepted by this House &mdash; the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, and the Adoption Act, 1991.  Therefore, a precedent has already been set.  If the Government is committed to the refugee problem as stated in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997</i> as follows: &ldquo;Our policy towards treatment of refugees, asylum seekers and immigrants will meet the highest international standards.  Procedures will be introduced to guarantee rights of hearings, appeal, access to legal advice and access to the courts;&rdquo; why will it not accept this Bill, allow it to go before the new Select Committee on Legislation and Security and bring forward the necessary amendments to improve it?</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter is willing to accept amendments which the Minister and her Department officials advise are required. This Bill will be voted down by the very people who gathered in the National Concert Hall and elsewhere to endorse this programme.  If I were a Labour or a Fianna Fáil Deputy I would hang my head in shame if I spoke against this Bill.  Last week Deputy Derek McDowell questioned why he should not be able to vote for this Bill.  I find it reprehensible that in the past week the Government has not found the generosity of spirit to accept this Bill and vote for it tomorrow night.  Let the Government put in amendments, but vote for it.  Are we not lightening their workload by having this Bill framed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1257" /> The 1951 UN Convention binds Ireland to fulfil all the obligations and duties, and the Minister said in 1990, in answer to a Dáil question put by me that legislation was not required.  Last week this Minister appeared to be saying that legislation may well be required but she has given no commitment in regard to it.</P>
    <P>The Minister said: &ldquo;My approach to this review will be guided by humanitarian considerations and the House can be assured that I will take whatever steps are necessary, including any necessary legislation.&rdquo; It is clear that since 1990 the advice has been that in order to fulfil our duties and obligations under the UN Convention legislation is required.</P>
    <P>If, as the Minister appeared to say, all that Deputy Shatter is looking for are in place, why was it necessary to put into the Programme for Government that procedures will be introduced to guarantee rights of hearing, appeal, access to legal advice and access to courts?  If they are in place and working well, why is the Minister condemning the Opposition for daring to cast aspersions on officials in Shannon and elsewhere?  If they are in place why was it necessary to put that statement into the Programme for Government?  It is because the procedures are not working effectively.  Why must Deputies receive heartbreaking letters from the public after they have watched programmes about refugees coming to Ireland?  The following quotation is from a letter sent by an elderly woman in County Galway:</P>
    <P>These are strangers in a strange land. At the best of times that is a little scarey.  But on top of it, they are alone, knowing no one, no family.</P>
    <P>And this is the strange land &mdash; a land where hospitality is in our very soul's fibres and these strangers are left for months and years to feed on their very real fears and nightmares, and are totally at our mercy.  They have nothing, are allowed to go nowhere, are treated like criminals.  What are we becoming?</P>
    <P>That is a cry from the heart of an elderly woman in Galway who was moved to write that letter after she watched <Col N="1258" />&ldquo;Wednesday Report&rdquo; about refugees who are awaiting word from our Department. If the system is working as well as the Minister tries to tell us it is, why do people have to write letters like that? Why are they ashamed to be Irish, ashamed of the way we are treating people who are looking for asylum?</P>
    <P>We are two-faced in our attitude to applicants for refugee asylum.  Members of the Government go on deputations to the United States and get down on bended knees to various Senators and to Presidents to beg and cajole them to make our citizens legal in their country, to allocate a special quota and allow them to have the right of American citizenship. We do that every year and we have been successful.  We have received great co-operation from the Americans with regard to Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>It is not, as Deputy Killeen implied, that hundreds of people are applying to Ireland for refugee asylum.  The number involved each year is small, about 50. That does not represent a deluge or huge procession.  What results come from those applications?  I should like to refer to some of the figures provided in answer to parliamentary questions in November 1990.  The number of applications for asylum in 1986 was 19 and the number granted was four.  The number of applications in 1987 was 50 and &mdash; for some reason that year was a good year &mdash; 15 were granted.  The number of applications in 1988 was 49 and two were granted.  In 1989 36 applied and one was granted.  In 1990 48 applied and none were granted.</P>
    <P>Instead we have the shame of newspaper stories and television programmes about people who have been prosecuted in other countries because of their political or religious beliefs.  When they come here we put them in prison taking up places that are badly needed for real criminals.  We subject them to the indignity of locking them away as if they were criminals.  They are totally dependent on the goodwill of an individual or small group of people who espouse their cause and highlight it in a way that brings shame <Col N="1259" /> on us.  Deputies have often had to raise the matter in the House.</P>
    <P>The attitude tonight is, at best, sad. At worst I sense elements of racism and xenophobia; we do not want to open our doors.  I understand that on a television programme last night, which I did not see, the spokesperson for Fianna Fáil implied that if we did open our doors to a number of these applicants we might have to look after them, provide some resources for them; God forbid, we might even have to house them and maybe pay them social welfare.  That person wondered if we have not got enough to look after our own.</P>
    <P>Do Deputies realise from whence many of these refugee asylum seekers come?  They come from countries where there are no human rights, no facilities to express oneself publicly or to have political views that differ from those of the Government in power.  We say to them that we do not want anybody except good, clean Irish people in Ireland and that we have enough to do to look after our own.  One has to weigh up what we do with regard to granting asylum against the generosity of countries whose <i>percapita</i> income is something like 200 dollars a year, like Zambia or Malawi in Africa.  In Malawi alone they have given refuge, resources, food and so on to more than one million refugees from Mozambique. I visited the refugee camps in Zambia.  That country is bowed down with economic problems and huge unemployment. They have hundreds of thousands of refugees from neighbouring countries and are giving them help.  They are giving them food when they hardly have enough for their own people.  They welcome the refugees with open arms and allow them live in Zambia for years. Those refugees cannot return to their own countries.  They do not necessarily have to go through a legal process but they are given refuge.  What do we do? We put them inside a jail or inside a plane as soon as they land in Shannon.  Within hours most of them are back on the plane.</P>
    <P>I accept, as the Minister rightly pointed out, that some people seeking asylum <Col N="1260" /> were clearly not asylum seekers and should not be allowed in.  Our procedures should sort out those applications, but we should not condemn all asylum seekers as not genuine.  If the procedures are working, as the Minister said, why are these people here illegally hiding in the houses of generous Irish people from the State as if they were common criminals? Months, and sometimes years, later they are told to leave.  I remember highlighting a case of two young Ethiopian women &mdash; I put down a Dáil Question about them &mdash; who after being a year and a half hiding in Ireland &mdash; were afraid of being stopped on the street and questioned about whether they had any right to be here.  They were terrified and that was 18 months after they had made their application for asylum.  The Minister, Deputy Burke, gave me a one line reply to my question, that their cases was under investigation.  Are they the procedures we boast about or that the Minister boasted about last week?  After 18 months two young women under 25 years of age who had to flee their own country because of fear of death and persecution were told that their case was still under investigation.  We must accept responsibility and face up to what we should be doing.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the necessary legislation would be introduced but she made no promises.  On 8 March 1991 there was a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> by the diplomatic correspondent.  Colm Boland, of a meeting between the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke, and Mr. Frank Krenz, the new representative for the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.  Mr. Krenz had already presented his credentials to the then Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Calleary.  The report stated:</P>
    <P>Mr. Krenz said yesterday, that while Ireland had signed and ratified the 1951 UN Convention on the Status of Refugees, no special legislation had been passed in this country or regulations made to implement its provisions, as <Col N="1261" /> was the case in Britain and other European countries.</P>
    <P>Mr. Krenz said that while he would not say the matter was dealt with in an arbitrary manner, it seemed to remain &ldquo;a discretionary thing&rdquo; in the hands of the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks to remove that discretionary element in regard to asylum seekers from the Minister for Justice and place it on a statutory basis so that the Minister will not be open to criticism about refugees and asylum seekers not being treated properly.</P>
    <P>The report goes on:</P>
    <P>He would like Irish regulations to provide formal procedures to deal with people who present themselves as refugees from persecution on political, religious or racial grounds.  People should be entitled to have an interpreter [for which provision is made in Deputy Shatter's Bill] and be informed of their right to legal representation [which is also provided for in Deputy Shatter's Bill].  There should also be some form of independent appeal system against the refusal of asylum and deportation.</P>
    <P>Again, this is provided for in Deputy Shatter's Bill.  The report goes on:</P>
    <P>A spokesman for the Department of Justice said that Mr. Burke's meeting with Mr. Krenz had been merely a courtesy call.  There had been some discussion concerning regulations about refugees.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice and her officials still seem to hold this view that somehow we can continue to hide behind a set of procedures that have given rise to the type of cases raised by the Minister of State and Deputies Carey, Briscoe and Killeen.  We should not have to raise those cases here if the procedures were working properly.</P>

      <P>I want a firm commmitment from the Minister that we will play our part in giving asylum to not just single refugees who come here seeking asylum, but large groups of refugees, particularly from countries presently undergoing strife.  A country as small as Austria has approximately 100,000 Bosnian refugees on their soil and they have complaints. They are assisting those people.  We managed to take approximately 170 refugees last year and there was great fanfare and publicity given to it.  Shame on us, that is not much to do for people who are being persecuted and killed in their thousands.  I hope we can hold our head high in EC, Amnesty International and UN fora and say we are not found wanting in giving the kind of asylum requested by many people in this world.  I know it will be difficult for Deputy Kemmy, who is present tonight, to cross the floor and vote against this Bill.  I hope that by tomorrow night there may be a change of heart, but if there is not a total change of heart I would at least like to see a free vote for Government Deputies who wish to support the Bill.</P>

      <P>As stated by many Deputies, we are signatories to the United Nations Convention, 1951, but since we signed that Convention in 1951 we have done nothing legislatively to bring into effect the spirit in the letter of that Convention. For the first time in the law of this land Deputy Shatter's Bill set out to define a refugee.  This Bill would provide refugees with something to which they could clutch when appealing against expulsions and from which their advocates in court could cite as being part of the law.  The Bill deals with a basic issue of human rights and this country prides itself on its reputation in the area of human rights. We are certainly sullying our reputation by what has taken place in this House in the past couple of weeks.  I do not know how Members of the Labour Party, especially the chairman of that party, who is present tonight and has a good record on issues of human rights, will be able in conscience to vote against this Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Amnesty International has been very active in this whole area, not just here but worldwide.  That organisation has set down approximately ten fundamental principles in relation to asylum seekers which any civilised Government should have on its Statute Book.  It recommends that all asylum seekers, in whatever manner they arrive within the jurisdiction of a State, must be referred to the body responsible for deciding on claims for asylum.  How do we measure up in that regard?  The body with which asylum seekers come into contact here is the officials of the Department of Justice.  I do not wish to be critical of the officials <Col N="1264" /> in that Department but they are not trained to deal with refugees and asylum seekers.  They usually&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is impossible not to refer to the people who deal with refugees and I believe it is within the rules of this House that I should make that point. However, I would like to put on record that the blame for those problems rests with the Minister.  The personnel designated to deal with refugees and asylum seekers are not in a position to do so. Generally speaking, they may not know the language or political background of such refugees or asylum seekers, but that is not their fault.  Since 1978 a number of people have come here from Sri Lanka and no official of the Department could be expected to be <i>au fait</i> with a minority world language such as that spoken by Tamils or Sinhales.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I hold the Minister fully responsible and I have gone out of my way to make that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amnesty International says that the <Col N="1265" /> body responsible for deciding on claims for asylum must be an independent and specialised authority whose sole and exclusive responsibility should be to examine and make decisions on asylum claims.  I do not wish to incur your wrath, Sir, but we fail totally in that regard.  We do not have an independent body to deal with asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>Amnesty International makes the point that the decision makers of that independent body must have expertise in international refugee law and international human rights law.  Their status and tenure should afford the strongest possible guarantees of their competence, impartiality and independence.  How do we measure up on that?  I suggest we do not measure up at all.  Amnesty International makes the point also that the decision makers of that independent body must be provided with the services of a documentation office whose task should be to impartially collect and provide them with objective and independent information on the human rights situation in the asylum seekers' countries of origin or any country to which they might be sent.  How do we measure up on that?  The Minister knows we do not measure up in this regard at all.</P>
    <P>In order to obtain additional information on some of these points I telephoned the Department of Foreign Affairs today where I was dealt with politely. I was informed that its role in the refugees/asylum area involved dealing with refugees who come here following a Government decision &mdash; for example, the Bosnian refugees referred to by Deputy Owen.  I was given any information I needed in relation to them, but in regard to the 40, 50 or 60 single asylum seekers or refugees who arrive here on an annual basis they are dealt with by the aliens section of the Department of Justice.  I was told to contact the Department of Justice.  I rang the Minister's office and was very politely received by the Minister's private secretary or somebody working with the Minister's private secretary. I stated my business &mdash; that was probably foolish of me &mdash; that I intended to speak to this motion this evening.  A <Col N="1266" /> silence ensued during which time somebody was sought to advise me.  Approximately three minutes later the speaker returned to me that they were very sorry but that nobody was available to speak to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reluctant to make that complaint but that has been my experience today and I consider it to be of serious enough import to raise it in this House tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amnesty International make the point that all asylum seekers must benefit at all stages of the procedure from the right to legal counsel and interpreters, and the right to have contact and to have access <Col N="1267" /> to the UNHCR.  That is simply not so. We do not afford those rights to such persons entering this country.  This is another of the fundamental principles laid down by Amnesty International &mdash; the people in the best position to know about this issue &mdash; in regard to which we are found wanting and are utterly condemned.</P>
    <P>Amnesty International state that asylum claims should be examined at first instance through a personal appearance by every asylum seeker before the decision makers of the independent body where there would be a thorough examination of the circumstances of each case. If I may return to what I said earlier, a person here is interviewed by an immigration officer who takes notes from an asylum seeker.  I understand the immigration officer returns his notes to an official in the Department of Justice. Based upon those notes, and in the absence of a personal appearance before him by the asylum seeker, the decision is taken by the Minister, who willingly, and I am sure on many occasions gleefully, signs the order refusing the person admittance to this country.  It appears that in 95 per cent of cases his decision is that the person may not be admitted here. In relation to the fundamental principles laid down for dealing with such people, it is a great pity that such a gap exists between what we give lip service to as being desirable and what in fact we do.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the reply to a Dáil question given to me and my colleague, Deputy Shatter, on 17 February 1993 in which we asked when the Minister for Justice would introduce the necessary legislation to ensure the application of fair procedures for persons seeking asylum here.  The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>The 1985 agreement with the UNHCR provides for the following: (a) asylum seekers will not be refused entry or removed from the State until they are given an opportunity to present a case fully;</P>
    <P>That is simply not so.  The Minister goes <Col N="1268" /> on to say that every application is examined in accordance with the 1951 UN Convention.  How could they be examined in accordance with the 1951 UN Convention when we do not have the legislative procedures here to examine them?  The Minister goes on to state:</P>
    <P>This does not prevent humanitarian considerations being considered which might justify permission to remain in the State.  I know of very few cases where that applies.  Every facility, including interpreters where possible [That is a nice qualification on the Minister's part] is provided to help an applicant in making a case.</P>
    <P>That is patently untrue.  The Minister makes the point of the need for confidentiality and privacy and that is given a high priority.  I cannot comment fully on that.</P>

      <P>Yes, I am sure there will be a lot of privacy in prison.  The Minister continues:</P>
      <P>An applicant is informed that he may contact UNHCR or its local representative.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, we do not have a local representative of the UNHCR.  If my information is correct the closest one to us is in London.  Therefore, an unfortunate person who may not even speak our language will be told by someone speaking in English that he or she can contact the UNHCR 500 or 700 miles away, depending on whether one is in Dublin or Shannon.  The difficulty is obvious.  Therefore, there is hypocrisy, as well as misleading information in the Minister's reply.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for his opportunity to speak on the Government's policy in relation to refugees and asylum seekers.  I want to emphasise, as the Minister for Justice did in her response last Wednesday to Deputy Shatter's Bill, that the Government fully supports the spirit and thrust of the Bill.  It is the Government's policy to ensure that those who are entitled to recognition as refugees are granted such recognition in accordance with our obligations under the 1951 UN Convention on the Status of Refugees.  It has always been the Government's policy to adopt a positive approach in considering applications for refugees status and the issue now is what we can do to improve the arrangements for dealing with these cases.  It is manifestly right that arrangements like these, which affect people's rights in a very real and significant way, should be subjected to review to ensure that they are characterised by efficiency and humanity and, of course, that they meet international norms.</P>

    <P>The House will be aware of the commitments contained in the Programme for Partnership in Government in relation to refugees and asylum seekers and the Minister for Justice has already <Col N="1270" /> confirmed that she will be taking whatever action may be appropriate, including any necessary legislation, in order to meet those commitments.</P>
    <P>There is one point I would also like to emphasise at this stage.  This is a point which has been made by the Minister but which tends to be lost sight of again as the debate progresses.  There are procedures already in existence for dealing with applications for refugee status.  These procedures have been in existence since 1985 when a formal agreement was drawn up between the Department of Justice on the one hand and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees on the other.  The important point to note is that last July the Supreme Court held that this agreement, which provides for facilities for asylum seekers to make their case and for examination of such cases by appropriate officials, was enforceable in Irish law.</P>
    <P>These procedures, as the Minister has already informed the House, are very specific and extensive.  They provide for every aspect of the arrangements for dealing with applications for refugee status from initial stage of the application, which is usually made to an immigration officer on arrival, to the stage where an applicant is recognised, or not, as a refugee and is informed accordingly.</P>
    <P>The key-element in the whole procedure, of course, is that each and every application is referred to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. They are the experts in this area and they are effectively, the decision-making body in so far as the State is concerned as to whether an applicant qualifies for refugee status in accordance with the 1951 UN Convention on the Status of Refugees. The Department of Foreign Affairs is also consulted.  It is a fact that no Minister for Justice, from either side of the House, has ever disagreed with the opinion of the UN High Commission for Refugees where it has been their view that an applicant is entitled to refugee status.  Every decision in real terms is made by the Minister for Justice personally, who relies heavily on the advice of the UN <Col N="1271" /> High Commission in order to come to a decision.</P>
    <P>I am not repeating this point in order to give the impression that there is nothing that requires examination.  I am repeating it because I believe it is important that people who may need to avail of the procedures would be left in no doubt that they exist and are applied.  What Deputies are concerned about essentially &mdash; and it applies on this side of the House as much as on the other&mdash;is that we make the arrangements applying to refugees as fair and user friendly as possible and that we remove anxiety relating to their operation. Obviously, it is of no assistance to those concerned if they are left under their impression that there is no fairness and no procedures as things stand.</P>
    <P>I come back to the point that since the procedures have existed since 1985 it is necessary that each of them be considered in detail to ensure that they meet the needs of today.  To that end a comprehensive review is being carried out. This review will touch on every area covered by the procedures&mdash;from the training of immigration officers to ensure that the sensitive initial stage of dealing with applicants meets our objectives, to the final stage when an application has been successful and it is necessary to consider how best a refugee can be integrated into our society, if that is what he or she wants.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach to this review will be guided by humanitarian considerations with the primary purpose of ensuring that the State's obligations with regard to the rights of refugees are satisfactorily provided for to meet the needs of today.</P>
    <P>I think it would be helpful to the House if I were to specify particular improvements which are being pursued in this matter because the House is clearly, and rightly, interested in positive action.  In the first place the Minister for Justice has already been in touch with the Garda authorities with regard to an examination of training needs to allow for the updating and preparation of a specific training programme for the Garda Síochána in the <Col N="1272" /> area of aliens controls generally.  The Minister has underlined her wish that specialised courses be further developed for immigration officers and gardaí employed on duties related to aliens as part of that programme and it is her intention that asylum procedures will feature prominently in any such training courses. The initial Garda response has been constructive and further discussions will be taking place in order to develop this area further.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Minister for Justice has also been in touch with her colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, with a view to ensuring that persons effectively granted asylum here are assisted in whatever way possible to integrate into our society and that any barriers in their way to doing so are removed.  It is the Minister's intention also that the terms of reference to the refugee agency, which is the agency founded by the State to assist with groups of refugees, be examined with a view to ensuring that there are no impediments in its way to assisting in individual cases. The agency was established primarily to assist with groups of refugees, such as the Vietnamese boat people and the displaced persons from the former Yugoslavia; but the Minister is of the view that perhaps more can be done to assist where necessary with individual cases which are not part of any group.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the Minister has decided to act on a specific matter she promised within the past week.  In her response last Wednesday the Minister referred to one important proposal in Deputy Shatter's Bill which does not feature in the existing procedures, the proposal for a refugee appeals tribunal.  The Minister emphasised her concern to ensure that whatever procedures are in existence are transparent and the subject of public satisfaction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>She indicated that she would be giving particular attention to that aspect of the matter and, having done so, it is her considered view that on <Col N="1273" /> balance there is a genuine need for an appeals mechanism in the procedures.</P>
      <P>With that in mind the Minister has asked me to say that it is her intention to appoint immediately a retired member of the Judiciary to act as a competent authority to deal with appeals against refusals to grant recognition of refugee status.  That appointment will be made in the next few days with a view to acting as an appeals authority pending the completion of the review of the existing procedures. The Minister does not wish to prejudge the outcome of that review and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;at this point envisages that the proposed appointment will be an interim one pending the formal establishment in the near future of a more defined forum for dealing with such appeals.</P>
      <P>It is the Government's overall intention that the outcome of the review of the general procedures will be in keeping with our respected traditions of social justice and human rights.  It will be guided by humanitarian considerations to ensure protection for the genuine refugee when he or she seeks sanctuary here.  It will of course also take account of the expert opinion of the UN High Commission for Refugees.</P>
      <P>Finally, while it is not directly related to the contents of the Bill currently before the House, there has been an important development in the whole area of non-Irish people who are resident here and persons who apply for refugee status which the House should know about.  The Government has decided to appoint an interdepartmental committee of senior officials who will examine policy and practices in these areas and who will make recommendations based on their findings.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I would like to acknowledge that the very best of motives motivated Deputy Shatter in putting forward this Bill.  I know the genuine sentiments that lie behind that action and behind the concerned and compassionate contributions which have been made from all sides of the House on this issue.</P>
      <P>The UN High Commission has very generously agreed to assist the Minister for Justice in the review of the existing procedures and that offer has been accepted.  Pending the completion of that review it would be somewhat unwise to proceed with legislation, especially until the Minister has the benefit of the expert advice offered by the UN High Commission. For that reason, and while fully accepting the principle and good intent of Deputy Shatter's Bill, the Government is opposing it.</P>
      <P>At this stage we will be opposing the Bill for the reasons we have outlined.  It is not that we are against the principle of the Bill but we will be taking the appropriate measures, including legislation if necessary, when we have concluded our review of the existing procedures with the assistance of the United Nations High Commission.</P>

I do not need much encouragement to speak on this issue.  I welcome Deputy Shatter's initiative.  This is not the first time I have said that in the House, as Deputy Shatter's two previous Bills made history. However, if Deputy Shatter were to say today is Tuesday that would not make it Wednesday or Thursday and if he introduces good legislation I would be the <Col N="1275" /> first Deputy to stand up in the Dáil and acknowledge and commend him for his work, and I do not need any help from anybody in that regard.  I am against play acting, histrionics and crocodile tears. They solve nothing.  Some Deputies have short memories.  Deputy Noonan was Minister for Justice when a substantial review of asylum seekers and refugees was undertaken here.  The legislation and procedures under which we are now working were introduced by Deputy Noonan eight years ago.</P>

      <P>I came here to give a reasoned account of my party's view on this issue and I do not welcome the heckling from Deputy Shatter as it spoils what I said earlier about him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a serious matter and should not be dealt with in a frivolous way.  I mentioned last week the pioneering work of Senator Neville in the Seanad on the issue of suicide.  His work there has been epoch-making and very important in regard to dealing with this issue.  Senator Neville dealt with the issue of suicide long before it was considered a major issue in this House.  I am against mischief making. I have some experience in relation to the issue of asylum seekers and refugees as I live in a city close to Shannon airport where many asylum seekers and refugees enter the country.  I am aware of the <Col N="1276" /> problems of those who seek refuge in our country.  The world is an unsettled place and man's inhumanity to man does not stop in one country; unfortunately, it extends around the world.  Deputy Briscoe, who is here tonight, could speak at some length about the disgraceful treatment of people who tried to leave Hitler's Germany in the last world war.  They were the first boat people, of which I am aware, the boat people do not come just from Vietnam, but I will not go into that as it is a matter on which I could speak at length and it might not be relevant. This is a worldwide problem and does not relate just to one country.  Nobody can afford to be judgmental and throw stones in regard to that issue.  I have not come into the House tonight to do that.</P>
    <P>Hundreds of thousands of people are forced to leave their homes and countries every year.  This is an unhappy fact of life.  They are forced out for a variety of reasons &mdash; fear for their personal safety or that of their families, threats, intimidation, oppression, conflicts, civil wars, tribal wars, etc.  The fundamental rights of these people are trampled on and violated. I am not referring to people who leave their own countries to seek employment, they are economic refugees.  The other refugees flee their countries by land, sea and air, often at great personal risk to themselves and endure long, arduous and hazardous journeys.</P>
    <P>Apart from the Vietnamese refugees, an average of 50 refugees seek asylum here every year.  A person's right to asylum is set out in Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which has been quoted in the House this evening.  According to the 1951 Geneva Convention and the 1967 Protocol, an asylum seeker is a person who &ldquo;owing to a well founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a social group of political opinion is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country&rdquo;.  In addition to signing the 1951 Convention, this country has an informal agreement with the United Nations High <Col N="1277" /> Commission for Refugees on procedures to be followed in the event of a person claiming political asylum.  However, the 1951 Convention has no legal basis in Irish law and the informal agreement with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees is not always applied in a uniform or even handed way, as I can testify.  There is an urgent need for fair and just procedures which can be followed in the event of people seeking asylum here.  They must also be guaranteed access to legal advice and interpreters with proper experience.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to some of my experiences in this area.  Many refugees fly into Shannon Airport on Aeroflot flights. Events in Yugoslavia and Eastern Europe have led to an increase in the number of people seeking refuge in this country.  These people often end up in a Garda station or prison.  In more recent times they have been given refuge in houses in Ennis and Newmarket-on-Fergus, County Clare, where they are cared for by the Red Cross.  I commend Amnesty, who have contacted me on numerous occasions about these issues, for the work they have done.  This organisation works under difficult conditions and often has to deal with convoluted and complicated laws and procedures.  It provides legal advice for refugees; solicitors often travel from Dublin to Limerick to deal with these cases.  These solicitors have to try to overcome red tape and bureaucracy.  They have had meetings with public representatives, including Deputy Carey and me, on these issues.  Many telephone calls have been made to the Department of Justice, sometimes to no avail, as the people seeking asylum are sent home on the next flight.  These people work hard in difficult conditions.</P>
    <P>I also wish to pay tribute to the Red Cross which has engaged in fund raising activities and provided caring and compassionate homes for approximately 20 refugees in County Clare.</P>

      <P>I have first hand experience <Col N="1278" /> of the work carried out by these people in County Clare.</P>
      <P>I have met refugees, many of whom were confused and felt alienated and lonely. Anyone who has emigrated knows how difficult it is to adapt to life in a strange country.  Many of these refugees do not speak English, and they are often cold, hungry and disorientated.  I can give numerous examples of refugees from China, Sri Lanka and other countries who have sought asylum in this country. However, there is no point in going on at length about this issue.</P>
      <P>To me and my party the granting of asylum in another country is a fundamental human right.  There are many illegal Irish emigrants in America and we are not in any position to throw stones at anyone on his issue.  We have all sought at times to have legal status granted to our illegal emigrants in America and for them to be given green cards.  Some of us have assisted Irish people to emigrate to other countries, usually to America, to find employment.  Therefore, none of us is in a position to throw stones at any individual on this matter.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party has examined Deputy Shatter's Bill and we believe it goes a long way towards meeting the requirements in this area.  It is a practical Bill which could be improved with a few amendments.  This is a difficult and controversial time for my party and I am not here to hype the situation or to try to talk my way out of these difficulties.  By improving the Bill there would be a clearcut procedure on this issue, which is not the case at present.  I welcome the statements by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, and the Government's initiative in this area.  It is never too late to reach a compromise.  In the past previous Governments reached a compromise with the Opposition on two other Bills introduced by Deputy Shatter and I do not understand why the Minister cannot take on board some of the proposals in this Bill.  I believe that both sides of the House can reach a compromise on this Bill.</P>

We need to look beyond this House to the people whom we represent. We will achieve nothing by dividing on this Bill and I hope a compromise can be reached before the question is put tomorrow night.  It would be hypocritical for us to divide on this Bill and would achieve nothing.

      <P>It is timely that we are debating the law on asylum.  Even though we are a signatory to the 1951 UN Convention and the 1967 Protocol we have no formal legislation in this area.  The acceptance of this Bill would be the first step in enshrining the provisions of the Convention and Protocol into our domestic law.  The Irish section of Amnesty has been lobbying for many years for improved procedures for determining if people are refugees.  This Bill would enshrine improved procedures for the protection of refugees in Irish law.  The people who work in this area on a voluntary basis will be very disappointed if this initiative by Deputy Shatter is defeated in a vote tomorrow night.</P>
      <P>Many of our EC partners are in the process of harmonising the material law on asylum at present to comply with the Dublin and Schengen Conventions.  It is interesting to note that EC countries have decided not to do so within the existing EC framework, that the Commission, the European Parliament and the European Court of Justice do not play any role in the application of the treaties.  Because of the disparity between the definition of refugee within various countries perhaps the word &ldquo;unification&rdquo; might be more appropriate than &ldquo;harmonisation&rdquo;.  Perhaps at a later stage a common definition could be decided on by the European Court of Justice.</P>
      <P>The law on asylum in Ireland is undeveloped and successive Governments have been lethargic on this issue.  That is rather surprising since, if one examines the cases which have arisen here no reason is given for a positive or negative decision other than an applicant does or does not qualify as a refugee.  There are no court decisions touching on matters of the material law of asylum.  We need to tidy up our house and introduce well thought out legislation in this field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedures and criteria for the <Col N="1281" /> recognition of applicants as refugees, as laid down in the hard book of the united Nations High Commission on Refugees have never been formally adopted or rejected by our authorities.  However, there is some informal arrangement. Immigration officers have been furnished with guidelines based on that handbook. Those guidelines are secret, obsessively so.  That is a feature of the law on asylum in Ireland, a common feature of anything to do with asylum matters and refugees. It is surprising that documents concerning asylum law are so secret since, of its nature, asylum law is a public matter and the doctrine outlining the concept of asylum and court decisions thereon are not secret.  Since the countries party to the convention, including the Schengen and Dublin conventions, are democracies I cannot understand the obsessive secrecy which greets anybody who makes inquiries about asylum and, in particularly, refugee applications.  What lies behind the secrecy?  Is it racism or just administrative laziness?  Is racism alive and well in this Chamber?</P>
    <P>The future of our asylum law in Europe should be the subject of public debate since it is impossible to discuss secrets. We must be more concerned to have a harmonised policy on asylum law.  It is not an exaggeration to say that Europe is in a state of flux in regard to the ever increasing number of refugees coming to Europe in addition to the biggest intra-European refugee problem.  The present position in former Yugoslavia is one which, if the Vance-Owen proposals are accepted, could leave an estimated two million refugees.</P>
    <P>In the past we have been articulating strong views on the humanitarian aspects of the conflict in former Yugoslavia.  It is disingenuous of us to do so without having in place firm procedures or adopting a civilised approach to dealing with refugees from that conflict.  If we were truly part of the community of nations to which we devote much rhetoric, we must do more than talk.</P>
    <P>Until this evening I had been disappointed with the quality of ministerial response to Deputy Shatter's Bill, despite <Col N="1282" /> a commitment in the Programme for Government to introduce improved procedures. However, until this evening there had been no indication of any substantive improvement in the measures to be brought forward by the Government. I am delighted to note there has been some move in that respect.  Hopefully a compromise will be reached before tomorrow evening.  I would prefer if we did not have to divide on this issue.  This is a humanitarian issue.</P>
    <P>I commend Deputy Shatter on introducing the Bill.  Indeed, some Fianna Fáil members who spoke last week adopted a worrying attitude.  One of them said that were we to improve our procedures it would draw more refugees on us.  That seemed an extraordinarily xenophobic, possibly racist attitude to adopt.  We must question our credentials on racism.  There is no better forum in which to have an airing of those issues than this House. That is why it is good that Deputy Shatter introduced this Bill.</P>
    <P>I predict that in Europe there will be a harmonisation process upward rather than downward.  If the definition of asylum in Europe is to become more liberal it follows that it cannot be more restrictive.  Of course, this would be easier in some countries than others.  For example, the German position is quite complicated because they have a constitutional provision, but we must put our own house in order.</P>
    <P>I am glad I prepared some criticisms of Deputy Shatter's Bill because they may be incorporated in amendments which would be good news.  My first and major concern about the Bill is that it does not say that those who seek asylum should not be detained pending the outcome of their application.  In other words there should be a provision to the effect that, except in exceptional circumstances, an applicant should not be deprived of liberty pending the outcome of an application. I do not know why such a provision was omitted.  Second, we should stipulate the method of informing an applicant of the outcome of his or her application.  At present, negative or positive decisions are never given in any substantive <Col N="1283" /> way but rather by a mere one line statement stipulating that an applicant had or had not made the grade.  Such decisions should be spelled out in detail. That is even more important in the context of the proposed appeals tribunal.</P>
    <P>The Schengen and Dublin Conventions have not been referred to in the Bill, something that will have to be remedied.  Perhaps one of reasons we receive such a small number of applications is our isolated geographic location.  It is quite difficult to reach our shores to make an application for asylum. Perhaps we should be moving towards accepting an application from a person to one of our embassies in a third State. While that may be somewhat radical, we should be adopting a more generous attitude towards refugees rather than just doing the minimum.  There may have been some pessimism about the establishment of an appeals tribunal to cater for such a small number of applicants but the paucity of applications should not be advanced as a reason for not putting in place good, fair and sensible procedures, particularly in a modern democracy. Indeed, the fact that we receive so few applications should mean that we should be more generous; that, as Deputy Owen said, like Denmark and Austria in the past, we should accept special categories of refugees, such as handicapped refugees or those coming from camps in various parts of the world.</P>
    <P>One of the provisions of the Bill relates to the quality of advice given refugees when they make application for asylum. It is essential that such advice be given them before being interviewed by an immigration official.  Often the refugee is so disorientated, alienated and terrified, that he or she will make prejudicial statements to an immigration officer before being given an opportunity to obtain proper legal advice.  Any such advice should be given them before they are interviewed by an immigration officer.</P>
    <P>This Bill deserves the support of all Members.  We have heard of horrific stories resulting from our present bad procedures.  I shall be delighted if the <Col N="1284" /> compromise suggested is reached this evening.  I commend the Minister on agreeing to review existing procedures and examine the terms of reference of the Refugee Agency, the agency founded by the State to assist groups of refugees. There is no substitute for good law passed by this House.  That is what we as legislators are here for.  Rather than reviewing bad procedures we should enact a new law of which we can all be proud.</P>

      <P>This is very much a human rights issue, as many Members said.  I congratulate Deputy Shatter sincerely on introducing this Bill.  Deputies Shatter and Michael McDowell have produced more new Bills than have the Government in the term of this 27th Dáil. This is a good Bill which could be improved, along the lines suggested by Deputy O'Donnell, when it is dealt with by a special committee.</P>
      <P>What I found interesting about the contributions made by the Minister for Justice last week and by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, this evening is that they want the present situation to continue, that is, where there are no proper statutory procedures in place for dealing with asylum seekers.  The Department of Justice and the political heads of that Department want it to continue so that we can avoid our responsibilities, not just to ourselves but to the international world.  If we did not adopt basic judicial procedures from the British when we gained our independence I suspect that today Ministers would justify making judicial decisions, which are now made in public on the basis of fairness, behind closed doors by officials and politicians. Why is it that matters that should be decided in a proper judicial way always remain in the case of asylum seekers, with officials and politicians?  I do not believe this is good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State spoke tonight about the need to make the procedures user friendly.  I support that concept and wish to highlight one particular case where I met the individual concerned, Marey Al Gutrani, a Libyan national who left Libya in 1982 because he was going <Col N="1285" /> to be conscripted into the Libyan Army to fight in the Chad war.  He fled the country and come to Ireland on a visa to study English.  Luckily, he came from a well off family who could afford to support him.  In 1985, his application to have his visa renewed was refused and he went into hiding because he feared he would be sent back to Libya.  Indeed, many other young people who fled to Europe at the same time have since been assassinated. However he was picked up by the police in 1991 and sent to Mountjoy Prison and then to Wheatfield Prison for 18 months where he was placed with sex offenders who frequently beat him up because he was different.  He was treated disgracefully and it was only when a solicitor took a successful case to the High Court that he was released from prison.  The deciding judge said that the man was being released because &ldquo;his continued incarceration was unreasonable, unfair and unjust&rdquo;.  However that man is still being refused asylum even though we all know that if he is returned to Libya, a corrupt state, at the very minimum he would be imprisoned and probably tortured.  He has not had any contact with his family for a considerable length of time and because they were threatened he does not know where they may be or even if they are alive.</P>
    <P>If there was ever a case where a Minister for Justice, on humanitarian grounds, could show that we want to make the procedures user friendly this is it.  I do not know the reason an ordinary, decent young man was placed in jail when so many criminals are walking the streets of this country because there is no place to put them.  It is an absolute disgrace. Our extradition laws are so out of date that we will not send people to our neighbouring jurisdiction to face a fair trial where they are wanted in connection with serious crimes, yet we will place in prison or send back to corrupt jurisdictions people such as the one I speak of.</P>
    <P>The reason that person is not being granted asylum is that he is not on a hit list.  Does anyone seriously believe that Gadaffi is going to put that man's name on a hit list?  Obviously if that were to <Col N="1286" /> happen he would never be sent back. Recently the Department of Justice tried to send him to Egypt or Malta, neighbouring jurisdictions, and if it was not for the efforts of the Irish Refugee Council that attempt would have been successful.</P>
    <P>If the Minister of State is genuine when he says that there is a need to make the procedure user friendly this is one humanitarian case.  I know of the group that is working for the person in question. They are ordinary reasonable people and they have no other motivation than to highlight and have brought to an end the injustice and the dreadful way in which this young man, a decent person, has been treated.</P>
    <P>I feel passionately about this case, I have met the person concerned and I know of the group.  I have tried to raise the case in the Dáil in other ways but have been told that the Minister has no function in the matter or that it is a matter for the courts.  I am fed up trying to raise the issue in a fair way.  If we are serious &mdash; to quote the Minister's words &mdash; about accepting the spirit and the thrust of Deputy Shatter's Bill, I could think of no better example than this one.</P>
    <P>We have an outstanding reputation internationally when it comes to being concerned and compassionate.  Our religious and many of our volunteers go to third world countries where they work to ease the plight of under-privileged and starving peoples.  This reputation is well merited when we consider the role which has been played by volunteers internationally but there must be a question mark over that reputation when we consider what happens to the tiny number of people who seek political asylum here. Deputy Kemmy has told us that there are about 50 such applications per year but let us consider the number that have been granted.  One person was granted asylum in 1991, one in 1990, one in 1989 and two in 1988, a total of five people in five years.  This is a shameful record given the torture and corruption taking place in the world and the tiny number of people who seek to come to this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State's commitment to set up an appeals procedure <Col N="1287" /> but he is not going far enough.  We do not know what the procedures are.  Deputy O'Donnell mentioned that there is secrecy; even when people are refused they are not given genuine reasons.  All they are told is that they are not at risk.  Last week the Minister said here that no one at risk has ever been sent back but I would challenge that statement.  In 1990, six Sri Lankans were sent to India, one of whom has been sent back to Sri Lanka since.  We take a conservative view when it comes to deciding which people are at risk.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Shatter said last week, what he is seeking to do is to include in Irish law the spirit and thrust of the UN Conventions. The United Nations was established to rescue the world from the horrors and the fall-out of war, to seek political consensus in trying to deal with many of these problems, torture, persecuction and so on.  If we want to remain genuine members of the United Nations. we owe it to that body to include in Irish law the substance of those Coventions and not try to have it every way which is what we often do in this country.  We ratify Conventions but they are never put into effect in Irish law.  This is a disgrace. We try to keep our heads down internationally, not draw attention to ourselves and pretend that we are fulfilling our obligations to the wider world.</P>
    <P>Deputy Owen referred to the responsibilities of other small countries and the role played by the Austrians.  On some occasions, in regard to the Vietnamese and Bosnians, for instance, we have been generous but we have made great play of that &mdash; the Minister of the day was there to welcome those concerned.  All we are asking is for a fair system to be put in place so that political asylum is granted in genuine cases and to those who have suffered, perhaps tortured in the way that Brian Keenan and John McCarthy were. In the case of John McCarthy we heard him recently on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; describe the torture he and other captives were subjected to.  Is it unreasonable to ask that a country such as this should give asylum to people who are tortured but <Col N="1288" /> who succeed in fleeing their countries?  It is not easy for them to do so given that very often they leave families and friends behind and leave only in difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is often said in relation to moral issues that if we change the law the floodgates will be opened; this is often an Irish excuse for doing nothing.  If thousands of people were arriving at Shannon Airport I would respect and understand the Government's attitude but that is not the case, only 40 or 50 per year come to this jurisdiction.  This may be because of our reputation internationally or because they do not get a chance to come here, by reason, as Deputy O'Donnell said, of our peripheral location.  Surely, it is not unreasonable to ask that we be sympathetic, on humanitarian grounds, and grant asylum to those people.</P>
    <P>Of all nations, the Irish people know how difficult it is when one is not recognised legally and one does not have proper rights in a foreign jurisdiction. Forty million Americans claim to be of Irish origin.  We are lucky that so many left the country when one considers the problems we would be confronted with now if they had all remained here.  We are great at going to the Brian Donnellys in the United States and to other politicians to beg that they give us more visas and green cards for our young people but we are found wanting when it comes to our responsibilities towards those most vulnerable of people who are being tortured, persecuted and frightened, people such as Marey Al Gutrani who is fleeing from Gadaffi &mdash; a gentleman this country should know a good deal about given his support for the Provisional IRA and whose activities have probably resulted in several people being killed and maimed on this island.  If there is anyone who deserves to be given asylum it is somebody who has stood up to Gadaffi and objected to conscientious reasons to joining his army and fighting Libya's poorer neighbour, Chad.</P>
    <P>I would like to make one last plea and it relates to the points made by Deputy Kemmy.  The Opposition cannot win this <Col N="1289" /> vote unless the Government changes its mind.  Great play was made of the fact that Deputy Shatter's Bill were accepted on previous occasions and that they were good Bills.  Those Bills dealt with the adoption of Romanian babies and with legal separation.  The only reason they were accepted was that the Government of the day would have been beaten.  Let us not be disingenuous about it.  There is no question of the present Government being beaten but if any issue transcends party political difference it is human rights, the human rights of the people we are talking about.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot be beaten but it can suffer a moral defeat on this very important issue.  The way one treats minorities and the way one treats the most vunerable like these 40 or 50 people, will be determined by the way we vote on this Bill tomorrow night.  I appeal to the Minister of State not to proceed by way of a formal vote and defeating this legislation, instead let us put it in Committee and improve on it if necessary.  For once and for all let us set up decent procedures to deal with these most vunerable people.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Compensation for Donegal Farmers.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The saga of the losses to farmers in Donegal last year came about as a result of a very late planting season and an extraordinary rainfall in the autumn when the crops, not just potatoes but cereal and flax, might have been harvested. Thanks to the advocacy of all our MEPs a motion was passed in the European Parliament last December and the Commissioner indicted that while there were no Community funds for such situations, it would be open to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to discuss the matter with the Commissioner. A sum of money was provided in the budget and this gave farmers great hope of speedy compensation.  We emphasised in December that those who had lost most would not be in a position <Col N="1290" /> to replant in the spring.  Indeed, some have not and will not because they did not have the wherewithal to do so.  Now, late though it may seem, an announcement has been made on the closing date for applications for aid for potato growers. There has been no mention of cereal or flax losses.  Our farmers must know whether the small farmer is eligible for this aid because if he is left out we will have lost the game.  The small farmers make up the backbone of the potato industry.  Despite adversity down through the years they still make up the backbone.  If it is true that farmers with under two acres in crop will not be recognised, I ask the Minister to vary the conditions, as he has the power to do.  A farmer who has lost one acre or one and a half acres is relatively worse off than a bigger farmer who may have lost 50 or 100 acres.  The smaller farmers is on his uppers, indeed, some have gone out of business because they could not get credit to buy either seed, fertilisers or anything else.</P>
      <P>This is the crux we find ourselves in.  I was assured before I came into the House that the story is that small farmers with under two acres will not be compensated. If that is the case I appeal again to the Minister to vary the terms and conditions, as he is empowered to do, and to ensure that all farmers who have lost crops will be treated equally relative to the amount of their loss.</P>
      <P>Let me draw the Minister's attention to the conditions laid down for ware potatoes losses because they are such that there might as well not be compensation. Ware potatoes must have been grown under seed production conditions, which means rotational propriety and inspections before the seeds are planted.  Why have ware if those conditions have to be applied?  Those who planted ware potatoes and lost them are just as badly off as everyone else.  The industry which has been on its knees will soon be out of existence.  Those few changes need to be made, but they would need to be made immediately to salvage what is left of the industry in Donegal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that the Minister for Finance has provided in the budget for expenditure of £1 million to assist potato growers in the Donegal region in overcoming the problems caused by the bad weather throughout the second half of 1992.  I have previously informed the House that I was seeking to have this £1 million augmented by appropriate EC funding.  The plight of these potato growers was conveyed to the EC Commission and their case has been pursued vigorously with the Commission since last December.  The Commission's initial response was that:</P>
      <P>There are only limited means available to the Commission in these circumstances and it was never the intention that Community funds be used to compensate for loss of income due to poor weather conditions.</P>
      <P>Although it has taken some time, considerable progress has been made since then in contacts with the Commission. We are now at the stage where the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry has advertised a scheme of financial aid.  Application forms have been distributed in the region and completed applications must reach the Department by 21 May.  When applications are to hand they will be verified from local departmental records, in so far as this is possible, and each application will be assessed, having regard, in particular, to an EC Commission condition that assistance must relate to the restoration of agricultural production potential.  In compliance with this condition, details of a scheme have been submitted to the Commission for approval and I would expect to have a response around the end of this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed scheme would apply to potato producers who grew upwards of two acres, seed and ware, in 1992.  It proposes to provide aid for the clearance of ground in respect of damaged 1992 crops; the cost of providing seed potatoes for the 1993 crops and interest on working capital for six months.  In addition, <Col N="1292" /> where affected producers are not growing potatoes in 1993, it is proposed to provide financial assistance towards the clearance of damaged 1992 seed and ware crops. The purpose of this latter aid is to clear the land of unharvested crops which would otherwise be a source of infestation, and could be damaging to the normally high plant health standards in the region.</P>
    <P>I hope that the EC-assisted scheme will be financed 75 per cent by the EC Commission, the remaining 25 per cent being funded by the national Exchequer from the £1 million budgetary allocation. As soon as clearance is received from the EC Commission details of the scheme will be announced.  It is my intention to make separate arrangements to use any balance of the one million pounds State money not used up in the national contribution to the EC-assisted scheme for the benefit of growers, particularly the seed potato growers affected.</P>
    <P>Growers of fibre flax and linseed have fully qualified for the EC aid in those sectors, with no penalty for reduced crop. In these circumstances the case made for special aid related only to the potato crop.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, assistance will be targeted towards commercial growers, that is those who planted at least two acres of potatoes in 1992.  Smaller growers would not have been as dependent on their potato crop and would have had an opportunity to harvest at least some of it.  Aid will be directed to those most severely affected.  For this reason also, and having regard to the comparatively small losses in cereals, aid will not be available to cereal growers under the EC-approved scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the father of the House has acknowledged that I remained seated in spite of his anxiety to come in again.  Having crossed swords on a number of occasions he expressed his dissatisfaction to me after the proceedings in the House had concluded and therefore I am most reluctant to become embroiled in any controversy concerning the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to address this matter and to the Minister for coming in to reply to what is a serious problem.  I am anxious in the few minutes available to me to raise four or five brief points on the need to upgrade the status of the ambulance service in the State.  I am aware that at present the Department of Health is conducting an ongoing review of this matter.  I hope the Minister will enlighten us as to when this review will be completed and the action, if any, he proposes to take in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need to seriously consider upgrading the status of an ambulance call from the present essential service call to that of emergency service call.  We all know that the designated emergency number, 999, is available to any member of the community who wishes to call an <Col N="1294" /> ambulance.  However, the response of ambulance personnel and paramedics is on many occasions not that expected of an emergency service.  There is no great difficulty during the day; the problem arises with calls for an ambulance between 1 a.m. and 8 a.m.  It is necessary for the member of the ambulance personnel who is on call to rise from his or her bed, report to the hospital, procure the ambulance and drive perhaps up to 40 miles or more to the scene of the emergency.  I hope some improvement can be made in this regard so that there will be an around-the-clock roster to deal with emergency calls, particularly in parts of the country with national primary routes.</P>
    <P>As regards the training for ambulance personnel, it is my understanding that there is not a rigid training regime whereby refresher courses or further training may be undertaken.  Perhaps the Minister would consider that matter.  I understand that three out of every four ambulance personnel receive no training whatever for an urgent cardiac call. There is need to upgrade the status of training in that regard.</P>
    <P>The physical state of many of our ambulances leaves a lot to be desired. Many of them have up to 200,000 miles on the clock and are in excess of ten years old.  I know there is some health board allocation for fleet replacement but an overall policy with a clearly defined framework is essential to ensure the safety of patients in an ambulance. Ambulance equipment is also a matter of concern and basic stocks such as pillows and sheets may not be readily available. Medical equipment, much of it essential, is lacking in many ambulances.  I hope that as a result of the review being undertaken by the Department the highest level of care and attention will be available to everybody irrespective of the part of the country from which they come.  The equipment in many rural ambulances, particularly in the Western Health Board and North-Western Health Board areas, is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>It is important that there be strict ruling on the question of ambulance personnel. <Col N="1295" /> At present the driver of an ambulance is accompanied by perhaps a hospital porter, a nurse or whoever is available at the time to go out on an emergency call. This is clearly insufficient because in many cases nurses are unable to perform the physical tasks of lifting a heavy patient by way of stretcher or otherwise.  A two man crew is needed in ambulances.</P>
    <P>My final point relates to Dublin where because there is no overall framework within which ambulances operate, there has been on occasion a duplication of ambulance calls, with two ambulances from different areas going to the same patient.  That underlines a lack of coordination and efficiency.  I hope the Minister addresses this problem by way of an overall national ambulance policy or a national ambulance authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I wish to thank Deputy Flanagan for raising this matter and for affording me the opportunity to explain the current position in relation to the provision of ambulance services nationally.  As Deputy Flanagan is well aware, arrangements for the provision of ambulance services in each health board region is a matter for the individual health board in the first instance.  Over the years significant improvements have been made, and continue to be made, by the health boards, with the assistance of my Department in the provision of these services.  However, in recent years the ambulance service at home and internationally has been going through a period of great change both operationally and technologically.  The importance of this vital service keeping abreast of these developments is certainly recognised by me.  In addition, the necessity to examine the role of our ambulance service in a changing society and how best that role can be fulfilled also requires careful examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is against this background of change that my Department, together with the health boards, is currently undertaking a major review of ambulance services nationally.  The review body is considering <Col N="1296" /> the nature and level of service required, concentrating on four main areas &mdash; communications; pre-hospital emergency cardiac care; organisation, management and training; and arrangements for the provision of ambulance services in the Dublin area.  These headings cover most of the points outlined by Deputy Flanagan and I will ensure that his points are taken into account.</P>
    <P>The review body consists of representatives from a number of Government Departments, from each of the health boards and local authorities, the ambulance service, the medical and nursing profession, Dublin fire brigade and the national ambulance training school. The review body has taken into account the views of all interested parties and wide-ranging discussions and consultations have been held.  Both written and oral submissions have been received by the body.  The work of the National Ambulance Review Body is nearing completion and the report will be pesented to me during the summer.  I look forward to considering the report and its recommendations as these will form the basis for the future national ambulance policy and will help to ensure the development of an ambulance service of which we can all be proud.</P>
    <P>The ambulance service has a very important role to play within the health services generally and ambulance personnel are at the forefront of providing care and assistance to the public.  We have a good service now but I am confident that this review will result in an even better service in the future for the people who really matter, the patients depending on the service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House tonight to deal with this matter.  Clonkeen national school is not destined to be closed or to lose a teacher in the foreseeable future.  There are 32 pupils attending this two teacher school.  Three children eligible for school transport will <Col N="1297" /> attend the school from September next. They could go to school now if the local community wanted to increase the numbers. Apart from them many other children will start school in September.</P>
      <P>Three children have been deemed to be ineligible for school transport under very peculiar circumstances.  According to CIE one child is .2 miles away from another school.  Another child deemed ineligible is from a family from which five children went to Clonkeen national school and were eligible for free transport. Indeed, the child who has now been deemed ineligible by Bus Éireann had free transport on a medical card for a period of four years.  Another child who will be ten on 18 June is qualified this term but has not been counted for the future.  On the minimum number of seven, Clonkeen national school qualifies for free transport, but it is obvious that under a minimum number of ten the school will not be entitled to free school transport from September.  The three new pupils could go to school at the moment if it would mean the restoration of school transport.  At the moment ten families are paying £7 per week to a local bus operator to bring the children to school.  The N22 national primary road is for three miles on either side of the school considered to be the most dangerous part of the road in County Kerry and the road is to be improved with the aid of EC Structural Funds.  Parents are threatening to withdraw the children from school and would have done so except for the advice of elected representatives and Members of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are pertinent questions to be answered on the withdrawal of school transport.  Why has Bus Éireann been measuring and remeasuring distances between houses and the school?  Why was it necessary to remeasure the distance between the homes of certain pupils and two schools over a weekend?  Why was such a determined effort made to take the school transport service from the children attending Clonkeen national school? Why is transport being taken from pupils whose older brothers and sisters got school transport to Clonkeen and why are <Col N="1298" /> they being told that they should attend another national school which is an equal distance away?  I hope the Minister will clarify these matters and will as a last resort take the matter up on a personal basis with the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward) Liam Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Leary for his ongoing contribution to this debate and for his unstinting efforts on behalf of the children and parents of Clonkeen national school.</P>
      <P>One of my areas of responsibility is to ensure the safe delivery of about 169,000 primary and post-primary pupils throughout the country.  I also have the responsibility of ensuring that the State gets the best possible value for the money it expends on the provision of this service. In the current year approximately £38 million will be spent on the provision of this service.</P>
      <P>As agents of the Minister for Education, Bus Éireann operates the primary school transport scheme.  That company assesses the eligibility of all children for school transport and organises the provision of school transport services for those who are eligible.  My Department does not make detailed arrangements on the ground.  Bus Éireann decide on the routes, set-down/pick-up points and the size of vehicles for all concerned, always bearing in mind the need for a cost-effective, efficient and safe service.</P>
      <P>In order to be eligible for primary school transport, children between the ages of four and ten must live at least two miles from the nearest suitable national school, as determined by the Department, while older children must live at least three miles away.  They must be attending that school and offering for transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the organisation of school transport services all routes are planned in such a way as to ensure that as far as possible every eligible pupil has a reasonable standard of service from the point of view of timetable and distance from the route, while at the same time ensuring that all <Col N="1299" /> vehicles are fully utilised in the most efficient manner.</P>
    <P>Under the rules of the primary school transport scheme there must be a sufficient number of children in a distinct locality attending their nearest suitable national school to ensure that the average daily number of eligible children conveyed each term is not less than ten in order to warrant the establishment, or retention, of a transport service to a national school.  A transport service may also be established, if it can be done within reasonable cost limits, where at least five eligible children from a distinct locality reside at least three miles from the school.</P>
    <P>The service to which the Deputy refers was established under the normal conditions of the primary school transport scheme.  However, Bus Éireann informed my Department, as they are obliged to do, that during the Christmas and Easter terms the number had dropped to six.  The chairperson of the board of management of Clonkeen national school was advised on 17 December 1992, and again on 23 March 1993, that the service would have to be withdrawn at the end of the Easter term.  My Department would have been prepared to retain the service had the average number of eligible pupils risen sufficiently in the meantime <Col N="1300" /> to warrant its retention. Unfortunately, that did not happen.</P>
    <P>In April, the chairperson sent to the Department a list of pupils whom he considered to be eligible.  When the list was examined it was found that, out of the 12 listed, five are ineligible.  Three of the five are closer to Glenflesk national school than to Clonkeen.  The other two are equidistant from Glenflesk and Clonkeen, but in each case are under two miles away from the schools.  A sixth child will be leaving school at the end of the current year.  Of the remaining six, only two live over three miles from Clonkeen national school.  I regret, therefore, that, under the terms of the scheme it is not open to the Department to restore the service to Clonkeen national school.</P>
    <P>I have explored every avenue open to me to try to resolve this problem.  If there is any change in the circumstances of the children attending Clonkeen national school, I will be prepared to have this case re-investigated.</P>

    <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government envisages the creation of a vigorous Third Banking Force from within the State sector by merging ICC Bank and ACC Bank, and by seeking a merger of the new entity with Trustee Savings Bank.  The Programme also <Col N="1069" /> raises the possibility of involvement with a major international bank.</P>
    <P>It is intended that this issue will be pursued by the Government as quickly as possible.  As a first step, officials of my Department have discussed it with the domestic financial institutions involved. These discussions were of an exploratory nature only and it would therefore be inappropriate to comment on them.  It must be appreciated that in-depth analyses are only at the initial stages and it will necessarily be some time yet before preliminary conclusions may be formulated.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 31, 45, 51, 61, 65 and 120 together.</P>
      <P>It has not proven necessary to conduct a study of the effect of stamp duties and other costs of buying and selling houses on labour mobility in Ireland.  Costs of moving home can, of course, be relevant to a person's decision about taking up employment in another location, whether that person is currently employed or unemployed.  As the question recognises, there are several elements to that cost, apart from stamp duty.  Stamp duty does not, of course, arise where the person is not a home-owner, and the exemption for new grant-size houses could substantially reduce this element of the cost of the new abode.</P>
      <P>Given the many situations where persons may move home for reasons associated with their employment, any relief of stamp duty would inevitably involve a significant cost.  I am not persuaded that this budgetary cost would be warranted purely in terms of facilitating geographical mobility.  Availability of personnel is not among the more serious problems facing prospective employers in Ireland.  I would point out that the World Competitiveness Report 1992 gave Ireland the best ranking out of the thirty-seven countries surveyed under the heading &ldquo;Ease of getting skilled labour&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It should be borne in mind, in any case, that reliefs in this area would necessarily involve higher taxes otherwise, which could well have a net adverse effect on employment, or deprive the Exchequer of resources that could be used more effectively to promote additional employment.</P>

      <P>I <Col N="1073" /> reject this assessment of the employment impact of the 1993 budget: the measures which I announced in the budget were focused on the overriding priority to promote jobs, including the improvement of the climate for job creation.  In the shorter-term the budget provided for a massive injection of capital resources which will provide many new jobs, particularly in construction, and which will also strengthen the longer-term growth capacity of the economy.  The central element in the budget, however, was the maintenance of macroeconomic and fiscal discipline which are crucial for investment and long-term growth which in turn are essential for sustainable employment growth.</P>
      <P>The developments in the economy since the end of February vindicate the stance I took in the budget; interest rates have fallen sharply, and the key Central Bank short-term facility interest rate is now at its lowest level since 1989.  The Deputy will be interested to hear that the body in question has acknowledged this in the April issue of its newsletter by referring to the &ldquo;...confidence of investors in the Government's firm fiscal stand in the February budget.&rdquo;.  The article goes on to say that &ldquo;The Government's commitment to holding the Exchequer borrowing requirement at under 3 per cent of GNP gave positive signals about the overall stance of the financial management of the economy and as such helped to reduce interest rates.&rdquo; and that &ldquo;...the fall in interest rates is likely to boost economic activity...&rdquo;.  I think that it would be a fair summary of these comments to say that the 1993 budget has succeeded in improving considerably the climate for job creation.</P>

      <Col N="1076" /> While no specific deadline for submission of the Plan has been fixed as yet at EC level I hope that the Plan will be ready for submission to the EC Commission by early July.</P>
    <P>Accordingly over the next two months the Government will continue to have discussions on the priority expenditure areas for investment to be included in the Plan.  As the total of demands substantially exceeds any likely allocation of funds to Ireland difficult decisions will have to be made on which proposals best meet our priority objectives.</P>
    <P>No decisions have yet been taken by the Government on the allocations of expenditure for particular Departments or sectors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 32, 36, 38, 55, 66 and 119 together.</P>
      <P>I believe that Ireland will be in a position to participate in Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), including the introduction of a single currency, even if Britain and Northern Ireland remain outside.</P>
      <P>The Deputies are aware that, under the provisions of the Treaty on European Union, the third stage of European Monetary Union will coincide with the irrevocable fixing of exchange rates.  Under the timetable set out in the Treaty, the third stage will begin no earlier than 1 January 1997.  If by the end of 1997 the date for the beginning of the third stage has not been set, the third stage will begin on 1 January 1999.  At the start of the third stage, the Council will adopt the measures necessary to introduce the ECU as a single currency of the member states participating in the Union.</P>
      <P>It is the Government's objective to proceed to European Monetary Union as quickly as possible following ratification of the Treaty.  We intend that Ireland will be among the first group of countries participating in European Monetary Union and we will continue to pursue vigorously our strategy to achieve the convergence necessary to enable us to take part in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1078" /> EMU offers many advantages.  To begin with, it will be based on closer co-ordination of member states' economic policies, which should make them more beneficial for growth and employment than policies pursued by member states in isolation.  Secondly, the low-inflation environment promoted by European Monetary Union will provide a sound basis for sustainable economic growth and also for lower interest rates. Thirdly, the introduction of a single currency will eliminate both the cost of currency transactions and exchange rate risk for our trade with participating States.</P>
    <P>It is true that the advantages of European Monetary Union will be even greater if the United Kingdom participates in it.  However, I would point out that Ireland's trade with the UK, as a proportion of our total trade, has fallen significantly since our entry into the EC. This process is likely to continue over the coming years, while our trade with the rest of the EC is likely to grow as the process of closer integration intensifies. The UK itself is also likely to become more closely integrated with the EC over coming years.  In addition, it should be borne in mind that Ireland participated in the narrow band of the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System from its inception in 1979, despite the fact that the UK remained outside until 1990: this demonstrated our ability to pursue a policy of closer integration with the European Community without the UK.  Finally, of course, the non-participation of the UK in European Monetary Union would not mean its withdrawal from membership of the EC, or that Ireland could no longer trade with the UK and the UK with Ireland: in European Monetary Union or not, the UK would remain an important market for Ireland.  Ireland would, however, be enjoying the advantages of European Monetary Union set out above which would not be available to the UK if it remained outside European Monetary Union.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis, however, the fundamental question is whether we in Ireland view our future as lying with the <Col N="1079" /> European Community or as lying with the UK.  The Government is firmly convinced that our future lies with the Community; that the Community's future lies in closer integration; and that Ireland should participate fully in that process, with or without the UK.  Our policies will continue to be directed to this objective.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 44, 53, 60, 63 and 118 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with a recommendation of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector in Report No. 30, a system of performance-related pay applies in the civil service to the grade <Col N="1080" /> of Assistant Secretary and some other grades at that level.  There is a pay range for these grades and individuals progress through the range by reference to annual assessment of performance which takes account of pre-determined work objectives. Report No. 35 of the Review Body recommended that the system for Assistant Secretaries be replaced by one consisting of an incremental scale plus bonus for performance assessed as exceptional. While this recommendation has been accepted in principle by the Government, actual implementation will have to await developments in the wider context of how claims for improvement in pay and conditions are to be handled under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> pay agreement.  The question of extending the application of performance-related pay is under consideration by reference to the needs of the service here rather than by comparison with other administrations.</P>

      <P>Section 17 of the Finance Act, 1970, provides that contractors in the Construction Industry are required to deduct tax from payments to sub-contractors unless the sub-contractor has a certificate of authorisation (C2 certificate) from the Revenue Commissioners.  These provisions were extended to the forestry and meat processing industries by the Finance Act, 1992.  The provisions were introduced to counter widespread abuse of the tax system within these industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The requirements for the issue of certificates of authorisation are set out in the law and are designed to ensure that only genuine sub-contractors, who are likely <Col N="1081" /> to comply with their tax obligations, qualify. Timber cutters will qualify for a C2 certificate if they are genuine sub-contractors and have complied with their tax obligations in the past or, if coming into the tax net for the first time, they can satisfy the Inspector of Taxes that they are likely to comply with their tax obligations in the future.</P>
    <P>The rate of 35 per cent is applied only to those timber cutters who fail to meet the requirements for a C2 certificate. Deduction is applied to the gross payment made to the sub-contractor who is, however, allowed credit for tax deducted at source against his income tax liability. The 35 per cent rate is meant to be penal and is set at a level to ensure that it is a deterrent against abuse and an incentive for sub-contractors to get their tax affairs in order.  I have no intention of decreasing the rate at this stage.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the proposal for the construction of a marina on the Abbey River in Limerick. It is at present in a very preliminary form. I understand however that implementation of the proposal as it has been put forward would require major engineering works and while no detailed estimate has been made the cost would be likely to exceed £10 million.</P>
      <P>The National Canals and Waterways Strategy which was recently published by the Commissioners of Public Works recommends as a matter of high priority that a scheme along the lines proposed should be examined.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have indicated their support in principle for the proposal subject to: (a) the availability of the necessary funds and (b) it being demonstrated to their satisfaction that there would be a satisfactory level of usage of any facilities that might be provided.</P>
      <P>I, and the Commissioners of Public Works, would certainly support the enhancement of facilities on the Shannon Navigation subject to the necessary funds being available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 73 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's five national parks are managed in accordance with international criteria laid down by the World Conservation Union, IUCN.  The essential purpose of a national park is to conserve natural plant and animal communities which are both extensive and of national importance, and under conditions compatible with that purpose, to enable people to visit and appreciate them.  The natural heritage of our national parks cannot be appreciated by future generations unless it is effectively conserved in the meantime.  Therefore, if any conflict arises between these objectives, <Col N="1087" /> nature conservation must be treated as the overriding one.</P>
    <P>In general, therefore, the conservation of wildlife and their habitats within the national parks takes precedence over other objectives.  This implies protecting and, if necessary, managing natural resources to permit the fullest possible operation of ecological processes, with the emphasis on whole ecosystems rather than preservation of individual species. Nevertheless, there are some plant and animal species in the parks which require particular consideration because of their national or indeed international importance. Appropriate management techniques are used to conserve these species provided they do not conflict with the ecosystem as a whole.</P>
    <P>One such species is the red deer in Killarney, the only remaining wild herd of native deer in Ireland.  This herd was on the verge of extinction in the sixties but, with careful management, the present population has increased to over 800.</P>
    <P>The survival of native woodlands in Killarney and Glenveagh is under threat from rhododendron ponticum, an introduced shrub which spreads rapidly on acid soils and shades out the ground layer, preventing germination of native tree seedlings.  The eradication of rhododendron is, therefore, a conservation priority in these parks.  This is being addressed through the use of park staff, voluntary workers and hiring of contractors to clear specified areas.</P>
    <P>Our national parks are among the most popular tourist destinations in Ireland and are, therefore, important from a tourism viewpoint.  The needs of tourists are catered for by providing and maintaining the facilities necessary to enable visitors to enjoy their visit in ways that are compatible with the proper conservation of the parks.</P>
    <P>A wide range of visitor facilities are provided including visitor centres incorporating interpretative displays and audio-visual presentations on the individual parks and their environs, as well as toilets, tearooms, picnic areas, and <Col N="1088" /> car-parks.  The centres provide access to guided walks, self-guiding trails, informal walks and viewing-points within the parks.</P>
    <P>Interpretation in national parks is an informal education activity aiming to explain meanings and relationships of park features rather than merely to communicate factual information.  This enables visitors to gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of the parks' natural and cultural heritage and also of wider environmental issues.  The methods used range from guided walks, talks and lectures to self guiding trails, outdoor display panels as well as interpretative displays and audio-visual presentations, and a wide variety of publications.</P>
    <P>The national parks also facilitate all three levels of formal education.  At primary school level this entails giving talks at school on aspects of the parks' environments and advising on and leading class groups on visits to the park.  Many of the parks are also popular venues for organised school visits.  At Killarney National Park a programme of field courses and education facilities have been provided, aimed primarily, but not exclusively, at secondary school level. Third level students are also facilitated in a variety of ways including information in connection with their studies, student placement schemes and support for relevant research projects by them.</P>
    <P>Recreational activities such as pony trekking, boating and jaunting cars are facilitated under licence at appropriate locations, some on a concession basis following public competition where practicable. Other activities such as jet skiing, power boating or sport shooting are not considered appropriate within a national park and are not permitted.</P>
    <P>All the national parks contain landscapes of high scenic quality.  The park landscapes are afforded protection by the fact that the lands are owned and under the direct control of the State.  Any proposals that would detract from the natural beauty of the parks would not be permitted.</P>
    <P>Management policies for the parks <Col N="1089" /> have been determined based on the experience of management staff and on research.  The experiences of national parks in other countries are also taken into account where appropriate and management strategies are monitored on an ongoing basis and are reviewed from time to time, as necessary.  A management plan has been published for Killarney National Park in which management policies for that park have been set out in detail.  Management plans for the other national parks are in course of preparation.</P>
    <P>The state of natural resources in the parks is generally excellent.  An inventory of national resources forms part of the basis data on which management plans are devised.  Inventories are based on published scientific literature and nation-wide survey data, e.g. on protected plant species, augmented where necessary by specific studies to guide park management, such as vegetation mapping, bird censuses and invertebrate surveys. Routine monitoring is by park rangers under the direction of qualified park managers, and identified threats to the health of park ecosystems have been the subject of further research, e.g. on fresh-water pollution trends, spread and control of rhododendron, and factors affecting woodland regeneration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49, 85, 86, 87 and 93 together.</P>
      <P>A total of 55 million shares in Irish Life were sold, bringing revenue of £104.5 million.  This price was equivalent to £1.90 per share, a discount on the market price at the time of 5 per cent.  The price in recent days has been around this level, or a little below.  The cost of the sale was £45,000 plus VAT.  The Government's remaining shares in Greencore were placed on 30 April, realising net revenue of almost £70 million.</P>
      <P>The circumstances of this transaction were debated in the House on Thursday last and I made a public statement on 7 May.  Until inquiries by the Stock Exchange are completed I do not wish to say anything further on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can confirm that the sale will now be completed, and that estimated proceeds of £69,872,459 will be realised and will be lodged to the account of the <Col N="1091" /> Exchequer on the due settlement date, 17 May.  The price at placing on 30 April was £2.75 per share, representing a discount of just under 7 per cent on the market price of £2.95 at the time.  This is the usual practice in a substantial placing. The price this year has moved between £2.38 and £3.16.</P>
    <P>Total fees of £175,000 were agreed with Davy's who arranged the placing of the shares.  In addition commission of £550,000 was initially agreed as payable in respect of S. G. Warburg's participation in the placing.  I can confirm that no commission will now be payable on the transaction and that Davy Stockbrokers have waived their fees.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my Budget Statement, I set a target of £150 million for asset disposals this year, which was included in the budget arithmetic.  This money goes to reduce the level of Exchequer borrowing and is not allocated to particular expenditure headings. There are no plans at present to sell other shares which I hold on behalf of the public.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-97</i> states that we will implement the principles regarding State enterprise set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  The relevant section of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> says that change in the ownership structure of particular State companies will only take place if it is in the public interest and in the best interest of the company and its employees.  I believe that these conditions have been fulfilled in the case of Irish Life and Greencore.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier the budget arithmetic assumed asset sales would yield £150 million this year.  The sales of the Irish Life and Greencore shares have in fact produced over £20 million more than that, but in the context of the budgetary totals for the year that is not a large figure.  However, there is every reason, at this stage, to expect budget revenue targets to be met.</P>

      <P>Circular 1 of 1983 issued by my Department on 8 March 1983 provides guidelines on the practice to be followed in appraising and managing public sector expenditure proposals, especially capital expenditure.  It is mainly concerned with setting out the broad principles involved in project appraisal and evaluation and with ensuring that those considering undertaking a project must submit a proposal covering all the realistic options, their costs and benefits and a recommendation as to the most cost-effective solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The circular is aimed mainly at central Government Departments and at bodies under their aegis such as health boards, <Col N="1093" /> local authorities and State-sponsored bodies.  In so far as the projects and programmes in question are mainly those undertaken at Exchequer expense, the question of tax expenditures in relation to those projects does not arise.</P>
    <P>However, Circular 1/83 provides that account should be taken of all relevant costs associated with a project.  While tax expenditures are not explicitly referred to in the circular, the provision to which I have just referred would imply that regard should be had to any tax expenditures associated with a project.</P>
    <P>Circular 1/83 has been under active review in my Department for some time and the question of whether any explicit reference should be made to tax expenditures will be borne in mind when finalising the revised version of that circular.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>In last year's Finance Act, I introduced special savings accounts, which are deposit accounts with banks and building societies, the interest from which is taxed at 10 per cent with no further tax liability on that interest.  These accounts are designed to be broadly competitive with the alternative of bank accounts abroad. In addition, the same Finance Act makes the 27 per cent deposit interest retention tax, DIRT, deducted from the interest on other bank accounts, the taxpayer's final liability to income tax on that interest income.  Similar 10 and 27 per cent tax regimes have been announced for the life assurance and unit trust industries, and the legislation for these regimes will be in this year's Finance Act.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any formal studies in relation to the level of Irish residents' holding of savings abroad.</P>

      <P>I assume, that, in referring to EC funding, the Deputy is referring to the funding that will be made available under the EC Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund. The current Community Support Framework for EC Structural Funds will expire at the end of 1993.  The preparation of a new National Development Plan which will form the basis of negotiation with the EC Commission of the next Community Support Framework for the post-1993 <Col N="1097" /> period is under way.  The central objective is to have a plan focused on generating sustainable employment and growth.</P>
      <P>As part of the preparation of the plan, I invited the seven sub-regional review committees to make submissions giving their views on the strategy and priorities that would best meet the needs of their region.  I am very happy to have received detailed submissions from all the committees. These are being examined carefully both by myself and other Ministers and our officials as part of the process of preparing the National Development Plan.</P>
      <P>In selecting strategies which will maximise the development of sustainable employment and growth we will be very conscious of the necessity for balanced regional development.</P>

      <P>As I stated in my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 70 and 71 of 2 March 1993, Ireland supported the French proposal made last year at the 44th annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission to create a whale sanctuary in the Antarctic Ocean and was also involved in the setting up of a working group to examine the proposal further in preparation for this year's conference.</P>
      <P>I am now happy to confirm that I have instructed Ireland's Commissioner at this year's conference in Kyoto, Japan to second the French proposal for a circumpolar whale sanctuary in the waters south of 40 degrees South.</P>
      <P>Ireland's endorsement of the French proposal will ensure that this very worthwhile measure will be brought forward and debated fully by the parties to the IWC as it deserves to be.</P>

      <P>There has been considerable ongoing work on evaluation of the various Structural Funds programmes and of the Community Support Framework, commissioned by the Irish authorities and by the EC Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the preparation of the National Development Plan, which will set out the Government's proposals for the use of EC Structural and Cohesion Funds in the period 1994-1999, a group of consultants comprising the Economic and Social Research Institute in association with DKM Economic Consultants; G. Boyle, Centre for Agriculture and Food Policy Research, Maynooth College; and Brendan Kearney and Associates were engaged to undertake an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Community Support Framework 1989 to 1993 in contributing to Ireland's economic development and to make recommendations on the strategy that should underpin the next Community Support <Col N="1100" /> Framework; following from that strategy, the optimal mix of national programmes and measures to implement the strategy, and practical ways of providing for greater integration and complementarity of measures within programmes. Although the main recommendations of the consultants have been received, the assignment is not yet fully completed.  The assignment was carried out by the consultants on the basis that it was not the intention of the Department of Finance to publish their report.  Government Departments, State agencies and other bodies co-operated with the consultants and supplied material to them on that understanding. In the circumstances, it would be inappropriate to publish the report now. When the assignment has been completed consideration will be given to whether the main conclusions of the consultants should be published.</P>
    <P>The publication of evaluations and cost-benefit analyses undertaken in the different sectors covered by Structural Funds programmes is a matter for the individual Ministers responsible for their sectors.</P>

      <P>The Efficiency Audit Group, EAG, was established by the Government in April 1988 to examine the workings and practices of each Government Department with a view to recommending improved and alternative policies and methods which reduce costs and improve efficiency.  The group, in conjunction with Departmental management, had the task of establishing whether, by more efficient or alternative work practices, costs can be reduced or a better service provided at the same cost. Subsequently it was decided that the role of the EAG could extend outside the Civil Service to other parts of the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1101" /> The work of the EAG has included efficiency scrutinies of the civilian side of the Department of Defence and of the management and administrative systems of the Defence Forces.  The EAG set up two working groups, the first to study the civil branches of the Department and, arising from its recommendations, the second was to study the administrative functions of the Defence Forces.  The recommendations of the EAG in these areas were considered by Government recently.  The Government decided that the implementation of recommendations concerning the delegation of financial authority to the military authorities and the reform of military administration should be pursued as a matter of urgency. The Government also decided that a radical overhaul of Defence Forces structures and systems should be undertaken under the aegis of the EAG.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture will be the next assignment for the Efficiency Audit Group, after which other Departments will be examined by the group.</P>

      <P>Failure to carry the referendum on 18 May would not require Denmark to leave the European Community, as its membership of the existing Community in accordance with the Treaty of Accession of 1972 would continue to apply.</P>

      <P>Commercially operated health and fitness clubs are liable to VAT at the 12.5 <Col N="1110" /> per cent rate because they provide taxable services in the course or furtherance of business.  The services in question relate to the care of the human body and leisure-orientated activities generally. Prior to 1 July 1992, many of the services of these clubs, such as use of sauna, jacuzzi, swimming pool etc. were exempt from VAT on the basis that these were lettings of immovable goods.  This position, which affected a wide range of sports facilities, gave rise to a number of undesirable anomalies.  I moved to correct these in last year's Finance Act, when I made all commercially run sports and leisure facilities liable to VAT, as EC law requires.</P>
      <P>Recently, certain health and fitness interests made representations to me about the fact that similar facilities run by non-profit making organisations are not liable to VAT.  This is because such facilities are not deemed to be operating in the course or furtherance of business. I am keeping this matter under review, in particular with a view to ensuring that undue distortions of competition do not arise.</P>

      <P>The Department's latest economic forecasts and tax revenue estimates for 1993 were published in February in conjunction with the budget.</P>
      <P>Domestic developments since February have been broadly positive, with interest rates moderating more rapidly than anticipated and inflation more subdued, pointing to the prospect of a lower increase in consumer prices of the order of 3 per cent this year.  This indicates that economic activity might be stronger than seemed likely in February.  External developments have been more mixed, however.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1111" /> A revised economic forecast, based on international prospects &mdash; which are currently being reviewed by the OECD and the EC &mdash; and on emerging domestic developments such as the foregoing, will next be provided in Economic Review and Outlook, as is customary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The charter represents an initiative by the Revenue Commissioners to promote better tax compliance and good relations with taxpayers.  In its central provisions the charter is simply reminding taxpayers of their rights as already established in existing law.  This applies particularly to one of the main points in the charter &mdash; the right of independent review through appeal to the Appeals Commissioners, as set out in the various tax Acts, and the legal right to judicial review in the courts.</P>
      <P>Other provisions guarantee people basic rights of courtesy and consideration, the presumption of honesty and an assurance that compliance costs will be kept to a minimum.  If these principles of good administration were given the status of legal provisions, then not only would their operation provide a fertile source of argument and litigation but also they would undoubtedly be used by non-compliant taxpayers to try to hinder Revenue's collection and enforcement operations.</P>
      <P>Indeed, the enactment of the charter into law would undermine various Revenue powers which are needed for effective collection and countering evasion. For example, the principle of presumption of honesty might be invoked to prevent revenue from carrying out random audits, or from examining books and records for that purpose, so as to help police the self-assessment system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The charter is actively promoted and <Col N="1112" /> publicised by Revenue, who have also put in place procedures as to how complaints may be made if it is considered that the charter is not being adhered to. These have been publicised to tax practitioners.</P>
    <P>While I can appreciate the sentiment behind the question, I am not convinced that giving statutory force to the charter of rights would be either appropriate or practical.  Indeed, it could be contrary to the interests of the general body of taxpayers who, if they endeavour to meet their obligations, will find the Revenue Commissioners fair and reasonable.</P>

      <P>Previous amnesties were conceded most reluctantly and only because major collection reforms were being introduced into the law and the administration of the tax system e.g. self-assessment, increased auditing and increased collection powers which have ensured that non-complying taxpayers have faced a more hostile climate than had been the case prior to their introduction.  Any question of the introduction of a further amnesty or of its possible form or scope would be a complex one.  No decision has been taken to introduce any such amnesty.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111 and 123 together.</P>
      <P>As part of the preparation of the National Development Plan, which will set out the Government's proposals for the use of EC Structural and Cohesion Funds in the period 1994-1999, the Department of Finance decided to engage consultants to undertake an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Community Support Framework 1989 to 1993 in contributing to Ireland's economic development and to make recommendations on</P>
      <P>&mdash;the strategy that should underpin the next Community Support Framework,</P>
      <P>&mdash;following from that strategy, the optimal mix of national programmes and measures to implement the strategy, and</P>
      <P>&mdash;practical ways of providing for greater integration and complementarity of measures within programmes.</P>
      <P>A number of firms and bodies were invited to put forward proposals to undertake the assignment.  The Economic and Social Research Institute in association with DKM Economic Consultants; G. Boyle, Centre for Agriculture and Food Policy Research, Maynooth College; and Brendan Kearney and Associates were engaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the main recommendations <Col N="1118" /> of the consultants have been received the assignment is not yet fully completed. The assignment was carried out by the consultants on the basis that it was not the intention of the Department of Finance to publish its report.  Government Departments, State agencies and other bodies co-operated with the consultants and supplied material to them on that understanding.  In the circumstances it would be inappropriate to publish the report now.  When the assignment has been completed consideration will be given to whether the main conclusions of the consultants should be published.</P>

      <P>TSB Bank is governed by trustees and operates under the Trustee Savings Banks Act, 1989.  Given its trust nature a trustee savings bank does not pay dividends. Trustee savings banks are not subject to the bank levy because the levy is confined to banks licensed under section 9 of the Central Bank Act, 1971. As a trust, a trustee savings bank is liable for capital gains tax and for income tax. However, certain categories of the income of a trustee savings bank are exempt from income tax under section 337 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  The scope of this exemption is such that trustee savings banks operating under existing rules would be unlikely to incur a liability to pay income tax.  In the circumstances, I have made provision in the recently published 1993 Finance Bill to bring trustee savings banks within the scope of corporation tax on a phased <Col N="1120" /> basis.  The tax affairs of any individual or organisation are a confidential matter and it is not the practice to disclose details of them.</P>

However, the Commissioners tentatively estimate that the cost in a full year of restoring the allowance at the values referred to in the question on the basis on which it formerly applied, that is to children under 16 years of age or over 16 years of age and in full-time education, would be as follows:</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that there is no provision in current legislation from 1 January 1993, for local authorities to charge motor tax from other than the date of registration of an imported car irrespective of whether the car is written off or off the road; and if he will consider legislative proposals to change this so that only operative cars that are on the road will be charged motor tax.</Quest>

      <P>Prior to 1 January 1993, the registration and licensing of vehicles was administered by the local authorities and it would have been normal practice, at that time, for car owners to apply for registration and licensing of new or imported cars simultaneously.  However, registration is now carried out by the Revenue Commissioners upon payment of the relevant vehicle registration tax, if any; licensing continues to be administered by the local authorities.</P>
      <P>Given the established pattern whereby an application for registration was indicative of the availability of a vehicle for use, it was decided, in order to avoid the creation of any opportunities for abuse, that vehicle licence duty should normally be due from the date of registration.  To ensure that motorists have sufficient time, following registration, in which to licence, tax, a vehicle, provision has been made in the new arrangements, by way of a &ldquo;good defence&rdquo; mechanism, so that a motorist will not be penalised for the use, driving or parking of an unlicensed vehicle in a public place within seven working days of registration by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>In the interest of road safety, I would not favour any road tax concession which might encourage the importation of cars which have been &ldquo;written off&rdquo; in road accidents.  Furthermore, I would be seriously concerned that any general acceptance of claims that cars being imported were &ldquo;off the road&rdquo; between registration and first licensing could lead to many spurious claims and thereby create a serious &ldquo;loophole&rdquo; in the road tax code.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware tax relief is already available in respect of rent paid by persons aged 55 years or over in respect of private tenancies up to a maximum of £1,000 for a single person, £1,500 for a widowed person or £2,000 for a married taxpayer assessed to tax in respect of the combined income of both spouses.  The estimated 1993-94 cost of this relief is £1.6 million.</P>
      <P>It is tentatively estimated that the 1993-94 cost of extending the relief to all households at the existing level of relief for private rented accommodation and local authority rented accommodation, would be approximately £45 million.  If local authority tenants were excluded, the cost would be about £40 million.  To extend the relief but without any ceiling on the amount allowable would cost the Exchequer significantly more.  Statistics are not available on which to base a reliable estimate of such an extension of the relief.</P>

      <P>In the budget I announced that the VAT rate on short term car hire would move to 12½ per cent with effect from 1 March 1993, in the context of a general increase applying to all goods and services which were previously at the 10 per cent rate and a consolidation of the VAT rating structure in general.  I also announced <Col N="1123" /> my intention to further increase the rate applying to short term care hire to 21 per cent from 1 September next.  This second increase was estimated to yield £0.6 million in the current year.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to the budget, I decided, in response to the many representations received from tourism interests, to defer the application of the standard rate due on 1 September: this position is reflected in the Finance Bill as published last week. When taken in conjunction with the proposed reliefs in relation to Vehicle Registration Tax for the short term hire sector, this concession should further underpin the financial viability of the sector, thereby facilitating an increase in the size of hire fleets.  I should point out, however, that in accordance with the EC VAT Rates Directive, short term car hire is ultimately destined for standard rating.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that to determine accurately the precise information requested by the Deputy would require identification of the cases involved and an individual examination of all the income tax returns of such cases.  Such an examination could only be carried out at a disproportionate cost.</P>
      <P>The only relevant statistics which are available indicate that some 40,000 to 45,000 cases are taxed annually on benefit in kind in respect of the availability for private use of business cars.</P>
      <P>It is tentatively estimated that the yield from taxing the benefit associated with the availability for private use of an employer-provided car had been of the order of £30 million to £35 million annually over the period from 1987 to 1991 inclusive.</P>
      <P>It is further estimated that, following the changes contained in the Finance Act, 1992, the yield in 1992 was of the order of £45 million to £50 million.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my press statement which accompanied the release of the first-quarter Exchequer Returns, the trend in tax revenue to end-March 1993 was well up to expectations.  The revenue flow in April remained satisfactory, and given that the reductions in interest rates which followed the budget should be of benefit to economic activity, I have no reason to believe that the first-half tax returns will not continue to perform in line with the overall budget targets.</P>

      <P>The prevailing downward trend in interest rates augurs improved investment conditions this year.  However, world economic activity, another very important determinent of investment, remains relatively subdued.  Domestic policies and responses are the third factor critical to Irish investment prospects.</P>
      <P>The Government is conscious of the importance to employment prospects of investment and is acutely aware that stability, low inflation and international competitiveness, and physical and other infrastructure conducive to business success are essential preconditions to investment growth.</P>
      <P>Creating and maintaining these have been, and as is clear from this year's budget remain, key objectives of Government policy.  A particularly significant boost to investment in the Irish economy will arise through the programmes financed by the enhanced EC Structural and the new Cohesion Funds over the medium term.  Improvements to the overall business infrastructure arising therefrom will enhance the conditions for further autonomous commercial investment and job-creation over the longer term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, while certain external factors conditioning investment and employment prospects may be improving this will not of itself guarantee an improved employment performance. Domestic responses, which are within our control, are also vital.  Unremitting commitment to improved competitiveness &mdash; in all its aspects and in all sectors of the economy &mdash; and to structural reform to improve the functioning of the economy can best harness the <Col N="1126" /> potential for an improved employment performance in the period ahead.</P>

      <P>Reform of the PRSI system is something that is kept under continuous review in my Department but major changes to the system can only be considered in the context of budgetary policy generally.  Changes which I have introduced in recent years were the extension of social insurance to the self-employed in 1988 and to part-time workers in 1991.</P>
      <P>With regard to public sector workers, there have been discussions over recent years with the various interests involved on the question of extending full social insurance cover to public sector workers currently insured at the modified rate of PRSI.  No final decisions have been taken in that regard.</P>

      <P>The abolition of the PRSI ceilings would yield an additional £145 million in a full year.  The cost of introducing a system of graduated PRSI rates on low incomes would depend on the exact rates chosen.  A restructuring of PRSI rates to give any substantial relief to low earners would, however be very costly.</P>

      <P>I would direct the Deputy's attention to my reply to a previous Question No. 190 of 23 March last, dealing with Garda strength to tackle the drugs problem in the North Dublin city area.</P>
      <P>In so far as the present question is concerned, the position is that a Divisional Task Force based at Santry, has a strength of two (2) Sergeants and eighteen (18) gardaí.  This unit deals with local crime including drugs.  In addition, two (2) gardaí are employed full-time on drug law enforcement.</P>
      <P>A Crime Prevention Unit based at Fitzgibbon Street, has a strength of one (1) Sergeant and fourteen (14) gardaí.  This unit deals with local crime including drugs, and two (2) gardaí from the unit have special responsibility for drug law enforcement.</P>
      <P>In addition, a specialised drug unit based at Store Street with a strength of one (1) Detective Sergeant and four (4) Detective gardaí, concentrate on drug problems in the North inner city.</P>
      <P>All these units are flexible and work together as required throughout the area. They have assistance as necessary from uniformed personnel, and District Detective Units.</P>
      <P>Since September 1991 twenty-six (26) gardaí from the North and North Central Garda Division have completed special courses on Drug Law Enforcement with the Central Drug Squad at Harcourt Square.  This squad comprises two (2) Detective Inspectors, and twenty-nine (29) Detective gardaí, and it operates throughout the Dublin Metropolitan Area, working closely with the units in the North city which I have mentioned. Furthermore, the services of the Serious Crime Squad and Surveillance Unit, under the control of a Detective Superintendent are available in any part of the city as required to tackle drug-related incidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1133" /> All of these units working both together and separately have had many significant seizures and detections relating to drugs.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that the resources and personnel at present available are adequate to deal with the drugs problem on the North side of Dublin, and employ strategies which are as flexible as possible to maximise their effeciveness.</P>

      <P>The redundancy payments scheme operates under the Redundancy Payments Acts to compensate workers for the loss of their jobs by reason of redundancy i.e. where an employee's job ceases to exist and he/she is not replaced.</P>
      <P>It is not clear from the Deputy's question as to whether the status of the &ldquo;contracted temporary workers&rdquo; to which he refers derives from a contract of service or from a contract for services (i.e. whether they are, respectively, employed or self-employed).</P>
      <P>In the event that contracts for services are involved, the reorganisation of a business in this manner is a matter for decision by the employer as is deemed necessary to achieve the most efficient operation of the enterprise.</P>
      <P>However, if the new engagements are entered into on a contract of service basis (i.e. the persons concerned are employees of the business) it would seem that, for the purposes of the Redundancy Payments Scheme, a genuine redundancy situation would not exist (the test being, generally, that an employer needs fewer employees to do work of a particular kind).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In such circumstances, the arrangements envisaged in the question would not qualify for assistance from the Redundancy Payments Scheme.  Furthermore, it is open to a dismissed employee, who considers that a genuine redundancy <Col N="1138" /> situation did not exist to justify a dismissal, to submit a claim to the Employment Appeals Tribunal under the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, that he/she had been unfairly dismissed.</P>

      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 26 of 1 April, 1993.  As capital receipts, which arise from the proceeds of tenant purchase schemes, are required to fund the corporation's 1993 housing construction remedial works scheme programmes, the question of using them for other purposes does not arise.</P>

      <P>I am aware from monitoring returns that some problems exist with water in the Rosses Region and that exceedances of quality standards for a number of parameters specified in the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1988, have occurred.  Discussions have taken place with Donegal County Council to agree action programmes to improve water quality.  In 1992, the Council submitted a proposal for the provision of additional water treatment facilities on the scheme but, having regard to the existing level of commitments under the Water and Sanitary Services Programme, I cannot indicate when a decision may issue in this case.  However, a scheme to replace defective mains from Dore to Bunbeg to Derrybeg was completed in 1992 at a cost of £630,000 and this has already improved the pressure and quality of water in the area.</P>

Experience of working on marine samples in an environmental laboratory and knowledge of the basic concepts of analytical quality assurance were desirable but not essential.</P>
      <P>As there was a large candidature (98 applicants) for the position, the Department asked the interview board to shortlist applicants likely to attain in the competition a standard sufficient for selection and recommendation for appointment.  Competition was extremely keen and many highly qualified and experienced chemists were not included in the ten applicants invited for interview.  While it is not the practice to divulge the specific selection criteria operated by the board for shortlisting purposes such criteria are, in general, based on the essential and desirable requirements for the position.</P>

      <P>The relevant EC Regulations provide for suckler cow premium quotas to be based on the number of suckler cows on which a producer was paid suckler cow premium under the 1992 suckler cow premium scheme.</P>
      <P>The person named meets this condition and will be granted a quota of three suckler cows based on the number of suckler cows on which he was paid premium under the 1992 suckler cow premium scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EC Regulations also provide for the establishment of both a national reserve equal to between 1 per cent and 3 per cent of the sum of the individual quotas allocated to producers and a special reserve equal to 1 per cent of the total of the individual quotas allocated to producers in the disadvantaged areas.  As the applications for the suckler cow scheme were accepted up to the end of 1992 and as the retention period for the scheme is six months, it will not be possible for some time yet to indicate the total number of suckler cows which received <Col N="1154" /> the premium in 1992 and therefore to indicate the size of the reserves.  When these reserves are established and the criteria for allocating quotas from them have been decided my Department will be inviting herd owners to submit a formal application for increase in suckler cow quota.</P>
    <P>The person named has been granted a ewe premium quota of 280 ewes based on the number of ewes on which he was paid premium under the 1991 ewe premium scheme less a deduction for the national reserve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The following tabular form details of Ireland's exports to Germany from 1987-92.</P>
      <P>Germany is Ireland's second largest export market.  Indigenous and multinational firms export a full range of manufactured products and commodities to the wealthiest and most competitive purchasers in Europe.  In 1992, our exports to Germany were in excess of £2.1 billion, an increase of 76 per cent over 1987.</P>
      <P>The thrust of An Bord Tráchtála's work in Germany is to assist indigenous Irish companies to become established in the German market.  This mainly involves developing contact with major German buyers, linking-up with German manufacturers and distributors and, in some cases, the opening of sales/service centres in the market.  An Bord Tráchtála is targeting a 12 per cent increase in indigenous exports to Germany for 1993.</P>
      <P>Two regions of Germany have been especially targeted as part of An Bord Tráchtála Regional Markets Programme, which makes a special promotional drive in high growth areas of Europe.  The programme was launched in Baden-Wuerttemburg in 1990 and in Saxony in 1992. Baden-Wuerttemberg was one of the original four &ldquo;European motor regions&rdquo; targeted under the Regional Markets Programme while Saxony, an area with a great industrial tradition, is likely to become Germany's most important industrial area by the year 2010.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Bord Tráchtála continues its priority approach to all of Germany with a strong promotional programme for 1993.  Irish companies will be represented at nine major international trade fairs, four specialist missions from Ireland will target specific sectors and four inward <Col N="1159" /> buyer missions will visit their Irish suppliers.</P>
    <P>It is clear that Germany is one of the success stories for Irish exporters.  I am determined that this will continue to be the case.</P>

      <P>Should a parent be concerned about their child's condition they should return to their general practitioner who would be in the best position to stress the urgency of the case directly to the consultant at the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government has allocated £20 million for a major action programme to reduce waiting times in the areas of orthopaedic surgery &mdash; hip replacement and other procedures &mdash; ophthalmology &mdash; cataract &mdash; ear, nose, and throat surgery, cardiac surgery &mdash; by-pass operations &mdash; vascular surgery &mdash; varicose veins &mdash; and plastic surgery.  The Government objective is to eliminate waiting lists in excess of 12 months in these specialities, and to set a <Col N="1162" /> maximum period of six months for children awaiting ENT or eye treatment.</P>
    <P>Discussions regarding waiting lists are now nearing completion with the various hospitals and health boards, and I will be shortly announcing my decisions in regard to the allocation of the £20 million.</P>

      <P>Almost all the further amount due reflects the excess expenditure incurred by the boards between 1984 and 1989. While this expenditure has been approved by the Department of Finance, the funding arrangements are still under discussion between my Department and the Department of Finance.

      <P>Of the additional £8.5 million made available in 1993 for the development of services for people with mental handicap, £4 million has been allocated to the health board regions from which £586,000 has been allocated to the South Eastern region.  This is in addition to the £850,000 made available last year which has been repeated in 1993.</P>
      <P>The guidelines issued to the South Eastern region proposed that particular emphasis should be placed on residential and day places (including respite care), home support services and emergency services.  Specifically it was indicated that 8 residential/respite places, 50 day care places and additional home support and early intervention services be put in place in 1993.  The precise services to be provided in the South Eastern region have been agreed by the Regional Mental Handicap Coordinating Committee, on which the County Tipperary Association is represented and are now being examined in my Department.  As a result, I am not yet in a position to inform the Deputy of the additional respite facilities which may be put in place in the South Tipperary area.</P>

      <P>Since 1985, the Department has been monitoring HIV in this country on the <Col N="1165" /> basis of monthly reports from the Virus Reference Laboratory UCD which submits, information on HIV positive tests obtained under the voluntary HIV testing programme.  This shows that a total of 1,358 persons have tested positive for the virus in this country.  It is considered, however, that this figure is understated and on the recommendations of the National AIDS Strategy Committee, a Programme of unlinked, anonymous HIV monitoring commenced in October, 1992 as a basis for more comprehensive monitoring of the spread of the infection.  The new programme involves the analysis of blood, taken at antenatal clinics for routine clinical purposes and which is surplus to requirements.  The information obtained will provide information on HIV relating to gender, age and regions.  It is proposed to extend the Programme further to include STD Clinics and hospital in-patients and out-patients.</P>

      <P>My Department has no special scheme whereby it can assist individual schools which have deficits in their accounts. However, I am happy to inform the Deputy that I recently secured an increase of £3.4 million in the 1993 provision for capitation grant for primary schools.

      <P>In my response to the Deputy on 23 March 1993 I outlined the present level of support provided by my Department in relation to escorts for handicapped children while travelling.</P>
      <P>I also indicated that the Special Education Review Committee was examining the range of support service available to children with disabilities.</P>
      <P>I expect to have the Committee's report fairly shortly and will be considering what further measures are appropriate in the light of the committee's recommendations.</P>
