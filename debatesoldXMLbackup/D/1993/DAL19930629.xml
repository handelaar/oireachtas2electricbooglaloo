      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if, in view of the absence of an official ceremony on the anniversary of the 1974 Dublin-Monaghan bombings, and no appropriate memorial to the 33 victims, he will have arrangements made for the 20th anniversary in 1994.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>While these terrible events of 17 May 1974 endure in the memory of many who witnessed them or were injured by them, I believe it would be invidious to single them out for special official commemoration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach concerned that, to our shame, what was and is, even after 20 years, an immense human tragedy, has been largely ignored for far too long?  That tragedy was unique in that it resulted in the greatest loss of life in any one atrocity resulting from the Northern conflict: some 33 people died, including the entire O'Brien family, the parents and their two children, and more than 100 were seriously injured.  Is the Minister aware that the relatives feel that the victims are forgotten in terms of the Northern conflict and that a fitting memorial should be provided to their memory?  Finally, is the Minister prepared to meet representatives of the relatives' committee to hear at first hand their concerns?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept and agree with what Deputy Gregory said in relation to that tragedy in 1974.  I would point out also that approximately 3,000 deaths have resulted either directly or indirectly from violence in Northern Ireland.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that picking out any incident for special consideration might not be the best way to approach this matter.  In relation to the concerns of the relatives that they are forgotten, the Minister for Justice indicated recently that the placing of the bombs in Dublin at that time was the subject of intensive Garda investigations over a protracted period in which all possible leads were fully pursued.  No charges have been brought in connection with the bombings but the Minister has been assured by the Garda authorities that their files remain open and that any new information which becomes available will be thoroughly investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that no one is requesting special consideration given that in the instance of Enniskillen, memorial services are organised each year which are attended by members of Government from this State?  It is a matter of great shame&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the many concerns of the relatives' committee, principally that a great deal more is known about the perpetrators of the bombings than has been publicly admitted?  The Irish and British Governments must be seen to act to bring those responsible to justice, including, possibly, members of the British security services. <Col N="5" /> The bereaved families and injured victims should then be fully compensated for their trauma and loss as they have received derisory compensation up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of media reports suggesting there may well be other evidence available and that a television programme may be shown in the near future in relation to this incident.  I repeat what I said, the Minister for Justice has been assured by the Garda authorities that their files remain open and that any new information which becomes available will be thoroughly investigated.</P>

      <P>The Deputy and the House can rest assured that whatever action is necessary, including the blocking of the regulations if it should come to that &mdash; let us hope it does not &mdash; will be taken.  Other countries have already signalled that they will block the regulations for different reasons.  This matter should be dealt with when the appropiate meetings take place.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware &mdash; as I am sure he must be &mdash; of the issuing of a document yesterday by Commissioner Millan in relation to the share out of funds between the four countries involved where the criteria laid down by Commissioner Millan will result in Ireland obtaining a sum less than £6 billion as against the £8 billion originally stated by the Taoiseach which became £8.8 billion with the devaluation of the Irish pound?  In view of this very serious development, what steps does the Taoiseach or the Government propose to take between now and Friday when I understand this matter will be finally decided at a meeting of Community Foreign Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I do not expect the matter to be finally resolved on Friday as another meeting is scheduled for July. <Col N="8" /> Second, I have not seen the document referred to by Deputy O'Malley but if I am to judge by the reports I read in the newspapers about the criteria applied &mdash; or which some officials say is being applied in Brussels &mdash; that <i>per capita</i> income is the criteria by which our allocation will be decided and if that is the true position then I can tell the House, and the Commission indirectly, that it is totally unacceptable and is not the only criteria on which allocations will be judged at the end of the day.  In May Ireland submitted a detailed objective criteria to the EC Commission justifying an allocation of £8 billion.  We are not seeking a percentage of all Structural Funds, only those applying to Objective I regions.  The detailed criteria which we submitted followed directly from the Edinburgh Conclusions and include not only income <i>per capita</i> but peripherality, unemployment, long term unemployment, migration, dependency, population density and other indicators of rural disadvantage.  That is the basic criteria which we have put forward and since then we have heard nothing to suggest our case is not being accepted.  I am sure it is quite clear to Deputies that two countries or regions could have the exact same income <i>per capita</i> but if one is peripheral or more structurally disadvantaged than the other then clearly both should not receive the same amount.  We have taken the capacity and structural disadvantages into account and have produced a transparent basis which shows that Ireland should maintain its existing share of Structural Funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Taoiseach will sound more convincing at the meeting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree, in the light of what he said at Edinburgh and on many occasions subsequently, that his credibility is at stake on this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not accept that.  In fact, this campaign of information has been going on for some time; it started in Brussels in December 1992, <Col N="9" /> some days following the Summit.  At that time a spokesman for the European Commission issued an official statement disassociating the executive from the views expressed by a number of senior officials who, on Wednesday, queried Ireland's chance of getting £8 billion of EC aid from new Structural Funds.  That statement was published in the Irish media on 18 December.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure most Members agree with the Taoiseach's remarks about the criteria but the Commission will lay them down.  In Brussels yesterday Commissioner Millan issued a document setting out different criteria and senior officials of the Commission are quoted this morning as insisting that Ireland, with just 1 per cent of the Community population, cannot lay claim to 13.5 per cent of the aid fund.  As there appears to be a major difference in approach between the Government and the Commission on how such moneys should be allocated, will the Taoiseach take urgent steps in the next few days to ensure that the criteria which he and the Government favour will prevail?  In particular, has the Taoiseach communicated with President Delors on this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>These are not just dreamed up criteria as far as Ireland is concerned, they reflect the Edinburgh Conclusions which have been put forward to the Commission and not rejected by it.  If the income <i>per capita</i> criteria the officials in Commissioner Millan's department put forward are the only criteria, this Government will totally and absolutely reject them because they do not reflect the Edinburgh Conclusions. We know exactly what the criteria should be, we have put forward our case on that basis and it is up to the Commission to tell us where we are off-side.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand how that relates to Question No. 4, it relates to the nature and content of the discussions with the UK Prime Minister to which I referred last week and which I will repeat today.  Sir Patrick Mayhew and the Prime Minister are reasonably optimistic that they can get the talks back on stream by the autumn.</P>

      <P>In relation to the question of Structural Funds, what arrangements will be put in place to recast the National Development Plan, the proposals of which we debated here last week?  Does the Taoiseach intend to extend the time available to organisations throughout the country, particularly subregional organisations, to resubmit plans in regard to the National Development Plan?  Will he indicate also the provision he is making for an input to the submission which the Government will be making by 1 September with regard to job creation by the European Community to which he referred last week?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred last week to the eight point strategy put forward by President Jacques Delors.  I said we would be responding to those eight points from an Irish standpoint before 1 September and I indicated the type of approach we would adopt.  In regard to the first part of the Deputy's question, we have no plans to allow more time for organisations to resubmit plans.  Many cases have been put forward in this regard and the Minister for Finance will be finalising his plan and the negotiations in due course.</P>

      <P>I appreciate and am concerned by the difficulties of growers who have suffered crop damage in recent weeks.  Officials of my Department, in conjunction with officials of other agencies involved, are closely monitoring crop damage in all areas affected with a view to preparing a comprehensive report.</P>

Would the Minister not now conclude that, in view of those figures alone, serious damage has been done to winter feed, to cereal and to root crops?

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the situation.  I am having an assessment carried out by officials of the Department and Teagasc.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea met the IFA and the horticultural group to discuss the extent of any damage caused.  When we know, technically and scientifically, the extent of the damage we can see what measures can be taken.</P>

Will the Minister consider taking some steps, such as <Col N="18" /> those taken in 1985, at least to help people with the problem of winter feeding?</P>

      <P>The EC veterinary fund is at present inadequate to meet the disease eradication programme proposals of a number of member states including this country's bovine TB eradication programme. Technical conditions under which funding could be provided were agreed with the Commission Services at the end of last year.</P>
      <P>I am continuing to press vigorously in Council for an increase in the fund on the basis that the measures must be available to protect the highest possible health status within the Single Market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="19" /> A review of the strategy on animal health is currently being undertaken and it is hoped that the matter will be discussed at the Council of Ministers in the near future.  I am hopeful that appropriate adjustments will be made to the veterinary fund which in turn will facilitate the securing of EC funding for the bovine TB programme in this country.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State not feel that he is running out of threadbare excuses?  It is several months since the promise was last made in this House that that funding would be available.  Will the Minister of State tell us what effect this delay will have on the TB testing scheme for this year which has already begun and which must now be in jeopardy because this funding has not yet come on stream?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The present round is underway.  Obviously the Department is very concerned about TB eradication. An expensive round of testing under the previous programme has proved that intensive testing is not the answer to ridding us of the residue of this disease.  We are seeking extra funding for a research programme to try to come up with a vaccine for badgers.  Work is underway in the Department on a computerised programme relating to the movement of animals.  At the COREPER meeting on 9 June, 1990 the subject of increased veterinary funding was discussed and referred to the chief health officers meeting on 18 June and it is likely that the matter of EC funding will be discussed at the July meeting of the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very valuable information. Could the Minister confirm that if the EC funding is not available nothing other than the round testing will take place this year?  Could the Minister comment on what that would mean for the programme in the light of the comments made recently by Dr. Liam Downey on the need for progress in this area?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 52, 56, 59, 76, 79, 80, 205 and 219 together.</P>
      <P>The disadvantaged areas appeals panel has recently completed its analysis of data from the survey of areas seeking inclusion in the disadvantaged areas.  The results of the analysis are being verified on the computer in my Department and maps of the areas are being prepared.  When this is completed the panel will present its formal recommendations to me.  I will submit these without delay to the Government and, when the Cabinet has approved them, to the EC Commission. The Commission will in turn examine the submission and if, as is likely, the area being proposed for extension is more than 1.5 per cent of the land area of the country, the final decision will rest with the Council of Agriculture Ministers which will make its decision on a proposal from Commission.</P>
      <P>I expect to receive the panel's recommendations during the next month.  Discussion of the recommendations prior to submission to the Commission would not be appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next part of the panel's assignment is the examination of areas under appeal <Col N="23" /> for reclassification.  Under current rules, in order to be considered for reclassification from less to more severely handicapped, an area must be homogeneous, have less than 40 per cent of the national average family farm income per farm worker and have more than 40 per cent of the working population engaged in farming.  Following the commitment given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> my Department has consulted with the farming organisations on revising the criteria for reclassification. Among the changes in the criteria I am proposing is an increase in the income threshold from 40 per cent to 60 per cent and the inclusion of district electoral divisions which fail marginally on the revised income criterion but which have a low land classification provided they are contiguous to existing more severely handicapped areas.  In addition, non-contiguous areas of minimum size block of 15,000 hectares will be considered.</P>
    <P>These revisions will enable many marginal areas to be included while maintaining a reasonable modulation between the other categories of disadvantaged area.  I will be conveying the details of the package shortly to the appeal panel which will then carry out its analysis of the area under appeal on the basis of the revised criteria using existing data.  It will not be necessary for the panel to carry out another survey of areas under appeal.</P>
    <P>Details on the proposal for a third category of disadvantaged area are being drawn up in my Department at present and ongoing discussions between my Department, the EC Commission and the farming organisations are taking place with a view to defining boundaries. I would expect the relevant criteria to result in mountainous and sparsely populated areas on the western seaboard and islands being classified in the third category.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given a good deal of information but he has not given any indication of time schedules. Regardless of what he has said about <Col N="24" /> other areas of the country, in my area of Monaghan many people have not got their first silage cut in yet.  On my farm the silage making is only in progress while on many farms cutting will not take place for some time.  The matter is very serious. We have been promised that something will happen in this regard at some stage but we do not know when.  The disadvantaged areas survey has taken some time to complete.  What analyses does the Minister intend carrying out in regard to areas to be reclassified from disadvantaged to severely handicapped? Some of the desk analyses his staff have been examining would bring in very few areas; the analyses are totally different to the position on the ground.  In one area of south Monaghan an in-depth farm survey has shown an income threshold of 32 per cent while the desk analysis shows 74 per cent.  Will the Minister give an assurance that he will use at least some farm surveys in respect of the disadvantaged areas seeking reclassification as severely handicapped to verify figures he is obtaining from other sources?</P>

In relation to the Deputy's anxiety regarding County Monaghan, I will ask the panel specifically to ensure that Monaghan is given every possible consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that the only areas that will be classified under the third category will be areas <Col N="25" /> along the west coast.  However, there are areas in most counties, but especially in western areas, that should be classified under the third category.  Such areas are located in parts of Leitrim, north Monaghan, parts of Cavan, Kerry and so on. Those areas, as well as the coastal areas, deserve to be classified under the third category.  People in those areas should receive an increased income from funds rather than having to be paid social welfare.</P>

      <P>I take the Deputy's point.  In my reply I stated that sparsely populated rural areas would be included, too.  I am hopeful that this will be the case not alone in western areas and others to which Deputy Crawford referred but to areas in the southern part of the country also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 42 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>EC Regulations require all animals being submitted for the special beef premium to be accompanied by administrative <Col N="26" /> documents in order to indicate to intending purchasers the premium status of the animals and to ensure that the premium is not paid more than once at each age category.  For the present, the BTE cattle identity cards are being used as administrative documents and applicants for the premium are required to submit these cards along with their applications.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I have decided to set up a central office in Portlaoise for processing applications under the special beef premium scheme because I believe that this is the best way to make maximum use of the additional staff being allocated to my Department to handle the extra work arising from the implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy reform measures in the cattle and sheep sectors.  However, offices will not be available for some time in Portlaoise and, in the meantime, applications for the scheme will be processed at a special office in Dublin.  Farmers have, therefore, been advised to send their application forms to Agriculture House in Dublin.  However, I have made arrangements also for applications for this scheme to be accepted in local offices in exceptional circumstances.  Such applications should be put in a special envelope and maked &ldquo;special beef premium&rdquo;. I would strongly advise farmers to send their applications directly to the Department in Dublin because this will help to reduce the burden on local offices as they deal with other schemes and at the same time expedite the processing of applications in the new central office.</P>
    <P>With regard to the loss of the BTE cards which have been submitted for the scheme, the procedures already in place under ERAD regulations for the replacement of lost cards will be applied.  BTE cards are transmitted from the DVO to individual farmers on a daily basis and experience shows that the cards are rarely lost.</P>
    <P>I am fully conscious of the importance of ensuring that the BTE cards are returned to farmers in time to enable them to sell their animals.  With this in mind I have arranged that the cards will be <Col N="27" /> punched and notched at the time the application is being registered so that they can be returned to farmers within one month of the arrival of the application in the central office in Dublin.  As the Deputy may be aware, farmers may not sell animals submitted for the scheme for two months after the lodgement of their application and I am confident that the arrangements in place will ensure that all cards are returned to farmers in time to enable them to sell their cattle as soon as they wish after the end of the retention period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFoxe" hpid="Mr. T. Foxe Mr. T. Foxe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the information in the Minister's reply.  I am sure the office in Dublin will be inundated with cards from all over the country.  It is possible that some of those cards will be mislaid in the Department of Agriculture just as correspondence is mislaid sometimes in the Department as in other offices.  If some of the cards are mislaid will there be provision for the farmers concerned to sell their cattle before replacement cards are issued?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the exercise is to streamline the system to ensure that farmers receive grants as quickly as possible.  It would be a duplication of existing resources to have applications submitted to a local office and then resubmitted to Dublin or another central location.  It is intended to have one central location for the processing of all the beef premium applications to ensure grants will be paid as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the Deputy's concern about cards being mislaid, it must be acknowledged that in handling such a large volume of cards it is inevitable that some will be misplaced.  On the other hand, there have always been procedures whereby if an identity card is not available to enable a beast to be taken to the mart or the factory, for example, the local office can issue a permit in respect of that animal.  I do not anticipate any difficulty in regard to either the operation of the centralised office, which is in the interest of farmers or, alternatively, in regard to <Col N="28" /> farmers who may not have the identification card for the purposes of selling an animal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFoxe" hpid="Mr. T. Foxe Mr. T. Foxe">

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">

Ireland's case was lodged with the court on 4 June 1993.  Since the 380 kg. weight limit is due to come into effect from the first tendering procedure in July, Ireland also applied to the court on 13 June 1993 for an order suspending the operation of this weight limit until such time as the court has given final judgment in the main proceedings.

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 46 and 96 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The safety of all veterinary medicinal products, including sheep dips is a matter <Col N="30" /> for the National Drugs Advisory Board. All sheep dips currently on the market are approved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is not about the safety of sheep dips, it concerns the safety of people dipping sheep.  Is the Minister aware that a study carried out in the UK in 1951, 42 years ago, recommended the use of protective clothing when using these organo-phosphate compounds? Has the Minister reviewed lately the safety directions and the directions for use on these products when they come to be sold at retail level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>All veterinary medicinal products have been approved by the National Drugs Advisory Board.  This process is to determine the safety, efficacy and quality of the product and takes account of all available data in these areas.  The NDAB does not initiate research but evaluates all data submitted by the companies seeking approval, that is, the company must submit proof of safety.  In assessing safety the NDAB ensures the safety of the operator, the animal, the consumer, where food animals are concerned, and the environment. Conditions of use are aimed at maximising protection under those headings. Organo-phosphates presents something of a dilemma between operator and animal welfare.  The risks to human safety are minimised by adherence to manufacturer's instructions in dispensing the product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existence of risk if instructions are ignored is acknowledged but there is no suitable alternative yet approved.  The lack of an alternative effective dip could lead to serious welfare problems.  The situation is being closely monitored by the Irish and UK authorities in a search for an alternative solution for the sheep scab problem.  Indeed, the Department here has carried out clinical trials in relation to an innoculation and we are now proceeding towards field trials.  An organo-phosphate is not involved here obviously but we are hoping that innoculation will prove to be a successful method of dealing with scab because we <Col N="31" /> believe it can lead to eradication rather than control of the problem.  Obviously, the field trials are very important and we must await their outcome.  Innoculation would be welcomed by farmers because not only does it deal with sheep scab but with other problems also and eliminates much of the physical labour involved in sheep dipping.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very interested to hear about the researches that are taking place.  However, I will not hold my breath waiting for the results of those because they have been going on for quite some time.  Would it be fair on my part to conclude from what the Minister said that he believes the health and safety of farmers using these compounds is a matter entirely for the National Drugs Advisory Board and that the Minister is concerned about it?  Would it be fair also to conclude that the Minister has not examined lately the safety recommendations on these packages?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the sheep dipping orders 1965 to 1991 the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry approves dips for sheep dipping.  The approval process involves efficacy tests organised by the veterinary research laboratory.  There are currently 16 sheep dips, a list of which is circulated to all local authorities and the administration of sheep dipping functions is the responsibility of local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 33, 35, 49, 63 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>I will be in a position shortly to outline our proposals to give effect to the agri-environment measure of Common Agricultural Policy reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is likely that our agri-environment scheme will contain a general ESA type programme available to farmers throughout the country.  Farmers would be paid a basic premium per hectare for work carried out under this scheme such as <Col N="33" /> maintaining hedgerows, repairing traditional stone walls, fencing water courses and protecting wildlife habitats.</P>
    <P>In addition, I envisage that farmers who undertake further environmentally friendly farming activities such as engaging in organic farming, managing lands designated as natural heritage areas by the Office of Public Works and tackling overgrazing by sheep on hills or water quality problems in certain areas of the country will also receive an extra premium.</P>
    <P>Overgrazing by sheep is a problem in some hill areas and I believe that the new agri-environment scheme will be very helpful in addressing it.  Also under Common Agricultural Policy reform, a national quota for sheep will be established at 1991 levels and this will remove the incentive to increase sheep numbers soley to obtain the EC premia.  The general question of stocking levels is largely a management issue for farmers and they should avail of the advisory services of Teagasc in this regard.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department have had consultations with, or received submissions from organisations in connection with the preparation of our scheme to give effect to the agri-environment element of Common Agricultural Policy reform.  There are 13 of these and I will not bore the House by reading out the names of these organisations.</P>
    <P>If time allows, it is hoped to have further consultations with the various interests before our proposed scheme is submitted to the EC Commissions for approval.  Subject to EC approval, I aim to have the new scheme, which will absorb the two pilot ESA schemes, on offer to farmers later this year.</P>
    <P>The amount of compensation on offer to farmers in the Slyne Head area of Connemara under the pilot environmentally sensitive areas scheme (ESA) is £50 per hectare, subject to an overall maximum of £1,000 per farm.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that in terms of the agri-environment, pollution grants are of extreme <Col N="34" /> importance?  Funding is available to complete the present schedule, but are there any projections on future pollution grants?  That grant has had an extremely beneficial effect on the environment in preventing rivers and fish kills.  Will the Minister give an assurance that this aspect will be catered for in future funding? He said the money would go towards work such as maintaining hedgerows.  In view of the fact that it is not feasible for local authorities to cut hedges due to lack of finance, does the Minister envisage that maintenance of hedging will be covered under this aspect of the agri-environment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree fully with the Deputy on the importance and effectiveness of the Department's scheme for the control of farmyard pollution.  The allocation under that scheme was taken up very early after its introduction.  Later in the year we carried out a survey of farmers who had received approval but had not yet commenced work and as a result we were in a position to grant further approvals to farmers to embark on schemes for the control of farmyard pollution. That was done to ensure the maximum possible benefit from the schéme and that the money would be fully utilised.  I assure the Deputy that we attach much importance to this scheme and we will be seeking additional funding for its continuation in the next round of Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>On the overall impact of the environmentally sensitive areas scheme on the countryside, Deputies will agree that in areas where the pilot scheme has been in operation &mdash; the Slieve Bloom and Slyne Head areas &mdash; there are obvious benefits in terms of improvements to the overall natural environment.  We are subsuming these two pilot areas into a broader package which will be applied nationally and every farmer who wishes to farm in an environmentally friendly way will be enabled to avail of that package.  It is a worthwhile package and we will be pursuing it further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>What consultations will <Col N="35" /> take place with farmers before areas are designated by the Office of Public Works in the context of the environmentally sensitive areas scheme?  Arising from the Minister's reference to the fact that the new sheep quotas will help to remove what he called the incentive for over-grazing in certain areas, would it be fair to conclude that it is with that fact in mind the Minister's Department has dragged its heels in a most appalling fashion in the final allocation of sheep quotas for this year?  That is only a spurious excuse for not telling people what their full entitlements are under sheep quotas for this year.  Will the Minister stop using that excuse for the bureaucratic delay and get on with the proper job of fully allocating quotas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The numbers are being cut without telling people.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy understands the point I make, that the application of quotas will contain and restrict the excessive over-stocking of lands in areas about which Deputies are correctly concerned.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy does not wish to hear the facts, perhaps he will allow me the courtesy of replying to other Deputies' questions.  On Deputy Dukes's query on consultation, I will read out the long list of farming and environmental organisations if the Deputy so wishes. Extensive discussions have taken place with farming and environmental organisations in preparation of the framework of the package we are putting together which will be submitted to Brussels by the end of July.  We hope to have further consultation with these organisations for the purpose of letting them see the final package so that they may give their views and recommendations on it before it is submitted to Brussels.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I hear the Minister right in informing the House that the amount of compensation payable to farmers whose lands are designated as environmentally sensitive is £20 an acre?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is £50 per hectare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is £20 an acre.  Will the Minister give the names of the organisations with whom he consulted?  The only organisation I know of to whom the Minister has spoken in Connemara is outraged at the suggestion that this scheme, which has been heralded so much and about which so much has been written, will offer the paltry sum of £20 an acre compensation for farmers who are so designated.  This will have disastrous effects in Connemara and throughout the west, from Cork to Donegal. Perhaps the Minister will comment on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to inform the House of the organisations with which consultation took place.  They are: An Taisce, the Irish Farmers Association, the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries, Teagasc, the Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works, the Department of the Environment, the Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association, the Biodynamic Agricultural Association in Ireland, Organic Farmers of Ireland, Forum &mdash; a rural development partnership in Connemara of which the Deputy will be aware &mdash; the Central Fisheries Board and Ground Limestone Producers Association of Ireland.  Department of Agriculture officials met these organisations in the formulation of the proposed new measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the two pilot areas to which the Deputy referred, Slyne Head in the Deputy's constituency and the Slieve Bloom area in my constituency, the level of grant payable is £50 per hectare, subject to a maximum grant per farm of £1,000.  I agree that is a very small level of grant.  Nonethless, from my observation of the scheme, certainly in the Slieve Bloom area, there has been a very positive response to the scheme and the overall environment in that area has improved considerably.  I visited Slyne Head in the Deputy's constituency and met farmers who are enthusiastic about the scheme. Obviously all farmers believe the level of grant should be increased, and that is our aim in the new scheme.  I cannot give a <Col N="38" /> categoric assurance on the matter at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think he will be at a disadvantage in arguing for increased funding to support farming when his Department cut the allocation in the Estimate and should the Department not have a much clearer view of the problems attached to over-grazing since there is considerable permanent damage to the landscape as a result?  Since agri-environment is now part of the brief of the Department of Agriculture, surely it is not sufficient simply to leave it to the mechanisms of which the Minister talked to protect the landscape from the impact of over-grazing? This problem has been evident for a while and we were warned about it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point, particularly in relation to the mountain regions in the west and in Wicklow.  We are not leaving it just to the mechanisms outlined.  In the broader agricultural package there is grant-aid for the housing of livestock.  We hope to be able to take sheep off the mountains during the autumn and the winter when most damage is caused to the soil structure. There is a package of measures along with restrictive controls of the grants in terms of these sensitive areas which I am anxious to preserve and protect.</P>

      <P>We hope to have new proposals ready by the end of July.  They will be forwarded to Brussels immediately. I hope to have the new national scheme up and running before the end of this year, at least to the stage where farmers will be in a position to apply. Although the scheme is a national one and individuals can apply, I hope farmers will come together in groups to make application because that is the only way to make a worthwhile environmental impact.  I realise that I did not reply to a question put by Deputy McManus on organic farming.  While it is now the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, I know from my discussions with him that he will be promoting organic farming and will be seeking a level of funding in line with the scale of industry here, which is not great.</P>

I am aware that the Minister attended a meeting in Clifden.  Is the Minister telling the House that he got an enthusiastic reception at the IFA meeting in Clifden for a compensatory amount of £20 per acre?  That is not what the farmers informed me.

      <P>In Connemara I met a very large group of farmer representatives at an IFA meeting.  At that meeting I outlined all of the agricultural schemes in which they were interested.  I indicated that I would bring in a broader package under the environmentally sensitive areas schemes.  I agree with the Deputy in that one would not find a farmer anywhere in Ireland who would jump with enthusiasm about a grant of £50 per hectare.  We have two pilot schemes, one in the Slieve Bloom area operating very effectively and one in Slyne Head which is now taking off.  I visited Slyne Head recently and met farmers there.  We will do what we can to make the scheme more attractive to farmers.  In future the scheme will apply not only to Connemara and Slieve Bloom but to the entire country.  The Deputy will appreciate the need to have widespread consultation with farming interests.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to maintenance of hedging.  Perhaps he would expand on that.  In relation to wildlife habitats, the largescale burning of gorse or furze at certain times of the year can have a considerable impact on wildlife, particularly birds.  Will provisions ensure that burning is controlled at certain times of the year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>There are regulations in force, apart from the controls in the environmentally sensitive areas schemes, which forbid the burning of gorse at certain times of the year.  That legislation is effective but perhaps not always implemented.  One of the purposes of the scheme is to encourage farmers to maintain their hedgerows and keep them <Col N="41" /> as presentable as possible and to protect wildlife who inhibit the hedges.  We are also anxious to retain stone walls which are part of the traditional environment in certain areas.  This is the package which will contribute to the protection of our traditional environment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 31 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>Arrangements for the sale of milk quota surrendered under the national milk quota restructuring scheme 1993 were not put in place pending council decisions on quota issues in the context of this year's farm prices package.  Some of these issues related specifically to restructuring of quota and in particular to Ireland's successful request for a Community contribution towards this.  I am at present in consultation with the Milk Quota Review Group considering a scheme for the use of the funds and the additional quota available to Ireland.  I hope to announce a scheme for the sale of surrendered quota shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the level of assistance provided under the current restructuring scheme is very low and is unlikely to call for a large amount of restructuring?  Would the Minister agree &mdash; this is the most important part of the question &mdash; that the uncertainty that has obtained since the beginning of May has now turned out to be a serious problem in relation both to the sales of land and the transfers of quota for people who are carrying on with restructuring outside of those schemes? Can the Minister give us some indication when these schemes might go ahead and say whether he will approve transfers <Col N="43" /> drawn up and agreed between participants in the interval but which cannot now be carried out because the regulations are not yet in force?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Dukes that the amount is small.  Ireland is the only member state that sought some contribution for a restructuring scheme but was informed that any such scheme had to be Community-wide.  Even though we were the only country who looked for it the scheme is now Community-wide.  I am in consultation with the Milk Quota Review Group to make the best use of this money.  I am in consultation with the co-operatives in the west and north-west who exerted most pressure for this subsidisation of restructuring in order to devise a worthwhile scheme.  Indeed, they have indicated that they will be prepared to contribute some finance for this purpose.  Therefore, within the next couple of weeks I hope to be able to announce a scheme for the sale of surrendered quota so that a worthwhile scheme can be put in place.  Approximately 13 million gallons have been offered under the provisions of the scheme which, with the seven million gallons, should make a worthwhile amount of milk available for restructuring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister undertake to approve the schemes in respect of which since 1 May last agreements have been reached for the transfer of quotas between producers but which have been held up because the Minister's Department has not been in a position to sanction them due to the uncertainty about the restructuring scheme?  Can the Minister confirm, where voluntary schemes or agreements have been entered into between producers, he will now sanction them without any further question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty that arose was that, though the prices package was agreed in May, we had to await the legal text before we could implement those schemes.  There has been no delay at this end.  I realise how important is this restructuring.  Approximately 60 million gallons have been restructured over the years.  That is important, especially for smaller milk producers in the west and north-west, who had been losing milk over the years to some larger farmers in the southern part of the country.  It is vital to them.  I will ensure no delay occurs in getting this scheme off the ground.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 24 and 73 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scrapie monitored flocks scheme launched by my Department in April last requires individual animal identification. This requirement is acceptable to pedigree sheep breeders.  It is an important requirement in the context of the eradication of the disease as it enables the <Col N="45" /> antecedents and progency of diseased animals to be traced and eliminated.</P>
    <P>However, my Department is reviewing the implications of this requirement for non-pedigree breeding sheep.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In the last words of his reply the Minister anticipated my supplementary question.  It is all very fine to talk about a scheme acceptable to pedigree sheep breeders who comprise a very small minority, whereas many other people involved in commercial sheep breeding are not in a position to operate the scheme, as the Minister has admitted. Will the Minister move quickly to find a resolution of this problem?  Flock identification would offer exactly the same kind of guarantees the Minister appears to be seeking from pedigree sheep breeders in regard to animal identification in that, if a flock is free then, by definition, all the animals must be free?  When does the Minister expect to resolve that problem so that we can proceed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>A large number of non-pedigree breeding animals are traded with Northern Ireland.  We have deferred implementation cross-Border for some months so that we could arrive at a solution which would meet the legitimate concerns of breeders in non-pedigree areas.  We are taking this matter seriously and endeavouring to find a resolution as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 90, 98 and 197 together.</P>
      <P>The position is that my Department has forwarded broad proposals to the Department of Finance in relation to the next round of the Structural Funds covering the agriculture, rural development, food and forestry areas.  These proposals are still being considered in the context of finalising Ireland's National Development Plan.  The Government will shortly make decisions on the allocations of funds for each Department.  No decisions on individual measures to be aided can be made until allocations for each Department are known.  However, I am confident that the provision of funding for the agriculture, food and forestry sectors will adequately reflect the importance of agriculture, food and forestry and the rural economy generally in Irish life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the ESRI report, the position is that the ESRI carried out the task for which they were commissioned.  It is up to the Government to decide whether all or any of the recommendations should be taken on board.  My task is not to argue about the contents of this independent report, which is but one element in our overall consideration of what should be finally included in the National Development Plan, but to put proposals to Government which will ensure my objectives for the agriculture, food, rural development and forestry sectors are achieved.  These objectives are, first, to secure a modern efficient and competitive <Col N="47" /> agriculture and food industry attuned to added value content and to the needs of the market; and second, to capitalise on our green image as a producer of high quality agricultural and food products through the achievement of high standards in terms of the environment, food quality and safety and third, to secure a vibrant rural society through maintenance of the maximum number of viable farm households and the development of the wider rural economy, including forestry.</P>
    <P>As regards headage payments in particular, I have outlined the position on several occasions &mdash; the objectives of this scheme are clearly set out in the EC Council Directive 75/268 on mountain and hill farming in certain less favoured areas, that is to maintain a reasonable level of income for farmers; to conserve the countryside from an environmental aspect and to prevent further depopulation in rural areas.</P>
    <P>These objectives apply throughout the disadvantaged areas of the Community and have been agreed at the level of the Council of Ministers which is representative of all member states.  In my view, and in the views of the EC Council of Ministers and the EC Commission, these payments make a very valuable contribution to the maintenance of populations in rural areas and, as such, will continue to be funded from the guidance side of the FEOGA Fund.  I am confident that decisions by the Government in the context of the overall allocation of Structural Funds will reflect these views.</P>

      <P>May I take it from what the Minister said that he is totally disregarding the proposals of the ESRI report in regard to the use of Structural Funds for headage grants?  Is the Minister confirming that the Structural Funds will be used to continue to contribute to headage payments to farmers?  In particular, what percentage of the Structural Funds is his Department asking the <Col N="48" /> Department of Finance and the Government to approve?  When will the proposals the Minister is submitting to the Department of Finance be placed before the general public and the farming and other interested organisations?  What degree of consultation will take place with the public and the relevant organisation before any plans or proposals are forwarded by the Government to Brussels?</P>

      <P>Negotiations are continuing. I am confident that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry will have sufficient allocation under these funds to reflect the importance of those sectors and, in particular, headage payments will continue to be an extremely valuable instrument in securing a reasonable standard of living for those in rural areas.  On the question of dialogue and discussions with various organisations, I have discussions on a regular basis with relevant organisations, including those to which we gave a commitment to have discussions in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  As late as last week I met a range of farming organisations who expressed their happiness that I am making a sufficiently good case to secure an appropriate allocation of funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>I have asked the Commission of the European Communities to make the necessary proposal to devalue the Irish Green Pound with effect from 1 July 1993 in order that the full effects of the devaluation of the Irish pound, which took place earlier this year, can be applied to farm prices and supports.  My request will be dealt with at the Agrimonetary Management Committee tomorrow.  The effect of this adjustment will be to increase all EC support prices and a range of market related premia and subsidies by a little over 2 per cent.  I estimate that the full year benefit of this Green Pound change on incomes in the agriculture and food sector to be in excess of £40 million. This change will also have the advantage of more than offsetting the decrease of 1.3 per cent due under the EC's agrimonetary arrangements for all our major sectors from 1 July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of premia or compensatory payments under the Common Agricultural Policy, the operative event or date which governs the agricultural conversion rate to be used for such payments for the following 12 months, varies from sector to sector.  Where a devaluation takes place after the operative event, the new rate cannot be used until the date of the following operative event.  It is not always possible, therefore, to apply the <Col N="52" /> effects of a devaluation in a particular year to all premia or compensatory payments. The full effects will, of course, apply in subsequent years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure it was also the Minister's intention to reply to Question No. 86 in my name on the same subject. Can he confirm, given what he said about the operative dates, that the full effects of this adjustment will not apply to headage payments in 1993 and that it is unlikely they will apply to ewe premiums and, if I understand him correctly, to a great many of the beef premium payments?  In view of this, why did the Minister wait so long to apply for this devaluation?  After all, devaluation took place on 30 January and because of the delay in requesting it we have lost a full year's benefit of a further 2 per cent in the case of headage payments, ewe premiums and the great majority of beef premiums.  Has the Minister any explanation for this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I took Questions Nos. 23 and 86 together.  Nothing has been lost in relation to the operative dates because 1 July is the key date.  The Green Pound rate for most livestock premia is set on 1 January each year.  Therefore, the full effects of the Green Pound devaluation will not be felt until 1 January 1994.  Where the devaluation takes place after the operative event or date which governs the agricultural conversion rate used the new rate cannot be used until the date of the following operative event.  Thus it is not always possible to apply the effects of devaluation in a particular year to all premia or compensatory payments.  The full effects will, of course, apply from 1 January 1994.</P>

      <P>Seventy-three animals have been diagnosed as suffering from BSE since the first case occurred in January 1989.  A total of 9,360 animals have been slaughtered under a voluntary scheme for depopulating herds in which BSE-affected animals has been diagnosed. The amount of compensation paid to date is £6,925,849.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the control measures taken by my Department are adequate. The disease is compulsorily notifiable. Affected or suspected animals are slaughtered and destroyed by burial <i>in situ</i> or incineration.  Compensation at market value is paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Movement restrictions are immediately placed on herds in which BSE has occured and the voluntary depopulation scheme is pursued.  Monitoring is carried <Col N="54" /> out at all meat plants and suspicious cases are referred for diagnosis.  The use of meat and bonemeal in ruminant rations has been banned.

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  When does he think the disease will be eradicated?  I appreciate that there is an incubation period, nevertheless, the figures he gave are a matter of great concern, particularly those in regard to the number of animals slaughtered. The general expectation was that there would be no incidence of BSE at this stage.  A very serious incidence of this disease in Munster was reported in January.  I know that the Department carried out an investigation into that case.  Is that report available, has it been published and what were its findings?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>A sense of balance is required when talking about this issue. For example, 90,000 cases of this disease have been reported in the UK as against a very small number of cases in this country. Unlike us, the UK authorities do not pursue a depopulation policy; in other words, all the animals on the holding are slaughtered.  This is a new disease.  I will come back to the Deputy in regard to the case in Munster to which she referred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is not suggesting that we should compare ourselves with Britain or regard anything which happens in Britain in terms of this disease as a model?  The point needs to be made &mdash; the Minister might consider this &mdash; that it was indicated we had reached the end of the line as regards BSE, that there would be a drop in its incidence and that perhaps, it could be eliminated.  However, cases continue to crop up and massive compensation is paid.  In addition, a large number of animals have been slaughtered.  This is surely a matter of concern.  When does the Minister think he will be in a position to say that BSE has been eradicated?</P>

      <P>The question skirts around the reality of the matter.  Last year there were 18 cases of BSE in Ireland while, so far, this year there have been nine cases, obviously a small number.  The Deputy will agree that the measures for dealing with this disease which have been put in place by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry are very stringent and have been effective.  The science and research required to tackle this disease is at an advanced stage.  It needs to be stressed that there is a very small incidence of this disease in Ireland and that we have a very strict regime in place to deal with it.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 225 together.</P>
      <P>Headage payments to farmers in disadvantaged areas are financed by a combination of EC Structural Funds and support from the National Exchequer.  In so far as the EC element is concerned, these payments are currently supported under the 1989-93 round of the Structural Funds.  The next round of these funds will apply over the six years 1994-99 and I am confident that further Structural Funds rounds will be negotiated beyond that date.</P>
      <P>The detailed arrangements for any of the measures, including headage payments to be supported from the next round of the Structural Funds, can only be finalised when decisions are taken regarding Ireland's overall share of the funds and on the amounts to be devoted to each particular activity.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 34, 50 and 97 together.</P>
      <P>EC Regulations governing the ewe premium and suckler cow schemes provide for the establishment of a national reserve and a special reserve for the disadvantaged areas for allocation to certain categories of producers.  The national reserve is to be established by the deduction of premium rights from quota holders and is to be equivalent to between 1 per cent and 3 per cent of the total individual quotas allocated to producers in the State.  The special reserve for the disadvantaged areas is to be equivalent to 1 per cent of the individual quotas allocated to producers in those areas.  The position is, therefore, that these reserves cannot be established until individual quotas have been allocated to producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the ewe premium scheme, individual quotas are allocated to producers who were paid the premium in 1991 and applied for the premium in 1992.  In addition, there are special arrangements for producers whose payments in 1991 were lower than normal or who did not apply for premium in that year because of natural circumstances or the imposition of penalties.  These provisions significantly complicated the work involved in allocating quotas and necessitated the examination of a substantial number of individual files and are largely responsible for the delay in allocating quotas to producers and, by extension, the establishment of the reserve quotas. Furthermore, my Department held consultations with farming organisations on the selection of priority categories for the <Col N="59" /> allocation of the reserve.  However, work on the selection of the priority categories has now been completed and I will be announcing them within a few days.</P>
    <P>As a convenience to producers, my Department accepted applications under the suckler cow scheme up to the end of 1992.  As the scheme provides for a six month retention period &mdash; which in many cases will not end until 30 June 1993 &mdash; not all applications submitted under the scheme have been processed and it will not be possible to establish either of the reserves until this work has been completed. I intend to announce the priority categories for the allocation of the reserve when the reserve has been established.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suckler cow and ewe premium schemes, producers will be invited to submit formal applications for reserve quota and to provide evidence of their claim for treatment as priority categories.  Producers who intend to apply for reserve quota may submit an application for the scheme in the meantime and they will be paid premium up to the limit of any reserve quota eventually allocated to them.  I have set up a new quota section in my Department in Castlebar to process all applications for reserve quota.</P>

      <P>The Iraqi regime is a dictatorship which has brought great suffering on its own people and to its neighbours.  It has consistently defied the resolutions of the Security Council.  Its <Col N="60" /> actions in the Gulf area, the invasion of Kuwait, the massive violation of human rights, the brutal treatment of minorities inside Iraq, have resulted in the imposition by the Security Council of severe sanctions.  We condemn all forms of terrorism, including any attempt by another country on the life of a former Head of State.  Security Council Resolution 687, among other things, obliges Iraq to renounce all acts, methods and practices of terrorism.  I understand and share the very great concerns of the American Government and people that any attempt should be made on the life of former President Bush and support the efforts of the US Government to bring the perpetrators to justice.  The international community must make it clear that it cannot and will not condone or tolerate State terrorism.  Nonetheless I have some concerns about the context in which the weekend attacks on Baghdad have taken place, especially the loss of life.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not agree that expressions of some concern about the weekend's attacks are not adequate to express the concern that many Irish people have articulated about one of the most powerful states in the world launching a missile attack on a city, not only putting at risk the lives of civilians but killing a number of civilians as a result?  This is entirely outside the United Nations Charter.  The United States has no right under the UN Charter to carry out such an attack.  Does he agree that the Irish Government should make a protest in the strongest possible terms to the American Government, as well as raising the matter at United Nations level?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 51 of the United Nations Charter permits a State to act in self-defence in the case of an armed attack until the Security Council has <Col N="61" /> taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.  It is my view that the Security Council has primary responsibility for international peace and security and whenever possible the authorisation of the Security Council should be obtained before military action is taken.  I would point out that Resolution 687 &mdash; the ceasefire resolution that ended the Gulf War &mdash; imposed on Iraq the obligation to renounce all acts of terrorism.  From all the information we have received the planned assassination of former President Bush is certainly an example of terrorism.  The ceasefire resolution reaffirms Resolution 678, which authorised UN member states to use all necessary means to restore international peace and security.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not agree that Article 51 of the United Nations Charter permits only acts of self-defence outside the scope of UN action on an interim basis and pending the raising of the matter before the Security Council?  Can he indicate any basis on which it would have been impossible for the United States to raise the matter at the Security Council before taking military action?  Would he not agree that it stretches the term self-defence beyond any recognisable meaning to say that you can launch a missile attack on a built-up area in a city, inevitably causing innocent civilians to lose their lives, as a step in retaliation against a planned but uncompleted act of terrorism which was discovered and which is the subject of pending legal proceedings?</P>

      <P>It is not for me to try to interpret why the United States did not go before the Security Council in the first instance and waited until afterwards to explain its actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The international community must make it clear that it cannot and will not condone terrorism.  The record of the Iraqi regime's assaults on human rights and international security is deplorable. I have expressed my concern at the loss of civilian life at the weekend.  Another reason for concern is the fact that the raid <Col N="62" /> was carried out while the suspects are still on trial in Kuwait.</P>

Will he make it clear that no State, no matter how powerful &mdash; if we are to ensure that security is based on law &mdash; has the right unilaterally to launch attacks under cover of a United Nations Charter?</P>

Does he agree, now that the United Nations is becoming involved in peace enforcement, that had this missile been fired by a soldier wearing the blue beret the moral authority of the UN would slowly disappear?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">

      <P>I can only agree with the view put forward by the Deputy that retaliation does not solve the problem. From our foreign policy point of view we would like to see the peaceful resolution of conflicts.  Given the difficulties in the Middle East and the difficulties since the Gulf War ceasefire it is extremely important that all action possible is taken to bring about peaceful resolution to a very serious situation.</P>

      <P>Members of the House will wish to join with me in paying tribute to the late Patrick J. Lindsay, former Master of the High Court, Government <Col N="224" /> Minister and Dáil Deputy.  May he rest in peace.</P>
      <P>His long career in public life began in 1954 when he was first elected to the Dáil for Mayo North.  The people of that county and his many friends in all parties and in all parts of Ireland will be saddened today by his loss.  He was Minister for the Gaeltacht from 1956 to 1957 and previously served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education and the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Whether as a backbencher or as a holder of high office &mdash; Government or legal &mdash; he was a skilled parliamentarian and advocate who brought great credit to his chosen professions.  He was a man of great courtesy and charm and a raconteur second to none who enjoyed the affection and respect of all sides of the House and all who came in contact with him.  He was a distinguished classicist.</P>
      <P>All who read his memoirs will readily attest to these qualities.  On my own behalf and on behalf of the Government I would ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to offer our deepest condolences to his family as well as his colleagues in the Fine Gael Party.  He will be much missed by all of us.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a ainm dilís.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the party to which Pat Lindsay devoted his life, I wish to join the Taoiseach in expressing a deep sense of loss at the passing of this great Irishman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pat Lindsay was a proud native of the Barony of Erris, educated in Doolough national school and subsequently at one of the great academies of the west of Ireland, St. Muredach's College, Ballina. He was, as the Taoiseach said, a distinguished classicist.  I think he was one of the few Members of this House &mdash; since the House was founded &mdash; who actually had the privilege of editing one of the books of Virgil's <i>Aeneid.</i>  He was a distinguished Minister.  There are families throughout the western half of this country who are benefiting to this day from decisions taken by Pat Lindsay to extend the Gaeltacht in an effort to restore the strength of the Irish language <Col N="225" /> and, indeed, to promote regional development.  In many ways Pat Lindsay was a champion of regional development before the term itself had been invented.</P>
    <P>He was, as the Taoiseach has remarked, first elected to the Dáil in 1954.  It is worth recalling for Members who have had a long struggle to be elected to this House, and perhaps for people listening who hope to be in this House but who have failed in the past, that Pat Lindsay was unsuccessful in seeking election to this House on five occasions, starting with the general election in 1937, before finally being elected in 1954.  That persistence shows his commitment to public life, his commitment to his party and above all the enormous strength of his personal character.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach has said, he was a man who led two lives successfully.  He was an outstanding advocate, an outstanding member of the Irish Bar and rose to one of the highest positions of the Bar in becoming Master of the High Court, a responsibility which he discharged with a unique combination of legal knowledge and earthly commonsense. In many senses the latter was more important than the former.  To his family and all those who mourn him, and they are myriad, I express my sympathy and that of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>Pat Lindsay was a character larger than life and as one of the great humourists he would forgive us for recalling him in a slightly humorous vein.  I recall the last words of his memoirs in which he said he had a great life, that he had enjoyed his family enormously but that the only regret of his family was that they had not been born before him so that they might have brought him up properly.</P>

      <P>I would like to be associated with the expressions of sympathy on the death of Mr. Pat Lindsay, whom I have known for many years.  I last met him only a month or so ago when he seemed to be in very good form.  It was a great shock to learn only a few minutes ago of his unfortunate death today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Lindsay had a distinguished career <Col N="226" /> in this House.  He was not here continuously but at different times over a long period.  I formed a friendship with him then that remained until his death. Deputy Bruton referred to many of the amusing aspects of Mr. Lindsay's life.  An occasion I recall in particular is that of a celebrated difference of opinion he had with a late uncle of mine on the value or otherwise of free school transport.  He believed the way it was in the old days in County Mayo was better, but he may have amended his view in that regard later.  He expressed his views, whatever they were, with great humour and conviction. He will be missed, particularly in the west which he served so well and to where he retired some years ago.  I would like to be associated with the expression of sympathy to his children on what is a sad loss for them.</P>

      <P>I, too, wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy on the sad and untimely death of Paddy Lindsay, a man who won the respect of many both far and wide in his career as a member of the Irish Bar and as Master of the High Court, as well as during his time as a Senator and as a Deputy and as a distinguished Minister in Government.  On behalf of the parliamentary Labour Party, I extend our sympathy to his family.  We all mourn his loss, a sad loss for Irish public life.  I did not know Patrick Lindsay well but the man who succeeded me told me on many occasions of his humour, intelligence, wit and his camaraderie with his colleagues down through the decades in Leinster House.  Again, on behalf of the Labour Party, I extend sympathy to his family.</P>

Lindsay, but from what I have heard about him he appeared to be larger than life and we need people in this House who have a sense of humour, particularly in relation to their own foibles. Such people are badly needed at times when we tend to take ourselves too seriously.  From what I know of Mr. <Col N="227" /> Lindsay, I would have nothing in common with him politically.  Nevertheless, he clearly made an impression on those who knew him.  On behalf of my party, I extend condolences to his family and friends on his death.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take eight motions and pass them without debate.  It is not unusual to pass one motion without debate, but there is involved here a number of motions dealing with many topics relating to various Departments and it is remarkable that they should be taken together.  The most significant matter is that motion No. 18 on the Order Paper is not being moved. If it were proposed to operate that guillotine for the remainder of the week there would have been intense opposition to it. My party put down an amendment to that motion but it was not circulated because the Government agreed not to proceed with the guillotine motion.  I hope that as No. 18 has been withdrawn the discussions in regard to the business for the remainder of this week and for next week will be more fruitful than was the case up to this morning.  In particular, I want to reiterate the offer that my party made on a number of occasions to the Government, there is no reason this House should not sit beyond 9 July.  We are happy to sit after that date.  If some of the important Bills listed under the former guillotine motion which need time for debate, are to be properly debated the House should agree to sit for a further week in order to do that.  Some of those Bills are fundamental.</P>

      <P>Obviously, I welcome the fact that the proposed motion attempting to guillotine all Bills going through the House this week has been removed from the Order Paper.  I welcome the fact that the Government decided not to guillotine those Bills because it would have led to serious disruption of the business of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal to take Nos. 11 to 17 and No. 19 without debate is a serious matter of using this House as a rubber stamp on <Col N="229" /> what many people may regard as minor technical matters but which in many cases refer to serious international agreements which should be dealt with at some level in this House, either by the House itself or by the special committees which were established with a view to dealing with such matters.</P>
    <P>I should make a point in regard to Item No. 3 which we have not yet reached, to avoid annoying you later.  The proposals give an extra 45 minutes or so to Second Stage of the Defence (Amendment) Bill. However, that is still inadequate in view of the major change in our international obligations.  It seems that it is being rushed through this House with undue haste and time is not being given for a public debate on the matter.  I want to register my protest about the way it is being dealt with and simply point to the briefing we have just had regarding the Foreign Affairs Committee by the Minister for Foreign Affairs which threw up major unanswered questions in relation to the implication of this move.</P>

Three other Bills, the Road Traffic Bill, the Criminal Justice Bill, and the Irish Aviation Authority Bill are finalising Second Stage to provide Committee Stage debate for the committees during July and September.  I do not think anybody in this House would object to that. Of the remaining three Bills a debate has <Col N="230" /> been taking place for the last three or four months on the Defence (Amendment) Bill, the one referred to by Deputy De Rossa, lest anyone think we are trying to rush anything through.</P>

      <P>Aithníonn ciaróg ciaróg eile.  I acknowledge what the Taoiseach said in regard to the revised schedule. However, it was not the original schedule <Col N="232" /> put to the Whips.  The fact that all Bills, except the Defence (Amendment) Bill, are now being taken to Second Stage and going into Committee thereafter is an immense improvement, I acknowledge that.  However, I wish to comment on the matters to be taken by motion without debate and on the specific matter of No. 13 which relates to the European Investment Bank and is, in effect, tantamount to an amendment to the Treaty of Accession to the European Community. It is a matter that could provide a major subject of debate in terms of employment implications.  It is regrettable, and it ought to be recorded, that the habit has grown of taking important motions like this without debate in the House.  Time should be found to discuss that matter.  I apologise for wearying you earlier, Sir.</P>

      <P>On item No. 3, the Taoiseach is misleading the House if he is suggesting that we had adequate time to debate No. 22.  There were 38 amendments last week and none of them was reached on Committee Stage.  Today there are 28 amendments and I foresee that, at most, two will be reached.  This should have been taken in Committee as the other Bills, thankfully, now will be.</P>

      <P>In regard to No. 22, the position, as read out by the Taoiseach, is different from that circulated.  I understand that the debate is now being further curtailed to one hour from whatever time it starts, which is very different from what is here and which would allow for two hours or more.  The Bill is very important. The Taoiseach referred to all the time that had been made available for it.  The Second Stage took three and a half hours and Committee Stage consisted of the first amendment being discussed but not decided, and not getting beyond that. <Col N="233" /> The curtailment of Report Stage still further, from two and a quarter hours to one hour, is certainly not giving sufficient time to debate it.  There are strongly held views in regard to many aspects of that Bill which will now be enacted without any proper discussion.  This is most unsatisfactory. I am prepared not to vote against this further curtailment of time on this Bill provided the Government is more reasonable in relation to the remainder of the week and, in particular, in regard to the proposals in relation to the Tax Amnesty Bill to be taken tomorrow. It is proposed that the debate will go on until 6 o'clock which means, effectively, four and a half hours' debating time.  That is not sufficient.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 11, to delete &ldquo;FORFAS&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is largely similar to the first amendment moved by Deputy Cullen on Committee Stage which, unfortunately, was not completed at that time due to the extraordinary shortage of time for Committee Stage.  Report Stage is even worse because we have only one hour to deal with a total of 28 amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of competing legislation this Bill does not get a great deal of attention. Given the underlying problem of <Col N="241" /> more than 300,000 people unemployed, I cannot imagine anything more important. During my period in the Department of Industry and Commerce I sought to respond to that problem by establishing the Culliton committee, asking it to work rapidly, putting considerable facilities at its disposal, which it used fully, publishing its report within a matter of days of my receiving it at the beginning of 1992 and immediately instigating the necessary steps to have it implemented.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I outlined some of the history of the difficulties that the implementation of this report caused during 1992.  It was discussed in this House on a number of occasions during Question Time and otherwise and the present Minister expressed to me his agreement with what Culliton had recommended. The Moriarty committee, which we set up to implement the Culliton proposals, agreed with it also.  The only disagreement appeared to come from some of the Fianna Fáil members of the then Government and, it was claimed, from some parts of the Department of Finance. The matter became increasingly difficult and fraught with problems and last September it was finally decided, in default of proper agreement, that we should go forward on the basis that there would be two agencies which would be divisions of a single holding company but that the holding company would be no more than a holding company.  I did not agree then nor do I agree now with that concept but one could live with that if it were to be implemented.  The structure contained in this Bill in what is so inelegantly called &ldquo;Forfás&rdquo;, is much more than just a holding company.  It seems to be the central company among three agencies, which is clearly in conflict with what Culliton proposed.</P>
    <P>It is not just a matter of detail that Culliton made certain proposals.  He indicated at some length the reasons there should not be a central company, which would mean essentially carrying on as we are at the moment.  It was agreed by all concerned that that was most unsatisfactory. The Minister on Committee Stage found it difficult to justify what he <Col N="242" /> was trying to do and in the course of his defence of this measure he surprised me somewhat by running down the Department concerned.  I thought that was very regrettable and sought to defend the situation that I had left, which I believe I was entitled to do.  I have been somewhat surprised since to find that apparently one is not expected to do that.  So I was informed in trenchant terms recently.</P>
    <P>It is clear that Forfás is not part of the strategy Culliton devised, that it runs counter to that strategy, that it will not allow the achievement of what he wanted and that it will bring the two agencies together in a way that will allow the overseas success of one to cloud the difficulties the other will encounter.  That is a great pity.  It would be much healthier if two agencies were operating quite separately and independently from each other and not being run from a central holding agency.</P>
    <P>The need to have a large agency devoted specifically to the encouragement and promotion of indigenous industry, with all the necessary support services, has been made abundantly clear in Culliton.  We will have only some of the support services.  The trade and marketing aspect is being taken out and will be located in a different Department. The training aspect, which was to be included in the Bill as envisaged last October, has been removed and FÁS remains an independent body as it always was.  The effectiveness of the proposed structure is very heavily diluted.  That is extremely regrettable.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to repeat all of the arguments as they were set out fully on Committee Stage and I wish to give other Deputies the opportunity to have their say on the matter.  I hope that since Committee Stage the Minister may have reconsidered the position and that he will take the sensible step of accepting this amendment which will eliminate the Forfás concept as it is proposed in this Bill.</P>

      <P>With the very restricted time available to us I will attempt to be brief in my contribution. <Col N="243" /> The responsibilities of Forfás, and the terms of reference set for it are really the task of a Department in proper control of the formulating of policy.  There should not be need for an intermediary board between the Minister and the front line agencies that are interpreting and, it seems to me, substituting for a proper policy-making body within his Department.</P>
      <P>We have not had for either Culliton or the Minister any real analysis of why indigenous industry has failed to develop. It is not that we have had only one agency dealing with both indigenous and foreign but because we have never bothered to evolve proper policies.  Successive Ministers have not driven their Department in the direction of making the long term investment in indigenous companies over and above the short term fix that was available from the foreign industry strategy.  We cannot blame the agencies or the IDA for doing that if the Ministers in control did not make the necessary changes.</P>

      <P>The establishment of this board is an attempt to paper over glaring defects in the series of Government decisions.  The Minister had the good grace to admit they were political compromises, but they were also bizarre compromises.  It is not right to separate An Bord Tráchtála from decision making on industrial policy.  It is not right that two separate Departments make decisions relating to the same companies. We have failed to evolve in this Bill, despite Culliton's recommendation, a coherent regional strategy.  The most extraordinary array of regional instruments will operate here.  The big defect is that no one has developed a thesis as to what makes a successful bottom-up development in Ireland.  All this has been done by a seat of the pants approach, and that is a bad way to legislate and govern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At no stage in the debate did the Minister <Col N="244" /> answer the matter raised by Culliton that was expected would be dealt with in this Bill, that is the lack of coherence in science and technology policy.  There is still the parallel activity of the Minister's Department on the one hand and Eolas on the other.  Culliton rightly criticised the lack of coherence in science and technology.</P>
    <P>Last week all of us on the Opposition benches were dismayed that the reasons advanced for the setting up of Forfás related entirely to side issues such as management of the land bank and staff deployment in the bodies involved.  It is pathetic that those are the justifications for setting up that body.  In this Bill the Minister wants us to accept that this is the empty vehicle into which subsequently all the ideas, all the mechanics will be put, accepting on faith that this vehicle, which last week I compared with a camel, will generate policy.  That is the wrong way to proceed.  We should not produce the bodies first and then, as the late John Kelly colourfully described in this House, when the brass plate is up on the door and the new furniture is bought for the office, the people sit around the table and say: &ldquo;Well now lads, what are we going to do?&rdquo;.  There is an outgrowth of bodies here and we are expected to accept on faith that the real policy substance will come afterwards.</P>
    <P>The final issue I wish to raise is directly relevant to what we are doing today, that is the potential impact on Irish jobs of changes in US tax law.  It is wrong to dismiss their significance as irrelevant. The reality is that they have been aimed precisely at Ireland and a small number of other countries that used the tax code to attract American companies.  The tax liabilities of the American companies involved will be almost quadrupled under the new rules.  The 25 per cent threshold on assets set in US law could easily be exceeded in many cases of American companies in Ireland because as they typically rent their factory space and lease equipment they have a small asset base in Ireland.  We could run into very serious difficulties in that regard.</P>
    <P>Irish jobs in American companies are <Col N="245" /> particularly vulnerable because of the structure of American industry here. American industry is highly profitable but it has very poor linkages with the Irish economy.  To take two examples from recent industrial reports, US companies earn six times the profits per man of that earned by Irish companies and three times the profits earned by EC companies located in Ireland.  By contrast, they buy only 23 per cent of their materials in Ireland whereas Irish companies buy 70 per cent of their materials here and EC companies 48 per cent. Therefore American companies are highly profitable, poor linkage companies and that makes them footloose and vulnerable to even small changes in US tax law.</P>
    <P>The Government should not think complacently that it has won a great victory by virtue of the fact that the US Senate is offering slightly less draconian measures than the House of Representatives offered.  The reality is that even the Senate proposals will have severe impacts on us and will make the IDA's job much more difficult.  We should get an honest statement from the Government on this matter rather than the very complacent statement of a couple of lines issued last week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible to take a different view from that of Deputy O'Malley and say that because this Bill is so narrow in scope and is, in the Minister's words, merely enabling legislation it is not very important.  It is the only Bill that has been brought before the House since the publication of the Culliton report and, albeit, a technical Bill, narrow in scope and merely an enabling Bill, it must be addressed as the only opportunity we have had up to now to raise the question of necessary legislative measures deriving from the findings of the Culliton review team.  Whereas the three parties in Opposition would not necessarily agree on many things, we are agreed that this Bill proposes a structure that is too complex, too bureaucratic, too elaborate, too unfocused, too diffuse and too ineffective for the purpose of the job <Col N="246" /> that has to be done.  The last thing we want is that the last stage would be worse than the first by way of the plethora of agencies and the complex structures that must be weaved through in terms of industrial development.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton raised a very important point in instancing the chicken and egg argument.  In all probability, in any serious examintion of the necessity to revamp industrial policy one would come to the conclusion that you do not start with the agencies.  That conclusion was reached after Telesis.  The Minister nodded his head vigorously the last day, indicating agreement that politicians, governments and Ministers have been all too happy down the years to take the credits and plaudits which the IDA's success in attracting multinational industry have brought and to pass to the IDA responsibility for the negative aspects of industrial development.  Ironically, that is precisely what the Minister is doing here again.  Instead of going along with Culliton, making more clear the focus of his Department and taking responsibility for policy development, he is passing the onus to a new agency called Forfás, whose responsibility will be to do what the Department of Enterprise and Employment ought to be doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was interesting to hear the paternity of this Bill detailed by the former Minister, Deputy O'Malley.  If I understood him correctly, he said that at the end of all the horse trading that went on in the artificial climate preceeding the unravelling of the last Government it was agreed that there would be an umbrella body but that it would be no more than a holding company.  What we have here is a great deal more than a holding company &mdash; in effect, it will be the dominant agency. Unless the Minister has discovered new arguments since the last day, if he falls back on the argument that he has set up this body for purposes of neatness, to cope with land transfers and personnel management, a holding company could very well do both of those tasks, even if one concedes they are as important as the Minister says.  Instead, we have set up a new super agency in whose powers <Col N="247" /> will be reposed the major force in Irish industrial development.</P>
    <P>Until we see the colour of the Government's money on the critical issues of industrial policy of today, which may mean a change of direction in a number of areas, until those policy targets are clear and the Government tells us what its new policy goals are, it is foolish to have rushed into setting up a plethora of new agencies of which Forfás is only at the pinnacle.  Right down to the level of the county enterprise board we have rushed into the creation of agencies rather than giving priority to the delineation of policy and the clarification of many of the critical issues to which unfortunately, we have only a limited time to devote in this debate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton raised an important issue which arose from a matter about which a number of us raised questions in this House, the change in the tax legislation is the US as it affects multinational companies here.  This could be a very serious matter for industrial development here.  Not so long ago it was not the done thing to admit &mdash; because somehow it reflected on companies giving badly needed employment here &mdash; as we now do that these companies used the relative status of this country as a tax haven to artificially boost profits made in this country.  That has been happening on such a scale internationally with transnational corporations that the American Congress felt it necessary to face up to it. The focus of the legislation was not really designed for Ireland.  There are a number of other countries nearer to the US who have been the genesis of this legislation. Nonetheless, even in its moderated fashion, it applies to Ireland and could have very serious implications for our industrial development.  Deputy Bruton adduced some very telling statistics in terms of the relative significance of those companies here compared to other international and indigenous companies.  That is a major issue which we are not likely to have an opportunity to debate.  I welcome the opportunity now given to the Minister to make some comment on that matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="248" /> I hope the Minister does not intend to persist with the complex structure he is now putting in place as we may live to regret it.  We should have preceded this with the necessary policy evaluation and then brought in a simpler, more effective network of agencies, that could do the job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not come as a surprise to the House that I cannot accept this and related amendments.  My understanding of the essence of what Culliton proposed and Moriarty recommended, notwithstanding the political decision of the Government in its programme for Government which was endorsed in the House, to separate trade from the old Department of Industry and Commerce, was that from the point of view of industrial development there should be two separate agencies, one dedicated to attracting mobile investment and the other to promoting indigenous industry. There is no difficulty in recognising that we have separated the agency which will be known as IDA Ireland on the recommendation of Culliton and Moriarty. There is clearly a difference in relation to what Moriarty and Culliton recommended and what we propose in respect of Forbairt, because a Government decision prior to that separated the Department of Tourism and Trade and, consequently and logically, the element of ABT.  Deputy McCreevy and I looked at the possibility of dividing the marketing functions between ABT and Forbairt so that there would be some marketing function in Forbairt but we realised that would make a bad situation worse.  We thought the best way to achieve what we wanted was to get clear co-operation between ABT and Forbairt.</P>
      <P>Deputies said that where we had one agency we will now have three.  We had two agencies, Eolas and the IDA, and now we will have three.  As far as the public and industry are concerned, we had two agencies, Eolas and the IDA and we will have two agencies again in the sense that we will have IDA Ireland for inward investment and Forbairt for domestic activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="249" /> This is enabling legislation designed to meet the timetable recommended by Moriarty, which suggested that the Department of Enterprise and Employment should draft the heads of the Bill by April 1993, publish the text by May 1993 and that the Bill if accepted, should be enacted by July 1993.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>At the end of the day this House is responsible for legislation.  Culliton was not some extraordinary separate Government with a right to dictate. Everybody concedes that the Culliton committee said that the role of agencies in the promotion of industrial activity here is less important now than it was some time ago.  Certainly our perception of our dependence on agencies is less important.</P>
      <P>I accept the comment by Deputy O'Malley about my acceptance of the Culliton recommendation that there should be two agencies from the point of view of delivering services to Irish industry, indigenous and inward investment. That is what we are getting.  The holding company was a compromise which Deputy O'Malley did not like.  It was proposed by a number of people and the Department of Finance, to the previous Government.  There are a number of operational reasons which I do not have time to go into which makes the legal existence of Forfás a useful, necessary vehicle if we are to meet the legislative timetable set out in Moriarty. If I had not done this we would not have any restructuring of agencies until next December and they would not commence work until the beginning of 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton implied that we are preoccupied with agency restructuring in the absence of a clear policy.  I would not like the House to think that this is the only legislation which will come before it and that Opposition Deputies should look at it on that basis.  This is not a considered policy response to the problems of industrial policy in the last part of the decade, It is an amazing mechanism enabling me to restructure the agencies <Col N="250" /> quickly in accordance with the wishes of the House but not to create the kind of super-agency to which Deputy O'Malley referred.  In section 6 (2) of the Bill the Minister can give general directives.  In section 9 (1) the Minister can direct Forfás to delegate specific functions to both the IDA and Forbairt, both of which imply policy decisions being made in Kildare Street, where they should be made.  I agree with Deputy Bruton that that is where policy decisions should &mdash; and will &mdash; be made.  It is easy to be wise in hindsight but, for a variety of reasons, policy drifted from Kildare Street to the IDA.  Policy will be made in Kildare Street, by somebody who is politically accountable to Cabinet and this House. Should directions be needed, they will be given to Forfás, in written form if necessary, so that there is absolute clarity about who is responsible for what.  In response to the argument that this is a super agency, I may add that Forfás will not be able to interact directly with the market and will not be able to give grants or financial assistance in any shape or form.</P>
    <P>The reason we have constructed the Bill in this way is to enable me implement the Moriarty recommendations as quickly as possible, as outlined in the Programme for Government. that is not to imply that policy development is on hold, or that there is no policy development within the Department in relation to focusing, á la Telesis and others, on the need to develop indigenous industry. Deputy Richard Bruton read into the record some statistics about the comparative looseness of connection between American industry located in Ireland, and indigenous industry or other European, non-Irish industry, all matters of fact to which we must have increasing regard.</P>
    <P>In addition to that &mdash; and I am conscious that I am addressing a House with an empty Press Gallery &mdash; the development of the tax regime in the United States of America is of considerable concern.  The former Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, will be aware of the IDA's continuous <Col N="251" /> monitoring of the impact of any changes in the US taxation system on Ireland's attractiveness as a location.  Most of us would recognise that, if our attraction as a place for inward investment is based on the United States Congress's interpretation of tax laws, we shall be in a very vulnerable position.  We must strengthen the attractiveness of Ireland as a place to invest irrespective of how the United States Congress proposes to tax American industry.  The Government still awaits a detailed analysis of how the US Congress, in its entirety, will interpret the changes the US Senate has made to the House of Representatives' tax Bill and its implications for the various Irish-based United States corporations.  Most people will understand the sensitivities associated with that.  The attraction of investment will become increasingly difficult if we must base such attraction more and more on the quality of the Irish labour force and the overall industrial environment in which such industry can locate.</P>
    <P>We are incorporating in this Bill the existing corpus of legislation that established the Industrial Development Authority in 1969, 1984 Act and the 1989 science and technology legislation.  Many of the sections dealing with the powers, responsibilities and remit of the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, now Enterprise and Employment, are encapsulated in this Bill.</P>
    <P>For those reasons I cannot accept the amendment.  Deputy Molloy suggested that an internal administrative arrangement could be devised within the Department to resolve the difficulties to which I referred.  We examined various ways in which these issues could be dealt with and came to the conclusion that Forfás &mdash; in the legal form set out in the various sections &mdash; constituted the best kind of administrative arrangement.  The Minister will be able to direct the indigenous agency and IDA Ireland to implement policy in the manner I have prescribed</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my sad duty to reply to this short debate because we <Col N="252" /> have had no response at all from the Minister but largely a repetition of what he said the last day, plus one or two other points that were not any stronger than what he said then.  It is very disappointing.</P>
      <P>This amendment, with which approximately ten others are associated for the purpose of discussion, is central to the overall approach by the Minister and Government in this Bill.  There are approximately nine other amendments dependent on this one or connected therewith.  For that reason I regard it as important.</P>
      <P>The Minister said one of the reasons Forfás features in the rather meaningful way proposed in this Bill is that it will be more convenient for holding land than dealing with personnel.  The other principal reason was that this House had accepted in January a division of the former Department of Industry and Commerce into Enterprise and Employment on the one hand and, on the other, Trade and Tourism.  It followed that one should have a company of this kind to maintain a relationship with An Bord Tráchtála, which would not form part of Forbairt, as had been intended up to October last.  The House never accepted this.  It was a <i>fait accompli</i> handed to us. There was no debate on it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we voted on the Minister's proposal on 12 January last.  It was not a matter open to us to debate.  I did refer to it in passing because it was indicated that this change would be made.  The change was made outside the House; it was not made by legislation. The Minister went on to say that Culliton had suggested two agencies only and that we really had two only as far as the people who had to deal with them were concerned, those two being IDA Ireland and Forbairt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would appear that the Minister's mathematics are not great because the public or business people would have to deal with some of the following list.  I am not saying they would have to deal with <Col N="253" /> all of them.  Some are mutually exclusive in that they deal with different areas of the country geographically.  They are the following: Forfás, Forbairt, IDA Ireland, An Bord Tráchtála, FÁS, SFADCo, Údarás na Gaeltachta and 36 county enterprise boards.  That adds up to more than two agencies to which the public will be exposed.  It adds up to an almighty amount of bureaucracy.  It is precisely what Culliton said we should not have. The Culliton report did not contain one line about county enterprise boards.  This was something dreamed up for internal political reasons last September, never considered by any Department, Industry and Commerce or Finance, and passed by the Government by way of majority approval of a press release, which is not a great way to do business.  All these other bodies are still in existence which it had been intended would be merged into Forbairt.  The degree of bureaucracy and overlap is really unforgivable.  As someone who spent a couple of years trying to get this problem straightened out once and for all, it saddens me to observe that we are worse off than when we started.</P>
    <P>If I had wanted to keep things simple, I would have been better off if I had never set up the Culliton review group, had not sought over 1992 to implement its report and had decided to leave things as they were.  In that case we would have fewer agencies and fewer complications and would be nearer the one-stop-shop that the Culliton review group recommended. Culliton wanted this for a reason, and not just because he liked the look of it; he gave us compelling reasons but the Minister has not given us any compelling reason it should be otherwise. He has given us three reasons, the first of which is that it would be better if someone held the land but this can be divided between the agencies in any way one likes.  For example, if the land was vested in Forbairt and IDA Ireland wanted some of it for one of its clients they could ask Forbairt for 20 acres or if there was any problem they could approach the Minister and the Department. That is the way it has been done <Col N="254" /> for years in the mid-west where the land is held by Shannon Development.  I cannot recall any difficulties in that regard.  Since most of the personnel will go to Forbairt 200 could be transferred from there to IDA Ireland.</P>
    <P>So far as the decision in regard to a new Department of Trade is concerned it is like saying that because somebody made a foolish mistake we have to make foolish mistakes all the way along the line.  Anyone who has a feel for this situation &mdash; I am one of those because I was there long enough &mdash; knows that it makes no sense to hive-off a separate Department of Trade with a handful of people because the marketing structure would be isolated from where it should be, which is right in the centre of the Department with responsibility for the promotion of indigenous industry; it would be isolated into a cul de sac or a corner where it would be separate from everything else and that would be regrettable.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke briefly about the tax changes in the United States without giving too many details.  Deputies Bruton and Rabbitte were right to raise this matter because, while I do not have the details either, I am afraid it looks ominous. The comments which have been made give rise to concern.</P>
    <P>I was not unduly perturbed during the past year when I heard that it was proposed to make these changes because I can hardly remember a time when there was not some proposal before Congress in the United States to clamp down on American companies which invest overseas. There has been always a protectionist atmosphere in the United States where foreign investment by American companies is not seen in a good light.  The people who usually take that view are also the people who would like to put up trade barriers around the United States to keep out imports.  Their reasoning is similar in each case but usually commonsense prevails.  We have always lobbied strongly and been able to have removed provisions which would have been damaging to this country.  I remember going to Washington on a number of occasions on such errand.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="255" /> I recall that about a year ago proposals of this kind were made but it seemed that they would not affect us seriously because they would not be applied against those countries with which the US had a favourable balance of trade.  The United States is in the unfortunate position where it has an unfavourable balance of trade with most of the world but happily for them and unhappily for us they have a favourable balance of trade with us.  There was every prospect that we would get out under that exemption clause but that must have disappeared.  Admittedly, that was to apply to a certain aspect of the matter, I do not know if the position has changed in the meantime but I am <Col N="256" /> disappointed to hear that we are now caught, apparently for the first time in a long time.  We should make every effort to negotiate our way out of that position.</P>
    <P>Tax law is constantly changing in the United States; Bills are being brought forward all the time, they do not have to be brought forward by the administration, they can be brought forward by individual Senators and Congressmen. The Minister should avail of the opportunity to give the House more details, to state what has happened and state what the position is because potentially it could be serious for us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Andrews) Minister for Defence (Mr. Andrews)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I wish to set out the headings of the proposed amendment to the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1960.  Copies of my speech will be handed out to the spokesmen of the Opposition parties as well as to the Members who will be involved in the currency of this debate.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill before the House is to amend and extend the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1960 which is the legislation currently governing the despatch of contingents of the Permanent Defence Force outside the State as part of United Nations International Forces.  The 1960 Act defines such a force as an international force or body established for the performance of duties of a police character.  The mandate of UNOSOM II is not confined to duties of a police character.  The effective removal of the restriction to duties of a police character is the only material change to the 1960 Act.  The Bill provides that personnel who enlisted in the Defence Forces before the change in legislation takes effect will not be liable for service in the broader role unless they offer in writing to do so and the offer has been accepted,</P>
      <P>While the Bill, if enacted, would be enabling legislation without specific reference to a particular mission, Deputies will be aware that the Government are favourably disposed to a request from the United Nations to supply personnel for service with the second UN Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II).  The mandate of the new Force is broader than any in which Ireland has previously participated, necessitating the proposed change in legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Government have been requested to furnish UNOSOM II with a transport company which will consist of six officers, 23 NCOs and 51 privates. These personnel will operate a fleet of 30 transport vehicles and will be mainly employed in transporting supplies for UNOSOM.  The personnel of the company &mdash; all of them volunteers with extensive experience of previous United Nations missions &mdash; have undergone intensive training in preparation for Somalia.  The unit has been organised to achieve maximum self-sufficiency and <Col N="261" /> will bring its own catering and medical facilities.  Personnel will be issued with small arms and other weapons appropriate for self-defence, although when moving in convoy in the transport role, armed escorts will be provided by other contingents.  Irish personnel will not be involved directly in military operations.</P>
    <P>In deciding our response to the United Nations request, a number of considerations arose.  In the first place, while accepting that there is always an element of risk attached to service with the United Nations, the Government were conerned that Irish personnel would not be exposed to an unacceptable level of danger.  Secondly, the Government considered whether participation in UNOSOM II would be appropriate having regard to our traditional role in the United Nations.  Having seen the situation on the ground at first hand, I can give some assurances on the level of risk but I cannot give absolute guarantees in that regard.</P>
    <P>Because of heightened concern about Irish participation in UNOSOM following recent events, I travelled to Somalia last weekend in the company of a number of senior military officers and of a member of the staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I wish to record, on the one hand, my appreciation of the professionalism of the Army officers and, on the other, the wisdom of the advice received from the person from the Department of Foreign Affairs.  On Saturday, in Mogadishu, I met the Admiral Jonathan Howe, the special representative of the Secretary General in Somalia and with General Thomas Montgomery, the deputy Force Commander on UNOSOM II.  I sought a meeting with the Force Commander, General Bir of Turkey, but unfortunately, on that occasion he was out of South Mogadishu.  However, his deputy Force Commander received us warmly and gave us a general account of what we might expect in our role in Somalia with the other forces.  I met also with representatives of the Irish aid agencies in Mogadishu and Baidoa.  In Mogadishu I met with representatives of GOAL and <Col N="262" /> of Concern and of other international aid agencies.  There were 15 or 20 personnel from one aid agency or another in South Mogadishu with whom I had extensive talks.  Certainly the GOAL and Concern representatives were most anxious that Ireland be represented under the United Nations flag in Somalia in the present circumstances and under the present conditions. The military officers accompanying me also had discussions with senior staff officers in UNOSOM headquarters in South Mogadishuu.  The House will be aware that the jurisdiction of South Mogadishu up to recently was under the patronage of warlord General Mohammad Aideed, a man I met on two previous occasions during the course of my visits to that tragic country.</P>
    <P>North Mogadishu is under the patronage of another warlord who describes himself as an interim president, Mr. Ali Mahdi.  I put that in historic perspective to give a geographical description of who is in charge, and in what region, in the context of the complex situation which existed and continues to exist in Mogadishu, a devastated city.</P>
    <P>While the present position in south Mogadishu, the stronghold of General Aideed, remains very tense that is not the case in the rest of the country where conditions are relatively calm.  I was informed that the Irish contingent will be kept together as a unit and co-located in Baidoa with a larger French unit.  In other words, the integrity of the Irish contingent will, at all times, be respected, under no circumstances will they be separated.  I obtained permission from the United Nations people to go to Baidoa which was not on the agenda, and that was generously acceded to.  It was a worthwhile visit, the experiences of which far exceeded my expectations. While in Baidoa, I visited the French contingent which took up duty several weeks ago, having replaced the Australian contingent.  I also met with the Irish aid workers and local community leaders.  The military officers accompaning me had detailed discussions with officers of the French contingent concerning the precise arrangements for <Col N="263" /> Irish personnel.  In that regard I pay tribute to General Quadri of the French contingent who warmly welcomed us and put all his disposition, forces, experience and information at the disposal of our two professional soldiers, General John O'Shea, Assistant Chief of Staff and the officer commanding the proposed contingent, Commandant Maurice O'Donoghue.  Those two officers had extensive talks with General Quadri on the Saturday evening we arrived and two hours of briefing on the Sunday morning before we departed.  Therefore, we will not be going into Somalia or Baidoa uninformed. Our journey and arrival is well prepared for.</P>
    <P>From the outset, I made it clear that I will be guided absolutely by the professional advice of the military authorities regarding risk assessment.  That advice, based on first-hand observation, is in favour with going ahead with the peace enforcement measure.  I would add that in south Mogadishu and Baidoa, the reputation of the Defence Forces as United Nations peacekeepers has gone before them and the arrival of the transport company with its fleet of heavy lorries is awaited with urgency.  I need hardly add that the Irish aid workers are looking forward to being joined in Somalia by Defence Forces' personnel.  The news that the transport company will be based in Baidoa will give a major lift to the morale of the GOAL and Concern volunteers.</P>
    <P>When I first visited Baidoa in August last year it was known as the city of death.  I saw at first hand the obscenity of famine, people dead and dying in their hundreds if not in their thousands, on the streets of Baidoa.  It was an horrific sight, one that will remain with me forever. Thousands of people were starving without hope.  The Baidoa which I visited last weekend is now a city of hope, a city of revitalisation and resurrection.  The aid agencies, particularly GOAL and Concern, have worked miracles in recent months now that aid is getting through. The work done by GOAL in the orphanage where there are more than 979 children <Col N="264" /> whose brothers, sisters, fathers and mothers have died during the past 12 months is remarkable.  Their achievement is writ largely in that now those orphans are well fed and have some hope that life is available to them.  The Concern feeding stations and the school operating under the aegis of Concern have made remarkable achievements having regard to what I saw less than 12 months ago.  Therefore, very positive things are happening in Somalia.  Desperate things are happening in south Mogadishu and more desperate things are to come, particularly in the context of the upcoming arrest of General Aideed and the convulsions expected thereafter, but what is happening in south Mogadishu is not reflected in the rest of Somalia and in Baidoa in particular.</P>
    <P>I would like to record my admiration and gratitude for the magnificent humanitarian work performed by the volunteer Irish aid workers in Somalia. Their heroism knows no bounds, particularly during the past number of years and more specifically in the past number of weeks.  The generous response of the people of this island has been well placed and they should be justly proud of their humanitarian generosity.  In the past 12 months the Irish people, since Somalia was brought to their attention, have given millions and millions of hard earned money towards the support of the aid agencies in Somalia and I assure them that, having seen the bad days and, as recently as last week, the good days, their money was well spent on the starving people who, happily, are no longer starving. In addition, I pay particular tribute to the voluntary agencies, including GOAL, Concern, Trocaire and the Red Cross for their tremendous work in saving life in Somalia.</P>
    <P>As to the appropriateness of participating in UNOSOM II, given the broader powers set out in its mandate, we should remind ourselves of why UNOSOM was established.  In regard to the background to UNOSOM, the scale of human suffering inflicted on innocent men, women and children in Somalia amid scenes of utter and total despair was <Col N="265" /> vividly brought into our living rooms by the news media.  Pictures of gaunt figures ravaged by disease and lack of proper nourishment with no hope of survival moved the international community to come to their aid.  However, when relief did arrive the warlords of Somalia, for their own selfish and self-perpetuating reasons would not allow the supplies to reach those in need.  Law and order had given way to the rule of the gun, with men, women and children starving to death because the available food and medical supplies could not be distributed.</P>
    <P>The United Nations is the only body with the moral authority to address the crisis, there is nobody else to do it.  If the United Nations pull out, what will be left?  There will be famine and starvation on the same horrific scale, if not worse. Against that background, the United Nations responded first with UNITAF, a mission undertaken by the armed forces of the United States and other countries and now with UNOSOM II.</P>
    <P>Overall, the UN intervention has produced a dramatic turnaround in the situation. When I visited Somalia for the first time as Minister for Foreign Affairs and as the first ministerial representative of the European Community, nothing could have prepared me for what I saw and experienced in those few days.  At that time it was estimated that out of a total population of 7.8 million, 1.5 million were in immediate danger of death from starvation and a further 2.5 million were seriously at risk.  I accompanied the President on her visit last October 1992 &mdash; that visit helped in no small measure to keep the plight of the Somali people in world focus and once again drew attention to the need for an urgent and co-ordinated international response.  When the President left Somalia I accompanied her to the United Nations where we had extensive discussions with Mr. Butros Butros Ghali, the Secretary General of the United Nations.  We impressed upon him the urgency of addressing what was happening in Somalia, which I described at that time as a land forgotten by God. Certainly, the international community had forgotten it.  As a direct result of <Col N="266" /> Ireland's intervention we now have what we have in Somalia, warts and all.</P>
    <P>The first response of the United Nations was to authorise UNITAF, the force initially established under US command, to deploy in Southern and Central Somalia.  It has now been replaced by UNOSOM II which is deploying throughout Somalia and working to recreate a normal environment in which the Somali people can live in peace and security and in which the various aid agencies, including the Irish overseas agencies, can carry out their work.  Recent events have only served to reinforce the importance of UNOSOM II.  Quite simply, the alternative to UNOSOM II is a return to the nightmare of 1992 and previous years.</P>
    <P>UNOSOM II will consist of approximately 28,000 troops drawn from 32 countries.  All these countries are sending their contingents and not one of them has said they will not go.</P>
    <P>UNOSOM II's mandate, which covers the whole territory of Somalia, includes enforcement powers in accordance with chapter VII of the UN charter.  Its mission will be to ensure that all factions will respect the ceasefire, to prevent the resumption of violence, to maintain control of heavy weapons, to seize unauthorised small arms, to secure ports, airports and lines of communication, to protect UN, Red Cross and non-governmental personnel and facilities, to continue the demining programme and to assist in the repatriation of refugees.</P>
    <P>The end of the cold war has produced dramatic changes in the international environment.  In many parts of the world conflicts formerly held in check by the tensions between the superpowers are now coming to the fore.  There is a growing need for intervention on the part of the United Nations.  Ireland has long supported United Nations peace-keeping operations and we support the need to develop further the UN's capability in this important area.</P>
    <P>In many ways the participation of Irish troops in United Nations peacekeeping has become the mainstay of our involvement in the affairs of that organisation. Without our peacekeeping commitment <Col N="267" /> the UN could be said to have little real meaning for us as otherwise our voice would be lost among the voices of the superpowers.  It is in this vein that we approach the latest request from the United Nations to Ireland to send troops to Somalia.  Not to respond positively would be to fail to recognise and support the new enhanced role of the United Nations and also to recognise the role which Ireland, as a small, neutral, independent state, can play in helping to bring about peace and stability in today's world.</P>
    <P>The people of Somalia need help and they need it now.  It is of no use to them for Ireland as a nation to preach to others about what should be done or who should do it.  As a sovereign state and a member of the United Nations we have a responsibility to match our actions to our concerns. To do otherwise would be to shy away from our obligations to our fellow human beings.</P>
    <P>Irish troops have a long and proud tradition of serving in the cause of peace around the world under the flag of the United Nations and have made a very significant contribution and sacrifice in the cause of international peace through the years.  Our troops are highly thought of and highly sought after by the United Nations and it came as no surprise that we were asked to contribute to the force now being established in Somalia.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces have participated in United Nations missions since 1958 and since then over 35,000 troops have served abroad with patience, diplomacy, discipline and military professionalism and have won for themselves international acclaim and an excellent reputation. At present approximately 750 military personnel are serving overseas in 12 countries, a very large number for a small country and a clear demonstration of our support and belief in the role of the United Nations as an international peacekeeping institution.  As a direct result, Ireland's international prestige and standing have been greatly enhanced.  We are seen internationally as a country which is willing to contribute <Col N="268" /> to the cause of international peace in a constructive and worthwhile way.</P>
    <P>It is my firm belief that the Irish people who responded so humanely and so generously in so many different ways to the needs of the Somali people fully and actively support our participation in UNOSOM II.  I also believe that public opinion would be critical of a refusal to participate in this force.  Not to participate would negate the generosity and humanity shown by the Irish people and would show scant regard for the safety and well being of aid workers working in Somalia.  It is not in the nature of the Irish people, nor is it a justifiable moral posture, to stand on the sideline and watch an entire people starve to death knowing that there is something constructive that we can do to alleviate the situation.</P>
    <P>Before finishing, I would like to give a brief explanation of the sections of the Bill.  The four sections of the Defence (Amendment) Bill, 1993, provide for the amendment and extension of the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1960, the legislation which currently governs the despatch of contingents of the Permanent Defence Force for service with United Nations International Forces.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill provides for definitions.  The definition of an International United Nations Force is amended so that it will no longer be confined to a force established for the performance of duties of a police character only.  This is the single most important provision in the legislation.  Section 2 provides that automatic liability for service with a United Nations International Force will be confined to personnel joining the Defence Forces on or after the date of passing of the Act.  Personnel who are serving at present will become liable for service only if they volunteer.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that various provisions of the 1960 Act will also apply to personnel serving with United Nations Forces as defined in the new legislation. This section provides that the requirement in the 1960 Act for Dáil approval before 12 or more armed members of <Col N="269" /> the Permanent Defence Force are sent overseas for service with a United Nations Force will remain.  The section also applies the provisions of the 1960 Act regarding personnel on active service, registration of births and deaths outside the State etc. to a United Nations Force as it will now be defined.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the short Title of the Bill, collective citation and construction and is self-explanatory.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Since joining the United Nations in December 1955 Ireland has played a major role on peacekeeping missions in various parts of the world.  In 1958 Ireland received its first request for assistance when the Secretary General asked for a contingent of officers to take up peacekeeping duties in the Lebanon. Irish officers have continued to serve on numerous observation missions and their devotion to duty has not been without cost.  I refer to the loss of two officers in 1957 and in 1982.</P>
      <P>Nineteen sixty saw the beginning of armed members of the Defence Forces serving outside the country in a peace-keeping role.  Contingents of the Permanent Defence Forces amounting to 55,000 troops helped in no small way to bring peace and stability to many parts of the world.  This service has given the Irish people a justifiable pride in their Army and has brought home to Irish public opinion in the most concrete way possible the aims and achievements of the United Nations Organisation.  Those members who died in the course of active service, whether it was in the Congo, the Lebanon or anywhere else, did so in defence of this country, in the preservation of world peace and of the things this country stands for.  Our involvement in peacekeeping missions has also afforded our troops the opportunity of working alongside soldiers from a number of different nations.  The knowledge they gained has resulted in the development of expertise in the area of peacekeeping to the point that we are highly regarded throughout the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the Irish troops who served <Col N="270" /> abroad under the flag of the United Nations have since left the Defence Forces and applied the skills and knowledge acquired from UN service in their civilian life to the benefit of this nation. Fine Gael continues to support the provision of Irish troops to assist United Nations actions abroad for the preservation of peace.  We also recognise that overseas service has a positive effect on morale in the Defence Forces and provides experience of an operational nature which cannot be acquired at home.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks to amend the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1960, to allow Irish troops serve abroad in a peace enforcing role.  While recognising that this change is being sought to enable an Irish transport company, consisting of 80 troops, to participate in the UN peace enforcement mission in Somalia, it should also be recognised that if the Bill becomes law it will allow for the involvement of Irish troops in future peace enforcement missions throughout the world, not just in Somalia.  While respecting the Minister's goodwill in regard to this request, this legislation will be on the Statute Book long after the Minister, other Deputies and I will have left this House.  This fundamental change deserves a great deal of consideration, particularly as it involves the UN in a vastly expanded role and the possibility of prolonged involvement in local conflicts. Force should always be the last resort in our search for peace and protection of human rights.  It is easy to believe that the use of military power can provide a quick and easy solution to the resolution of problems and this manner of thinking can put aside the use of preventive diplomacy in attempting to bring hostile parties together by peaceful means.</P>
    <P>In the case of Somalia it is understandable that the public reaction to the horrific scenes on our television screens of hundreds of thousands of starving men, women and children would provoke an immediate response to get in there and sort out by whatever means necessary the problem in relation to the people who are causing this holocaust.  I know that <Col N="271" /> was my immediate reaction.  I agree with the Minister when he said that would have been the response of most Irish people at the time.</P>
    <P>The United States justified Saturday's retaliatory missiles strike against Baghdad as its response to the alleged attempt to murder former President Bush.  What would happen to the moral authority of the UN if the soldiers who fired the missiles were wearing the blue beret of the United Nations and were found subsequently to be responsible for the deaths of six civilians as a result of straying missiles hitting residential areas.  The United Nations is arguably one of the most important political organisations in the world.  It is dedicated to achieving and maintaining world order and harmony. For its influence to be lasting it must rely on its moral authority.  No one power or bloc should ever be totally dominant. Ireland's role in this organisation should be to ensure that the mixture of objective diplomacy, patient political persuasion and humanitarian assistance is the best formula for achieving peace.</P>
    <P>Ireland has built a great reputation in the area of peacekeeping.  This reputation has been built over many years and we still have a great deal to offer in carrying out this role.  The Irish personality is very suitable to the area of peacekeeping.  Our soldiers have the great gift of friendly persuasion.  This gift has contributed in no small way towards our success.  There is a danger that if we are seen more in the light of the aggressor in places like Somalia, we will be less effective and therefore, contribute less to the cause of peace.</P>
    <P>When we are asked to perform the role of peace enforcer we will be serving alongside troops from many countries where cultural differences and different values can often lead to actions alien to our way of thinking or acting.  I ask the Minister to consider that the concern that exists does not refer a hesitancy to support the people of Somalia.  I hope that as we debate this request there will be open and frank discussion and that sense will prevail in this regard.  We must recognise <Col N="272" /> that this matter does not just relate to Somalia.  Once people are involved in the area of peace enforcement working alongside people from other countries there are grave dangers in regard to what will heppen in the future and account must be taken of problems in relation to communications, language and cultural differences.</P>
    <P>The United Nations should only consider the utilisation of peace enforcement units in exceptional and clearly defined circumstances.  When used their terms of references must be specified in advance. It is vitally important that those who volunteer for this type of service undergo extensive preparatory training.  While I am satisfied that the experience built up through our peacekeeping missions will greatly assist in peace enforcement, I am not sure that is the case in other countries. The recent behaviour of the Pakistanis in Mogadishu left a great deal to be desired.  Their behaviour could have caused enormous damage to the important role of the UN.  The action of the US, who launched missiles on Bagdad having no regard to the loss of life of civilians, was also very serious.  The Irish Army is trained and equipped for peacekeeping roles.  It has become involved in peace enforcement.  The present type and intensity of combat training will have to be reviewed.  Suitable equipment will also have to be acquired, including armoured personnel carriers designed to provide maximum protection to our troops.</P>
    <P>If and when this Bill is passed I am aware that the Minister will come before the Dáil to seek its approval to send troops to Somalia.  At that stage I intend to question the Minister in regard to a number of issues.  Those issues include the UN mandate covering UNOSOM II troops in Somalia, the UN mandate covering the US presence in Somalia, the level and type of co-ordination which exists between the US and UNOSOM II troops.  I will inquire to what extent the US and UNOSOM II troops operate jointly and, where this is the case, what command and control procedures prevail. I will inquire if they operate jointly <Col N="273" /> under US command and how this affects the UNOSOM II mandate.</P>
    <P>It is important that the role and objectives of US troops in Somalia are clarified. During the Gulf War the perception was that the US troops operated under the US flag, but in reality they were controlled by the Pentagon and used the UN as an agency which legitimised its activities.  Consequently, troops from other nations could be caught up in activities which may not be in the strategic interest of the UN.  In addition, it is important that the objectives of the UN and the US in Somalia are known.  It is of equal importance that the strategy to achieve these objectives is also known. For example, is it proposed to establish a political infrastructure in Somalia and, if so, how is this to be achieved?  Is it intended to withdraw forces when political stability has been restored and relief agencies can function in safety?  If this is so, then a strategy to achieve these objectives must be accompanied by a plan of implementation which must include target dates and a timetable.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to Somalia, I am aware that the transport company which it is intended to send to Somalia is a logistic back-up unit.</P>

      <P>Irrespective of the outcome of this Bill this debate has been useful, timely and long overdue.  It has given people such as myself an opportunity to discuss a matter about which we have deep and long held opinions.  I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the question of live hare coursing, a practice which should be repugnant to any civilised society and which should be outlawed immediately without prevarication. There should be no beating about the bush on this issue.  People who support live hare coursing will acknowledge <Col N="274" /> that opinion in private so there should be no more prevarication in this House by the Government or other Deputies on this issue.</P>
      <P>The contributions to the debate last week were an insult to the intelligence. They were homespun sermons which appeared to have been written for the Deputies concerned.  Those Deputies have an obligation to use their intelligence. If Members are sent submissions on the issue they must rely on their own experience and bring their own intelligence to bear on those submissions and filter them through the light of experience as a Deputy and as a human being.</P>
      <P>The greyhound industry here has long been in a shambles.  Everybody knows it is in need of root and branch reform. Much of the sport of greyhound racing is seedy and shabby compared with greyhound industries in other countries such as the United States, Canada and Australia. Perhaps it is true that it does not receive sufficient funding, it is under-capitalised, but apart from that it is not a professional industry.  There is little point in saying that the killing of 51 hares in Cloonanna, County Limerick, is unacceptable. How many hares must we kill before the practice becomes unacceptable? That is not the issue.  The activity is wrong and it should be declared illegal as soon as possible.  Many of the meetings which we hear nothing about are run in an unprofessional manner.  The time has come for live hare coursing to be made illegal in the same way that cock fighting, badger baiting and pit bull terrier fighting is illegal.  There should be no kicking to touch on this issue today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will not be the end of the world if live hare coursing is abolished.  People can find other ways to occupy their time and can turn their energies and activities into the industry in a different way.  The muzzling of greyhounds is not the answer to this problem.  The hare will not know that the greyhounds are muzzled and on large turfs of grass the greyhounds could break their necks.  Indeed, travelling at 13 miles per hour or more the hare can <Col N="275" /> be killed also.  The hare is certainly terrified in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Government must not fudge this issue.  I am unhappy with its attitude and I say that as chairman of the Labour Party.  My party is opposed to live hare coursing.  This issue must be tackled and as long as I have been a Member of this House, since 1981, I have been sick and tired of Governments saying that Private Members' time is not useful.  That is the stock answer in every case.  Bills could be taken on board and amended on Committee or Report Stage.  That has happened in several cases.  Former Minister, Deputy Collins, did that on two occasions in the past involving Deputy Shatter's Bill.</P>
    <P>The time has come for us to be magnanimous and more mature.  If a Bill can be improved we must do that, take it on board and acknowledge its merits.  It is not sufficient to say that live hare coursing is part of our culture.  Just because something is part of one's culture does not, <i>ipso facto</i>, make it right.  The time has come for the anti-live hare coursing groups to double their efforts.  I hope the Minister and the Minister of State will meet those groups as they have met those who are pro-live hare coursing.  It is important that we have a balance in this regard and I hope the anti-hare coursing groups will make submissions to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The reality is that we must use the time available to us to ensure that we adopt the right approach regarding this issue. We must transform our greyhound racing industry into a professional sport.  It must be made an acceptable sport which families can enjoy.  Live hare coursing, by any stretch of the imagination, could not be considered a sport.  It is barbaric.  It is not a test of speed, stamina or skill between equals because it is two trained greyhounds chasing a hare.  That could not possibly be called a sport.  Some people say that the object is not to kill but merely to turn the hare but that is not the reality.  As far as I am concerned this activity has gone on for far too long here.  It has damaged the image of this <Col N="276" /> country and should be ended now for once and for all.  The Government must grasp the nettle.</P>
    <P>So far as I am concerned, as chairman of the Labour Party, irrespective of the outcome of this Bill I have no intention of changing my views on this issue.  This matter will be raised again whether by Deputy Gregory, another Deputy or myself and I intend to continue to call for the banning of live hare coursing in this country.</P>

      <P>Having listened carefully to the arguments advanced on both sides of this debate I have no doubt but that all who have contributed have expressed sincerely held views, in some cases views and opinions reflecting the speakers background, the environment in which they were reared and their experiences of life.  Those Deputies, mostly coming from a rural background, have tended to support coursing, but conditionally, while those mostly from a large urban background have tended to favour this Bill or a Government Bill which, it is promised, will be along similar lines.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats are unanimous in their condemnation of the unsavoury practices that have been reported as taking place at some coursing meetings and are also critical of the lack of an adequate supervisory role for the State in the running of these events up to now.  Recognising the diversities of backgrounds and experiences of our own Deputies and the different views as to how best this situation might be dealt with in the future, our parliamentary party has unanimously decided on this occasion to allow our Deputies a free vote on this Private Members' Bill which Deputy Gregory has brought before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear to me both from the discussions within our own party and from the views which I have heard expressed <Col N="277" /> in the House by Deputies from other parties, that there is a general agreement that greyhound coursing activities should be strictly regulated or banned altogether.</P>
    <P>In deciding what way to vote on this issue, I have drawn on my personal and practical experience of the years my family were involved with the breeding, rearing, training and coursing of greyhounds, but mostly tracking dogs.  That was for most of my years as a schoolboy and young adult.</P>
    <P>Today I am opposed to the &ldquo;kill&rdquo; in greyhound coursing and the cruelty associated with it and I see the need for comprehensive, statutory controls including the muzzling of dogs, with adequate supervisory arrangements to ensure full implementation and enforcement.</P>
    <P>I have heard the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, promise legislation to implement such measures and I reserve my judgment on hare coursing until I see the Minister's Bill which I hope will be brought forward early in the next session. I listened intently to Deputy Gregory's speech and was shocked at some of the allegations he made.  Indeed, if I was satisfied that what he said was true of all aspects of the activities of the Irish Coursing Club and its affiliates, I would have no hesitation in supporting his Private Members' Bill.  However, I believe in justice and in hearing both sides of the argument.</P>
    <P>I listened to Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, who spoke after Deputy Gregory, and felt that he did not deal adequately with many of the points raised by him in regard to alleged practices and activities in the coursing world.  I asked the Irish Coursing Club for its explanation on the various points raised by Deputy Gregory.  I will mention the response it gave as the records of this debate should show that response for what it is worth.  Deputy Gregory referred to drug testing carried out by the Irish Coursing Club in 1990 and stated that 50 per cent of the greyhounds tested were found positive.  However, I am informed by the ICC that it voluntarily <Col N="278" /> introduced intensive drug testing in 1989. It claims that it has pursued a very strong policy in this regard since then.  It gave me statistics to illustrate developments in regard to drug testing which it carried out: in 1989 of 48 greyhounds tested, only two were analysed as positive &mdash; 4 per cent; in 1990, it tested only 13 greyhounds, six of which were analysed as positive &mdash; that of course would give the high percentage of 46 per cent mentioned by Deputy Gregory; in 1991, it stepped up testing and tested 60 dogs in all, only two of which were analysed as positive &mdash; 3 per cent; in 1992, 69 greyhounds were tested, all analysed as negative and in 1993 to date it has tested 63 dogs and again all of the dogs tested were analysed as negative.  The Irish Coursing Club believes these figures illustrate its concern and indicate the element of controls exercised by it.</P>
    <P>An interesting point came to light during my discussions with ICC officials, that the State-run Bord na gCon, the organisation with control over greyhound tracks, did not carry out any drug testing of greyhounds running at its tracks until after the ICC voluntary scheme was put into place.  Legislation was introduced here to set up Bord na gCon and down the years while the public wagered on the outcome of races the State did not even to bother to require this organisation to introduce drug testing of competing dogs, which one would expect to be common practice.  The point has been made by the ICC that the statistics quoted by Deputy Gregory are as a result of its voluntary introduction of drug testing in an attempt to ensure that its sport is run in a fair manner.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gregory also mentioned that coursing clubs have been convicted of breaching the law.  However, the ICC has informed me that last year one club, Edenderry, was found to have netted hares in advance of the date allowed under the licence.  On being informed by the wildlife ranger that it was in breach of the law, the club members immediately released all the hares back to the wild. The club was however, charged and fined.  The ICC states that this is the <Col N="279" /> only instance of a coursing club found in breach of the law.</P>
    <P>There was also mention of the suspension of Moate-Tubber Coursing Club for a three year period.  The ICC states in regard to this club that it has indeed been disqualified by the ICC from running a coursing fixture for a three year period because it was considered by the executive committee of the Irish Coursing Club that the meeting it had run on 15 October 1989 was not up to the required standard.  The Moate-Tubber Club did not appeal against that decision and the ICC understands that this club does not intend to continue in existence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gregory also referred to the conviction of employees of Matt O'Donnell, a greyhound trainer, for the blooding of greyhounds with a hare.  That conviction, I understand, is currently under appeal and is, therefore, <i>sub judice.</i>  The record of the ICC in this area is to deal very severely with persons found to have engaged in the practice of blooding.  The action taken by the ICC in the past includes a warning from attendance at greyhound tracks, greyhound sales and coursing meetings and disqualification from ownership of greyhounds.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gregory referred to a letter he received from a farming family in New Ross stating that they often find hares with injuries which have been entangled in nets for some time.  If that is the case the advice of the ICC and my advice to Deputy Gregory and to those who wrote to him is to bring the facts of the case to the Garda so that the matter will be properly dealt with and prosecutions brought.  The danger of quoting from letters without stating their source is well known and there is always the suspicion that Deputies may receive fictitious letters. It would be helpful if the Deputy referred the letter to the Garda.  Otherwise he shall admit that there is no name &mdash; or a fictitious name &mdash; on the letter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear the Deputy mention the name.  Activities such as blooding are illegal and if there is evidence to sustain allegations it should be brought to the notice of the Garda.  The Irish Coursing Club who is accused by Deputy Gregory in this matter has sought to defend its position and I am merely putting on the record its response to the points raised.  It makes me wonder about the strong arguments made by Deputy Gregory in the course of his contribution.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gregory said that in Wisconsin in the USA Irish greyhounds are banned from competing on dog tracks.  I am informed by the ICC that there is no ban on Irish greyhounds in any State in America.  I listened in good faith to what Deputy Gregory said and I accept in good faith what the ICC tells me.  There is a conflict of evidence and it must be resolved to establish credibility in regard to the points made.</P>
      <P>The greyhound industry is very large. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, said that £40 million worth of greyhounds are sold here every year and about 10,000 people are involved in the industry, including 8,000 in breeding and training and 2,000 working on tracks and so on. The industry exports about £20 million worth of greyhounds every year.</P>
      <P>It is proposed that hare coursing be banned, but it would be very unfair to do so overnight.  I look forward to the Minister's new Bill, the proposals on muzzling and the strict controls necessary. A veterinary inspector of the Department of Agriculture, or somebody of similar standing, should attend each coursing meeting and have full authority to stop it on the grounds that proper procedures are not applied, for instance, if the hares are weak or are being coursed more than once.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extraordinary that this &ldquo;sport&rdquo; has been accepted here as normal.  It has been run on a voluntary basis with little statutory control.  The State has been very negligent in this matter.  It has been well aware down the years of people's concern at the cruelty aspect of coursing whereby hares are torn apart by dogs. None of us wants to see that practice <Col N="281" /> continue.  Thanks to Deputy Gregory who introduced this Bill, we have an opportunity to take action in this regard. I was a Minister and I have been long enough in the House to know that when Governments do not want to accept a Private Members' Bill they talk about bringing in their own Bill at a later stage. That device has often been used as an excuse, but I have every faith in the Minister, Deputy Walsh, and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, I believe they seriously intend to bring in a Bill to introduce proper controls and regulations in coursing.  If they do not do so, I will support the next Bill brought forward to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gregory's Bill is far too short. The Bill has sought the guillotine solution to this matter rather than seeking to exercise controls which would eliminate the aspect of coursing that we do not like. I will reserve my position on this Bill and I look forward to seeing the Minister's Bill.  I hope we will see it in the next session, before the Christmas recess.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Gregory on introducing this Bill even though it looks as if it will be defeated. Deputy Gregory can take satisfaction from the fact that by bringing this Bill to the Floor of the House he has forced the Government and the Irish Coursing Club to come forward with agreed proposals to muzzle dogs.  Had it not been for this Bill that would not have happened.  The kind of events outlined here by Deputy Gregory and others are not news to the Minister or to the Government.  One of the problems with Irish society is that we sweep things under the carpet rather than confront the issues.  We are afraid to confront either political or economic difficulties. I pay tribute to Deputy Gregory because without him we would not see the kind of measures now being proposed by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Irish Coursing Club were as concerned as are some of their members about cruelty to animals they could have introduced on a voluntary basis the measures now being imposed on them by the Government.  They did not need to <Col N="282" /> wait for legislation in order to muzzle dogs.  I regret that action was not taken earlier by the Irish Coursing Club to deal with many of the difficulties that have been highlighted.</P>
    <P>I will be voting in favour of the Bill. As Deputy Molloy said, our party is allowing a free vote.  That is a healthy thing in this House.  All too often Deputies are forced to vote in a manner incompatible with their convictions. Hare coursing is not a matter of fundamentals for any party.  If the Government is beaten tomorrow night it will not be brought down.  It will not damage the Government if 30 per cent of Government backbenchers vote in favour of this Bill.  On the contrary, it will show a maturing attitude in this House.  It will show we can implement the process that has been under way in most civilised democratic parliaments for many years, where representatives are entitled, on issues like capital punishment and so on, to vote in accordance with their convictions they are not expected to abide by a party Whip on matters which are not fundamental to the party.  They can follow their convictions without being at any loss within their own parties.</P>
    <P>It is not yet too late for other parties to reconsider their attitudes.  It would be appalling if Deputies had to give up their positions in particular parties.  I do not want to personalise this, but like everyone else I have been reading the newspapers.</P>
    <P>Hare coursing is not a question of fundamentals. People do not join political parties on the basis of whether they are for or against enclosed live hare coursing. Although animal welfare is of concern to large numbers of people within all parties in this House and in the country at large, there are different opinions on this issue. This debate has been calm and reasonable because there are two different points of view.  I have attended a coursing meeting and I occasionally go to Shelbourne Park.  I enjoy greyhound racing. Most of the people involved in coursing have become immune to the cruelty, because for them it is traditional.  Many people will say that it is not an Irish <Col N="283" /> tradition, that the British introduced it 175 years ago, but 175 years is a long enough tradition.  Greyhound racing is a traditional activity in certain rural areas. Many of the participants in the activity have become immune to the cruelty that the rest of us see in what is described as a sport.</P>
    <P>The argument put forward in favour of enclosed live hare coursing is that all we are doing is re-enacting nature &mdash; the hunter and the hunted &mdash; and that it is good for jobs and an industry worth £40 million employing 8,000 people.  Economic justification is not good enough reason to continue this cruel activity.  One would never suggest that cruelty to children, if it was good economic business, could be justifiable.  Nobody in this House ever took the view that economic considerations were a justification for supporting apartheid in South Africa. Members of all parties were very critical of other Governments for looking at it from the point of view of their own economic welfare.</P>
    <P>Many people say that coursing hounds is essential if we are to ensure proper breeding strains for dogs who race the track.  People say that there are other forms of sport that are just as cruel or worse and I agree with that.  Whatever about the arguments of those involved in the activity, photographs speak volumes. Some of the photographs we have seen in our newspapers tell us more than anything else just how awful the activity is. I have met many coursing people.  It is a big activity in my constituency in Saggart in County Dublin.  I know many of the people involved and they are not cruel people.  However, a photograph speaks volumes about the nature of this activity, which is quite unacceptable.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Gregory said, live hare coursing is banned in virtually all European countries except Britain, Ireland and Portugal.  There are heavy fines and imprisonment terms for those who engage in it.  It is banned in Canada, the US and Australia.  In documentation I received I was interested to read how successful drag coursing is in Victoria in <Col N="284" /> Australia and how it has enhanced the greyhound industry.</P>
    <P>Society has certain norms.  There comes a time when the average citizen says &ldquo;we have had enough&rdquo;.  The average Irish citizen has had enough of live hare coursing.  The hare is used as a live rope in a tug of war and is torn apart by the dogs.  Deputy McGahon was involved in live hare coursing.  I remember what he said last Wednesday and how shocking it was.  He said that listening to the hare die was like hearing a child squeal and that he just could not bear it.  We must listen to people like him who have been involved in the industry.</P>
    <P>I thank the media for their coverage of this minority pursuit.  Most Irish people have never been to a coursing meeting but have formed their opinions from the education they receive, particularly through the media.  I pay tribute to the media who have been subjected to certain pressures regarding the publicity they have given to coursing meetings.</P>
    <P>Last Wednesday Deputy John Browne of Fine Gael said that the media was biased.  On the following day when we were discussing the sexual offences Bill I suggested jocosely that he wanted to muzzle the media.  Deputy Browne was very upset by my comments.  I withdraw them and apologise for causing him offence.  Deputy Browne certainly does not want to stop the media but he felt they were biased in reporting on coursing meetings.  My comment was not serious but nonetheless Deputy Browne was offended.  I do not infer that Deputy Browne wishes to muzzle the media.</P>
    <P>The media reporting of the February meeting in Cloonanna this year made most Irish people wish to put an end to this cruel pursuit.  Fifty-one hares were mutilated and killed in three days.  I cannot see how that can be a sport.  We need to distinguish between a hunting activity, for example, fox hunting, angling or shooting and what I might describe as gathering people together to watch animals being killed in activities such as bullfighting, coursing, dogfighting or cock fighting.  There is a distinction to be drawn.  Some people will argue that <Col N="285" /> the next step will be to stop angling. There is a huge distinction to be drawn between a hunting activity and gathering people together to watch animals literally being slaughtered.</P>
    <P>I understand that efforts will be made to design a suitable muzzle.  I wonder how realistic this is.  Many hares are terrified and die during the netting period so it is during that period that many of them are in danger.  Obviously the muzzle will not make a difference in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>The people involved in the industry, as it is called, must be distinguished from the activity and the perception most people have of what it is they do.  It is often said that we encourage or discourage certain activity in the laws we make, but when it comes to certain matters people behave in accordance with their conscience.  If cruelty to animals is legal, how then can we draw a distinction between that and other forms of cruelty? How do we say we want this to be a caring, humane society where there is not cruelty meted out to animals or to people if, by the laws we enact, we encourage giving legal status to the killing, terrorisation and mutilation of hares?  I do not believe we can draw that distinction and it becomes very difficult for those who endeavour to do so.</P>
    <P>The ending of live hare coursing would be good for the greyhound industry for two reasons.  Many people would not go to Shelbourne Park or Harold's Cross because of the association between cruelty to hares and the greyhound industry. Many people will not attend genuine sporting meetings because of the association with live hare coursing.  That is a pity because the industry would gain enormously by their attendance.</P>
    <P>Companies are reluctant to sponsor greyhound meetings because of the inference that by so doing, they are putting financial resources in the way of the greyhound industry, that in some way the company would become associated with live hare coursing and cruelty to animals. I understand that is a very common case advanced by many financial institutions and business interests against sponsorship of the activities of the greyhound <Col N="286" /> industry.  The industry is experiencing great difficulty in gaining sponsorship for many of its events.</P>
    <P>Within the context of the debate in this House it is also important that we adopt a reasonable attitude to each other.  While that has been a feature of the debate in this House, it has not been a feature of debate outside it.  Sometimes people, even those who work hard for peace, become obsessed by their hobby or interest.  They literally become violent in their obsession about cruelty to the hare. We have seen some such examples.  At least one colleague in this House has been subjected to intimidating mail from some of the opponents of live hare coursing.  I regret that very much.  I cannot understand how those who want to end cruelty to animals can justify writing intimidating and untrue letters to Members of the Oireachtas or anybody else.  Rather than achieve their aim, or winning support for their cause, they drive people away. Certainly they render some people very reluctant to support anything with which they are associated.  Equally those who defend live hare coursing can be just as unrealistic and unsympathetic to a different point of view.  We should learn from the experience in Northern Ireland.  We must respect diversity, respect difference of opinion, realise that those from whom we differ are not necessarily bad people who are out to get us, but rather people who simply take a different point of view and want the freedom to express it.  Was it Daniel O'Connell who said that, by giving others freedom, one does not diminish one's own but rather enhances it? It is good that we are debating this subject in this House and that there is a debate nationwide.</P>
    <P>For as long as live hare coursing is legal it will be reported by the media.  We cannot expect the media to censor it, to prevent people seeing what goes on. There are some members of the Irish Coursing Club who take the view that it is all the fault of the media, that if only the media would stop reporting these meetings, stop taking photographs, the problem would go away.  The pressure might be lessened but the problem will <Col N="287" /> not go away.  I am not a great advocate of using opinion polls to back up arguments because they can sway in either direction. Indeed the fact that a minority might take a different view is no reason something should not happen.  According to opinion polls approximately 80 per cent of the Irish public are against this activity.  Even if it were the other way round, even if 20 per cent were against and 80 per cent in favour, I would still believe it to be cruel and wrong.  We should follow the pattern in most other countries.</P>
    <P>My party will allow a free vote on this issue, although a majority of the party may well vote in favour of Deputy Gregory's Bill.  The reason we are having a free vote is that we agreed unanimously that that was the best course of action to take, that it would be wrong to expect people to vote against their convictions. I conclude by urging other parties to do likewise.  It would be good for this House, good for politics and a great example to the public who experience difficulty in understanding why we must vote against things on which we feel so strongly when they are not fundamental matters.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputy Gregory again. Even if his Bill is not passed he has achieved much in the response from Government.  This would not have come about without this Bill having been introduced. On that account he can be satisfied he has done a good day's work.</P>

      <P>I come from South Tipperary which has a very proud tradition in coursing and I resent anybody suggesting that this is a sleezy sport, a sub-culture or anything of that nature.  From experience in my constituency and my knowledge of the importance of the activity to the county I know that is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My county this week has gained one of the highest honours within the greyhound <Col N="288" /> industry, with the dog named &ldquo;Ringa Hustle&rdquo; which won the Wimbledon Derby on Saturday evening last, having been bred in County Tipperary by Liam and Sarah O'Brien of Dundrum, owned by Philip and Vera Heffernan.  They are indeed proud today and would be annoyed if anybody implied they were in some way involved in an industry intrinsically linked to coursing and criticised for their activity, which has continuously enjoyed a high degree of control particularly in Clonmel.</P>
    <P>It is also important to note that a coursing Derby was won in a particular year by a dog called &ldquo;Pyramid Club&rdquo; that never once killed a hare.  There is no question that anybody involved in coursing wants to be involved in the killing of hares.  As a matter of fact the greatest cheer of all in Clonmel is to be heard when the hare escapes.</P>
    <P>Members of every party, whatever their personal point of view, need to realise that there are two sides to every story.  It is appropriate that people be afforded an opportunity of putting their view on the record, irrespective of whether it be on a Private Members' Bill or a Government Bill.  As Labour Party Whip, I should point out that we discussed this at length.  We are listening to the advice of our Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry who has suggested that this Bill is flawed.  The Minister and his Department have a wealth of legal advice available to them.  If the Bill is flawed, then let us talk about its flaws.  There is no point in passing a Bill that may suit some people's objectives and then having to amend it.</P>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak about the issue of hare coursing, which is not a simple one and cannot be divided as between town and country.  It is popular to suggest that a person living in Dublin holds a different view from someone living in the country.  Neither can it be divided as between animal lovers and animal haters, despite what some people may think, or considered to be a pastime confined to any one socio-economic grouping.  People who are unemployed or <Col N="289" /> wealthy, the religious, business people, indeed, people from all walks of life have an interest in this sport, which dates back many centuries.  There is however a strong rural lobby in favour of coursing.</P>
    <P>I have received some extraordinary letters in which I was advised and indeed threatened to adopt a different line; but in cases such as this one has to listen to all sides of the argument and make one's own mind up.  As my party's whip, I have an obligation to ensure that we work together as a unit.</P>
    <P>People who course greyhounds take good care of their dogs and, indeed, the hare.  My colleague, Deputy Brian Fitzgerald, indicated last week that it is important to the industry that the hares are healthy.  Therefore they take great care of the hare and like to express their pleasure in doing so.  Approximately 10,000 people derive a livelihood, directly or indirectly, from the greyhound industry, while approximately 20,000 greyhounds are exported all over the world.  We have a reputation for producing dogs with stamina.  This does not mean however that the industry is perfect, that there is no room for improvement or that we condone what happened at Clounanna, which was a disgrace.  I am pleased that the Minister and the Minister of State present in the House have taken action to ensure that there will be no repeat.</P>
    <P>Many communities, including my own, benefit significantly from the greyhound industry in terms of employment in tourism and exports.  It is worth in excess of £3 million to the town of Clonmel.  I am obliged, as a public representative in south Tipperary, to take this into consideration. The international reputation of our greyhounds is based on their speed and performance.  Those involved in the industry claim that coursing blood lines are intrinsically linked with the pedigrees of our greyhounds and their performance on the track.  If hare coursing is banned &mdash; this Bill would also outlaw hare coursing clubs &mdash; our exports of greyhounds would suffer considerably.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to carry out a thorough review of the industry and such a review <Col N="290" /> is underway.  I have to take the word of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, that a comprehensive examination of all the legislation dealing with hare coursing is being carried out within the Department as part of that review. The Minister of State has suggested that it would be inappropriate to amend the Wildlife Act if people believe there is cruelty, and there is some suggestion that there is.  If restrictions are to be imposed, this could be done by way of amendment to the Protection of Animals Act.  It has also been suggested that the Wildlife Service should patrol coursing meetings. Perhaps charges could be levied on the greyhound industry to meet the cost involved to satisfy those who are concerned.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister of State when he says that the kill is unacceptable and he is taking action in this regard.  The Irish Coursing Club has indicated that it is prepared to accept the concept of muzzling.  It is essential that a proper muzzle be designed soon and that trials be carried out at meetings in the forthcoming coursing season to ensure that the hounds are not damaged in any way by the muzzles.  The hare should also be protected.  It should be remembered that their first instinct is to escape.  As I said, the greatest cheer goes up when the hare escapes.</P>
    <P>The capturing of hares will not be excluded under the Bill.  We would have people continuing to capture hares and treating them in a cruel fashion.  Indeed, the industry would be forced underground and illegal hare coursing meetings would be held.  This already happens in the case of badger batting, otter hunting and fox hunting out of season.  People take part in a range of other illegal sports which had been legal in the past.  Just passing simple legislation like this we will not address the problem and could do immeasurable damage to an important national industry.  If we work together in Government we should be able to bring forward legislation which would be of benefit to the industry and to those genuinely concerned about the welfare <Col N="291" /> of helpless animals.  I have no doubt that Deputy Gregory is genuinely concerned, but I only hope that he will not seek to ban fly paper and other products which involve cruelty to animals and insects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to contribute to the debate on this legislation.  I come from an area in north Cork where hare coursing is a major industry.  We have many fine clubs and many people give of their time to develop those clubs.  They are dedicated and caring people and have no wish to damage the hare.  It is unfair to suggest otherwise.  Those involved in hare coursing have no interest in killing or damaging the hare.  They are animal lovers and are very proud of the contribution they have made in improving the industry.</P>
      <P>Recently the Occupiers Liability Bill was debated in the House.  That Bill was presented by Deputy Deenihan and I am still of the view that it was a good Bill. Coursing clubs in my area have indemnified the farming community and property owners by taking out insurance and have sought their permission, which is further proof that they have adopted a caring approach.  I am proud to list the areas concerned.  These include Glanworth, Mitchelstown, Mallow, Fermoy, Rathcormack, Kildorrery, Ballymacoda, Churchtown South and many others which are too numerous to mention.</P>
      <P>I have received the largest volume of correspondence I have ever received in favour of hare coursing; it breaks down to a ratio of 5:1.  I should further state that the people are being asked to ban an activity which has been part of their culture and tradition.  Will the Spanish be asked to ban bull fighting, which is a more cruel sport?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from the heart of rural Ireland and I recall seeing, as I walked to the local national school, coveys of partridges, a game bird.  That sport was outlawed, but despite this we do not have one partridge in my area.  Those who fought to have this sport outlawed and the conservationists no longer worry about the partridge.  Furthermore, the lark no <Col N="292" /> longer graces our land along with many other birds and animals.  These are now protected by Government order.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is passed there will be little or no interest in the hare.  The only groups who have an interest in preserving the hare are hare coursing clubs and those who have an interest in the sport.  The hare may well become as rare in our landscape as the birds I have already mentioned.  A few years ago otter hunting was outlawed by order and since then those who pushed to have this sport outlawed have shown no interest in the otter. None of the Greens has walked our river banks or expressed their concern about the otter.  I can speak with authority on that matter as I own a large tract of land which borders a river where otter hunting used to take place.  Nobody cares about these animals any more.  The people who were involved in that sport were interested in caring for and preserving those animals.</P>

      <P>The promoters of this Bill are proposing to destroy a part of rural life.  If people were more interested in this type of field sport I do not think our level of crime and vandalism would be as high as it is today. Many of our cities and towns have become like downtown Chicago where the elderly are attacked and young people go joyriding in stolen cars.  The people who engage in such crimes have few other interests.  Many of us remember when we went hunting on Sundays, Wednesdays and Saturdays.  That was a better type of lifestyle than the lifestyle many people have today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said about coursing and the large number of hares killed at meetings.  Changes in farming practices and rich grass lands have led to the destruction of more hares than anything else.  It has also meant that hares are not as vibrant or lively as the hares which were used at coursing meetings 20 or 30 years ago.  Once the hares are captured they are placed in cages inside the wire at coursing fields.  Efforts are made to <Col N="293" /> ensure that first class training for hares is carried out before coursing trials.  Unfortunately, the efforts of those dedicated coursing enthusiasts have often been put at naught by the &ldquo;antis&rdquo; who have released the hares on the eve of a coursing meeting.  If the ordinary procedures were followed without any interference there would not be the same number of hares killed at coursing meetings. The people who release these hares have much to answer for.  Several coursing meetings used to be held in areas two, three or four miles from where I live. Prior to the meetings, dedicated gamekeepers trained the hares late into the night.  In recent years some clubs have had their hares released at night by the &ldquo;antis&rdquo;.  This means that other hares have to be captured a few days before the meeting and there is no time to train them.  Coursing clubs have always ensured that the hares are well trained. Unfortunately, their efforts have often been thwarted.  This has contributed to the problems about the number of hares killed at meetings.  The training of hares has always been a very skilled job and it is not possible to train them in a short period of time.  The people involved in the greyhound industry and coursing do not have the financial back-up to employ a night watchman to keep away those people, who are mainly from outside the area, and who illegally release hares at night.</P>
    <P>A specific period should be set for the time the hares can be retained by coursing clubs.  There should be a minimum length of time for the holding of hares inside wires.  I should like to know what vested interests these new animal lovers have.  Ireland can boast of having the finest field sports of any country in the world, for example, beagling and foxhunting. I do not know of anyone who has callously killed hares, foxes, otters or any other wildlife species merely for the sake of destruction.  Last week a Bill was brought before this House dealing with an issue which is more alien than foxhunting or coursing.  Unfortunately, I was not present in the House to contribute to the debate on that Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="294" /> I agree that there can be weaknesses in any system.  Perhaps the codes of practice for coursing could be updated by providing for example, that the hares are placed on the coursing track for a minimum number of days prior to the trials and coursing and are properly fed &mdash; it is very important that they are given oats and water &mdash; that the gamekeepers are properly trained and that an expert will visit the coursing field once a week, supervise all trials and coursing meetings and inspect the hares.  In addition, the hares should be allowed to run a minimum distance before the dogs are released by an experienced slipper.  I have reservations about muzzling dogs as it could damage the dogs and also lead to the dogs damaging the hares if he gets too close to them.  Another problem is that some farmers are reluctant to make suitable sites available for coursing meetings. Many of these farmers have received threats that glass and nails will be thrown on their land if they make it available for coursing meetings.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat surprised that Deputy Gregory introduced this Bill.  He is a Deputy for whom I have a lot of regard. I admire him for the many issues he has raised.  I believe he is having some fun for introducing this Bill.  I know from the smile on his face that he is enjoying the debate.  The House is in turmoil over this issue and it has been suggested that there should be a free vote on the Bill.  The Deputy could have introduced a more relevant Bill dealing with some of the problems in Dublin rather than introducing a Bill on hare coursing.</P>

      <P>Hunting has, by and large, been part of the Irish way of life since the time of Na Fianna and Cuchulain. This sport is not confined to rural Ireland only.  This Bill is the tip of the iceberg; it is the first step in an attempt to ban all field sports.  Earlier this year we saw the total confusion caused by people opposed to hunt racing at the Grand National, one of the greatest hunt races in the world.  I am delighted Deputy Harney referred to people who have written scurrilous and filthy letters to people <Col N="295" /> who support coursing.  I know that Deputy Gregory and Deputy Sargent would not like to be associated with these letters.  I would not like to be responsible for my actions if I met the people who wrote these letters.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gregory said that people who were cruel to children were also cruel to animals and <i>vice versa.</i>  I hope the Deputy did not mean &mdash; I am sure he did not &mdash; that people involved in field sports, particularly coursing, are cruel to their own children and to other children.  I hope he did not mean to imply that people involved in coursing are cruel to other people and to children in any way. That is the clear implication of what the Deputy said in his speech, which I took the trouble to read&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The people involved in coursing have never shown anything but love for the greyhound and hares. Anyone who has attended a coursing meeting will know that all the people at that meeting cheer spontaneously when the hare escapes into the hatch after he has been turned by the greyhound.  They do not want to see hares killed.</P>
      <P>I agree that the meeting at Clounanna was a disaster.  A number of aspects of that meeting have to be investigated, for example, were the hares fit, were they properly looked after and properly fed? One cannot make a decision on hare coursing on the basis of one disastrous meeting.  I ask the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to investigate whether, as a result of our milder winters, hares are coming into season much earlier. If this is so, perhaps the dates of meetings will have to be changed.</P>
      <P>Coursing is a part of rural life.  All of us who grew up in rural Ireland went hunting with our dogs on Saturdays.  We did not go hunting to see hares and rabbits killed.  When we were young we enjoyed the thrill of seeing the dog at work and especially when it would take the scent.  It is the same for those who go shooting &mdash; they enjoy seeing a good dog working, raising the pheasant and then retrieving the kill.  This is what makes the sport enjoyable, not the kill or any other part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate when hares are killed, but the hares which are released subsequent to coursing meetings are healthier than when originally snared.  They have been properly fed and treated well, unlike the rabbits.  At present the country <Col N="297" /> is overrun with rabbits and myxomatosis is becoming more prevalent as prolific breeding has weakened the breed.</P>
    <P>What has happened to foxhunting? People are no longer shooting foxes to get the pelt and we now have a plethora of them.  The foxes are losing their natural ability to hunt because of the scarcity of the wildlife on which they live and now they are scavenging in gardens in towns. I suggest that Deputies will see more foxes killed on the road than ever before. Previously foxes would not come near light or near urban areas but they do so now because there are too many foxes in the countryside.  It is acknowledged in animal reservations throughout Africa that there has to be a system of culling. That is nature: we have to cut back on the numbers so that there is sufficient for the others to feed on.</P>
    <P>I was sorry to read that Deputy Gregory said that Irish dogs were banned in Wisconsin.  That is untrue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's script states that Irish dogs are banned in Wisconsin. As Deputy Ferris said of the six dogs in the English final six were bred in Ireland, of which four came from a coursing breed.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that we should have drag hunting.  It is like Coca Cola which is advertised as the &ldquo;real thing&rdquo;&mdash; drag in any form is not the real thing. Nobody is drinking blood.  Anyone who has gone to coursing meetings will know that the cry is for the hare, once it has been decided which dog has won. However, there is a question about proper slipping methods &mdash; the same applies in GAA matches when unfair decisions are made, for example the referee in the Leitrim match made the decision to allow play to continue and play the advantage rule.  That was unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy was ever at good GAA matches, he would know that some of them involve just a little more <Col N="298" /> than sport, but I would not expect the Deputy to know too much in that line.</P>
      <P>It is part of what we are, it is part of our tradition.  This Bill is not just about hare coursing, it is about stopping foxhunting, shooting and fishing.  There is a combination coming together that will not only destroy what we are but damage a large section of our tourist industry.</P>
      <P>The intelligence of the Irish show-jumper and the cross country horse derives from the fact that they are natural hunting horses.  They hunt over ground for foxes.  In Germany they only allow drag hunting and not foxhunting and now the complaint is that the hunters are disturbing the insects when the horses cross the land.  The Germans, as a consequence, buy our horses for their ability over natural terrain.  We gain from the situation in Germany.  We should ensure that we do not lose our tradition.</P>
      <P>While I accept there has to be an improvement, I question the sudden enthusiasm for muzzling as a solution. In fact, a muzzled dog will cause more damage to a hare than an instant kill because it will either be clawed by the dog or damaged by the muzzle.  I would prefer to see more research being carried out on the effects of a muzzle, not only on the greyhound but on the hare.</P>

      <P>Coursing is cruel.  Which Member will deny that statement?  Coursing people admit that coursing is cruel &mdash; and I know quite a few coursing people. I have lived in Balbriggan, north County Dublin, for 11 years and I have often discussed live hare coursing.  Balbriggan is the venue for the largest coursing meeting in Dublin but it is also the venue for the largest protest against coursing in Dublin every year.  Let us have no more whingeing about city folk having a go at their country cousins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have hare coursing in Saggart, County Dublin, where muzzling was tried <Col N="299" /> and failed.  At Ballough, Donabate &mdash; I can produce the programme to show Members &mdash; the photograph I have in my possession of a mutilated hare was taken. With other members of the Irish Council Against Blood Sports I have been threatened in writing with death unless we stopped highlighting the cruelty of live hare coursing.  The Garda Síochána have taken up the matter.</P>
    <P>It seems that the Government do not want to do anything and at the same time want to be seen to be bending under the pressure of 80 per cent of the Irish people who clearly want an end to the coursing of live hares.</P>
    <P>The ridiculous suggestion from the Government that greyhounds going coursing should be muzzled has been consistently rejected in the past by the Irish Coursing Club, not because it will still allow hares to be injured and die from fright as they do, but because muzzling is cruel and dangerous for the dogs.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the House needs to be reminded of the position of the Irish Coursing Club on muzzling as clearly stated in November 1987 when Mr. Gay Byrne interviewed Mr. Matt Bruton, chairman of the ICC on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo;.  The following is a short extract from the interview:</P>
    <P>Gay Byrne: Is it not on for dogs to be muzzled?</P>
    <P>Matt Bruton: The answer to that quite simply is that it was tried some years ago.  An official trial session was held by the Irish Coursing Club at the South County Dublin meeting in Saggart, as it was then, and it was a total disaster.</P>
    <P>Gay Byrne: Will the dogs not chase?</P>
    <P>Matt Bruton: In one instance the dog broke his neck.  Now I must explain to the audience &mdash; they wouldn't appreciate it.  The dogs had wire muzzles on them similar to what racing greyhounds currently wear on our tracks. And when a dog is driving in to catch a hare or to turn a hare as the case is, obviously when he has no muzzle, he <Col N="300" /> can slide along the ground if he misses his drive.  When the muzzle is on, the effect is that he stubs his nose into the ground and consequently he will break his neck.</P>
    <P>Mr. Jerry Desmond, Secretary of the ICC, has made his views on muzzling greyhounds clear.  He said:</P>
    <P>Trials were carried out and we found that the hares were being damaged by the muzzles.  Hares find it very difficult to recover from injuries.</P>
    <P>A leading greyhound authority, Mr. John Martin, did not mince his words either when he said:</P>
    <P>Those who advocate muzzling know nothing about the nature of the sport. The risk of injury to the dogs is obvious.  Injury can be caused to hares causing prolonged and agonising deaths.</P>
    <P>Aside from injuries to a dog and hare there is the matter of terrorising the hare. Many die from fright.  We should bear in mind that to terrorise an animal is an offence under our Protection of Animals Act.  If muzzling is introduced are they to be used in training and trials as well as on coursing day?  Who will supervise all this?  Will it be the Irish Coursing Club stewards, as previously, that is self-supervision, or will the taxpayer be obliged to pay for a special supervisory body?  What of the dog's motivation to pursue its quarry?  Muzzling can only lead to a massive increase in blooding incidents.  This is fact, not fiction.</P>
    <P>There is only one answer to the coursing problems and that is an outright ban. This is not a debate about whether or not we ascribe human feelings to a timid wild animal as Deputy Dukes would have us believe.  Enough medical research has been undertaken for us to know how coursing affects hares regardless of the muzzling issue.</P>
    <P>I know what goes on before the Annual Park Meeting &mdash; the public coursing event &mdash; because I live in a town which has had coursing on and off since the British army garrison in Gormanston <Col N="301" /> Camp introduced it in the last century. I wish to have that recorded.  Enclosed coursing was originally a very British sport in this country and in Britain it is now outlawed, which goes to show how much it brought shame to those who developed it.  I would ask the Deputies who keep telling us this is a traditional sport to please read up on Irish history. Of course, if some evidence exists that Fionn Mac Cumhaill was a British army private in the 19th century, then we can all think again.</P>
    <P>I would ask Deputy Brian Fitzgerald from County Meath to please show some respect for the memory of Wolfe Tone and stop telling us coursing will unite Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter.  As an Irishman I am deeply hurt and insulted to think that I must allow hares to be terrorised for the sake of gambling and sadism, to promote greater understanding between Irish people who go to different Churches and those who go to none.</P>
    <P>I am not the only person who could be offended by Deputy Fitzgerald's remarks.  In a letter to party leaders this month the Methodist Conference secretary, Mr. Edmund Mawhinney writes:</P>
    <P>In the opinion of the Conference the practice of enclosed hare coursing clearly involves unnecessary suffering to defenceless animals and it requests that members of your Party be allowed freedom of conscience in voting on this Bill.</P>
    <P>In my own town of Balbriggan, the local branch of the Irish Council Against Blood Sports is led by joint patrons, local clergy from both the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of Ireland in Balbriggan. What we are opposing is a barbaric activity supported by taxpayers' money.  I understand that £28,000 was given to coursing clubs last year just to reward them for releasing the hares.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the House what happens to a hare before the &ldquo;big day&rdquo; and the cruelty involved, quite apart from the kill which is obviously an abomination too. At the beginning of the season children are sent out to the fields to beat the <Col N="302" /> hedges and round up the unsuspecting hares.  One vet writing in a coursing publication from Abbeyfeale Coursing Club about the effects of netting on hares stated:</P>
    <P>We have regularly got (or found) strained backs, dislocated hips, broken thighs, broken ribs, cuts in webs, we even got a broken neck and another with his ear hanging off.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes could also learn from the expertise of the same vet who writes:</P>
    <P>It is impossible to completely avoid stress in hares once you manhandle them and take them out of their natural environment.  Stress can come in many shapes and forms and as long as you have the hare in captivity he is prone to it &mdash; resulting in his disability and even death at times.</P>
    <P>This same vet also is very revealing in his advice to coursing clubs regarding the health of hares in captivity.  He writes:</P>
    <P>Hares have absolutely no resistance to infection &mdash; once the skin is broken that is the end of him.</P>
    <P>Tagging the hares' ears is a common practice to ensure they are not coursed at other places.  The vet admits that:</P>
    <P>When it came to coursing time most of the tagged ears were badly infected, in fact some were so bad and the infection so bad that the tags actually fell out through the resulting holes.  The following year I had no option but to change my tactics, so instead of inserting a tag at entry, I just punched a small hole in the ear with a leather punch and sprayed both sides with an antibiotic spray, with the intention of having all the holes fully healed by the time of the trials.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>When I went to insert the tags, I was horrified to find that more than half the newly punched holes were again badly infected so I had to tag most of them in a new part of the ear.  I then realised that unlike cows and calves, hares are continually washing and <Col N="303" /> cleaning themselves and so have a ready means of transferring infection from their contaminated feet to their ears.</P>
    <P>I urge all parties and Members in the House to examine their consciences. Muzzling will not stop cruelty in coursing. In fact, coursing people locally have told me that blooding will have to increase to keep the dogs keen on chasing the live hare.  I particularly urge those Ministers who have championed the cause of animals over the years to act now according to their word.  The Minister for Defence and the Marine, Deputy Andrews, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy M. Higgins, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt, and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Stagg, are all renowned for their commitment to the campaign to abolish coursing.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Stagg, in a statement to a rally on hare coursing in Balbriggan said:</P>
    <P>On behalf of myself and the Labour Party I want to express my full and unequivocal support for the banning of hare coursing in Ireland.  It is a travesty that hare coursing is referred to as &ldquo;a sport&rdquo;.  It is a sadistic, cruel and barbarous activity and it is a discredit to our society that such activities remain legal.  The vast majority of Irish people want this activity banned and the Labour Party commits itself to working with any other political party in Dáil Éireann to bring about an end to hare coursing.</P>
    <P>Where are the vast majority of Deputies in Labour and Fianna Fáil who say they are opposed to coursing?  I urge them all to vote for this Wildlife Bill and allow it to be amended &mdash; if they wish &mdash; on Committee Stage.  I would ask them not to be deaf to the people of Ireland.  I would ask them to remember that the Irish Council Against Blood Sports has <Col N="304" /> branches in many rural areas in the four provinces and its headquarters are in Cork.  Listen to the cry of the hare at a coursing meeting &mdash; an innocent victim of coursing &mdash; and vote for the Bill because this is what you are voting against.</P>

      <P>I want to speak in support of Deputy Gregory's Bill.  I listened with interest to Deputy Davern evoking Fionn Mac Cumhaill in defence of his position.  The proponents of hare coursing claim that hare coursing, both park and open, is an ancient Irish sport which has been enjoyed by our fellow country men from pre-Christian times.  I have no doubt a similar argument was put forward when cock fighting or dog fighting was being made illegal.  Indeed, bear baiting had some kind of tradition but that did not alter the fact that it was a cruel sport. The House will be aware that in ancient times there was a sport known as &ldquo;throwing the Christians to the lions&rdquo; and probably somebody stood up in the Senate then to argue the case that it was not really cruel.  Nowadays the Italians have banned live hare coursing.  They probably let their blood loose in other directions as regards songbirds and so on, but that is another story.  The fact that we are in a minority in Europe in allowing live hare coursing is something we need to remember when we hear some of the more outrageous comments from people who support this activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Dukes that we should not impose human values on the animal world.  I am not concerned about the effects of live hare coursing on the animal world but I am concerned about its impact on humans and what it says about us tolerating such an activity.  I am not a vegetarian, I have no objection to fishing, to the Grand National &mdash; except that it should be managed properly &mdash; or other sports that people enjoy, but cruelty is inherent in hare coursing.  It is a spectacle based on cruelty watched by <Col N="305" /> humans.  Giving licence to enjoy cruelty against animals makes a statement about how we relate to one another.  This has nothing to do with whether those who attend hare coursing meetings care for their children, it relates to the way society operates.  Deciding what society should tolerate in regard to animals is nothing new in respect of enacting legislation. That matter comes up for discussion from time to time and I am glad Deputy Gregory gave us an opportunity to discuss it today.</P>
    <P>Many traditions have been consigned to history as society progressed, that is what progress is about.  We should not be afraid to recognise that change is inherent in every facet of our life, including sport. In this instance, we should not run away from the fact that the killing of hares is an integral part of hare coursing.  There was a fatality rate of 33 per cent at the premier event of the coursing year at Clounanna in February.  The scarcity of hares in recent years &mdash; a fact recognised by coursing clubs &mdash; is obviously giving rise to the use of poor quality and sick hares at coursing events.  It would be interesting to read the reports of those clubs on the Clounanna meeting. Recoursing is not uncommon and things are done that should not be done.  A journalist of the sporting press stated that it will no longer be possible to cover up the bad meetings which, unfortunately, crop up from time to time.  Bad meetings involve the coursing of sick hares, the doping of greyhounds and the recoursing of hares, sometimes on the same day.</P>
    <P>The Irish Coursing Club rules stipulate that, immediately after the conclusion of a coursing meeting hares, should be earmarked and released back to the wild. It has been stated in this House that those rules are broken and many hares never make it back to the wild.  That poor level of regulation leads me to believe that, apart from the eloquent argument against muzzling put forward by a number of Fianna Fáil Deputies, muzzling is not the answer.  Not only does it not protect the hare and damage the dogs, it may prove unenforceable.  Some time ago a Bill relating to the muzzling of certain breeds <Col N="306" /> of dogs and keeping dogs under control was passed in this House which resulted in an improvement but the regulations are not monitored fully and people are not complying with them.  If it is difficult to monitor control on city streets, I can imagine how much more difficult it would be to monitor it at rural coursing events.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of hare coursing which, no matter what regulations are introduced, will be difficult to stamp out is the practice of blooding which involves the feeding of live animals &mdash; usually rabbits &mdash; to dogs.  That practice is illegal but it is taking place.  The argument put forward that we cannot legislate against it, because it is something which people want to do is extraordinary.  People would like to engage in many illegal acts but the law prevents it.  That is what a civilised society is all about.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that attitudes have changed in relation to hare coursing.  For much of rural Ireland hare coursing has provided a much loved and celebrated social and sporting focus.  It is a part of rural life, although that is not the case in County Wicklow.  I am told no Wicklow farmer could afford to feed a greyhound. Whatever the reason, I acknowledge that hare coursing has been part of rural life here, but that, like every other facet of Irish life it is changing.  It cannot be allowed to continue and flourish.  There is a perception that coursing without a live hare cannot develop because it would involve a change in attitude and that people involved in hare coursing cannot adapt to such change.  The idea of replacing the live hare with technology is feasible. There is a model for this in other countries and it would offer an opportunity for those who enjoy coursing to do so with the blessing of the public, which is important, because people are conscious of the cruelty which is part and parcel of hare coursing.</P>
    <P>The defensiveness shown by organisers highlights a rection to the new awareness. The fact that some TDs must go to hare coursing meetings incognito to discover what takes place speaks for itself, because TDs could never be described as shrinking violets in public places.  The <Col N="307" /> defensiveness shown by organisers is also worth noting.  Members of the media who have attended such meetings to see the cruelty involved have been subjected to threats and harassment.  But that type of suppression is not effective in the long term.  Modern technology and communications ensure that the reality of hare coursing cannot be concealed and no amount of invoking the name of Fionn Mac Cumhaill will change that reality. Technology could provide the excitement and element of competition in hare coursing at present and this is evident in Australia, which is not known as a country of wimps.  Its white community, who originated from convicts and settlers, would be surprised if anyone thought they were afraid to face up to the harsh realities of life.  The Aboriginal community have always maintained close contact with the natural landscape and its wild animals. Australia has successfully made the leap sought in this Bill and which will continue to be demanded in regard to taking the element of casual cruelty out of hare coursing.  We have not been told why we cannot do that.  Arguments against muzzling have been put forward from both sides of the House, but those relating to replacing the hare with a lure were not dealt with.</P>
    <P>If we take the live hare out of coursing we will set a new direction, not just in relation to the animal world but in how we view ourselves and society as a whole. Other countries have made that leap successfully, we should do the same.  The fears expressed by the pro-hare coursing lobby were, doubtless, expressed elsewhere but if those fears are not faced down once and for all, the cruelty attached to hare coursing will continue to damage our tourism business and our sporting traditions or simply the way we relate to each other as human and humane beings.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Gregory for introducing this Bill, which should be supported.  We can learn from other countries how to move forward instead of being stuck in a rut and stating blindly <Col N="308" /> that tradition must always rule.  I ask Deputies to support this Bill.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the Irish Army transport company, which it is intended to send to Somalia, is a logistic back-up unit.  What type of protection will the UN commander on the ground afford to this Irish unit when it carries out the various logistical tasks assigned to it?  It is important that we know exactly what role the transport unit will be expected to perform, the type of protection they will receive and if the Minister is satisfied that all reasonable precautions will be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like the Minister to indicate if any special allowance will be paid to Irish troops serving on peace enforcement missions which would reflect the additional risk involved and if he will consider introducing some sort of compensation scheme, perhaps by way of life assurance, for members of the Defence Forces who lose their lives while on active service.  The Defence Forces are very far behind the Garda Síochána in terms of the type of compensation that is available to them.  It is only reasonable that we as a country should respect the services given by members of the Defence Forces and be in a position to make some compensation available if they are unfortunate enough to lose their lives on active service.  Members of the Garda Síochána deserve the same treatment.  Most pension schemes in the private sector and in the public sector include a death-in-service benefit, and they do not have to face the risks that members of the Garda Síochána or of the Defence Forces face. For that reason it is reasonable that we examine the possibility of providing compensation, and it could be self-funded if we use the National Treasury Agency to manage the scheme.  Will the Minister consider reviewing this matter and make <Col N="309" /> some reference to it when replying to the debate?</P>
    <P>On behalf of Fine Gael, I intend to try to amend the Bill to ensure that each request from the United Nations for a peace enforcement unit to serve on a particular mission will be examined in detail by the Dáil.  It is important that all who serve on such missions do so on a voluntary basis.  I appreciate that the 1960 Act does provide for a Dáil motion before persons may be dispatched on a peacekeeping mission.  However, this is a new departure in so far as we are involved in peace enforcement.  It would be well worth our while to review that section of the 1960 Act so that all persons serving in the Defence Forces, at present and in the future, would serve on peace enforcement missions on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer the Minister to the document produced by Mr. Boutros Boutros Ghali, <i>An Agenda for Peace</i>, in which he referred to peace enforcement units and said:</P>
    <P>I recommend that the Council consider the ultilisation of peace enforcement units in clearly defined circumstances and with the terms of reference specified in advance.  Such units from member states would be available on call and would consist of troops that have volunteered for such service.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the Secretry-General felt that anybody serving in such a unit should be doing so on a voluntary basis. I see no justification for differentiating between those who are presently serving and those who may join after this Bill is enacted.  If we are asking people to serve on a peace enforcement mission it should be on a voluntary basis and I strongly recommend that the Minister consider the amendment I will be putting down on Committee Stage.  It is particularly important that serving on peace enforcement missions should be on a voluntary basis in view of the fact that the average age of those serving in the Permanent Defence Forces at present is 35, which means that quite a considerable percentage <Col N="310" /> would be married persons.  It may be easy for us to agree to despatch a contingent of the Defence Forces to Somalia or anywhere else for peace enforcement purposes, but we must also consider the natural concern of the spouses of serving members.  Making this voluntary service would enable people to discuss in the privacy of their own homes whether they should or should not take part in a peace enforcement mission.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important that the Dáil be given the opportunity to review its position on each peace enforcement mission and on each and every occasion the UN mandate is up for renewal by the UN Security Council.  I will be tabling an amendment on Committee Stage to provide that after 12 months, and annually thereafter, the Dáil would review the involvement of an Irish contingent on a peace enforcement mission.  That would enable the Dáil to express any concerns it may have, in the case of a long running mission, about the length of time our troops will be in service on that mission. I see no reason that the Dail should not be given the opportunity to review the position every 12 months.  It is a reasonable request.  I will table an amendment on Committee Stage and I hope the Minister and the Government will accept that amendment.  Fine Gael approves in principle providing Irish troops to assist UN action abroad in the preservation of peace.  It approves the principle of this Bill, subject to the reservations which I have outlined and which Fine Gael will seek to incorporate into the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It would be easy for my party in Opposition to play politics on this issue, but it is too important an issue to engage in such activity.  All Members have the highest regard for members of the Defence Forces.  I am careful not to instil any unnecessary fear in the wives of those who may be going to serve abroad.  We should be conscious of that.  We reserve the right to express our views in regard to each individual request made by the UN.  I hope Governments in the future will be forthcoming in providing information on peacekeeping missions in <Col N="311" /> Somalia and other areas.  I am sure the Minister will do that.  He has shown his concern by visiting Somalia.  We should not put unnecessary pressure on the Government in relation to this mission. Every attempt has been made to ensure that our troops will be properly protected. However, it is important that we ask questions and if the answers to those questions are not satisfactory we should continue to ask more questions.</P>
    <P>My party have too much respect for the Defence Forces to play politics in regard to such a serious issue.  If it is decided that our troops should go to Somalia I hope that they will all return safely and that they will continue to play the important role they have exercised in the past and continue to bring pride to the country.  I wish them every success and a safe return.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before examining the general policy of this Bill, or the circumstances that have given rise to it, I would like to join other members of my party in emphasising the Progressive Democrats' strong disapproval of the way in which an important measure of this kind is being rushed through the House. This measure profoundly changes the nature and extent of Ireland's military commitment to the United Nations.  In making this profound change, we are under no duty to rush this Bill.  We are under a duty to consider carefully the measure and to judge the effect it may have on our Defence Forces and their members.  The purpose of the Bill is to make members of Ireland's permanent Defence Forces liable for service in international military operations authorised by the UN Security Council under Chapter VII of the UN Charter.  It will be the legal duty of all new recruits to the Defence Forces and all existing officers of the Defence Forces to participate in military operations, including acts of war such as that in the Kuwait-Iraq war, (a) if the Security Council or the General Assembly of the United Nations establish the force and (b) if Dáil Éireann approves <Col N="312" /> of the despatch of an Irish contingent for service in the force.</P>
      <P>In short, Irish soldiers will henceforth be legally liable to be posted overseas, and there to engage in combat situations under UN auspices, where the Dáil so resolves.  That is a fundamental change in the Constitution, and the role of what were heretofore known as defence forces.  Irish soldiers may, at some future time, be liable to become involved in foreign offensive action where the Dáil and the Government so decide.  It is vital, therefore, that this change in the law should be accompanied by a wide and far-ranging debate, that the implications of this Act should be fully understood and that great caution be shown in considering and minimising the future risk to Irish lives which may flow from the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Having said that, my party and I believe that Ireland should in principle be legally capable, where it is democratically decided, of participation on a military basis in Chapter VII Actions authorised by the UN.  Otherwise, we would be easily rebuked and derided by others if we were ever to call for other members of the UN to take any military action, howsoever justified, under Chapter VII. We cannot preach to others what we will not practice ourselves.  It is the view of my party that Ireland must be, in every sense, a full member of the United Nations.  We cannot afford to be an associate or semi-detached member, that is, one that is willing to adopt moral positions but decline the responsibility in certain circumstances of doing anything about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Members of this House have indicated that they regard Ireland's present position as both honourable and tenable.  The Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1960, the current legislation governing the despatch of contingents of the Permanent Defence Forces for service with the United Nations, restricts Irish participation to duties of a policing character only.  While peacekeeping is honourable, there are occasions where the weak, especially the smaller nations, may need the military assistance of the <Col N="313" /> United Nations to repel invasion of military subjugation by stronger States. Ireland, as a small nation, cannot expect the world community to intervene to protect it from such a threat in the future or to repel it, while denying the right of the United Nations to institute major military acts of warfare under Article VII. So while Article 29 of the Constitution commits Ireland to the peaceful resolution of international disputes and by implication prohibits Ireland from resorting to belligerent behaviour except as a last resort, it nonetheless follows that Ireland cannot totally wash its hands of the possibility of becoming involved in a Chapter VII activity where this House, which the Constitution refers to as the House of Representatives believes that our UN obligations require us so to do.</P>
    <P>It seems right in this context to draw attention to the American action in Baghdad in which a series of missiles was launched at a target in a built-up area in retaliation for the plot to detonate a bomb in Kuwait on the visit of George Bush, the former American President. This action has been charaterised as an act of self-defence.  In my view, the provisions of Article 51 of the UN Charter do not authorise an act of retribution in these circumstances.  Article 51 envisages members states of the United Nations only resorting to acts of self-defence involving military action or acts of war where it is not possible or practicable to invoke the jurisdiction of the Security Council immediately.  The American action does not amount to a legitimate act of self-defence contemplated by the UN Charter.  It does not find any authority in any existing UN resolution and is, by any judgment, an act of retaliation and retribution rather than necessary self defence.  There seems no good reason such action, even if it were warranted, could not have awaited consideration by the Security Council of the UN; nor do I accept that it can ever be right to take the lives of innocent people who are civilians living in an inhumane dictatorship to show their masters how to behave.  When will we ever learn that killing people to highlight that killing people is wrong is <Col N="314" /> not the proper basis for international peace or political progress?</P>
    <P>This Bill is introduced to facilitate Irish participation in a Chapter VII UN operation in Somalia but the recent events there show that the UN intervention is in danger of becoming bogged down in the middle of a civil war for want of properly established political, military and humanitarian goals.</P>
    <P>Second, the Pakistani shooting of civilian demonstrators requires an immediate and urgent report.  We cannot have a lengthy and disingenuous inquiry such as happened in the Widgery inquiry into the Bloody Sunday shooting in Derry.  The UN should not attempt a whitewash; the facts should be capable of being established within two weeks.  A report should be published as soon as possible thereafter. If the Pakistani troops are to blame &mdash; and there is substantial evidence to believe they were &mdash; that should be admitted and a public apology made.</P>
    <P>I believe it is unfair to ask Irish soldiers to participate in a UN force, whether peacekeeping or Chapter VII, where that force operates under the shadow of the recent shootings of civilians and where the force has no clear political mandate. The Government should clearly state the terms upon which Ireland is participating, the length of our probable involvement and the political, military and humanitarian goals of that involvement.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats will be tabling amendments to this Bill on Committee Stage, both substantive and technical. Our aim in principle will be to ensure that Ireland's participation in Chapter VII military operations is completely transparent and that the Government's responsibility, both before and after any agreement to dispatch an Irish contingent, should be one based on complete accountability to this House.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his visit to Somalia to see the situation for himself. We are dealing now with a Bill which will change the image of our Defence Forces and it must be considered in a rational, sensible and considerate <Col N="315" /> fashion.  I hope the Minister will implement this Bill in a proper manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;noting that the Bill provides for the involvement of Irish troops not just in the Somalia UNOSOM II Mission but in any international force established by the United Nations;</P>
      <P>concerned at the implications of this for Irish defence and foreign policies and the unquantifiable risks that Irish troops will be exposed to in combat situations over which they will have no control;</P>
      <P>believing that the United Nations must be reformed and restructured in a democratic manner before Irish participation in such operations can be considered;</P>
      <P>reaffirming our commitment to Irish participation in UN peace-keeping operations,</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If this amendment to the Second Stage, seeking that this Bill not be given a Second Reading, fails &mdash; and it is clear from what has been said so far by the other Opposition parties that my effort to have this matter deferred will in fact fail &mdash; I intend to propose a number of amendments to the Bill when it comes before us on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I continue it is important to set the context of the situation we are being asked to change in this Defence Act. Much of the case that the Minister has made, and that of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in his briefing today to the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs, has hinged around the importance of a United Nations role of peace enforcement in Somalia.  I wish to quote from an article in <i>The Guardian</i> of Tuesday, 15 June 1993.  The article was written by <Col N="316" /> Rakiya Omaar, a Somali, who is a codirector of African Rights, the London based human rights group.  The opening two paragraphs of her article make interesting reading and should give the Members of this House cause for caution in how they address the Bill we are being asked to adopt here tonight.  I quote:</P>
    <P>The crisis triggered by the killing of Pakistani UN peacekeepers in Somalia is turning a mercy mission into a violent occupation.  The UN retribution has been swift and merciless.  If the killings had happened in Bosnia, the outcry would have been tempered by calls for an investigation, by the fear of jeopardising the UN's broader objectives and concern about public reaction in the West.  But in Somalia the UN accused the faction led by General Mohamed Farah Aidid and launched a ferocious retaliation without conducting an investigation.  Power has meant licence over people, rather than a means to influence policies.  A degree of political thoughtlessness unimaginable in Bosnia is regarded as justifiable in Somalia.</P>
    <P>One thing is beyong dispute.  Somali civilians are paying the price for the impotence of the West in Bosnia.  In particular, President Clinton is seeking to prove his political manhood on the streets of Mogadishu.  Embarassed by accusations that he lacks the backbone to take decisive action in Bosnia, he hopes that the use of force against people who cannot retaliate, and who matter little in the international corridors of power, will help shore up his faltering presidency.</P>
    <P>Before we reach Committee Stage I would recommend Members of this House to obtain a copy of this article from the Dáil Library and read it through in full because I believe it tells a story about Somalia which we are not getting from the Government in this debate.  It should be taken into account, not because I draw it to the attention of the House but because it is written by a Somali woman who is concerned about African rights, about her country and the <Col N="317" /> way it is being treated at this time by the international community.</P>
    <P>The Bill we are being asked to consider today is a relatively short one running to just four brief sections, but the implications of the legislation are enormous and are likely to be felt for decades to come.  The Defence (Amendment) Bill, 1993, if passed in its present form will mark major departures for this country in both the defence and foreign affairs policy areas.  In regard to foreign affairs policy it is probably the most important decision we have been asked to take since Ireland's entry to the European Community more than two decades ago.  In regard to the role of our Defence Forces it is certainly the most important decision since the Second World War and is far more significant than the passage of the 1960 Defence Act which allowed for the participation of Irish troops in UN policing operations.</P>
    <P>What we are being asked to do is to clear the legislative path for the commitment of Irish troops to combat situations, initiated by the United Nations throughout the world, where they will be under the effective control of the military authorities of other countries, exposed to severe danger and possible death &mdash; and that cannot be avoided &mdash; and which will effectively undermine Ireland's reputation and role as peacekeepers.</P>
    <P>I am not arguing against this on the basis that there is a risk to Irish troops, because clearly in peacekeeping operations there is a risk to Irish troops.  The case I am making is that in this and any future situation there is no guarantee that Irish troops will have any say in the decisions being taken with regard to attacks being launched.  The public have been told that what is being done is to change the law so that Irish troops can participate in peace enforcement as distinct from peace keeping operations.  Of course, strictly speaking this is not so. The new Bill makes no reference whatsoever to peace enforcement.  What it authorises is the commitment of Irish troops to any international force or body established by the Security Council or the General Assembly of the United <Col N="318" /> Nations, forces which we do not know about yet.  There are no qualifications, no conditions, no ifs, no buts.  If this Bill is passed Irish troops will be able to participate lawfully in aggressive operations once they have been sanctioned by the Security Council or the General Assembly.  This Bill clears the way for participation by Irish troops in a future Gulf War type operation.  A motion of approval by the Dáil will still be necessary for each operation, but this effectively means that the decision will rest with the Government, which has the majority within the House.  Once a motion has been approved by the Dáil the scale of involvement by Irish troops can be increased without any reference back to this House.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there has been adequate public debate concerning the proposed changes.  The Bill has received little serious analysis in the media and the Government, through the ruthless use of the parliamentary guillotine that has become its hallmark, seems determined that it will not receive the scrutiny it deserves.  I challenge the view that because an extra half hour was given to Second Stage tonight and Committee Stage will be taken tomorrow there is adequate time for calm and careful consideration of this issue, given the extensive effect the Bill could have on future policy.</P>
    <P>When I expressed concern about this matter during consideration of the Department of Defence Estimates more than a month ago, I was assured by the Minister that a full discussion document would be produced before a final decision was made by the Government. We are now expected to pass all Stages of this legislation by tomorrow.  We had a briefing today by the Minister for Foreign Affairs for little over an hour, sandwiched between the end of Question Time and the beginning of the Order of Business, which was totally inadequate. What was presented was superficial nonsense in that none of the issues relating to the foreign affairs implications of the decisions we are being asked to make was <Col N="319" /> addressed.  We have been told that the immediate reason for the legislation relates to the desire of the Government to allow about 80 Irish troops to go to Somalia, but the implication of the legislation will go far beyond that.  I am torn between believing that perhaps the Government is stupid enough to change the law so that it can send 80 troops to Somalia or perhaps that it has a hidden agenda with regard to what it hopes to achieve down the road by using Somalia as an excuse to change the law.</P>
    <P>When this matter was first mooted, support for the idea of sending troops to Somalia was more widespread than it has been since recent events there.  The anguish and frustration of Irish people about poverty and famine in Somalia is understandable, but his move to amend the Defence Act is only the thin end of a wedge that will eventually see Irish troops participating in a wide range of international military operations.  Even on the question of Somalia, no convincing case has been made to justify this major policy reversal.</P>
    <P>At the briefing given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs today I asked a simple, straightforward question, how could the Minister justify by way of a legal base the use of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter to justify peace enforcement in Somalia when Chapter VII specifically refers to its use in the event of a threat to international peace and security.  There is no evidence of an international threat to peace and security deriving from the Somalian position. Certainly no evidence was presented by the Minister for Foreign Affairs today or by the Minister for Defence here tonight. The Minister may regard this matter as legalistic twaddle, but unless international relations are based on law there can be no peace or security for anybody. I again appeal to the Minister for Defence to produce some justification for what is being done in Somalia for which we are being blithely asked tonight to give approval for the involvement of Irish troops.</P>
    <P>Like most Irish people I am immensely <Col N="320" /> proud of the role of Irish troops in United Nation peacekeeping operations and I am anxious that they continue to help keep the peace in troubled spots around the world.  However, I am concerned that if we rush in to change the law without first securing structural changes in the United Nations and without a thorough debate on and understanding of what precisely peace enforcement means, Irish troops may be made pawns of some of the big powers, plunged into the most difficult circumstances and exposed to the risk of severe casualties simply to serve the self-interest of the big powers rather than the cause of peace.  I draw the attention of Members to the quote I read from <i>The Guardian</i> of 15 June from a Somali woman who expressed concern about her country.</P>
    <P>My concern has been greatly intensified by events in Somalia in the past few weeks which have demonstrated the difficulties involved in trying to carry out a vague and ill-defined peace-enforcement mandate.  Three weeks ago 23 Pakistani soldiers serving with the United Nations were killed by one of the local gangs and a week later the Pakistani troops apparently took their revenge on the local population by shooting dead more than 20 unarmed demonstrators.  I ask a simple question: if that action took place in Northern Ireland what would our attitude be to it?  Would there not be calls for the regiment that carried out such an action, regardless of provocation, to be taken off the streets of Northern Ireland and sent back to Britain?  Would we not make that demand here in this House?</P>

      <P>Why are there different standards as between what we expect in Ireland and what we expect in Somalia?  Why are there different standards in relation to what can be done in Bosnia and Somalia, what can be done in relation to Palestinians and so on? There are so many contradictions and so much selectivity in the way the United Nations deals with international matters <Col N="321" /> that it is appalling we are being asked to simply jump in feet first into a matter without giving adequate thought to its implications.</P>
      <P>I am appalled at the idea of United Nations troops, acting in the name of the world community, shooting civilians dead.  I am not at all convinced by the excuses offered on behalf of the Pakistani troops, which seems to have been the classic response of the military in every country when they are accused of using excessive force.  Justification of the mass killing of civilians by claiming they were providing cover for gunmen is an excuse that will not be unfamiliar to anyone who remembers the events of Bloody Sunday in Derry on 9 January 1972.</P>
      <P>There are other disturbing parallels between Somalia and Northern Ireland. In Northern Ireland British troops were warmly welcomed when they first appeared on the streets in 1969, but within a year they were in conflict with the civilian population.  Almost 25 years later they are still on the streets and have sustained heavy casualties, with no sign that they can be withdrawn to barracks for a long time to come.  UN troops were warmly welcomed by the civilian population when they arrived in Somalia last year, but already they are in conflict with the civilian population, and reporters and journalists have been struck by the bitterness of Somalians towards the UN troops who were supposed to free them from the scourge of the warlords.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Newsweek</i> magazine had this to say on the subject:</P>
      <P>Policy makers would do well to study the British experience in Northern Ireland.  Brought in to quell religious strife between Roman Catholics and Protestants in 1969, the British soldiers soon became targets themselves. Today after more than 3,000 deaths there are 12,000 British troops tied down in a ruined province that costs more than $1 billion a year.  Somalia could easily become another Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the analogy may be simplistic there <Col N="322" /> are enough comparisons to merit careful consideration.  Do we really want to place Irish troops in a position where they may be asked to come into conflict with unarmed civilians?  Do we really want to let Irish troops become targets of the gangs of the warlords that 18,000 UN troops have been unable to deal with? There would be immense problems in being involved in any UN military operation in Somalia in present circumstances. If Irish troops are to go, it should only be as peacekeepers with the right to defend themselves and the civilian population.</P>
    <P>To send Irish troops to operate a vague and ill-defined mandate and without a proper chain of command to ensure that the operation is under the genuine control and authority of the Secretary General would be to gamble with the lives of Irish troops without any guarantee that they can significantly help the people of Somalia, that is not a gamble I am prepared to take.  I appeal to Members to read what is being said by those who have seen close up how UN troops are being managed in Somalia, the scathing attitude of the United States professional team towards the UN team and the fact that they consider them to be totally unprofessional.  I am not saying these things with pleasure; I am simply urging that this House approach the issue with caution, having fully studied the matter. There is no need to rush this change in our law tonight or tomorrow.  The situation in Somalia will not go away overnight. It will not go away next week, next month or next year.</P>
    <P>If Irish troops go, who will they be taking their orders from?  While it is a multinational force, the real steel in the military presence in Somalia is provided by the United States and particularly by their Cobra helicopters and 103-H gunships. Turkey's Lieutenant-General Cevik Bir, may be in nominal command of UNOSOM, but the US forces are far more likely to be taking their orders from General Colin Powell than from Secretary General Boutros Boutros Ghali. Key strategic decisions which will impact on the safety and security of Irish troops <Col N="323" /> will be taken in the Pentagon, and the determining factor will be the United States strategic interests in the region.</P>
    <P>I am simply reflecting a reality.  The missile asault on Iraq reflected the strategic interests of the US.  We would be foolish to pretend otherwise.  We cannot consider this Bill without also having serious regard to structural defects and democratic shortcomings of the United Nations.  The United Nations was established in the aftermath of World War II.  Its structures have remained virtually unchanged since then, although the world has changed beyond recognition. For several decades the United Nations was ignored &mdash; and even derided &mdash; by some of those who are now hailing it as the vehicle for creating a &ldquo;new world order&rdquo;&mdash; a new world order, no doubt, in their own image.  The United States, in particular, treated the United Nations with contempt, vetoing Security Council motions critical of its activities, ignoring General Assembly resolutions and withholding funds due to the UN for peace-keeping operations.</P>
    <P>As a result of the overuse of the veto by some of the permanent members of the Security Council, the UN was mostly reduced to the level of a spectator during major international crises since the 1950s &mdash; Berlin, the Cuban missile crisis, and two Arab-Israeli wars.</P>
    <P>Many people hoped that with the ending of the Cold War, the United Nations would take on a new lease of life, give real moral and political leadership and provide a powerful force for the resolution by peaceful means of international conflicts and disputes.  Sadly, this has not been the case.  Writing on the current state of the United Nations in the March issue of the <i>Irish Law Times</i>, Liz Heffernan, a lecturer in law in TCD said:</P>
    <P>Signs of undemocratic practices have emerged ... not least the selective nature of Security Council action and the use of the Council as a vehicle for the promotion of the agendas of permanent members.</P>
    <P>A similar point was made more succinctly, <Col N="324" /> if more brutally, by the distinguished international lawyer, Professor Richard Falk, at the time of the Gulf War, when he said that the United Nations has become &ldquo;a virtual tool of US policy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>When faced with the illegal Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the 15 members of the Security Council allowed themselves to be pressured into passing a series of vaguely worded motions which those seeking a military solution interpreted as a blank cheque.  Without giving sanctions an opportunity to bite, a massive war was launched causing very many casualties, the exact number of which we still do not even know.</P>
    <P>We are seeing a new pattern emerging in regard to the United Nations.  Military operations launched in the name of the United Nations, in theory, are increasingly being &ldquo;sub-contracted&rdquo; out to some of the larger military powers.  The Gulf War &mdash; and it was war, not a peace-enforcement operation &mdash; was theoretically launched as a result of UN resolutions, but all key decisions were taken by the US military and their allies.</P>
    <P>People will, I am sure, remember the Secretary General of the United Nations, Perez de Cuellar, admitting that the first he knew of the massive air strikes launched against Iraq &mdash; allegedly in the name of the United Nations &mdash; was when he heard about them on television.</P>
    <P>UN action on the former Yugoslavia was sub-contracted to the CSCE, who in turn sub-contracted it to the EC.  This trend means that the United Nations has then little or no control over the day-to-day conduct of these operations.</P>
    <P>I would draw attention to the more recent operation referred to by the Somalia human rights activist I quoted earlier from <i>The Guardian</i> when the day after the &ldquo;UN&rdquo; troops launched their attacks on what was alleged to be the headquarters of Aidid, it was not Boutros Boutros Ghali who went on television to talk about that operation, it was Bill Clinton who went on television and said what a great operation it was and how successful it was and how he stood by his allies in the free world who were not only <Col N="325" /> seeking to establish human rights and democracy but market economics in Somalia.  That was his objective.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the UN Charter that obliges any country to be forced to acquire market economics, whatever one's view of them is.  There is nothing in the Charter which obliges us to enforce any particular market system on anybody. We cannot have a situation where the President of the most powerful state in the world takes it upon himself to act on our behalf without any regard to international law.  We are a small country. The only thing we have in our favour is that we have a reputation of being peacekeepers, people who have stood solidly on the side of peace.  If we do not argue and fight for the rule of international law, we will have nothing whatsoever.</P>
    <P>People will remember the Iraqi incident and I would draw their attention to the most recent Somali incident where Bill Clinton claimed credit and not the UN.  UN action on the former Yugoslavia was also sub-contracted.  Rather than simply going along with this situation Ireland should be to the fore in pressing for changes in the structures of the United Nations, which date from the cold war era and which concentrate virtually all of the power in the hands of the small number of countries which are the permanent members of the Security Council. Whatever justification there may have been in 1945 for the allocation of the five permanent positions, none remains in 1993.  The membership of the Security Council was determined by the Second World War.  What relevance does that have today?  Why should all five permanent members be drawn from the Northern Hemisphere and none from the Southern Hemisphere?  Why should three of the five be members of NATO? Why should there be two from Europe &mdash; three if you consider Russia to be a European country &mdash; and none from South America or Africa?  Unless we set about reforming the United Nations its stature and authority will be further diminished and rather than being the collective voice of the world &mdash; which it can <Col N="326" /> and should be &mdash; it will simply be the pawn of a handful of dominant, economically powerful states.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons Democratic Left opposes this Bill.  We should look at alternative non-military ways of assisting the people of Somalia.  I challenge the Minister's claim that the only alternative to UNOSOM II and that mandate, and our involvement there, is the return to a 1992 situation.  Will the Minister present evidence that there are no other options that the UN can pursue in relation to Somalia?  I would argue strongly with the Minister with regard to his claim that we would in some way be immoral if we do not agree to changing our law to enable Irish troops to become involved in peace enforcement.  I made this point when debating the Estimates for the Department of Defence and again on the Estimates for the Department of Foreign Affairs.  There is nothing immoral, wrong or dishonourable in Ireland maintaining a role as peacekeepers.  In fact, in the world today it would be the most honourable position for Ireland to adopt.  It is one we should be urging on every other country that wants to play a role internationally. We should honestly examine whether it might be of more benefit to the unfortunate people of Somalia to divert the money which will be committed to any Irish military involvement there to some of the Irish aid organisations working in that country.</P>
    <P>Why is it that money is always available for military adventures but so difficult to obtain for humanitarian aid?  I must revert again to the United States of America, who hurled 23 Tomahawk missiles at Baghdad over the weekend at a cost of $23 million.  Bearing in mind the level of hunger and deprivation in the world surely this money could be applied to better use.  I suggest that, unless such money is applied to ensuring that poverty is dealt with or lessened in the Third World, we shall be sending troops and peace enforcement missions for the remainder of this decade and well into the next.  Inevitably, poverty will drive people to war and there will be an on-going battle between the wealthy North <Col N="327" /> and the poverty-stricken South for control of resources.  That is where the risk to world security lies.  I urge a rethink on the part of the Government in the direction in which it appears to be taking this country, our troops involved in the United Nations and indeed our foreign policy approach.</P>

      <P>I support the Minister on this Bill and commend him on his most recent visit to Somalia to check out the position obtaining there with regard to our proposed mission to that country. While the proposed mission to Somalia is to the forefront of our minds, we must be conscious that these provisions have much wider implications.  I support the facilitation of the expansion of the peace enforcement role of the United Nations. I want to mention areas in which I believe vigilance is required once this new role becomes commonly accepted.  While we are all reasonably pleased to note the work in progress on the proposed mission to Somalia, we must bear in mind future missions that may be requested of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although this is one of the shortest Bills of this session it may well prove one of the most important, being a defining measure with regard to this country's relationship with the wider world.  We have rightly taken much pride in our neutral role outside any major defence pact. While we must not over-emphasise that role, what has been important about our neutrality, and what will continue to be increasingly important, is that we have adopted an active rather than passive method of demonstrating it in international fora.  Rather than sit on the fence on major issues, our neutrality has allowed us flexibility to act on basic principles on the merits of different cases.  In so doing we have been able to make a constructive contribution often beyond <Col N="328" /> what might be expected of a country of our size and/or geographic position. While there is little doubt that we were on the western side on major East-West issues of the post-war period, we have been able to speak our minds on important issues such as those that arose in Nicaragua, El Salvador and South Africa.  This has not been a distinguishing feature of the foreign policies of countries belonging to military alliances.  A key part of our active attitude to neutrality has been our willingness to participate in peacekeeping operations worldwide, a type of activity not countenanced by neutral countries such as Switzerland or until recently, by Japan.</P>
    <P>The performance of both our Army and Garda personnel in trouble spots worldwide has been a source of tremendous pride to all our people.  All Members of this House recognise their skills and professionalism, reflected in the number of occasions Irish personnel have been requested specifically to participate in United Nations operations.  It is clear that our neutral position has played a key role in the ability of our forces to become accepted even in the most tense areas.</P>
    <P>We must remember that there have been tragedies and loss of life in the course of our forces' activities abroad. For example, incidents such as those that occurred at Katanga and South Lebanon should always be in our minds when considering their international role.  There is no doubt that the provisions of this Bill will implement a change from peace-keeping to peace enforcement, constituting a significant departure from the principles which underlined our participation in former peacekeeping operations. It is envisaged that we shall send our personnel into areas other than those in which a peace framework had been established, where to all intents and purposes fighting had ceased.  The concept of peace enforcement within the United Nations framework of operations conjures up many possible types of action.</P>
    <P>I can find no convincing argument to be advanced against the basic requirement of ensuring humanitarian supplies <Col N="329" /> to Bosnia and Somalia.  I do not think any Member of the House could advance any convincing argument against such provision.  If we are to express our support for the basic principles of human rights &mdash; which we have been strong in supporting traditionally &mdash; then it has to be said that chief among them is the right of people to be free from the threat of death whether by starvation or war.  It is not good enough to feel virtuous but not to do anything about such issues.</P>
    <P>That being said, we must be cautious and vigilant before undertaking to participate in such peace enforcement operations. We must remember that the Korean and Gulf War endeavours were undertaken under the auspices of the United Nations.  Those wars distorted the principles advanced initially to justify them and involved the development of a full-scale, offensive conflict.  We must be conscious and wary of such development since, in those cases, widespread civilian casualties were inflicted by United Nations-sanctioned forces.  We must bear that in mind and ensure that the same does not recur in the case of peace enforcement operations.  We are not talking about sending our troops into the midst of such conflicts.  Rather what we are talking about under the provisions of this Bill, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the mission to Somalia, are the humanitarian principles applicable to operations designed specifically not to involve direct conflict.  In line with that approach we must be willing to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; on occasions whenever we believe action is designed solely to serve the interests of a particular power, a very real danger which must never be underestimated. We must also ensure that we do not over-stretch ourselves by agreeing to each and every request to participate in United Nations action.  Our Border and other security needs at home should never be undermined by our commitments abroad.</P>
    <P>I support the basic principle encompassed in this Bill, that of allowing our forces to participate in peace enforcement operations.  That having been said, peacekeeping should remain our chief activity and whenever requested to send <Col N="330" /> our personnel abroad on peace enforcement missions, we do so subject to strict conditions only, the main one being that any such activity or purpose be humanitarian directed towards helping the indigenous population, and emphatically not forming part of any engagement in direct conflict.  We must protect our forces and ensure that we adhere to the humanitarian principles underlying our foreign policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to note so many Members offering to participate in this debate, the most important aspect of which concerns the changing role of our troops not only at home but overseas. This should not be taken for granted. There is also the question of public accountability in regard to decisions made in this House concerning our troops.  That should also be the subject of a wide debate.  There should be a full discussion in this House because this legislation should not be passed on the nod.</P>
      <P>We are amending the Defence Act and it is important that we do not rush into it, especially having regard to the position in Somalia.  The questions of our role as a member of the United Nations and the role of the United Nations itself have to be considered.  It is open to question whether the United Nations should stand idly by and allow slaughter and carnage to take place in any country, especially in a small, weak country which has no natural resources such as oil.</P>
      <P>It has been proposed that we should send 80 troops to Somalia.  I listened carefully to Deputy De Rossa's contribution. It was carefully prepared and well researched but I hope, as a member of the Labour Party which supports the Government, that there is no hidden agenda involved in this move.  If there were, I would not support it.  I would not stand by and allow our troops to be used as guinea pigs.  I have too much respect for them to do that.  Deputy De Rossa deserves answers to the questions he asked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a wide-ranging debate and it has been widened to include the role of <Col N="331" /> the United Nations, be it peacekeeping, peace making or peace enforcement.  We often join organisations on our terms only, we cannot do this when it comes to a large organisation such as the United Nations.  It is also important that we look at the way in which the United Nations operates in practice as well as in theory. We should endeavour to ensure that there are democratic rules and regulations within the United Nations, which is what Deputy De Rossa asked for.</P>
    <P>Too often the big nations call the shots, but it is wrong to expect the United States to act as a world policeman.  That would be undemocratic and dangerous.  There is no reason that the United Nations should not be what the name suggests, with all nations working together in concert in the interests of justice, fair play and humanity.</P>
    <P>The United Nations has expressed frustration about the difficulties it has encountered in Bosnia.  It has been slow, weak and unable to impose itself.  We cannot look on this with any degree of satisfaction as a country which prides itself on its democratic spirit and liberty.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that vicious warlords can reign in countries such as Somalia.  It is sad to see countries when they obtain their freedom being torn apart in a vicious civil war by small groups of gangsters and warlords.  The people of Somalia are suffering as a result.  I am also amazed that so many people can buy guns in a poverty stricken country; they have no difficulty in getting their hands on the money to buy them.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to Deputy De Rossa's fears and forebodings.  I would be worried if we did not get answers to some of the points he raised.  He is entitled to answers.  I am old enough to remember the shockwaves felt when the first Irish casualties in the Congo were announced. This had a searing effect on the Irish people.  The same is true in the case of the Lebanon.  Our troops at that time were innocent, naive and inexperienced but they have learned a lot since then.  I have the greatest of respect for our troops and would never take them for granted. <Col N="332" /> They, too, are entitled to answers.  I am very proud of what they have achieved.</P>
    <P>Apart from the question of our involvement in Somalia we also need to address the question of our role in the United Nations.  Are we our brother's keeper?  How should this role be determined and played?  I have listened to two Ministers speak on this issue and they have sought to reassure me.  Some loose ends have to be tied up and some questions have to be answered.  I hope we will receive those answers in this debate because this issue is far too important to allow legislation to be rushed through the House.  Given that the role of our troops is being changed there must be a debate. I am not against change; the world is changing and if we expect the United Nations to act in the way it should we must play our part.  I support the Minister in this regard but I am anxious to ensure that answers are given to the points raised by Deputy De Rossa and that we seek as many safeguards as possible for our troops in Somalia.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  I congratulate the Minister on visiting Somalia to see at first hand the conditions our troops will face.  It is important, once this Bill is passed, that each case is taken on its merits to ensure we know exactly what our troops will face.</P>
      <P>It is extremely important to ensure the safety of our troops.  In Somalia a group of warlords are looking after their own interests at a time when agencies from all over the world are trying to get food through to the population.  Happily, it seems that the position has been improved greatly.  This is to the credit of the many organisations operating there.</P>
      <P>Our Army has given great service in various parts of of the world.  It has represented us extremely well as peacekeepers, but now they are to become peace enforcers.  I am concerned about the new world order.  In this regard the United Nations will have to consider its own role carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not anti United States but recently <Col N="333" /> when they shelled various sites in Somalia they claimed this was done for humanitarian reasons.  To some extent, they do this with our blessing.  I am extremely concerned about what happened during the weekend in Iraq and about the fact that people came out immediately to support them.  Perhaps I am being cynical but one must ask if the Russians, who supported this action, have received the cheque yet.  Russia would never have supported such action in the past.  Suddenly there has been a change.  It will fall on countries such as ourselves who have a tradition of independence to be the policeman in this new world order.  What happened during the weekend was almost like a PR exercise and it was not acceptable to me.  I do not know the reasons the United States attacked Iraq. The only reason given was that an attempt was to be made to assassinate the former President, George Bush.</P>
    <P>In certain cases it is important that we act as peace enforcers in an effort to get aid through to people who are starving but we must take each case on its merits. This new world order which we all welcomed at the end of the Cold War will present its own problems.  We encountered one of those problems during the weekend.</P>
    <P>I wish our troops well when they go to Somalia.  The location to which they are going is more peaceful and I have no doubt they will represent us well and do an excellent job, as they always do. Having spoken to people in the Army I gather that our troops are anxious to go to Somalia to play their part in getting food through and rebuild what is left of its economy.  I hope they can be of assistance to the people of Somalia.  I did not hear all of Deputy De Rossa's speech but I understood the point he was making.  It is increasingly clear that a small country like Ireland has to be very careful in terms of the direction in which the United Nations is going.  We have to regard our Defence Forces as policemen and we have to ensure that there is no infringement of the role of small countries.</P>
    <P>The bad guys in the world at present <Col N="334" /> are the Arabs.  There seems to be a lack of understanding of the history of the Arab world and its people.  It is up to us, both in the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and this Chamber, to ensure that everyone is properly represented at the United Nations, that we do our job properly and that we enforce the peace where necessary.  At the same time we should not turn a blind eye to the things that are happening in the world because of some type of new world order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  This is a short but important Bill in that it will fundamentally change the traditional peacekeeping role of Irish forces on United Nations missions.  I pay tribute to the Irish troops who have served abroad on peacekeeping missions during the past 30 years.  They have carried out their role under the United Nations flag with both distinction and courage.</P>
      <P>It is very important to distinguish between the concepts of peacekeeping and peace enforcement.  Peacekeeping operations are entirely separate from fighting operations.  There is an onus on United Nations officers in charge of peacekeeping to ensure that the soldiers under their charge remain cool, calm and controlled and are equally firm and decisive. All too often we have witnessed pictures on the television of soldiers on peacekeeping missions losing control in tense situations.  The cost in terms of lives can be very high during these few moments of panic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the peace enforcement role proposed in the Bill will give Irish soldiers on UN peace keeping missions the necessary power to endeavour to implement a lasting peace, it does not make sense to send troops to places such as Somalia and the Lebanon with explicit peace enforcement instructions, only to find that they cannot carry out their role, by achieving lasting peace.  Requests for United Nations troops are usually made by countries which are war torn or where there is a civil war.  United Nations troops should not be seen as taking sides in these conflicts. Newspaper reports during the past <Col N="335" /> few days indicate that the local population in Somalia are becoming increasingly hostile towards white men and women who in the past were regarded as the providers of food and medicine.  We need to be very careful about the way in which the role of our Defence Forces is developed in the context of United Nations peace enforcement missions.</P>
    <P>Our position on neutrality has been made very clear during the past years &mdash; our neutrality has a high profile in the world.  I ask the Minister in his reply to indicate the effect this legislation will have on our neutrality and to give us an assurance that it will not have a negative impact on our neutrality.  I ask him to comment on the provisions in our Constitution which clearly set out Ireland's international role in terms of peacekeeping.</P>

The people of Galway are very proud of the part played by the members of the barracks in Renmore in these missions.  They have brought honour to their families, city, counties and country.  The people of Galway are proud to have an Army barracks in Renmore.  They appreciate the commitment of the Army personnel to Galway city and county.  I am glad to have the opportunity to put this on the record of the House during the week I finished my term of office as Lord Mayor of Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish troops which have had the honour of serving on UN missions abroad <Col N="336" /> have greatly enhanced Ireland's reputation in international circles.  It is only fair to say that the peacekeeping skills of our troops have been enhanced by the other forces with whom they have worked.  This has raised the morale of our Defence Forces and made our Army more attractive to young people.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the existing Act to allow Irish troops to serve abroad in a peace enforcing role. While this change is being sought to enable Irish troops to act as a transport company on a UN mission in Somalia, it should be remembered that this Bill will enable Irish troops to engage in other peace enforcement missions abroad in the future.  Fine Gael will not oppose this Bill on Second Stage, but our spokesperson, Deputy Barrett, will put down amendments on Committee Stage to ensure that there are sufficient safeguards. Fine Gael believes that the use of force must always be a last resort in any endeavour to achieve peace and maintain or restore human rights.</P>
    <P>During the past few months we have all seen on our television screens horrific pictures of human suffering in Somalia, for example, starving families and suffering mothers and children.  People have been greatly moved by those horrific scenes and their immediate reaction might be that the United Nations should try to sort out this problem as soon as possible.  Fine Gael believes that United Nations personnel should be involved in peace enforcement action only in specified circumstances and the personnel who volunteer for such service should undergo specialist training.</P>
    <P>Up to now the Irish Army have been trained in peacekeeping duties.  This Bill proposes to change completely the role of our Defence Forces.  I ask the Minister to give an assurance that they will be given proper training for this new role. Will a greater demand be put on our Defence Forces for peacekeeping and peace enforcement duties abroad in the future?  Would the Minister not agree that we should be building up the number of personnel in our Defence Forces, which has decreased significantly over the <Col N="337" /> past years?  I hope there will be a more detailed debate on this matter on Committee Stage, especially on the Fine Gael amendment which seeks to ensure that each future request comes before the Dáil for its decision.  Deputy Eoin Ryan seems to have expressed support for that safeguard.  I hope the Minister will be in a position to accept our reasonable amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in saying a few words about the Bill.  As Members have intimated, this is a major leap forward in conditions in the Defence Forces.  I believe the Army will meet this challenge, and conduct itself in the proper way as it has done since we first sent missions in support of the United Nations.  The Army is now being asked to play a peace enforcement role, but it appears to have made the right preparations.</P>
      <P>The Minister has already taken time to go to Somalia and has seen at first hand some of the problems the Irish troops are likely to encounter.  He should indicate the type of equipment that will be available to the current contingent going to Somalia.  They will be undertaking the protection of a transport route.  We have already seen cases where people travelling in convoy were shot at.  An Irish volunteer serving with a voluntary organisation suffered the ultimate and lost her life while travelling in one of these so-called guarded convoys.  I wonder what type of vehicles will be used by the transport division.  I did not see any reference to that in the Minister's speech.  Is it true these are not armoured plated vehicles but only light-weight trucks?  Will the troops not be at risk in the wide open spaces of Somalia because they are not afforded the protection of armour plated vehicles?</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the troops would carry light arms but would not have heavy weaponry and I am concerned that the troops should have the fullest protection possible.  Will the Minister refer directly to this point when he concludes the Second Stage debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important that troops have <Col N="338" /> volunteered to go on this mission.  Army personnel usually look forward to the challenge of serving abroad and indeed, they are exhilarated by the prospect of going to a place like Somalia where they can help.  We, however, have a duty to see they are properly looked after and are happy in their role.</P>
    <P>Members have referred to the average age of Army personnel, which is now 35 years of age.  This of itself is an inhibiting factor when it comes to enhancing the role our troops will play in peace enforcement in the future.  The Minister did not indicate if he will open up recruitment and allow people to join the Army from time to time.  Surely this Minister who had the courage to go to Somalia must have the courage to take on the Department of Finance and ask them to provide the funds for recruitment.  It will not cost a great deal to recruit people to the force and it would be a pity to continue with the embargo on recruitment to the Department of Defence.</P>
    <P>I join my colleagues in wishing the troops well and I know this mission will be successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I lend my name to the majority view of the House that Irish troops should be deployed in peace enforcement duties only in certain circumstances. The Bill before us is very important in many respects.  I do not wish to cover ground that has already been dealt with but I will draw attention to two or three aspects of the legislation that need to be teased out.</P>
      <P>I, like other Members, feel we owe a debt of gratitude to our troops for their role in peace-keeping operations throughout the world.  When I was a young lad, I saw on television that our troops were going to the Congo.  Our troops have covered themselves in glory right around the world and they have a very proud record.  I would like to think that they will be equally successful in their new role.  I fully subscribe to this new role, provided there are proper checks and balances, which I will deal with in detail later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be very tight rules as to <Col N="339" /> where we should deploy our troops in a peace enforcement role.  As a rule of thumb I believe we are talking about humanitarian reasons only.  There is a huge fountain of good will towards us all around the world and we have no axe to grind with anybody.  We have managed to maintain this for 30 to 35 years but we are now about to change from a peace-keeping to peace enforcement role.  We need to be extremely careful when serving in areas of ethnic violence that we are only there for very specific reasons.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons that prompted me to contribute tonight was the harrowing images on television recently of a huge convoy of humanitarian aid being stopped at a crossroads by a few warlords, who I would consider to be thugs. The United Nations commander looked like a person who had no authority.  I do not know enough about foreign affairs, particularly in those parts of the world engaged in ethnic violence, but I know enough to realise that if that sort of imagery of the UN is beamed around the world, its authority will be undermined before we know where we are, and it will not be able to fulfil its role.  If the United Nations cannot fulfil its role, whatever the United Nations General Assembly decide, there will always be people and countries who will decide to fulfil the role for them &mdash; and that is dangerous.  For the future protection of many people across the world it is in all our interests to have a strong United Nations.  I see the issue being discussed tonight as a step in that direction, but whoever decides where or how we will be involved in the future would need to have the wisdom of Solomon.  One can imagine the horrendous problems in a situation where one could not win.  I am not a military man and I am sure there are answers to all these queries, but I would like to tease them out with the Minister on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>This Dáil will give a unanimous decision because we are a peace loving nation and we believe that other people should have a right to the type of lifestyle <Col N="340" /> we have.  Our troops are extremely well-trained and disciplined and will be well managed under the United Nations flag. If they can bring peace and stability to a war-torn part of the world, then I am all in favour of it.  It is reasonable to expect that every Deputy would say publicly and conscientiously what he believes the case to be.  The Minister should take seriously the Fine Gael view that if our troops are called on in the future to serve in a peace enforcement role in other parts of the world, we should be given the same opportunity to consider the request, as we are doing tonight.  I appreciate the lengths to which the Minister is going.  I would not expect any Irish Minister for Defence to do any less to ensure that our troops are as safe as they can be.  In the military world there will always be risks. If possible, I do not want to see any Irishman or woman lose his or her life in any circumstances; but we live in an age when soldiers and policemen even in civil law circumstances lose their lives.</P>
    <P>Tonight marks a turning point in how the United Nations will operate.  It is an impetus which the United Nations badly needed.  I believe we are on the right track.  It is important to make clear recommendations. It is important to ensure we know the culture and the type of terrain into which we will put our troops and that we will know when it is not in anybody's best interests not to send our troops, not least our own.</P>

      <P>It gives me pleasure to speak on this Bill and in support of the two large military encampments in my constituency in Fermoy &mdash; Fitzgerald Camp and Kilworth Lynch Camp &mdash; where we have a substantial number of personnel.  We live in a volatile and changing world.  Since the collapse of the old bi-power structures we have seen a great <Col N="341" /> increase in violence and instability across the globe.  In such a situation there is an onus on the countries of the world to reform their nations to maintain peace and to work collectively for the peaceful resolution of the problems of these troubled areas.  This Bill makes a positive contribution towards attaining this aim.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a long and noble record of participation in UN peacekeeping operations since 1958, when a group of officers took up duty with an observer group in the Lebanon.  This tradition should be a source of pride to our country. It is a tradition that is very much in harmony with our nation's stance on neutrality in the international arena. More than ever there is a need for peace-keeping around the globe.  Ireland has never shirked its responsibility in this regard.  Indeed, we have recognised this responsibility as an integral part of our neutral stance.  This Bill allows for a more effective participation in this process and as such I welcome it.</P>
      <P>I would like at this stage to say a word of thanks to all those Irish soldiers who have served in a peacekeeping capacity around the world.  They have been true ambassadors for Ireland and have carried the message of peace around the globe. Long may it continue.  I would ask the Minister to consider an expanded role for the FCA, who play a magnificent part in solving many of our military problems, and an upgrading of this service is important. I fully support the recruitment of young people.  It is necessary for the lifeblood of any Army to have young people coming on stream at all times.  There should be a policy of annual recruitment. Again, I welcome the Bill and I look forward to its being enacted.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward such a vital piece of legislation.</P>

      <P>The changing of the role of Irish contingents serving with the United Nations international forces is a major step for this country.  It is regrettable that so little time has been allocated for this debate, both in the House and nationally.  I understand Committee Stage is being taken tomorrow and that <Col N="342" /> a final motion will be passed on Friday. I appreciate that the contingent will have to travel next month.  However, it is a pity that so little public debate has taken place regarding this major change in Irish foreign policy.</P>
      <P>During the past few weeks important pieces of legislation, with significant implications for Irish society and Irish political life in general, have been passed in this Oireachtas with unseemly haste and without adequate debate.  The role of parliaments in the political process is already diminishing in the modern state. The Oireachtas has again been sidelined, and surely a liberal democracy should not operate like this.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for his role in putting Somalia on the world political agenda.  I understand the Minister has travelled to Somalia three times.  As he said in his speech, there is significant public support for action on Somalia.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs and in his current ministry he has consistently supported the promotion of peace and justice and basic human rights throughout the world.  I commend him for his humane approach in relation to this Bill and particularly his concern for the safety of the soldiers who will travel to Somalia and their families.  The Minister encourages and supports a proud tradition initiated by Frank Aiken.  I say with all sincerity, and without any ulterior motive, that his removal from the Department of Foreign Affairs was unfortunate for this country.</P>
      <P>I have major reservations about this Bill, which in effect changes the role of our Defence Forces serving with the United Nations from that of peace-keeping to one of peacemaking and enforcing.  The nature of international politics has changed dramatically since the ending of the Cold War and the United Nations has had great difficulty in adapting to this change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always supported Ireland's policy of positive neutrality.  Ireland's role in international affairs should be to continue to encourage negotiation and diplomacy and not to become involved in military conflicts.  Ireland is not a military <Col N="343" /> nation and we have a proud tradition of missionary work and of voluntary aid relief.  The Minister rightly paid tribute earlier to organisations such as GOAL, Concern, Trócaire and the Red Cross. The Programme for Government makes provision for increased overseas development assistance.  As a small, impartial and respected nation we should not be expected to become militarily involved in every flashpoint in the world.  We will not shirk our responsibilities, but we should continue to play a constructive role in international affairs in more effective ways.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt the Somalia cause is a good one.  The Irish people have been moved by the scenes of starvation there and have become involved in voluntary fund raising for those people.  Indeed, President Robinson represented us all when she visited Somalia to highlight its causes.  However, once we take the crucial decision to become peace enforcers and the risk that involves for Irish lives, what will we be asked to do next?  Will we be on a slippery slope?  Will the next cause necessitating military intervention be equally worthy?  We need a full scale national debate on Irish foreign policy; this Bill cannot be taken in isolation. For many, Irish foreign policy is drifting. Now that we have come to the end of the Cold War and, with creeping European integration and a change in character of the United Nations we are facing major challenges.  Our role in international affairs needs to be clearly assessed.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt Irish troops want to go to Somalia but, as previous speakers stated, evey soldier wants to fight.  They are trained to fight and that is what they expect.  However, we should take into account the wider implications of that decision.</P>
    <P>I will deal briefly with the risks to which Irish soldiers will be exposed.  The Minister is concerned in that regard, that was one of his main reasons for travelling to Somalia.  He stated earlier that he could give assurances but no absolute guarantees. The general public should be made aware that this is a significant step.  We <Col N="344" /> should not lose sight of our overall objective if the military conflict is prolonged. Our overall objective is a humane one, basically to aid the ordinary people of Somalia.</P>
    <P>The activities of the UN are being questioned and it is also being questioned in regard to its activities in Somalia.  Certain reservations have been expressed, particularly following the killing of the Pakistani soldiers.  Those issues need to be addressed.  We need to monitor consistently the role of the UN in Somalia to ascertain if it is handling the situation correctly and in that regard we need to review our own position.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that if we do not proceed with this measure Ireland will be marginalised.  Nobody in Ireland wants that to happen.  We can continue to participate in peacekeeping missions, we are an impartial nation in many ways and are respected for that.  We have always carried out our UN obligations in the past, for example, we allowed our air facilities to be used by the United States during the Gulf War.  However, from time to time we must put forward a different view.  For example, do wars simply promote the arms industry and in whose interest is it to have military intervention in many of those countries?  We have a role to play in regard to diplomacy.  More than anything, President Robinson highlighted what a small nation can do.  We have moral authority and we became involved in the situation in Somalia.  We highlighted the issue there, which demonstrates that Ireland can play a role, not necessarily a full military intervention role, but we can raise our voice and speak out as a respected nation.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a moral obligation to address global inequalities, for example, the general issue of poverty in the Third World compared to the position in Western Europe and the United States.  That is possibly the most fundamental issue underlying the debate tonight. Obviously, the specific issue under discussion relates to sending troops to Somalia, but that is because people are starving there and warlords are preventing food from getting to the starving <Col N="345" /> people.  We should examine the general situation, the banking situation and how those inequalities arose in the first place. That is a major challenge but it should be dealt with in this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On my election to Dáil Éireann in 1989, I became Labour Party spokesperson on Defence and since then I have become interested in the activities and operations of the Defence Forces, both Permanent and Reserve.  I am pleased to say that those interests have at all times been facilitated by successive Ministers, officials and members of the forces, male and female, whether in the Army, Naval Services, Air Corps or Slua Muiri.</P>
      <P>This legislation is the fifth Bill discussed by the Oireachtas since the primary Act came into force in 1954.  It is the second time this matter has been introduced in this House in my time, the last being the Bill which gave effect to representations made by members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before us is brief, a mere four sections.  Its purpose is to permit the permanent element of the Defence Forces to operate in a peace-enforcing role, rather than a peacekeeping role in which we have been engaged since the first mission to the Lebanon in 1958.  This is a significant expansion of one of the primary roles of the Defence Forces, last articulated in a full form around 1981.  I have some reservations about the change in policy.  Members of our Defence Forces are currently serving in some 13 missions overseas both in a UN and EC capacity.  They are serving in Cyprus, in a high profile mission with UNIFIL, in the Lebanon &mdash; for which the United Nations was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1980 &mdash; in the Middle East and in less well known operations in the Sahara, Angola and Pakistan.  In all, there are 1,700 men overseas, a significant proportion of a total Permanent Defence Force of 12,700.  It is appropriate to record that since we joined the United Nations in December 1955 we have participated fully in sending troops on various <Col N="346" /> missions and our role has been acknowledged throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Since its formation as a corps back in 1924, Supply and Transport, from which these blue helmets will be drawn, has served the nation extremely well.  It has provided the ultimate sacrifice in that Captain McNamara of the Second Garrison Company was the first fatality on UN service.</P>
    <P>The legislation before us provides that a further 80 men will serve on overseas duties in the United Nations operation in Somalia.  Those men are in a specialist unit and provide much needed support to the combat elements of the Defence Forces.  A number of issues come to mind, both in respect of the Bill and the operations in Somalia.  How many men volunteered for this mission?  How many dropped out?  Do we need a mandatory enlistment clause for future members of the Defence Forces as proposed in section 2 (1)?  What is the nature of the peace enforcement mission?  The first such mission under the UN flag was in Korea.  I feel certain that there are many more volunteers than vacancies for such UN missions so only the element of volunteering needs to be added to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Recent developments in the United Kingdom in respect of that state's manifold military missions, as well as those of other EC member states, come to mind again when I look at the general thrust of this and other overseas defence Acts. As far as we are aware, the Bill provides that only members of the Permanent Defence Forces may serve overseas.  The various commitments we have at home &mdash; 9,767 military parties for Border operations, 523 military presences at blasting in the course of quarrying and 2,106 cash escorts &mdash; indicates the pressure on our forces.  I wonder if now is the time to sit back to see if we can commit selected personnel from the Reserve Force and Second Line to undertake some of these operations.  It seems that the demands on and resources of our full-time Army, with knock-on implications for hours worked, on a force which is already suffering the difficulties of a high age profile now require radical solutions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="347" /> It is important to note the age profile. The average age of a private in the British army is 18 whereas in the Irish Army it is 21.  The average age of corporals in the Irish Army is 34 and of sergeants 40.  This indicates a specific need for a recruitment policy by the Government.  Notwithstanding financial difficulties, I hope the Government will introduce a recruitment policy, as recommended in the Gleeson report, as early as possible.</P>
    <P>In regard to the legislation before us, I wonder to what extent the Council of Defence advised the Minister on all matters relating to the Department of Defence.  What is the time duration of Irish participation in United Nations' operations in Somalia?  I would also be grateful if the Minister could address the subject of payments by the United Nations of the cost of this and other United Nations' operations.  We now have a significant proportion of the Permanent Defence Forces overseas participating in such missions, costing the Irish taxpayers significant sums.  I understand that to date some major countries, such as the United States, are not paying their fair share to the United Nations. Every effort should be made to ensure that they play their part.  I await the Minister's response to the various issues I have raised.  I wish God speed to the unit preparing to go to Somalia and hope they return to Ireland without casualty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to support and welcome this legislation but with a few words of caution similar to those expressed by our spokesperson, Deputy Barrett.  This move is to be supported. We in Ireland should be willing to expand our role in the UN from peacekeeping to peace enforcement.  My interest in this stems from my time as spokesperson for the party on development affairs.  Following the Cold War it is clear that apart <Col N="348" /> from our aid responsibilities we have other responsibilities to the Third World arising from our often very destructive involvement in the context of our broad involvement with the western powers. That is a legacy that requires our active intervention.  We also have responsibilities as Europeans to European trouble spots, but those are issues for another day.</P>
      <P>This legislation will enable our troops going abroad to be involved in a way different from their role in the past.  The Government has already made a decision about sending troops to Somalia.  It obviously has ramifications for any potential demands in the future and gives the power to our troops to be involved in any UN action if this Dáil so approves. It is a very significant decision indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to dwell a little on the post-cold war situation.  The Minister referred to how that had changed world politics in that balances which had been there had been altered and there was need for a new order.  If it could be a new order based on the UN operating from the highest principles, that would be a good thing, but there are obvious serious questions about that when one considers the events of the last weekend.  However, we should strive to create a better world order.  Somalia is a most impressive example of how intervention can rapidly transform a disaster into a situation of some hope, some peace.  As the Minister knows, if there is to be any serious development in any region an absolute prerequisite is peace, and this view is supported by the UN in the context of their annual reports on the state of the world's children who, along with women, are often the most vulnerable in times of famine and war.  The UN see the end of the cold war as a beginning towards helping the cause of the world's poor in a number of ways.  They identified the most substantial way which is relevant in Somalia and which may also be relevant, in the years ahead, in the context of Mozambique, where a huge UN resource has already been put in place to attempt to demilitarise the situation there and build on a very fragile peace of seven months, <Col N="349" /> which has already transformed a famine-striken, war-stricken country into a country that has begun to build.</P>
    <P>The move away from military dictatorship and military equipment as the driving force will not happen very easily because there are vested interests in the military presence in those countries, a vested interest which we saw at its most devastating and insidious when we finally got substantial amounts of aid into Somalia and it was blocked by the warring factions until such time as there was a UN presence there.  If aid is to be of any relevance, if development is to be possible, demilitarisation must take place.  In many cases, it will not take place spontaneously because there are so many powerful vested interests.  In our own country we know how insidious and how difficult it is when ideals become enmeshed with power sources, to separate them.  The consequences have been enormous right throughout the Third World, especially for children.  In the last decade alone more than 1.5 million children have been killed in wars, more than four million have been physically disabled, more than five million have been forced into refugee camps and more than 12 million have lost their homes.  It is easy to read those figures out but if one thinks about them they are truly horrifying.</P>
    <P>It is right therefore that we should not stand back from situations and be involved only in peacekeeping and not get involved in complex situations where difficult decisions have to be made?  We should not stand back and let a situation develop to a stage where a peacekeeping role is necessary.  In the intervening period before complex situations develop great destruction can take place.  I support the broad principles of the Bill.  The transformation in Somalia over the last 12 to 18 months has been major and the position of UN troops there has become very difficult.  The relationship with the local population has become more tense arising out of recent incidents in regard to which there has been much publicity.</P>
    <P>Peace enforcing is very different from peacekeeping.  Our spokesperson on Defence made the point that peace <Col N="350" /> enforcing involves a different level of training, experience and resources.  This issue was raised during Question Time last week.  References were made to Boutros Boutros Ghali's views on this.  He had not anticipated that every peace-keeping force would be transformed into a peace enforcing group, but he identified that new and different sensitivity and skills were needed for that role.  The challenges posed to the soldiers on the ground and their leaders are great.  The choices to be made become enormously complex and are fraught with difficulties. This issue should not be taken lightly; it should be given due attention.  The cautions suggested by our spokesperson in relation to regular reviews of each request should be considered.  Each request should be considered on its own merits.</P>
    <P>I note the amendment put down by Democratic Left opposes our involvement in a peace enforcing role.  I would not agree with that.  The amendment refers to the need for reform of UN structures and that is very important.  This matter was raised during Question Time. The UN was set up more than four decades ago to cater for different problems in those times.  As it has adopted post-Cold War policies, the demands being placed on it have increased.  All defence spokespersons and foreign affairs spokes-persons in the world should seek to set in place a review of the structures and functions of the United Nations.  I am concerned about the self-appointed international policekeeping role of the United States.  I have supported some of its actions but its position in this area is something that should be clarified.  That should be included in a general examination of the structures and workings of the UN.  I hope the Minister will assure us that he and other EC Ministers are taking this issues seriously and that some initiatives have been taken in this area. Initiatives are being asked for on the ground.  UN officials managing complex operations in places like Mozambique are finding the delays, problems and bureaucracy very difficult to deal with. They are dealing with very tense situations <Col N="351" /> involving two armies standing off from one another with the potential of war breaking out at any time.  The response the UN can provide in such cases is inadequate and its reform should be seriously reviewed.  With those words of caution, I support the Bill.  I hope the Minister will be able to provide assurance in regard to areas of concern.</P>

      <P>As a young child I vividly remember the visit of the late President Kennedy to this country in 1963.  It was interesting to watch the RTE programme on Sunday &mdash; 30 years to the day of his visit &mdash; and to listen to his words in respect of the dark days that were on the horizon in the 60s.  Given the tremendous boost people of this country and the world received from his character, personality and words, it is only after some years of involvement in politics and a certain sense of maturity that one understands the implications of war, military action and political decisions involving armies, armed personnel and participation in both peacekeeping and peace enforcement.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for Defence on his openness in regard to this matter, his concern and involvement as Minister for Defence in seeing that the ground is properly reconnoitred before a decision is taken to involve Irish troops in peace enforcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Defence was for many years a cinderella Department under the responsibility of junior Ministers of lesser ability than their peers. That responsibility was given to satisfy persons who might otherwise be peeved. However, the present Minister for Defence, having moved from the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Department of Defence, has given a new impetus, new status and a new stature to the Department of Defence and that is welcome.  For over 1,000 years this country has been involved in military activities. From my primary school days I recall the lines of the poet who said that on the far foreign fields from Dunkirk to Belgrade lie the soldiers and chiefs of the <Col N="352" /> Irish Brigade.  I read in the daily papers last week of the involvement of Irish people in the Battle of Waterloo 178 years ago and one is constantly reminded of our people's history.  One does not join an army for fun.  Only certain types of people with certain characters want to join an army.  That character is forged and tempered by an enthusiasm for adventure, excitement, involvement in humanitarian issues and the risk of danger and death.  Irish Army personnel who have served our country well over the years have displayed not only those characteristics but, due to our history, they have shown an understanding of the variety of conflicts that exist across the world.  It is no shame to say that people from this country involved in Army activities or other types of work have always shown a unique understanding for sorting out conflicts.  If only we could sort out our own conflicts.</P>
    <P>Section 1, the main section defines an international United Nations force.  This calls for a change in the status of peace-keeping forces to that of peace enforcement. One does not join an army for fun, one joins to fulfil one's perception of that role.  All we can do as a neutral country is assist in so far as we can to bring peace to areas of conflict where the UN is involved.</P>
    <P>I found Deputy De Rossa's contribution this evening unhelpful to say the least.  If the United Nations were not involved in Somalia would it be the equivalent of Democratic Left, or its counterparts around the world, attempting to put in place a political structure that would bring peace to a war-torn country such as that?  It is impossible for people here to understand the mentality and the day-to-day activities that take place in Mogadishu, in other parts of Somalia or, indeed, around the world.  It is difficult to do that without appreciating both the historic background, as in the case of the former Yugoslavia, or the local circumstances, as might obtain in Afghanistan, or elsewhere in deciding how a solution can be achieved.  We have all been appalled &mdash; that is too slight a word &mdash; at the television pictures from <Col N="353" /> Ethiopia, Somalia and other countries where, due to intervention and a mad craving for power by local warlords, the extermination of human life on a vast scale has taken place.  We have no real appreciation here of what that means. Human life is valued in a very different way in many of the Third World or emerging countries than it is here.</P>
    <P>I support fully the call for the change from peacekeeping to peace enforcement. I would ask the Minister, before Committee Stage, to give serious consideration to the amendment tabled by the Fine Gael spokesman, Deputy Barrett, requesting that, as happens <i>de facto</i>, each application would come before the Dáil by way of motion, that this involvement by Army personnel in peace enforcement be on a voluntary basis, that it be explained properly to personnel prior to any participation and that there be a review every 12 months of our involvement in any peace enforcement operations.</P>
    <P>From a legal point of view I am sure questions, arising from peace enforcement, as to the consequences for a member of the Irish Army involved in UN peace enforcement operations who decides to take action to enforce peace either in self defence or otherwise, need to be answered.  Who determines whether the peace enforcement was legal and proper?  Will there be a monitoring system to ensure that everything is above board in so far as Army etiquette and participation is concerned?</P>
    <P>I trust the Government will ensure that our Army personnel on UN duty in Somalia or elsewhere are given the best of preparatory training, supplied with proper equipment and the most up-to-date and sophisticated facilities for these peace enforcement duties.  It may be that based on our historic understanding of how conflicts start and how the human mentality can be attuned to finding solutions, any involvement of Irish Army personnel could bring about a greater sense of realism and practicality in many of the current conflicts.  I am aware that in his former capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs the Minister allocated <Col N="354" /> £6,000 to a religious order to enable them to buy a printing machine in Ethiopia to help educate small children who would otherwise be prematurely sucked into a life of military activity.</P>

I worked with Deputy Andrews in the Department of Foreign Affairs for almost a year and I am pleased to be contributing to this important debate and supporting his Bill.  Deputy Kenny's late father and my father, who served this country together for some years, would be proud of what we are doing tonight because we are involving ourselves in an historic development and that should not be underestimated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened with interest to the statements and views which have been expressed in this House this evening. Like most Irish people, I was horrified by the death and destruction inflicted on Somalia and its people by the warlords and bandits there.  However, as the Minister <Col N="355" /> for Defence, Deputy Andrews, said the situation in Somalia has, in less than one year, changed dramatically.  The people are no longer dying from starvation. That is not to say that everything has improved.  Recent events in south Mogadishu have shown that fundamental problems still remain.  There is a need for all parties and factions to respect the ceasefire and to work for national reconciliation and the establishment of democratic government.</P>
    <P>The international community, through the United Nations, has become involved in Somalia to help its people resolve their differences and reconstruct their country. The United Nations is not in Somalia to impose its will or to impose a government on its people; it is there to help the Somalis reconcile their differences and establish their own government.  Only through co-operation, patience and determination can the fear and distrust which have torn Somalia apart be overcome.</P>
    <P>In March last, I had the opportunity to visit Somalia.  While there, I met the special representative of the Secretary-General, Admiral Jonathan Howe, the commander of the UNITAF Forces, General Johnston, and a number of other senior officials.  I also met representatives of a number of NGO's, including Concern and GOAL, and of women's groups in Mogadishu.  I was impressed by the conviction of all whom I met to work for the future of peace and stability in Somalia.  All recognise that it is neither an easy nor simple task.</P>
    <P>On my way to Baidoa, I visited the feeding centre where Valerie Place had worked and I saw the beautiful monument that her Somali co-workers had erected in her memory.  It was a most moving experience.  Further on the road to Baidoa, I saw the place where she had been killed one month earlier.  She was the third international aid worker to be killed this year in Somalia.  It is tragic to think that she, and other aid workers, foreign and Somali, have lost their lives or been injured while trying to help others.  Her death illustrated the immediate necessity of providing adequate protection <Col N="356" /> for the humanitarian relief effort and of disarming the warlords and gunmen who have disrupted the country's social fabric and destroyed its infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Following Valerie Place's death in February, I raised at a very senior level in Washington and at the United Nations in New York our concern about the situation in Somalia and the need to ensure that the humanitarian effort was not impeded.  It was vital that there be adequate protection for aid workers, upon whom the relief effort depends so much.  I reiterated our concerns to Admiral Howe when I met him in Mogadishu in March and made a number of recommendations as to how the security of the aid workers might be improved.</P>
    <P>The visit by the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy David Andrews, to Somalia last August, and the visit by the President in October, brought the world's attention to the tragedy of Somalia. Ireland appealed to the international community to act immediately to help restore peace in that country, to provide the necessary humanitarian assistance and to support Somali efforts to re-establish national authority and democratic government.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the United Task Force (UNITAF) was authorised by the Security Council in December 1992 as an interim step to bring stability to the country, when it became obvious that every attempt to help the people of Somalia was being consistently disrupted, often by General Aideed's faction which was responsible for much of the destruction of Mogadishu.</P>
    <P>UNITAF was largely successful in fulfilling its mandate.  It brought a measure of calm to its area of operations in southern Somalia.  In Mogadishu people began to resume normal activity and there was hope that peace and national reconciliation would follow.  The reconstruction of the Somali police force was begun, plans were made for the rehabilitation of the basic infrastructure of the city and projects in support of agriculture developed.  In a few weeks time the crops are expected to be harvested <Col N="357" /> after a good rainy season.  While in that country I had personal experience of seeing the many NGOs working in this area providing seeds for the local community.  We should not under-estimate the role these people have played in ensuring a good harvest for the people of Somalia.  For the first time in nearly two years many parts of Somalia will be able to feed its people.</P>
    <P>When UNITAF was established it was clear that it was a short term measure only.  The United Nations would have to devise plans to fulfil its original political and humanitarian mandate.  Following the presentation of the Secretary-General's third report to the Security Council in March 1993, the Security Council unanimously agreed to re-establish UNOSOM, with an expanded and enhanced mandate.  This mandate expresses the original goals of the UN: to bring a permanent end to the fighting, to assist in the reconstruction of Somalia and to promote, through political reconciliation, the establishment of a democratic national government reflecting the wishes of the Somali people.  It is clear beyond doubt that a very great international effort will be required for some considerable time to achieve these ends.</P>
    <P>The mandate and activities of UNOSOM II must be seen as part of this effort: an attempt to create a secure environment in which the wider political and humanitarian objectives can be achieved.  The Government, Irish NGOs and public and political opinion have pressed for action along these lines and for a stronger UN presence.  Some progress has been made on the political front since an agreement was signed in Addis Ababa in March 1993, under the aegis of the United Nations, between leaders of the main factions, local elders and social groups, including women's groups.  Sustained efforts have been made to encourage the Somali leaders, through patient and painstaking negotiation, to arrive at a political consensus.  UNOSOM continues to work with and to encourage the elders and other representative groups throughout Somalia to reconcile their differences and to participate in negotiations with a <Col N="358" /> view to electing representative local and district councils.  This is a first step towards the re-establishment of representative national authority.</P>
    <P>I deplore the events of 5 June and 13 June in which so many people were killed.  I express my condolences to the families of all those who lost their lives. Our concerns have already been raised at a very high level with the United Nations in New York.  I welcome the fact that the incidents will be thoroughly investigated and await publication of the findings.  It is important that whatever measures may be called for are swiftly implemented by the UN.</P>
    <P>The House is considering this evening the Bill to amend the Defence Act, 1960. It is necessary to amend the Act in order that Ireland can respond positively to the request from the United Nations for a transport contingent.  I believe that we should participate in UNOSOM II.  As I have already said, we have publicly pressed for an international commitment to help the people of Somalia.  On behalf of the Government and the majority of the people of Ireland, I personally have conveyed this message to the United Nations.  Now we have been asked to participate in the international effort for which we have called.  We cannot turn our back on this international effort, which has been established by the United Nations.</P>
    <P>UNOSOM II took over from UNITAF on 1 May 1993.  Already approximately 18,000 personnel, from over 20 countries, are participating in Somalia.  When deployment is complete over 30 countries will have provided a total of 20,000 military personnel, 8,000 logistics personnel and a civilian staff of 2,800.  In addition there is a quick reaction force of battalion strength currently provided by the United States.</P>
    <P>The Irish transport contingent, as part of the logistics component of UNOSOM II, will support combat troops in the provision of supplies.  Following the visit of the Minister for Defence to Somalia last weekend, it appears that the UN has decided to locate the transport unit in Baidoa from where it will supply the Zimbabwean <Col N="359" /> troops in Oddur and Wejit.  The Minister for Defence has already provided details of the unit, how it will be equipped and its capability to protect itself should the need arise.  The unit will, when fulfilling its transport role, be protected by troops from the UNOSOM Force Command.  In its base camp it will be protected by the French battalion in whose sector it will be located.</P>
    <P>I welcome the news that the Irish transport unit will be sent to Baidoa.  Ireland has a particular relationship with that region.  The Irish NGO's, GOAL and Concern, have played an important role in stemming the death rate there.  They continue to support the local community in rehabilitating the schools and the orphanage and in supporting the local health clinics.  I hope that when the transport unit is established in Baidoa it will be able to support and work with the Irish NGO's there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of all the modern global requirements to which the United Nations must address itself, our response in this instance is a minimum response.  To put this matter in context, under the proposed operation in Somalia there will be a force of 28,000 troops from 32 countries and what we propose is to supply a transport contingent of 80 personnel who will be based in Baidoa.  I hope the Dáil will approve the resolution to give effect to that proposal following on the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation amends the Defence Act, 1960.  Since enactment of that Act, in all United Nations operations in which we have taken part our military force has functioned in a police-like manner. They have been engaged in United Nations operations on the basis of keeping the peace, policing the peace as it were, between agreed lines that were settled between opposing forces in areas such as Lebanon.  We are now amending the 1960 Act to allow our military forces to proceed to these areas as military personnel, and that is the minimum we should do.  From 1960 until now they <Col N="360" /> operated as police and now they are going, as they should as professional soldiers participating in a UN force under a UN command.  That is not a new concept. It was written into Chapter VII of the UN Charter but it was frustrated over the years by the cold war rivalries on the Security Council.  Deputy Flaherty touched on the nub of this matter when she said that what is required is for the UN to address itself to the post-Cold War era.</P>
    <P>Dr. Boutros Boutros Ghali in his book <i>Agenda for Peace</i> summarised what the UN approach should be now, how one can get agreement at the Security Council when it is not divided on Cold War lines and when one can invoke Chapter VII of the Charter.  We are invoking Chapter VII in order to participate with the other nations in this operation in Somalia.  The League of Nations failed because it could not invoke this sort of peace enforcement measure.  Eamon de Valera, who was then the Irish representative on the League of Nations, strongly advocated the need for collective security and the importance of functioning on that basis. He considered that the test on which the League of Nations would stand or fall. The League of Nations failed in Abyssinia, the neighbouring country of Somalia, because it did not enforce the peace. After the Second World War Chapter VII was put into the Charter forming the United Nations to ensure that the UN could enforce peace; if there was agreement by the Security Council they could effectively enforce the peace by dispatching a contingent of this kind to Somalia. That is the sort of operation in which the UN will have to engage to a greater degree in the future.  This is the kernel of the effectiveness of the UN.  It is the essence of the concept of collective security set out in the Chapter.  If peaceful means fail to prevent a breach of the peace or an act of aggression, coercive measures agreed by the international community may be used under the Charter. Otherwise the UN will collapse.</P>
    <P>Our response is the correct response to ensure international banditry will not succeed and that an international rule <Col N="361" /> of law to preserve peace will prevail. Ultimately there must be the sanction of force properly controlled under the direction of the UN by the agreement of the Security Council, designed to ensure that peace can be restored and the rule of law brought into operation.</P>
    <P>This Bill should have the required safeguards. Safeguards are written into the Bill where we maintain the provision of the 1960 Act that any such overseas operation requiring Irish personnel of more than 12 members must come before the Dáil by way of a resolution.  Each case can be adequately assessed on its merits in the Dáil.  With that safeguard we are making our contribution to a great UN effort in Somalia.  By incorporating this type of operation into legislation we are ensuring that this new orientation of international policy involving the enforcement of collective security is one which Ireland can participate and play its part.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to be able to take part in debate on this major legislation. It makes a very powerful statement about how we are shaping up to the post-Cold War period and about linking our defence policy with our foreign policy.  This legislation is fundamental and profound.  It is a watershed in terms of defence and foreign policy.  I do not want to dwell on Somalia because we will deal with a motion as appropriate, when this Bill is enacted.  The substance of this Bill is not about Somalia.  It is about war and peace, about coercion with a UN mandate and about depriving aggression of the spoils and territorial gains that go with it.  It involves issues of life and death. It involves commitment rather than passivity in terms of international affairs.  I share the belief of a number of speakers that it is a pity we do not have more time to reflect on this.  I support the measure. It is fundamental legislation which should <Col N="362" /> not be diminished by the modest number of sections proposed.</P>
      <P>The key issue has to do with the essential difference between peacekeeping and peace enforcement.  It is worth explaining some of the differences.  The peace-keeping mandate of the United Nations arises in the context in which all sides to a conflict will a peace and will the intervention of the United Nations as a peacekeeper.  All of them agree to certain preconditions regarding what is required. In terms of the troops we commit it also carries with it very limited rules of military engagement.</P>
      <P>Peace enforcement is very different. As a prior condition it does not require that everyone involved perceives the mandate in the same way.  Not everyone who is party to a conflict will necessarily welcome the intrusion of the United Nations forces.  It may involve acts of coercion in certain circumstances &mdash; hopefully not in Somalia &mdash; in line with decisions of the Security Council.</P>
      <P>We are now considering a very major transition in terms of defence and foreign policy.  In that regard I would be interested to hear the view of the Minister and of the Government in terms of the emerging agreement and consensus, within the context of the Maastricht Treaty, that the European Community should have a common foreign and security policy.  What is this Government's view of what Europe should be saying about structures in the United Nations itself?  It is an extremely important issue. I would be interested to hear even its first thoughts or principles on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current make-up of the Security Council is entirely inadequate to deal with the breakdown of the bi-polar world, the breakdown of the old certainties of the Warsaw Pact versus NATO, of the equilibrium maintained across the face of the globe.  It may have been a balance of terror but it had the advantage of some certainty.  That has evaporated, leading to considerable potential for uncertainty.  The Security Council of the United Nations was put together at the end of the last war when <Col N="363" /> the victors all had a seat at the Security Council table.</P>
    <P>The Security Council is in urgent need of reconstruction, to give greater weight to what was heretofore referred to as the Third World.  Do we have a view about whether the European Community, within a reconstructed United Nations, should have a seat at that table?  If we have such a view, at what price?  Would it speak with one voice?  Is it conceivable that the two existing members of the Security Council, both nuclear powers, France and the United Kingdom, would concede such a role to the European Community?  We should be active in such a debate, active in promoting a view as to how the United Nations itself should work from the top down.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with one or two provisions of the Bill.  The clear distinction will be made under this Bill between existing members of the Permanent Defence Forces and new members who would enter as serving officer, NCO or private.  They will be obliged to accept, as a condition of their employment, that this United Nations peace enforcing mandate will form part of their conditions of employment.  For existing employees that is not a condition. As we renew the Defence Forces over time it would be wrong to maintain such a distinction.  I would add my voice to those who have called for an emphasis on voluntarism.  I am convinced, in terms of their professionalism and their appetite to serve this country and the United Nations, there will be no shortfall of volunteers within the Permanent Defence Forces to fulfil any of the United Nations mandates this country takes up.  We should allow for voluntarism in the case of all members of the Permanent Defence Forces for peace enforcing missions whenever they arise.</P>
    <P>When the United Nations Security Council redefines some of the elements of a mission, whether it be the political objectives, the rules of engagement or any other relevant but fundamental matter to the nature of the mandate &mdash; and in ongoing difficult circumstances <Col N="364" /> that is not an unusual thing for the Security Council to do &mdash; it should be incumbent on the Government of the day to come back to this House, in respect of any new mandate by the United Nations Security Council which could impact on Irish troops in operational terms.  Those new conditions should be the subject of a separate motion in this House so that one could discuss the commitment.  That is extremely important.</P>
    <P>In the absence of the type of basic reform of the structure of the United Nations Security Council, we need to ask some very serious questions about the nature of the interface between the forces of the United States of America and those of the United Nations where they find themselves serving either together on the same field of operation or where the United States is leading forces under United Nations Security Council Resolutions. I do not subscribe to the view &mdash; and I would regard myself as of a friendly disposition in terms of my attitude to the United States &mdash; that the United States of America should have some free-wheeling, super policing role in global terms.  In Somalia, there are serious difficulties in ascertaining the real chain of command involving the United States.  I should like to know the view of our Minister and Government.  It appears to me that much has been motivated by political needs and virility tests within the United States itself, perhaps directly on the orders of the Pentagon, rather than the clear command and authority of United Nations personnel on the ground. That is extremely disturbing if we are to commit ourselves to being co-partners in projects such as this, which I agree in principle and practice we should undertake. We should clearly insist that the United States be part and parcel of that United Nations umbrella in a significant and substantial way.</P>
    <P>Perhaps in the way power politics operate, somebody will tell me that is somewhat naïve, but if we believe in a world order based on respect for the principles of international law we cannot have free wheelers on board.  The use of the self-defence claim by the United States last <Col N="365" /> weekend, when they sent in something like £28 million worth of hardware to bomb a target in Baghdad, in my view was reprehensible, disgraceful and indefensible in respect of the United Nations itself.  I hope that, at the first opportunity, our Government will take advantage of whatever platform they get at the United Nations to express such a view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>If we believe in the primacy of the role of the United Nations, the corollary is that anything which brings it into disrepute should be repudiated.  That must be a fundamental principle in this type of legislation on the future conduct of defence and foreign policy.</P>
      <P>We have talked a good deal this evening about Somalia, which is the soft sell for the vigorous policy on which we are about to embark.  The hard sell, were we to go down that road, is Bosnia-Hercegovina. I want to pose a few questions to the Government and ascertain what specific answers they might give.  The Taoiseach attended the Copenhagen Summit last weekend.  That Summit, in Annex III, issued a declaration on Bosnia-Hercegovina, in which the heads of the various Governments and the head of state in the case of France, included the usual ritual which the toothless and useless European Community in this regard is wont to repeat <i>ad nauseam</i>, including one specific comment:</P>
      <P>The European Council decided to respond positively to the request of the United Nations Secretary General for men and money.  It urged member states to comply with that request within their abilities.</P>
      <P>Since we signed the declaration in Copenhagen is it considered that we have the ability to make a contribution of men and money to the operation in Bosnia-Hercegovina? On a wider basis, I would ask what are our views in the formulation of a common foreign and security policy? We are very close to the point where we will have to consider the question of joint action and to define principles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="366" /> Will it be a fundamental principle that aggression should not pay under international law in relation to the principles outlined in the UN Charter?  If that will be a fundamental principle we will have to recognise the gross failure of the European Community to respect the principles of international law in Bosnia-Hercegovina. The European Community was the first to recognise that state.  We set out laudable principles of international law in London and, prior to the Edinburgh Conference, we sent Vance and Owen on their mission, which has amounted to zero.  We have reduced this to the protection of safe havens which must be the most unsafe places on this earth to live in.  In addition, we are committed to providing a palliative, of men and money, as yet undefined.  Are we going to be part of this dirty and difficult war where toughness will be required even in the safe havens and it will not be the soft sell as in the case of Somalia? What is our view on that matter, because this law has as much to do with Bosnia-Hercegovina as it has with Somalia?  I have heard no one on the Government side of the House express a view on that matter and I would like the Minister to express a view on it.</P>
    <P>I would like to make one other point in conclusion.  The Government is being courageous in introducing this legislation and I salute it for doing so.  We have reached a major watershed in marrying defence policy with foreign policy.  I would like to know what implications this has for our unfolding policy at the United Nations, at the CSCE and in the European Community.  If we are to become active in this regard we should forget about the soft sell and the double think.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to avail of this opportunity, as a former Minister for Defence, to express my sincere appreciation for the great service provided to this State since its foundation by those who have served in the Defence Forces and the great honour they have brought to this country in their peacekeeping role under the flag of the United Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation before the House introduces <Col N="367" /> a fundamental change in the role that this House will ask Defence Forces personnel to undertake if they are to participate in peace enforcement operations. My party will table important amendments on Committee Stage which we will press very hard.  I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to these amendments &mdash; I have no doubt that amendments will be tabled by other parties also &mdash; to ensure that protection is provided for our troops when they commence operations under this new role and with this new responsibility.  In recent times I had the privilege of seeing the Army in operation under the United Nations flag in Cambodia when I was part of a delegation from this House who acted as international observers during the elections there.  They are performing magnificently in difficult circumstances.  I hope the amendments that we will put forward will be accepted.</P>
    <P>It is essential that serious consideration is given to the role of the Defence Forces. When emergencies arise we immediately look to the Army but forget about them in the intervening periods.  It is important that they are provided with proper equipment and that the recruitment campaign is renewed to ensure that we do not end up with a &ldquo;Dad's Army&rdquo;.  There is a danger that this will happen given the failure to recruit personnel over a long period of years and the willingness of the Government to undertake UN missions abroad while failing to recognise that the duties for those who remain at home have increased threefold.</P>

Most Members realise that while it is a short Bill it is of significance and importance to our Defence Forces whose United Nations' role will change dramatically from one of peacekeeping <Col N="368" /> to peace enforcement across the globe. We have a long and proud tradition of involvement with the United Nations down through the years and no one can dispute the fact that our commitment to its cause has been unwavering.  Since the days of a former constituency colleague, the late Frank Aiken, Ireland has been a stalwart member of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Tonight we are focusing on Somalia.  It has been proposed that we should send 80 Army personnel to that unfortunate country to see if we can provide any of the help and assistance that they so urgently need.  The scenes of devastation which have been shown regularly on our television screens have brought the problems home to us.  Unfortunately, the warlords wreak havoc and they have no difficulty in using death and starvation to achieve their own ends and objectives. The developed world has to act.  While it may have been effective to adopt a policing role in the past we need to move towards the point where we can enforce the peace in countries such as Somalia.</P>
      <P>We live in a changing world.  As the Minister said, prior to the end of the Cold War the super-powers were able to keep small conflicts under wraps but following the ending of the Cold War the picture has changed.  In the ideal world there would be no conflicts.  The United Nations would be ineffective, as a peacekeeper, if army personnel from various nations which are accepted as being fair and even-handed were not made available. Our Army personnel have a good reputation and I am sure that we will continue to play an honourable role with the United Nations for many years to come.</P>

      <P>I have listened to most of the contributions which have been made on this Bill today.  While the majority of Deputies have been very supportive of the Bill, I wish to bring to the attention of the House an unfortunate remark made last week by Deputy Bruton when he said that a Bill was being brought before this House which would commit Irish troops to almost certain death.

      <P>I can understand the Deputy's shame, and I am not responsible for it.  The purpose of this Bill is to allow our Permanent Defence Forces to act as peace-enforcers on behalf of the United Nations.  Our Defence Forces have a wonderful record througout the world as peacekeepers.  They have made friends throughout the world while engaged in that role.  However, we must not under-estimate the challenges and difficulties the proposed change will bring.  Last week, the Minister for Defence, aware of the concern regarding Irish participation in UNOSOM, travelled to Somalia with some senior military officers to discuss with officers in the UNOSOM headquarters in Mogadishu and the French contingent in Baidoa, the implications of this new role.  This mission was undertaken to ensure that, first, it was relatively safe for Irish troops to travel to Somalia and, second, every precaution which could be taken would be taken so that our Defence Forces faced the minimum risk.  The Minister must be congratulated for his caring approach in dealing with this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="370" /> Members of the Defence Forces will not be asked to serve on this mission unless they have offered to do so.  I live in County Kildare, home of many members of our Defence Forces, and I know they are looking forward to this challenge.  While they are very much aware of the potential dangers which exist, they know what is required of them and that they have the ability and capacity to meet the challenges of this new role.  Members of the Defence Forces regard this request from the United Nations as a great honour for Ireland and an acknowledgement of the marvellous contribution they have played throughout the world as peacekeepers.</P>
    <P>Many speakers thanked our Defence Forces for the wonderful work they have done and the tremendous ambassadors they have been for Ireland over the past number of years.  One of the big problems which has confronted our Defence Forces in recent years has been a lack of recruitment. This issue must be addressed immediately.  This lack of recruitment does nothing to improve morale among the Members of our Defence Forces.  The Minister has indicated that he intends to deal with this problem.  I should like to see it resolved as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>While the intervention of the UN in Somalia is very welcome, the UN itself is in need of close examination.  The United Nations has been hijacked; certain actions taken recently have sullied the name of the United Nations.  Serious questions must be asked about some of the decisions taken in the name of the UN.  There must be proper debate to determine the future role of the UN.  We must ensure that no one nation is allowed to dictate UN policy.</P>
    <P>I am happy that every precaution possible will be taken before the mission commences.  I wish the Irish Defence Forces well in Somalia.  I have no doubt they will complement the good work being carried out at present by the Irish NGOs, Concern and GOAL.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with a very sensitive issue which the Minister has handled in his usual confident <Col N="371" /> manner.  This change in the role of our Defence Forces is a cause of some concern in view of recent events and the increasing number of volatile areas in the world.  My main concern is that both world wars began in Europe and sadly, guns are again being fired there.  While these guns are still a long way from the great capitals of Europe, London, Paris and Berlin, we must realise that the ending of the Cold War and all its economic dividends has not brought the desired peace to Europe or the Continent of Africa.  On the contrary, bloody ethnic wars in Bosnia, Azerbaijan, Somalia and the Balkans carry the risk of spreading to surrounding regions and continents.  The conflict in Somalia has been well documented in recent months.  These current fanatical conflicts continue to prove highly resistant to UN and other international mediation; they are smouldering fuses which cannot be left to burn for too long.  Who is going to help to put out the fires, guarantee the ceasefires, bring aid to refugees and protect the world from warlords and aggressive dictators?  We can talk politics all we want but soldiers have a large part to play in this area.</P>
      <P>Europe has introduced the most massive defence cuts ever witnessed right across the board.  These cuts have been driven by political pressure as a result of soaring budgets caused mainly by skyrocketing social welfare costs.  Politically speaking, the easiest areas in which to introduce cuts is in defence &mdash; there is no political profit in defending political budgets.  During times of peace, soldiers are often castigated.  Kipling once wrote &mdash; it is worth quoting him in this context &mdash;&ldquo;For its Tommy this and Tommy that and chuck him out the brute, but it's saviour of his country when the guns begin to shoot.&rdquo;  It is soldiers like Kipling's Tommy that we continue to call on in times of crisis.  There is a growing need for more and more troops, preferably UN troops, in various parts of the world.  We must be prepared to play our part in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The post Cold War Europe needs to rediscover the virtues of a sound defence. <Col N="372" /> The trimming of the defence budget has already gone too far.  I say this for the following reasons.  We have seen the mushrooming of UN troop deployment throughout the world.  There are approximately 20,000 UN troops in Cambodia; 14,000 in Croatia and 8,000 in Bosnia.  If peace is to be achieved in Bosnia, it will probably require 60,000 UN troops.  It is estimated that 50,000 UN troops will be required in Somalia.  There is a demand for well-equipped, trained and disciplined forces.  If we do not pass this Bill our troops will not only be less effective against the warlords in Somalia but also against the warlords in other parts of the world where they are likely to be deployed.</P>
    <P>The Americans have decided to reduce the number of US forces in Europe to approximately 100,000.  Germany has reduced its forces from 500,000 to 300,000.  The strength of the British army is at its lowest since 1830.  Only the French seem to plan to spend what it takes to remain an independent military power.  What does one see when one looks around Europe today?  There is still nuclear power in four former Soviet States, namely, Russia, the Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhastan.  The danger of a conventional attack from the East may now be deemed to be virtually non-existent but the risk of formerly controlled Soviet weapons falling into the hands of local warlords cannot be discounted. What are scientists who were once nuclear physicists in Russia doing now that the Cold War is over?</P>
    <P>In addition to Eastern Europe and the Balkans, there are other equally explosive areas on our southern shores &mdash; North Africa and the Middle East.  There is also the Iraqi problem and a major threat from anti-western Islamic fundamentalists extending from Algeria in the West to Pakistan in the East.  The goal would appear to be the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction &mdash; nuclear, chemical or biological.  We know how close the Iraqis came to achieving this. The point I am making is that Europe is cutting back on its defence budget at a <Col N="373" /> time when it is surrounded by a live, volatile area.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for this Bill.  I ask him to accept the vitally important points I have made.  I know it is not directly relevant to this Bill, but reference has been made to recruitment to our Defence Forces.  We cannot allow the Army to be under strength while expecting it to take its place in volatile areas.  I commend the Minister on the Bill.  Our troops will enhance their reputation because they are, and always have been, responsible and honourable people.  I wish them well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMulvihill" hpid="Mr. Mulvihill Mr. Mulvihill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulvihill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for sharing their time with me.  As an exserviceman I am pleased to have this opportunity to contribute to this very important debate.  I spent nine years in the Irish Naval Service.  One might ask what a sailor knows about the Army.  We were first trained as soldiers in the Naval Service and then as seamen.  I spent nine months training in the Curragh Camp some years ago and I gained considerable experience in those years.</P>
      <P>After the Second World War, as Deputy McDaid said, many people expressed the hope that we had seen the last of warfare.  Unfortunately that is not the case, and there have been local and national wars all over the world.  Millions have been killed in these wars, usually without justification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The United Nations, as its name implies, was set up to bring about co-operation, peace and harmony among the member nations.  Ireland has been an active member and has played a useful role in the work and operations of the United Nations.  We must continue to do our duty as a member nation.  I know the proposal to send 80 Irish troops to Somalia as a transport unit has caused heart-searching concern in and outside this House.  It is accepted that this is a dangerous assignment for our troops but I have every confidence that they will measure up to the task.  Our professional soldiers are trained to the highest standards and we should wish them well in their mission.  However, we must ensure <Col N="374" /> that all possible safeguards are put in place to ensure their safety and the success of the mission.</P>
    <P>As a considerable number of troops are working overseas, Army staff at home are expected to double up on duty. For this reason will the Minister consider recommencing recruitment?  We take the Army for granted at times.  Its personnel are brought onto our streets at times of industrial unrest to carry out public services. On such occasions they are lauded as great people but we seem to forget very quickly about them.  Recently I visited Haulbowline and saw that of our seven naval ships five were tied up.  Will the Minister examine this as a matter of urgency?</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate, those who expressed a contrary opinion and those who were in favour of the Bill.  I thank Deputy Enda Kenny for his remarks.  I will give serious consideration to the amendment tabled by Deputy Barrett which proposes that a review be carried out every 12 months.  It may be possible to accommodate the import of that amendment in another manner, by virtue of other mechanisms in this House.  I will examine the amendment further in view of the request by Deputy Barrett, so ably supported by Deputy Enda Kenny. Deputy De Rossa chose an unusual procedure, one I had not seen adopted previously in this House but, presumably, it accords with Standing Orders.  It is provocative in that in the last sentence he asks that we decline to give a Second Reading to the Bill.  By virtue of that line alone, apart from the general content of his amendment, I would be letting the Bill proposed by the Government fall if I supported the amendment and in the circumstances the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would want to talk to former Deputy Haughey about that but, in the meantime, I am bound by the collective wisdom of the Government who decided that this was the legislation that was required to meet the request from the UNOSOM II mission.  The Bill is now before the House for its democratic decision.</P>
      <P>In the short time available to me I will try to respond to as many as possible of the points raised by the Deputies.  I thank the main Opposition spokesperson, Deputy Barrett, for the positive and constructive tone of his contribution and I welcome his support in principle for the Bill.  The Deputy questioned the role of the United Nations troops in Somalia.  As the Deputy will appreciate, UNOSOM II will consist of approximately 28,000 troops, drawn from 32 countries and its mandate, which covers the whole territory of Somalia, includes enforcement powers in accordance with Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, 1945, so succinctly stated by Deputy Lenihan.  Its mission will be to monitor and ensure that all the factions respect the ceasefire; to prevent the resumption of violence; to maintain control of heavy weapons; to seize unauthorised smallarms; to secure ports, airports and lines of communication; to protect United Nations, Red Cross and non-governmental organisations and facilities and to continue the demining programme and to assist in the repatriation of refugees.  Basically, that is the mandate as set down under the UNOSOM II proposal.  All the military forces of the United States in Somalia are part of UNOSOM.  The suggestion that in some way the United States is separate and apart from the order of the United Nations is wrong.  Their role is the same as that of the other contingents and they come under the United Nations command, of which the force commander is General Bir, a Turk.  He is, in the nature of things, <i>primus inter pares.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barrett also raised the issue of compensation.  Arrangements for compensation <Col N="376" /> for Defence Force personnel compare favourably with those for the Garda Síochána.  They are eligible for disability pensions and gratuities under the Army Pensions Acts and for special and substantial allowances payable in respect of injuries sustained in United Nations service.  There are also widows' and orphans' pensions and death gratuities payable to dependants.  This is especially so where the death is attributable to United Nations service.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett, in common with a number of other Deputies, raised the voluntary nature of overseas service.  It should be clearly understood that all personnel who are presently serving will not be liable for service in peace enforcing missions unless they volunteer.  There is no question of the Army saying &ldquo;You, you and you&rdquo; when it comes to volunteering. It will be a question of a genuine will to serve based on the freedom of will of the individual concerned. Furthermore, although the majority of the Defence Force personnel are liable for service under the 1960 Act, in practice overseas missions are heavily oversubscribed by volunteers.  Most, if not all the missions are oversubscribed and there are queues &mdash; if I may put it that way &mdash; but without oversimplifying it a very serious role that must and will be played by the Defence Forces.  The 80 personnel of the transport company are all volunteers and will be replaced on rotation with volunteers.</P>
    <P>Deputies Barrett and Ryan inquired about the allowances to be paid to personnel serving with UNOSOM II.  Personnel will qualify for the same rates of overseas service allowances as troops serving with UNIFIL.  The associations representing members of the Defence Forces submitted claims which will be processed in the normal way through the conciliation and arbitration scheme. RACO and PDFORRA have put in claims which in the ordinary way will be considered by the conciliation and arbitration scheme.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies, including the Progressive Democrats spokesman, Deputy Clohessy, made a positive contribution <Col N="377" /> and questioned the procedures for obtaining Dáil approval for the despatch of contingents.  The provisions for approving the sending of the contingents overseas are identical to those which have operated successfully and in good faith by successive Governments for 33 years.  When the original legislation was passed there was considerable debate about the provisions governing Dail approval.  None of the fears expressed has been borne out.  The system has worked well and hopefully will continue to do so.  I am not in the business of gazing into a crystal ball or whatever, but hopefully they will continue to operate positively and well into the future. Should some future issue arise giving cause for concern, the Dáil has many avenues available to it to make the Minister accountable, such as Question Time, Adjournment Debates, the annual Estimate and now the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  These avenues are available to make the Minister and, by defintion, the Government accountable for the concerns of Deputies arising out of this matter and, indeed, other matters in relation to the portfolios which I hold for the time being.</P>
    <P>Deputies Barrett, Kemmy, Carey and Haughey are rightly concerned for the safety of the Irish personnel going to Somalia.  Everybody in the House shares that concern.  I cannot give a graduated assessment between one and ten of the risk factor.  I would think that the risk in south Mogadishu, having visited there under very heavy security, is quite considerable; but we were informed that our transport unit will be going to Baidoa and comparatively the risk is less.  I cannot guarantee the future.  All I can do, as I have said in my opening remarks, is give assurances.  The risk factor was addressed by many Deputies and, as Minister, I share that concern.  For that reason I travelled to Somalia last weekend to obtain an update on the situation there from the United Nations commanders on the ground.  I stated in my opening remarks that I met with Admiral Jonathan Howe, the representative of Boutrus Boutrus Ghali, the Secretary <Col N="378" /> General of the United Nations, and General Thomas Montgomery, the deputy force commander in the absence of the force commander.  I met with the logistics and transport people and at all times I was accompanied by the professional people to whose advice I listened very carefully.  I was accompanied by two Army personnel, the Assistant Chief of Staff, Brigadier General John O'Shea and the force commander of the 80 man personnel transport unit, Commander Maurice O'Donoghue.  I listened to their assessment and they listened to the assessment given to them by their peers in the United Nations.</P>
    <P>I am a civilian and I have to listen very carefully to the advice I get from the military authorities.  I listen carefully and I assess, based on their judgment, the realities.  In the circumstances they appeared to be reassured by the people whom we met.  The decision to go to Baidoa was made on the ground as it was not in our original programme.  It was a wise decision because we met there the French contingent with whom we will operate side by side, presided over by General Quadri, who made us most welcome and was very supportive of our intentions to go to Baidoa.  Effectively, we now know where we are going and the ground is staked out.  That is as much as I can do to continue to reassure everyone that the situation will be relatively good from our point of view.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that suitable arrangements for the security of our personnel as they operate in a logistics role will be in place. Specifically, I can assure Deputies that, first, the Irish contingent will be among the most experienced and best trained in UNOSOM II; second, they have been provided with all the resources and equipment necessary to do the job; third, conditions in Baidoa, where they will be located, are not in any way comparable, as I have already stated, with the tense and dangerous situation in South Mogadishu; and fourth, the advice of the military authorities is unequivocally in favour of going ahead. I am satisfied that the detailed preparations <Col N="379" /> by the Defence Forces, combined with the security arrangements which will be taken in Somalia, will ensure as far as humanly practicable that the contingent will be safe in all the circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to raise this important matter.  It is almost 12 years since this scheme was first mooted and more than five years since local contributions were collected from the people concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme entails the provision of a water supply to 26 householders in the Caheragh region of west Cork.  Numerous representations were made to the <Col N="380" /> Department of the Environment during that period to get a financial allocation to carry out the work in question.  It appears the requests have fallen on deaf ears. Cork County Council have agreed to provide their special allocation towards the upgrading of the scheme.  Could the Minister, therefore, explain why it has taken so long for his Department to provide the financial contribution which is necessary to commence the scheme?</P>
    <P>In view of the billions of pounds we are told are earmarked for this country from the EC Structural and Cohesion Funds, is it possible for the Minister to give an assurance that this group water scheme application will receive favourable consideration from his Department? Could the Minister give a definite commitment that finance will now be forthcoming in the 1994 Estimates, thereby alleviating the serious plight of the people concerned?</P>
    <P>On 10 March 1992 I tabled a question to the Minister for the Environment asking him when his Department would approve and issue finance for the commencement of work on the Caheragh-Drimoleague group water scheme.  He replied that having regard to the existing level of commitments under the group water scheme programme he was not in a position to indicate when there would be a decision on the Caheragh-Drimoleague scheme.  To a further question which I tabled on Wednesday 2 June 1993 asking the Minister for the Environment the amount of finance allocated by his Department for group water schemes in 1993 and the amount allocated to each county council, the Minister replied that a sum of £2.5 million was provided for group water scheme grants in 1993 throughout the whole country and that these grants are mainly administered on a national basis and paid directly to the trustees of the group schemes.</P>
    <P>It is unfair of the Minister to hold up to ransom those farmers and private householders in the Caheragh area.  I hope the Minister will give a firm commitment to make finance available in the 1994 Estimates.  The Minister, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe and I attended a very <Col N="381" /> heated meeting in Caheragh hall the other night and we were told that if the money was not forthcoming this year further action would have to be taken.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has already given a commitment to provide finance.  I hope the Minister for Finance will copperfasten that tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford)</i>: I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.</P>
      <P>An outline proposal for the provision of a group water scheme in the Caheragh area to serve up to 30 houses and farms was received in my Department in February, 1990.</P>
      <P>The group proposes to use as groundwater source a borehole drilled by Cork County Council in 1975 for the purpose of serving local group schemes.  In order to supply the group scheme, the borehole will have to be developed and commissioned at considerable cost to the group.</P>
      <P>In April, 1991, Cork County Council advised the Department that the proposed design should be expanded to cater for the future development needs of the area.  This would involve upsizing the group's distribution main and the provision of a 20,000 gallon reservoir.  These additional items will add significantly to the overall cost of the scheme.  As a result, group water scheme grants of £700 per house and £500 per farm only amount to some 26 per cent of the estimated cost of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the group are unable to finance the after-grant shortfall and have looked for a supplementary grant of around £49,000 to ensure the financial viability of the scheme.  Such a grant would have to come out of the provision for public water and sewerage schemes and considering the existing level of commitments and the pressing need for water and sewerage schemes in all parts of the country, it has not been possible to approve the Caheragh scheme so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can fully appreciate the Deputy's concern regarding the urgency of the Caheragh <Col N="382" /> scheme and I would like to assure him that the Minister is aware of these concerns and is doing everything possible to ensure that this scheme is released at the earliest date possible.</P>

It has a catchment area of 70,000 acres and because of the water levels the river is a source of drainage problems. As far back as 1956, efforts were made to get the Office of Public Works to carry out a drainage scheme which would have improved the availability of land and given the local farmers the opportunity to upgrade their farms and to improve their holdings.  Despite many setbacks in their dealings with various Government agencies and the persistent refusal of the Office of Public Works to become involved, the farmers continued to press their case and in 1982, they finally had success with their efforts when the Farm Development Service reported that a scheme for the drainage of the river had been prepared following a survey.  The scheme was to be carried out by a contractor engaged by the farmers in accordance with the plans and specifications prepared by the FDS.  The farmers would also be responsible for a financial contribution to bridge the gap between the contract sum and the amount of grants paid by the FDS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the many discussions which took place, it was consistently stated to the farmers that anything unforeseen would <Col N="383" /> be paid for by the FDS.  This was repeated emphatically when the question of meeting rock was raised before the scheme began.  All the necessary legal procedures were completed and a contractor was appointed, the price being fixed at £190,000.  The contractor was also advised that the farmers were at the limit of their financial contribution and he accepted this point.  He was also assured that anything unforeseen by way of meeting rock would be paid by the FDS.  This was stated quite clearly at a meeting with FDS personnel in 1983.</P>
    <P>The crux arose when extensive rock was encountered during excavation and the FDS refused to pay for the quantities of rock actually excavated, paying only for the estimated quantities.  Despite protracted discussions, the FDS held firm and refused to accept responsibility for the financial commitment involved.  The work eventually continued under enormous strain for everybody concerned, but without any resolution of the financial problem.</P>
    <P>That is a brief background to the dilemma.  The matter has been through the courts and judgment for a sum in excess of £200,000 has been entered in favour of the contractor against the farmers. The contractor's entitlement to this money is not an issue but what is at stake is the livelihood and the future of the farmers and their families as a result of this judgment.  These farmers entered into a contract in good faith and on the advice given to them by a Government agency.  They acted at all times with honour and gave a financial commitment to the very best of their abilities and were constantly assured that there would be no problem at any stage if anything unforeseen cropped up.  It would certainly be fair to say that had they even the slightest inkling that there would be any difficulties relating to the scheme which would involve them in further financial outlay, then they would not have proceeded.  That is the kernel of the whole problem.  These were men of limited means who saw the opportunity to improve their holdings, thereby securing <Col N="384" /> a future for them and their families.  They saw the Farm Development Service as a friend of the farming community and depended on the goodwill of a Government agency to steer them on a true and straight course.  However, they have been cruelly treated, their futures have been threatened and their tenure as landowners has been thrown into jeopardy. Unfortunately, they now look on all Government agencies with suspicion.</P>
    <P>The amount of money involved is, in national terms, a pittance.  It is a mere drop in the ocean compared to the sums being expended on tribunals, Government hearings, special advisers and programme managers.  However, to the families involved it represents a lifetime of work cast aside.  A close knit and caring farming community has been brought to its knees by an act of supreme indifference by Government officials, and the spirit of co-operation and friendship which inspired them to band together for this project may now be destroyed forever.</P>
    <P>This traumatic experience has been divisive in a previously contented and integrated community.  It has inflicted financial hardship, unbearable mental anguish leading to ill health and personality changes.  In the interests of a unified approach I will not outline the appalling level of political manipulation through broken promises, but rather appeal to the Government to make a generous financial contribution towards a relief fund.  Any positive Government initiative would have the full support and co-operation of Fine Gael.  In the interest of justice I implore the Minister to give my request an early and favourable consideration.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Lowry for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  The application by the 42 farmers involved was made in 1975.  The scheme was approved in March 1982 at an estimated cost of £236,184 and on foot of this a grant of £132,972.50 was calculated on the basis of 50 per cent of the Department's <Col N="385" /> estimate.  The contract price was only £190,000 and this left a contribution of approximately £58,000 by the farmers. Work commenced on this basis but problems were encountered.  The cost proved to be much higher than anticipated by either the Department or the contractor. Substantially more rock was encountered on the river bed than was estimated.</P>
      <P>The specifications and plans relating to the work on the bridges had to be revised at the request of Tipperary North Riding County Council.  The revised grant that was finally made payable was £221,387. The total cost of the work was £440,000. The farmers refused to pay more than the £58,000 which was the shortfall in the initial agreement.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy said, the matter has been through the High Court and the Supreme Court.  While we would all have great sympathy for the position in which the farmers find themselves, nevertheless I am satisfied that my Department is discharging its obligations in full in respect of the Ballyfinboy drainage scheme.  The total cost to my Department arising from this scheme of work, including the outcome of the court actions, is of the order of £450,000.  This is a considerable sum of money and there are no funds available to my Department to respond further in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed that it is now proposed to sell 50 acres of land at Ballyhaise, County Cavan.  When news circulated last week of the proposed sale it caused much anger in Cavan and the catchment area of Ballyhaise Agricultural College.  The way the board of Teagasc &mdash; not the inspectors &mdash; arranged this sale raises many questions.  The board organised the sale without any consultation and it has no mandate to do so.  Ballyhaise Agricultural College was established almost 70 years ago as a training college for the north-east and north-west region.  It is one of the two colleges in that region.  Saint Patrick's College in <Col N="386" /> Monaghan also provides excellent training.</P>
      <P>Ballyhaise Agricultural College has 600 acres of land of which 150 acres is under plantation and enterprise work is undertaken on the remaining land.  For the past 70 years students have received excellent training in agricultural management in regard to farming or agribusiness.</P>
      <P>It is ironic that on the page this sale was advertised in the farming section of <i>The Anglo Celt</i> there was a photograph of the regional manager of Golden Vale making a presentation of student of the year award to a student of that college. That highlights the catchment area the college serves.  The college enterprises comprise dairying of 90 cows, a suckler cow unit of 75 animals, a calf to beef unit, a pig unit of 100 sows and all the farrowers are fattened, a poultry unit of 100 hens and 1,000 chickens, a sheep unit of 700 animals and a small horse breeding unit.  All the activities are part and parcel of farming in the north-east and north-west regions.  Young boys and girls who attend the college receive a good foundation on how to manage a farm.</P>
      <P>People may say that the sale of 50 acres will not matter.  However, I consider this sale to be the beginning of the break-up of that marvellous college.  I am supported in that view by all the rural organisations. Local papers reported that local farm organisations, including the IFA, the ICMSA and Macra na Feirme, are also opposed to this sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Teagasc spokesman stated that in addition to the Ballyhaise disposal the board had sold 150 acres at Oak Park Research Station, it was selling a farm in Glindwell, County Galway in addition to a number of sites not required, a research tillage farm near Athy and a number of houses.  That spokesman said that those sales were being undertaken as part of an overall organisation efficiency plan.  The advice young farmers are receiving from Teagasc is that to become more efficient they should sell their land.  This is unbelievable and unacceptable.  That college has survived for 70 years in good and bad times.  When we are supposed to be developing and preparing for Common Agricultural Policy reform Tegasc sends <Col N="387" /> a signal to hard pressed farmers in that region to sell their land.  This is not acceptable because in Cavan pollution is a major problem and all the land is needed for the disposal of slurry from the enterprises to which I referred.</P>
    <P>If the sale of this 50 acres proceeds some of the enterprises to which I referred will have to curtail their operations substantially as there will not be sufficient land on which to spread this slurry.  Some of this land is close to the college's milking and pig units.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to the sale of an unoccupied house on the property.  I would like to see that house occupied, perhaps, by a couple with children.  Teagasc raised £1.5 million when part of its headquarters in Sandymount was sold but it is still selling property that does not belong to it.  What it is doing is contrary to what the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste said here about a forthnight ago that no further State assets would be disposed of during the term of office of this Government. I appeal to the Minister not to proceed with this sale.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Boylan for raising the matter of the proposed sale of the land in question and acknowledge the very strong case he has made for not going ahead with that proposal.</P>
      <P>In recent years Teagasc has experienced some financial difficulties.  In order to remedy this situation and to provide for the efficient and effective operation of the body, an efficiency plan was prepared by Teagasc in consultation with the Department and is now in the course of implementation.  The plan contained a number of elements, including the utilisation of Teagasc resources, physical and human, in the most cost effective manner.  In addition, some disposal of assets is essential in order to provide the resources for necessary capital expenditure required by Teagasc to fulfil its mandate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act, 1988, Teagasc may dispose of assets subject to the sanction of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, It is understood from Teagasc <Col N="388" /> that the disposal will have little impact on the operation of Ballyhaise College, which has close to 400 acres of other land available to it.  In the circumstances, I do not propose to prohibit Teagasc from disposing of this land and the sanction required under the Act for the sale has now been given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to have the Minister here so late at night, or rather so early in the morning, but this is an important project.  I understand there are already ten multi-denominational schools in existence in the country, with approximately 2,000 pupils and 70 teachers employed.  Galway, no less than these other parts of the country where multi-denominational schools have already been established, has a demand for such a school.  The Galway School Project has been working on the provision of such a school for the past four years.  They have 160 pupils pre-enrolled of which possibly 60 to 90 would attend school this coming September if a school building was available to them.</P>
      <P>For the past four years the committee have been trying to open this school and have satisfied all the Department of Education requirements with the exception of providing a suitable premises.  Their priority is to seek accommodation in buildings which have already been used for educational purposes, because in that way they would already be complying with the stringent planning and safety regulations which apply to the construction of school buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that St. Brendan's National School at Cemetery Cross on the Tuam Road in Galway has been completely vacant for 12 months, from June 1992 to June 1993.  Indeed, prior to that a considerable number of classrooms within the school were vacant because pupil numbers had simply fallen in that school.  The committee's application for space within that school dates back to March 1990 and they can produce correspondence addressed to the chairperson <Col N="389" /> of the then board of management.  They repeatedly applied but were informed that the vacant space was being used and they never received any positive reply.</P>
    <P>Since June 1992 they have been in contact with Bishop McLoughlin, who was patron of the school.  They understood that the Church were the owners of the building and the Bishop has replied informing them, as he has informed me, that the diocese had informed the Department of Education that they were prepared to hand the school building over for use as a school for the children of travellers in the Galway city region.</P>
    <P>This committee are now desperate to find some premises wherein they can open this school and accommodate the huge numbers of pupils they have on their rolls.  As this stage they are prepared to lease space in the St. Brendan's building, bearing in mind that it has been totally vacant for the past 12 months. They are prepared to share the building with the travelling community if it is required by them for a school building.  I understand they have not confirmed their interest in using the building.  I understand also it may have been offered to the Gaelscoil Dara group, but I believe they are not too keen to use this building either.</P>
    <P>We now have the unusual situation where the school has been offered to two other groups who are seeking premises and a third group who desperately require a premises have no offer.  Could the Minister of State give an indication tonight that he or the Minister will take a personal interest in this matter and seek to resolve it quickly in order to enable the children commence their school year in September.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Brothers of Charity, who own the Holy Family School, wish to vacate part of that building and that St. Brendan's has been offered to some of the school groups. Gaelscoil Dara are located in the Holy Family premises at the moment, as indeed are the traveller group.  As I said, the Galway school project would be willing to share with any other group; and should the building be allocated to the group of traveller children who are currently <Col N="390" /> on the Holy Family campus there would still be sufficient room for both groups in St. Brendan's because it is an eight classroom school.</P>
    <P>We now have the extraordinary situation where this huge school building has been empty for 12 months.  It is on a very large site which would accommodate a substantial number of prefabs if required because of the size of the site. The Minister, Deputy Bhreathnach, has not communicated with the Galway School Project, apart from sending acknowledgements from the Department. That is very unsatisfactory and I am disappointed because this group met with the Minister on 19 February last when she was in Galway speaking at the Green Paper Seminar.  On that occasion she expressed firm support for the project but since then they have heard nothing definite from the Minister.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will clear up any confusion that may exist tonight and take some initiative to ensure that these children can attend school in September.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy Molloy's concern in this matter and I hope I can clarify the up to date position.</P>
      <P>The initial application to establish a multi-denominational national school in Galway city was lodged in May 1990.  To receive departmental recognition, which initially is provisional recognition only, as in this case, the promoters of a multi-denominational school must fulfil certain conditions regarding the enrolment, viability and organisation of the school.</P>
      <P>One of the most important conditions to be met is that the promoters of the school must identify and secure a suitable premises for the school and ensure that it will be available during the period of provisional recognition, which will normally be four to five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once suitable accommodation has been secured, and assuming all other conditions have been met, the Department is prepared to grant recognition to a multi-denominational school and provide the appropriate grnt-in-aid towards the rental of school accommodation. <Col N="391" /> From the foregoing it will be clear to the Deputy that the onus on providing suitable accommodation lies with the promoters of a multi-denominational school &mdash; not with the Department, in the first instance.</P>
    <P>The Department is aware, and I acknowledge also, that the promoters of the Galway School Project have made strenuous efforts to secure suitable accommodation for the school.  Where possible Department officials and inspectors have tried to help in identifying buildings where surplus school accommodation may exist, whether at primary or post-primary level.  Some of those referred to by the Deputy were investigated by Department officials.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I only referred to one building, St. Brendan's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>Where such surplus accommodation is identified, however, it still lies with the promoters of the multi-denominational school to make an individual approach to the management and/or trustees of the buildings in question.</P>
      <P>The Department is sympathetic to the difficulties which a number of school project committees, including that of Galway, are experiencing in finding suitable school accommodation.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that, given the Department's many capital commitments to replace or extend existing unsatisfactory national school accommodation, it would be unreasonble to expect the Deparment to incur significant additional expenditure in providing from the start school buildings for new multi-denominational schools, which, as I have already said, enjoy only provisonal recognition in the first years of operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

      <P>This report, <i>the Impact of Forestry on Rural Communities</i>, which was in fact commissioned under the forestry operational programme operated by my Department comments favourably on the impact of forestry on rural development and job creation in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government in its Programme for a Partnership Government has identified forestry as a key sector and therefore places a strong emphasis on the development of this indigenous natural resource which has the potential to create sustainable employment in both the primary and processing sectors.</P>
      <P>At present my Department is preparing a new forestry programme under EC Regulation 2080/92 which covers the forestry accompanying measures to the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and this programme will be geared towards achieving the planting target set by the Government which is 30,000 hectares per annum and maintaining this level to the year 2000.  Achieving this target will result in about 10 per cent of the land area of this country being under forest by the year 2000 and according to the above mentioned report this will in time generate up to 10,000 additional jobs in forestry and forestry related industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, my Department is preparing a programme under the Structural Funds.  This will focus on the implementation of back-up and other measures which will contribute to the achievement <Col N="66" /> down stream processing and marketing sector.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 48 and 84 together.</P>
      <P>With regard to delays in payment arising from computer error, I assume that the Deputies are referring to applications which were found to have errors following a computer check on the ear tag numbers of animals submitted for the special beef premium scheme rather than to computer errors as such.  The position is that, unfortunately, a considerable number of farmers who submitted applications for the special beef premium scheme in 1992 incorrectly transcribed the eartag numbers on to the application forms.  A large number of these errors have already been corrected and work is continuing on correcting the remaining errors.  The farmers involved will be paid their grants when the errors have been corrected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall position with regard to payment of applications submitted in 1992 for the various premium schemes is that there are approximately 32,500 <Col N="67" /> farmers awaiting payment of unpaid premia out of a total of some 243,000 applications submitted to my Department under these schemes in that year. The vast majority of unpaid cases relate to applications submitted in December 1992.</P>
    <P>I expect that all applicants, except for query cases, will be paid by the end of next month.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="69" /> Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, the Government undertook to review all national policies relating to the agriculture and food sector and negotiate with the farm organisations a new Development Programme for the sector.  The review would take account of Common Agricultural Policy reform and of the outcome of the GATT negotiations. The new development programme would also take account of the organisations' views on the need to promote structural change in agriculture, in the light of the Government commitment to, <i>inter alia</i>, promote lifetime transfers of land and the early establishment of young trained farmers.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the overall <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> commitment, an Expert Group on the Food Industry was established.  The group reported in April 1992 and the group's recommendations are under consideration by Government.  In addition, a group consisting of representatives of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the farm organisations is working on an agricultural development programme.  Land policy is being considered within that framework.  The group is expected to report to me in the coming months.</P>

That proposal will also impose additional costs on the beef industry.  For these reasons, Ireland is opposing this proposal at the beef management committee.

      <P>One of my priorities in the GATT negotiations is to ensure that the direct compensatory payments to farmers agreed in the Common Agricultural Policy reform package in the beef, cereals and sheep-meat sectors should not be subject to discipline under a final GATT agreement. These payments would have been subject to restriction under the framework agreement put forward by the Director-General of the GATT, Mr. Dunkel in December 1991 and this was, together with other issues, a matter of great concern to me and many of my colleagues in the Council.  Accordingly, we mandated the Commission to negotiate improvements to the text.</P>
      <P>I was very pleased therefore that the draft deal negotiated between the commission and US negotiators last November provides for the exemption of the Common Agricultural Policy reform compensatory payments from GATT restrictions.  There are, of course, other elements of the deal, known as the Blair House agreement, which I have major difficulties with and I am pursuing these matters in the on-going negotiations.  The Blair House agreement has still to be accepted by the Council, the US Congress and the other parties in the GATT. This will not arise until an overall agreement covering all sector areas has been finalised.  I am confident, however, that whatever agreement finally emerges in the agriculture sector will retain the exemption for Common Agricultural Policy compensatory payments already agreed between the EC and US.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the EC Commission has carried out a two-year information campaign to promote Community produced olive oil. This campaign, which ended in March this year, was run in all 12 EC member states.

      <P>I am, of course, conscious of the desirability of promoting the use of milk and dairy products and have encouraged this. Following the abolition, from 1 April 1993, of the EC co-responsibility levy, which has been the basis for funding generic promotion in the dairy sector, I obtained the agreement of the EC Council that member states would have the option of applying a levy at national level to continue such activities.  I am confident, however, that the dairy industry will continue on a voluntary basis to finance the promotion and advertising of its products and, if this is the case, I would not have to introduce the compulsory levy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 103 and 104 together.</P>
      <P>The most recent data available on the number of Irish speakers is from the 1986 Census of Population.  Corresponding information from the 1991 Census will not be available until the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The following table provides information from the 1981 and 1986 Censuses on the numbers and percentages of Irish speakers aged 3 years and over in each county and for the State as a whole distinguishing counties with an official Gaeltacht area and those without.  It may be noted from the table that between 1981 and 1986 the number of Irish speakers aged 3 years and over increased by 24,288 &mdash; from 1,018,413 to 1,042,701 but showed a slight decline from 31.6 per cent to 31.1 per cent when expressed as a percentage of the total relevant population.</P>
      <P Just="Center">Number and percentage of Irish speakers, 3 years of age and over, in each Province, County or County Borough, 1981-1986.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I made clear in reply to a question on the same subject on 26 May 1993, the Government believes that nuclear tests are unnecessary for military purposes, environmentally unacceptable, and harmful to the prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons, as set out in the preamble to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).</P>
      <P>Both Britain and the United States are aware of Ireland's views on the question of nuclear testing.  Last year, the Government welcomed the steps taken by the United States towards limiting nuclear testing.  Since both the US and Britain use the same testing site in Nevada, this has also precluded Britain from carrying out nuclear tests.  These steps, following similar ones by the Russian Federation and France, appeared to represent significant progress towards the cessation of nuclear testing.  At the same time, Ireland made clear, at the United Nations, that we regarded further progress in this area as necessary if the process of nuclear disarmament is to be made irreversible. We also made clear our belief that the issue of a comprehensive test ban treaty should continue to be actively addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A resumption of nuclear testing carries <Col N="89" /> risks for the international non-proliferation regime as a whole, at a time when negotiations leading to the extension of the NPT, which is due for renewal in 1995, have commenced.  I hope that the nuclear powers will consider very carefully all these aspects before any decisions on ending their current moratoria are taken.</P>

      <P>There are two resident Irish Ambassadors in Africa, in Cairo and Lagos.  The Ambassador in Cairo is accredited on a non-resident basis to the Sudan and to Tanzania.  The Ambassador in Lagos is accredited on a non-resident basis to Ghana, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</P>
      <P>Egypt and Nigeria are countries of major importance in their respective subregions and in Africa.  I believe it is important to be diplomatically represented in both countries in order to foster closer relations and thereby advance Ireland's political, economic and other interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of establishment of diplomatic relations with South Africa is under active consideration in the light of the evolving political situation in that country. If a resident Irish Embassy were opened in South Africa, the necessary financial and personnel resources would be identified in the context of our ongoing <Col N="90" /> review of the overall deployment of our limited diplomatic resources.</P>

      <P>The passport fee regulations no longer provide for the issue of annual passports and that is therefore not an option open to me.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to a similar question from the Deputy (10 March 1993) I appreciate that the standard passport fee of £45, while not unreasonable, may cause hardship for certain categories of applicants.  A number of special provisions are already in place to help reduce this hardship: a three year passport, which costs £10, is available for persons under 18 or over 65 years of age; a collective passport, which costs £45, is available for groups of young people of over five and under 50 persons, who are travelling on educational, cultural or pilgrimage purposes to certain countries; a collective passport is also available for groups of invalid pilgrims travelling to Lourdes; a low season fee of £35 was introduced on a trial basis last year for applicants who apply for their passports during October and November.  The campaign proved very successful and will be continued this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These provisions should cover the large majority of special cases and, as a matter of general policy, I would not think it desirable to introduce too many exceptions to the standard fee.  However, I understand that, in the particular case of the applicant mentioned by the Deputy, the person concerned will not qualify under any of the existing special provisions.  Having considered the details of the case, I am prepared to examine <Col N="91" /> the scope for introducing a provision whereby in certain clearly specified and properly documented medical circumstances, a reduced cost passport can be made available to applicants.  The Passport Office will be in further contact with the applicant on the matter.</P>

      <P>The Government is very conscious of the needs of Irish emigrants and we are providing support in a number of practical ways.  Special programmes are in place in Britain and in the United States and initiatives are also being undertaken in the European Community context.</P>
      <P>In Britain, funding is provided for immigrant assistance groups through the DÍON Committee which reports to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment. The Government's grant to DÍON this year was £500,000; the Committee is extremely active and a reorganisation currently under way is intended to ensure that it will continue to operate with maximum effectiveness.</P>
      <P>The Government also helps to fund the work of immigrant assistance groups in the United States; I recently announced an additional £100,000 grant for these groups which brings the total funding in the current year to £150,000.  As in Britain, our diplomatic staff in the US devote very considerable time and resources to advising and assisting Irish immigrants.  The Immigration Working Committees which meet under the auspices of our Consulates in New York, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco, are particularly useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Through the Euroadviser Programme, FÁS has greatly strengthened its links with State employment services in all EC <Col N="92" /> countries; at present it has representatives in Germany and The Netherlands assisting Irish immigrants in those labour markets.  The British and Irish authorities also operate a Transfrontier Committee (TFC) under EC auspices, which assists workers moving between the British and Irish labour markets.</P>
    <P>An inter-Departmental Committee on Emigration, chaired by a representative of my Department, meets regularly to discuss all issues of relevance to emigrants. Apart from the special programmes in place in Britain and the US, our embassies throughout the world are available to provide assistance to emigrants when the need arises.</P>
    <P>In summary, I am satisfied that a good deal of worthwhile support is made available to our emigrants; I intend to keep the situation under close review, bearing in mind both the needs of our emigrants and the budgetary constraints under which we must operate.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can be assured that I am fully aware of the disquiet and concern to which such incursions give rise, particularly in Border areas.  All such incidents are immediately raised with the British authorities through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat in Belfast.  The matter has also been discussed with British Ministers at meetings of the Anglo-Irish InterGovernmental Conference.  They have informed us that all Northern Ireland Security Force personnel are given clear instructions that incursions are not permitted and that the greatest care should be taken to avoid crossing the border.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="93" /> While no incursion is acceptable, I am aware that in recent months when incursions have occurred the majority of these have been promptly admitted by the British authorities and an official apology received.

      <Quest>if he will alter the present system operated by the Revenue Commissioners whereby old age pensioners in the tax bracket are taxed on their social welfare old age pension increases from 5 April, although the increases only come into effect in late July, with particular reference to the case of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 11.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that tax on a social welfare old age pension is collected in two ways:</P>
      <P>&mdash;by reducing a person's tax-free allowances by the amount of the pension where the person concerned is taxed under the PAYE system in respect of other income, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="95" />&mdash;by assessment, together with other income subject to tax through the self assessment system.</P>
    <P>Pensioners are taxed only on the amount of the pension received in the tax year. Where a person is taxed under the PAYE system the procedure is to spread the deduction evenly throughout the year. Most taxpayers would consider this an advantage.  It is also administratively efficient as it obviates the need to issue a revised certificate of tax-free allowances in July when the pension increases are applied.</P>
    <P>In the case mentioned in the representations the taxpayer's overall liability reduced from £1.83 per week to £1.82 per week as the increase in the social welfare pension was compensated for by an increase in the exemption limit. If the deductions in respect of the pension were not spread evenly through the year the tax due in the period to July would have been £1.46 weekly and from July onward would have been £2 weekly.</P>

      <P>The system of reliefs which applies to rally vehicles under the Vehicle Registration Tax is largely the same as that which applied under the motor vehicle excise duty regime up to end-1992.  Under the VRT regime, section 135 (b) of the Finance Act, as amended, provides that vehicles brought temporarily into the State, <i>inter alia,</i> for competition may be exempted by the Revenue Commissioners from registration provided such vehicles are not for sale in the State <Col N="96" /> and the vehicles are intended to be taken out of the State at the end of their purpose in the State.  The exemption may be granted by the Commissioners, on written application, to a person whose normal residence is in the State on the condition that she/he provides such security as may be required in respect of the taxes and duties that would normally be payable on the vehicle on registration in the State.</P>
      <P>While the Act makes it clear that at the end of the competition the car must be removed from the State, facilities do exist for special application to be made to the Commissioners to allow the car to remain in the State until the start of another competition which must commence within a few days of the previous rally.</P>
      <P>As for a reduction in the rate of VRT applicable to rally cars, I have no plans to introduce such a measure.</P>

      <P>The representations made by the Deputy concerned an application, by an individual, for the tax concessions provided under the terms of the Disabled Drivers Scheme.  The present scheme, which was established in 1989, is currently the subject of a comprehensive review of its operation.  This review, which was commenced some time ago, and which has involved consultation with a wide range of interested parties, will, <i>inter alia,</i> be considering the issues raised in the particular case highlighted by the Deputy. Unfortunately, extreme pressures of work, associated with the preparation of this year's budget and Finance Bill, have prevented the completion of the review <Col N="97" /> and it has only been possible to resume work on it very recently.</P>
      <P>As I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, it would not have been appropriate to have issued a detailed response to the representations received in advance of the completion of the review.  It is now hoped that this review will be completed very shortly and, in accordance with a commitment given on a number of occasions, most recently during the debate on the 1993 Finance Bill, the Opposition spokespersons will be consulted in relation to the review at that stage.  Once that consultation process has been completed, a detailed reply can be issued.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I accept that, in the light of the unavoidable delay in finalising the review, an interim reply should have been issued to the Deputy and I apologise for the fact that such an acknowledgement did not issue in this case.  I have now taken steps which are designed to ensure that all representations received from Members of the Oireachtas will, at a minimum, be acknowledged promptly in future.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the legislation that imposes the health contributions and levies has no special provisions relating to covenanted income.  Therefore, income which has been subject to these charges and which is transferred to another person under a deed of covenant will also be liable to the charges in the hands of the covenantee provided the charging conditions are satisfied.</P>
      <P>There has been no legal challenge to the collection of the health contributions or levies from covenanted income.</P>
      <P>The health contributions and levies would not be chargeable where the convenantee holds a means tested medical card.  The income levy would not apply unless the covenantee's income is £9,000 or more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimated full year cost to the Exchequer of the changes mentioned by the Deputy is approximately £7 million in 1993/94 terms.</P>
      <P>The tax treatment of widowed persons is being kept under review in my Department. There are, however, serious practical objections to giving double rate bands and an extra £2,000 tax free allowance to widowed parents.  If these concessions were made for widowed parents there would be immediate calls for commensurate concessions to be extended to single parents, to married couples with children and to widowed parents on relatively low incomes who could not avail of all the concessions mentioned.  As the doubling of the rate bands would benefit only the relatively better-off widowed parents who are currently on the higher rate of tax, about 35 per cent of the total, such calls for additional concessions would, in equity, be difficult to resist for single and married parents at all income levels and for widowed parents at lower income levels.</P>

      <P>When I first introduced the Christmas bonus in 1980, it was paid to the elderly and other pensioners, including persons who were long term ill and in receipt of invalidity pension.  In 1985, it was extended to unemployed people in receipt of the long term rate of unemployment assistance.  Disability benefit is a short term social insurance payment.</P>
      <P>Last year some 655,000 people and their 395,000 dependants on long term payments were paid a Christmas bonus of 70 per cent of normal weekly payments at a cost of £31 million, which was an increase of £3 million on 1991.</P>

      <P>The prevention of fraud and abuse and unwarranted claiming of social welfare is an integral part of the work of the Department of Social Welfare.  Staff are continuously vigilant and all officers involved in the processing and payment of social welfare entitlements have a role in monitoring claims and the prevention and detection of abuse.</P>
      <P>There are also specific units, which work at local, regional and national level within the Department, whose responsibility is to seek out and identify specific forms of abuse and to devise appropriate measures to counteract these.  Their work includes carrying out inspections of employers in relation to their PRSI obligations, investigating cases of concurrent working and claiming of social welfare benefits, and monitoring on-going entitlements to social welfare payments. There are approximately 530 staff involved in this work.  The work of these units has a positive and significant impact in preventing fraud and abuse and has been highly successful in bringing many employers into the PRSI system and in reducing black economy operation.  Last year the total savings to the taxpayer as a result of these activities amounted to £84 million or about £158,000 per officer on average.  However it should be noted that the savings per officer would vary according to activity, location, etc.  It should also be noted that the savings figure does not include any element arising from the routine validation and checking of claims before they are put into payment.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for Unemployment Assistance on 19 January 1993.  His means were assessed at £135 per week (£7,000 per annum), based on means derived from his self-employment as a painter and decorator.</P>
      <P>He appealed this decision to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office on 29 March 1993 and the appeal was submitted for consideration by an Appeals Officer.  The Appeals Officer disallowed the appeal on the grounds that, having regard to the person's previous earnings, the assessment represented a reasonable expectation of his likely earnings over the following twelve months.  The Appeals Officer's decision is final and may only be altered in the light of new facts or evidence.</P>

      <P>A major programme of criminal law reform is under way in my Department at present and, as proposals are finalised, they will be announced in the usual way in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to legislation to help the victims of crime, I would point out to the Deputy that the plight of victims is to the forefront in the on-going process of devising proposals to reform the criminal law.  In this regard I would specifically refer the Deputy to the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992 and the Criminal Justice Act, 1993.  The former Act contains provisions designed to make it easier for victims of certain crimes to give evidence; the latter, as well as providing for a procedure allowing for an appeal against unduly lenient sentences, contains measures making it incumbent on the courts to take into account any effect of crimes on victims in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed and allows the court to order payment of compensation to the victim.  In relation to the Deputy's specific reference to legislation to deal with the problems of muggers and attacks on the elderly, I would be happy to take into account any representations which the Deputy would be in a position to make suggesting particular changes of the law which he believes would be helpful in this area.  In this connection I might also refer the Deputy to the contents of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, 1993 which was published yesterday which, <i>inter alia</i>, gives the Garda power to direct persons loitering in circumstances that give rise to a reasonable apprehension for the safety of persons or <Col N="139" /> property, or for the maintenance of the public peace, to leave the vicinity.</P>

      <P>There are no official statistics on the level of absenteeism. <Col N="143" /> However, there have been a number of studies and reports on the subject including one undertaken recently by IBEC in an attempt to quantify the level of absenteeism generally.  These are outlined in the following table.  Absenteeism rates are difficult to assess and compare due to the existence of different definitions of the term.  Nevertheless, the various surveys make it clear that there is no room for complacency.</P>
      <P>Absenteeism is a cause of concern due to its detrimental effects in terms of increased costs and reduced productivity and competitiveness.  The control of absenteeism is an essential element in managing an enterprise and is the primary responsibility of the management at each workplace.  Experience has shown that enterprises which have adopted specific absence control policies, including the keeping of records, have been successful in reducing absenteeism.  I would accordingly, urge all enterprises to adopt appropriate measures to address the issue.</P>
      <P>Fostering greater commitment by employees to the enterprise also plays its part in improving attendance and, in this regard, I have always encouraged greater involvement by employees in the affairs of the company.  The Government is committed to this process and this is underlined in the Programme for Government. The FIE/ICTU Joint Declaration on Employee Involvement in the Private Sector provides a framework within which arrangements for consultation with and involvement of employees might be encouraged.  The document emphasises that the involvement of employees assists in the development of the enterprise and increases motivation and job satisfaction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem of homelessness amongst the Irish community in Britain is a matter of very serious concern to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the Deputy that the provision of accommodation in Britain is essentially a matter for the relevant authorities in that country.  However, various studies have shown that the Irish <Col N="145" /> are substantially over-represented amongst both those who are street-homeless and those who must avail themselves of temporary and hostel accommodation.</P>
    <P>DÍON, the advisory committee on emigrant welfare, has helped to highlight this over-representation through its funding of certain research projects.  One very important study funded by DÍON of the whole question of Irish homelessness was the research by CARA called &ldquo;Access to Housing for Irish Single Homeless People&rdquo;.  This research looked at the policy and practice of housing associations and local authorities with regard to the Irish homeless.  It had a two-fold benefit for the Irish in London. Firstly, it helped to highlight to these organisations the particular plight of the Irish homeless and, secondly, an additional 500 bedspaces were secured for Irish clients as a result of the research.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to record that DÍON is fully supportive of the direct efforts by the large number of individuals and organisations within the Irish community in Britain who are tackling the specifically Irish dimensions of the problem of homelessness. DÍON in recent years has given priority consideration to applications from organisations concerned with supporting the homeless.</P>
    <P>I would also like to remind the Deputy that, despite the fall off in net emigration and the severe budgetary situation, the Government has maintained the DÍON allocation at £500,000 per annum for the last four years, because of its concern for the continuing needs of emigrants in Britain.</P>
    <P>The primary focus of grant-aid from DÍON is to support the salary costs of providing professional advice and welfare services.  In the 1992 allocation of DÍON grants, virtually all those who received grants were involved in one way or another in trying to address the housing needs of the Irish emigrants.  The three Irish housing associations, i.e., Innisfree, CARA and An Teach, who provide accommodation at reasonable rents for Irish emigrants, all received money from the DÍON allocation.  DÍON also granted support for others such as <Col N="146" /> the Homeless Concern projects based in Cricklewood, Acton, Baron's Court and Southwark Day Centres which provide for the needs of those who are homeless or in sub-standard accommodation by providing them with a drop-in centre where meals and clothing as well as advice on other services is available.</P>
    <P>DÍON also funds three non-Irish West End advice agencies in London which come into contact with vulnerable and ill-prepared young Irish emigrants who arrive without prior preparation and require immediate assistance.</P>
    <P>An important development in DÍON activity in recent years has been the development of links with the statutory bodies in London and the UK generally which can help provide valuable resources to tackle the needs of Irish homeless people.  In particular, DÍON has established close ties with the London Borough Grant Unit which also joint funds, with DÍON, voluntary agencies tackling various aspects of Irish homelessness, e.g. An Teach, the London Irish Women's Centre.  DÍON has also established links with the Housing Corporation &mdash; now the main source of housing provision in Britain.  In turn, the Housing Corporation has grant aided a number of new Irish housing projects to the tune of many millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>I hope the Deputy will agree that quite a great deal is being done to assist Irish homeless persons in Britain.  The DÍON committee keeps me fully briefed on matters relating to the welfare of Irish emigrants in Britain.  I shall of course, together with DÍON, be keeping the situation under review.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) in County Waterford, in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance, who had set up his own business was deprived of a payment which is available to social welfare recipients who start up their own business in view of the fact that this resulted in the business having to be discontinued; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Area (Enterprise) Allowance is one of a number of special measures being piloted by the 12 Area Partnerships set up under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> This pilot scheme involves payment by the Department of Social Welfare, for a period of twelve months, to a person who is starting a business, of an allowance equivalent to the social welfare payments that person would have been entitled to while on the live register.  Such persons are also allowed retain a range of secondary benefits which are associated with receipt of the long term rate of unemployment assistance where that applies.  This scheme is currently confined to persons who have been on the live register for at least twelve months.  No arrangement exists at present to regard persons in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance (DPMA) as potentially eligible to participate in this scheme as such persons are not normally regarded as available for, capable of and genuinely seeking employment.</P>
      <P>The question of whether the scheme should be extended to cater for such groups will be considered as part of the ongoing evaluation of the Area Based Response to Long-Term Unemployment. In the meantime I will take up with the Minister for Health the question of whether there is scope to enable disabled person's maintenance allowance to be converted, in certain circumstances, into an equivalent allowance in the way in which social welfare payments are treated for the purposes of this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should emphasise that questions as to whether individuals in receipt of particular type of benefits are eligible for support under special schemes which are funded from Exchequer resources are a matter for the public body with responsibility for the particular scheme concerned. The question, however, of <Col N="148" /> whether any particular business proposal is potentially viable and unlikely to displace existing business is a separate matter to be considered, in this instance, by the Area Partnerships.  I have no direct role <i>vis-à-vis</i> decisions taken by the Partnership Boards about individual applications.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the published report of the Commission's public inquiry into the supply and distribution of motor fuels.  I am satisfied that, with the coming into force of the Competitive Act, 1991, and the contemporaneous removal of restrictive practices and prices regulations, a good balance has been achieved in providing a regulatory environment which allows price levels to be determined by competitive market forces, while allowing those aggrieved of anti-competitive practices the means to seek redress.</P>
      <P>My Department has been mandated to seek to increase awareness of prices differentials between forecourts in co-operation with consumer interests. Under the Retail Prices (Petrol) Display Order, 1986, retailers of petrol are obliged to display the retail price, expressed in pence per litre, for each grade of petrol on sale at their premises. The notice showing retail prices must be clearly visible and easily legible from the public road in the vicinity of the premises. The Director of Consumer Affairs is charged with the enforcement of this Order and infringements may result in court action being taken by him against the retailer concerned.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 158 and 159 together.</P>
      <P>I have not sought advice from the Director of Consumer Affairs in relation to an oil company's interest in participating in a national promotional scheme.  I am, however, aware that in his submission to the Fair Trade Commission's Report on the Supply and Distribution of Motor Fuels, the director of Consumer Affairs indicated that he received no complaints from consumers that such schemes were putting up prices. The Consumers Association of Ireland were not opposed to the principle of gift schemes, considering that consumers should be free to choose gifts if they wished.</P>
      <P>I would also refer the Deputy to my reply to a Dáil question on this subject on 18 May, 1993 which remains valid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>General trading stamp schemes are regulated by the Trading Stamps Act, 1980 (as amended).  Under this Act the intending promoter of a trading stamp scheme must lodge the scheme catalogue with the Minister for approval prior to the introduction of the scheme.  As the Act is primarily a consumer protection measure, the Director of Consumer <Col N="150" /> Affairs is responsible for its enforcement. Promotional schemes where the tokens, stamps, etc. are redeemable only from the seller of the goods covered by the scheme, or his supplier, are excluded from the scope of the Act.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the parties involved as to whether such schemes should be notified for the purpose of seeking a licence or certificate under the Competition Act.</P>

      <P>I recently confirmed that I had requested my Department to consider the scope for extending the area based response to long term unemployment by means of an examination of areas with similar socio-economic profiles to the existing 12 Partnerships.  The selection of areas will have to take account of factors such as the level of unemployment, particularly long term unemployment, the need for a geographical and urban-rural spread and the existence of structures and activities already in place on which the area based response could build.</P>
      <P>I have arranged for consultations to be undertaken between the Drogheda Pre-Partnership Committee, which has been exploring job creation ideas and the prospects for local enterprise initiatives, and officials of my Department and the National Co-ordination Team which has worked closely with the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> Area Partnership Companies over the past three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An extension of the area based <Col N="151" /> response will, however, require further consideration on the part of the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, which is charged with monitoring the current initiative, and also by the Government in the context of framing the National Development Plan, 1994-1999.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the, now disbanded, Apparel Industries Federation (AIF) carried out a feasibility study with funding approved under the EC PRISMA Programme on the question of setting up a Dublin Fashion Centre and that an application has also been made for further PRISMA funding in order to proceed to a design/ commercial viability stage on the project.</P>
      <P>However, the new IBEC representative Body for the Clothing Sector, the Irish Clothing Manufacturers Federation (ICMF), which has replaced the AIF, has written to me recently indicating that it wishes to appraise further the idea of a Dublin Fashion Centre.</P>
      <P>I believe it is essential that the ICMF should establish the precise level of support among clothing manufacturers in Ireland for the centre as the setting up of a project of this nature should have the central objective of underpinning the future development of Irish clothing manufacturers.  A formal response is awaited from the ICMF before a final policy decision can be made on PRISMA funding.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 174 and 175 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position concerning the provision of a high level bridge in Waterford is set out in the reply to Question No. 79 of 2 July, 1992, and in my reply to the Adjournment Debate on the matter on 10 February 1993.  As I indicated then, in view of the extensive programme of road improvements which has been carried out in the area since the proposal was the subject of a Bridge Order application in the 1970s, any proposal for the provision <Col N="158" /> of a further bridge would have to be examined very closely in relation to the likely cost, and the benefits to be derived from it.</P>
    <P>Last March, Waterford Corporation, acting in co-operation with Kilkenny County Council, submitted a proposal for a consultancy study which would involve a fundamental review of all relevant factors concerning the provision of a further bridge, including existing and predicted traffic volumes and patterns, the capacity of the existing road network, the examination of environmental implications and cost factors.  The brief for the study and a request for funding to allow it to proceed are being examined in my Department and I will inform the corporation of my decision as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>A more comprehensive list containing all the information sought by the Deputy is currently being compiled and is expected to be completed shortly.  I have arranged for a copy to be sent to the Deputy as soon as it is available.</P>

      <P>Applications for commonage divisions are received, recorded and processed, in the first instance, at local Land Commission office level.  In many cases details are not forwarded to the headquarters until the division on the ground has been completed. In these circumstances it was not possible to assemble the information requested in the time available.  However work on the preparation of a comprehensive list of applications for commonage division has commenced and will be completed as soon as possible.  I will communicate directly with the Deputy at that stage.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the dissolution Act provides for the transfer to me of the continuing powers and functions of the Land Commission.  These include certain judicial or quasi-judicial powers and certain &ldquo;excepted&rdquo; functions previously reserved to the Lay Commissioners. Arrangements are currently being made to provide a framework within which the transferred powers and functions of the Land Commission can be exercised.  The Irish Land Commission (Dissolution) Act, 1992 will be commenced when these arrangements are finalised.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that substantial amounts of land are still unregistered by the Land Commission; if he will give details of the difficulties that prevent such registration taking place; whether further resources will be made available to expedite such dealings; the extent of the unregistered lands throughout this State; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Land Commission has no responsibility for the registration of lands generally I assume that the Deputy is referring to lands allotted by the Commission and not yet vested i.e. lands for which the documents necessary for registration have not yet been lodged in the Land Registry.</P>
      <P>While I am not in a position to give the area of lands involved I am aware that there are some 4,000 recipients of Land Commission land still waiting to have their title vested.  Vesting is the first stage in the legal process of transferring ownership of the vested lands.  Delays in the vesting process in the main, are caused by legal and/or technical difficulties which usually involve complex title and/or mapping problems.  The provision of resources in the Land Commission is subject to the same budgetary constraints as in the rest of my Department.  The staffing needs are constantly reviewed and resources allocated within those constraints.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that every effort is being made, within the resources available to have all Land Commission allottees vested in their new lands at as early a date as possible.</P>

      <P>An extensive programme to improve and upgrade pig slaughtering and processing facilities over a number of years has created capacity to handle up to 4 million pigs in Irish factories annually.  Thus, scope exists to increase pig numbers by up to one-third but expansion can take place only in response to demand and in fact, at the current time, expansion must be export driven.  I am confident that the industry can maintain its excellent export performance record of recent years, having achieved an average annual growth rate of 24 per cent over the past three years.  Consequently, the prospects for growth in the period up to 1997 are good.</P>
      <P>As regards the impact of the GATT proposals, the interpretation of a number of important aspects of the agreement still remain under discussion.  The effect on the pig-meat sector will depend on how these issues are finally resolved.  It is likely that, at Community level, only modest levels of growth will be possible in the pig-meat sector following the GATT agreement.  However, as Ireland accounts for only 1.6 per cent of Community pig numbers even a limited expansion would permit considerable growth in Irish pig numbers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1977, the Government introduced a 3 per cent quota for those with a physical or other disability for employment in the public service.  Unfortunately, this 3 per cent target has not yet been met and unemployment among people with disabilities is now estimated at 80 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government provides that the Government will give a lead by honouring the <Col N="188" /> pledge in the public sector and that serious consideration will be given to formulating legislation for an employment quota throughout the economy.  I intend to have this issue included in the agenda for future talks between the Government and the social partners.</P>
    <P>Recent statistics which have been compiled in my Department show that while some Government Departments have complied with the Government directive, unfortunately others have not.  I am writing to the Ministers whose Departments have not reached the quota to ask that immediate steps be taken to ensure that it is fully honoured.  I have already raised the issue with the Ministers for Health and the Environment.  I have asked them to let me know what plans, if any, each health board and local authority has to increase the proportion of people with disabilities in their employment.</P>
    <P>It is intended to hold recruitment competitions for Clerical Assistant (disabled) and Blind Telephonist in the Civil Service later this year or early next year.  In addition, it is intended to include a special recruitment competition for disabled people in the next Executive Officer competition.</P>
    <P>The appointment of people to subordinate grades is a matter for each individual Minister.  Departments have been instructed to ask the National Rehabilitation Board to nominate some suitable candidates and to give priority to them. The final selection, however, rests with each Minister.</P>
    <P>People with disabilities are not restricted to special competitions.  It is open to anyone to apply for any open recruitment competition for which they are eligible and many people with disabilities have been recruited by these means over the years.  Once notified in advance of special needs, the Civil Service Commission will make special arrangements to facilitate candidates wherever at all possible.</P>
    <P>While the emphasis for some time has been on the achievement of the target quota, it is also important to ensure equality of treatment between staff with and without disabilities once in employment. The introduction of a code of practice <Col N="189" /> for the Employment of People with Disabilities in the Civil Service has been the subject of discussions at a subcommittee of General Council.  A draft code has now been prepared and is being considered by the staff side representatives.</P>
    <P>The code of practice will cover issues such as recruitment, reception and integration into the workplace, career development, accommodation and equipment and safety and evacuation procedures.  The ideas for the code of practice were developed in conjunction with the Civil Service unions, relevant voluntary bodies and consultation with staff with disabilities.</P>
    <P>I would urge all people with a disability to register with the National Rehabilitation Board and to apply for competitions for employment as they arise.</P>

      <P>The Western Health Board has plans to provide a Community Nursing Unit at Achill, County Mayo.  They are presently making arrangements to determine the suitability of a possible site.  However, building of the unit will depend, in the first instance, on the capital funding made available on a national basis in the coming years for community nursing units for the elderly and secondly, the internal priorities of the Western Health Board.</P>

      <P>The Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Regulations, 1990, provide for restriction and prohibition of smoking in certain designated public places.  Article 7, Part III of the regulations applies in the case of hospitals and other health facilities.  This article provides for the designation of certain clearly identified areas where smoking is prohibited.  It is a matter for each hospital authority to decide on the areas most appropriate within the hospital for such designation. Enforcement arrangements have been put in place involving environment health officers employed by health boards.</P>
      <P>The regulations are, by and large, strictly enforced in hospitals and other health institutions and persons who do not observe the rules on the prohibition on smoking in such areas are liable to prosecution.</P>

These proposals do not include the opening of further residential places at Áras Attracta.</P>

      <P>In regard to the school dental services the position is that the Western Health Board is now adopting a systematic targeted approach for the delivery of these services. This ensures a more equitable distribution of the dental resources available.  The approach aims to examine all children in specific classes and to provide treatment as necessary.  The classes chosen in the Western Health Board area are second and sixth.  These classes are chosen with preventive treatments in mind and to ensure that children are dentally fit before they leave national school.</P>
      <P>Children for whom a service was previously rarely, if ever, demanded and those in greatest need of dental care, will be screened, advised of the services available, educated in dental hygiene and provided with treatment as necessary.  In this way the optimum service is provided for those in need within the resources available.  Emergency treatment is also available for children on demand.  There is no waiting list for children under the schools programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to orthodontics the position is that a consultant orthodontist took up duty with the health board in November 1992.  Since her appointment she has been reviewing cases on the waiting list and is treating patients in clinics in Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.  Renovations and structural works are being completed in Merlin Park Regional to accommodate a five surgery orthodontic unit which the board hopes to have completed by mid-autumn. The consultant orthodontist will commence treatments then in Merlin Park and will further improve service <Col N="202" /> levels.  The current waiting list for orthodontic treatment in the boards area is 2,430.</P>
    <P>As regards the adult dental service an emergency service for the relief of pain is provided to all medical card holders throughout the area.  The board does not, at present, provide a comprehensive routine adult dental service because of budgetary constraints.  At the moment there are 4,124 adults on the waiting lists for dental treatment.  The board is reviewing the situation in the light of additional resources which were recently made available to the board for the further development of its dental services in the current year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 245, 246 and 248 together.</P>
      <P>On 31 December 1992 there were 467 patients awaiting orthopaedic treatment, 415 patients on the waiting list for ear, nose and throat treatment, and 490 patients awaiting cataract operations in the Western Health Board area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware of the £20 million major action programme which I recently launched in relation to hospital <Col N="203" /> in-patient waiting lists was specifically targeted at those areas of hospital treatment where long waiting times are causing the greatest hardship.  The Western Health Board has been allocated £2,192,600 from the waiting list fund. This will enable the board to carry out an additional 1,884 procedures this year of which 160 will be opthopaedic, 350 ear, nose and throat and 250 cataracts.  This should impact significantly on the average waiting times in these areas.</P>

An AIDS monitoring committee representing statutory and non-statutory agencies in the Western Health Board area has also been established to advise on the provision of appropriate services for people with HIV/AIDS.  My Department liaises on a regular basis with each health board to ensure that demands for services for people in this category are met in the most efficient and comprehensive manner and having regard to the level of resources available.</P>

The report showed that of a total of 27,250 admissions to psychiatric hospitals and units 3,555 were non-voluntary.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at the delay at the compilation of these statistics.  My Department has just completed discussions with the health boards, and the Health Research Board about improving the timeliness of the data on psychiatric admissions.

      <P>The current reporting system in respect of cases of AIDS does not present data on a health board basis.  However, the National AIDS Strategy Committee in an interim report on HIV/AIDS surveillance in April 1992 has recommended that the current HIV reporting system operated by the Department of Health through the Virus Reference Laboratory, UCD, should provide data on a country basis without prejudice to the confidentiality of individual cases.  Since then, the laboratory has indicated to the Department that four HIV positive cases have been notified in respect of the Western Health Board area.  The HIV surveillance system is being augmented, initially by an anonymous unlinked system under which antenatal bloods taken for routine clinical purposes are tested for HIV.  This system is designed to monitor more comprehensively the spread of the infection and will provide <Col N="205" /> more focused data regarding the infection throughout the country.</P>

      <P>The information, in the form requested by the Deputy is not available.  I am advised by the Midland Health Board that there are currently 202 patients awaiting orthopaedic procedures in the Midland Health Board area, of which 58 are awaiting hip replacement operations.  Of these, 28 patients reside in County Westmeath. Within the health board area, 391 patients are awaiting tonsillectomy procedures, of which 284 are children.</P>
      <P>The waiting lists for orthodontic treatment are also maintained by the health board on a regional basis.  A total of 754 children are on the waiting lists for the entire health board region.  The health board has made considerable improvements in its orthodontic services over the past few years and I have recently allocated additional funds to the board which will enable it to further develop these services in the current year.</P>
      <P>As I have already informed the Deputy, I have recently given approval to proceed with the construction of two additional operating theatres at Tullamore General Hospital, one of ENT and one for general surgery.  This will bring the number of theatres to four.  The total cost of this project will be approximately £1 million.  It is expected that work will commence later this year and the project should be completed by late 1994.</P>
      <P>My Department has also recently given approval to the appointment of a third consultant orthopaedic surgeon and a second ENT surgeon for the Tullamore General Hospital.  The appointment of the consultants and the provision of the additional operating theatres will considerably improve both orthopaedic and ENT services in the Midland Health Board area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that the Deputy is aware that recently I launched a major action programme on hospital in-patient waiting lists.  Twenty million pounds was allocated for this programme to reduce waiting <Col N="208" /> times in a number of specialities, including ENT and orthopaedic surgery.  The Government objective is to eliminate waiting lists in excess of 12 months in these specialities and, in particular, to set a maximum period of 6 months for children awaiting ENT or eye treatment.</P>
    <P>I am happy to say that £1 million has been allocated to the Midland Health Board to help reduce waiting times.  This will enable the board to perform 100 additional hip replacement procedures and 506 additional ENT procedures, of which 395 will be children.</P>

      <P>Remedial teacher posts are allocated to schools on the basis of priority of need as indicated by data collected from schools by my Department's primary inspectorate.  The school in question currently has the services of two full-time remedial teachers.</P>
      <P>Because of on-going changes in the level of remedial need in individual schools over time, it is necessary to review allocations on a continuing basis to ensure that optimum value is obtained from this valuable resource.  I have no proposal to withdraw remedial teaching posts from this school.</P>

      <P>To be recognised as a national governing body of sport for the purposes of annual grant aid from my Department an organisation must satisfy the following criteria: (a) promote and control a form of sport of physical recreation which requires an acceptable level of physical skill and effort from the participant and of which Cospoir, The National Sports Council and the Department of Education approves; (b) be sufficiently developed to justify the term national; (c) be constituted on democratic lines; (d) possess a written constitution and committee structure acceptable to Cospoir and the Department of Education; (e) maintain an effective level of management and control of the sport in Ireland; (f) generate a reasonable level of financial support from within the activity and (g) complete at least one year working, followed by an annual general meeting and the production of audited financial statement and balance sheet covering all financial transactions.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the physical education programme in schools which has a sport content. Physical education is part of the official syllabus in the rules and programmes for <Col N="218" /> schools and as such is developed along lines of social and gender equality.  While no specific measures are taken to reflect this policy the main support for the policy is in the provision of PE facilities and the payment of teachers' salaries.</P>
      <P>In the context of the school based programmes of national governing bodies of sport, the policy relating to social and gender equality in such programmes is a matter for each independent voluntary national governing body of sport.  The Deputy will be aware that many teachers contribute to these extra curricular sport programmes.  As the term educational sport can have a very broad meaning it may be that the Deputy might wish to submit a more specific question should further clarification be required.</P>
