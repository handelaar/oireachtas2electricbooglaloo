      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 6, 8 and 9.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders that: 1, No. 6 shall be decided without debate; 2, in the case of the resumed debate on No. 9, the speech of each Member called on shall not exceed 20 minutes; 3, the Dáil shall sit tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. and adjourn not later than 4 p.m.; 4, statements shall be made tomorrow on the Report on Marital Breakdown and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) the statement of each Member called on shall not exceed 20 minutes; and (ii) the Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon not later than 3.40 p.m. to make a statement in reply not exceeding 20 minutes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion provides for a very restrictive debate on the Social Welfare Bill which affects the livelihoods of one million citizens of this State.  May I ask the Government to ensure that next year arrangements are made to provide adequate time, not just one day, for Committee Stage discussion of the Social Welfare Bill because of its importance and the contribution that many <Col N="742" /> Members, if not all Members, wish to make?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>More or less.  I may or may not be right in relation to this matter but I understand it is necessary for an order of the House to be made if the Social Welfare Bill is to conclude at 5 p.m. today.  However, there is no provision in the orders you have read out for such a conclusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It is openness, yes. I would also make the point that although spokespersons on Social Welfare have agreed with the Minister on the scheduling of the debate &mdash; I presume an order will be made later this morning in relation to that matter &mdash; the time available is very short.  There are 34 sections to be dealt with, relating to many major issues, and one day is not adequate for that debate.</P>

      <P>In view of the developments in regard to Greencore in the past 24 hours will the Taoiseach agree to allow the House have a further debate or statements on this subject in the near future before a final decision is taken?  May I ask the Taoiseach &mdash; this question is not in order but I am going to ask it just the same &mdash; if he will consider asking the Minister for Foreign Affairs to make representations to the appropriate authorities in regard to Maggie O'Kane who is being detained and about whose welfare I am sure many Members in this House will be concerned?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an inquiry yesterday about the possibility of having a debate on Northern Ireland.  Would the Taoiseach agree now that it might be discussed next week so that the House could be aware of the present position with regard to the talks that have now <Col N="744" /> stalled and in view of the continuing violence &mdash; the latest instalment of which I understand is that there were two further murders in County Derry this morning &mdash; which is absolutely appalling.  This will go on and on apparently daily on a tit-for-tat basis.  This House should discuss the matter at an early stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I said yesterday morning that asking the Taoiseach or Ministers in this House to make statements is, strictly speaking, not appropriate on the Order of Business.  Our Question Time invariably ends up by asking the appropriate Minister, the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste to make a statement.  I would ask Deputies to bear that in mind.  I would much prefer if these matters were discussed and deliberated upon in another way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I asked the Taoiseach if he might consider allowing a debate on Northern Ireland next week and I suggested Friday of next week.  I understand that a debate on European affairs has been fixed for Friday of next week, but it seems that in the course of next week's business we have also scheduled a day to debate the Comptroller and Auditor General Bill which is not the most urgent legislation. If Wednesday or a large portion of Wednesday was set aside&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>These were matters which I was seeking to dissuade Members from raising.  When the Deputy raised this matter yesterday I indicated to him that I would prefer that it be discussed with the Whips.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. I would point out, with respect, that there is a considerable degree of anger and frustration outside of this House, among the population, at the continuing activities of the Provisional IRA&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not seeking to create a row about it, I am simply making the point that the House should be seen to be taking this matter on board. If this House was to set aside three or four hours next week to debate Northern Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it would indicate a great advance in that we would actually be debating issues relevant to the people outside this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I would welcome such a debate as this is probably the most important issue facing this nation at the moment.  If there is to be a debate I would request the Taoiseach and the Government not to have a restricted debate of three or four hours and not to restrict Deputies with time limits.  We should have a free discussion on what is happening in the northern part of this island.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P>I am calling Deputy Currie.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Chair agree that there are some things which are so important that they ought to take precedence over restrictions and precedents of this House?  In this instance I strongly suggest to the Taoiseach that he accede to the demand for a debate and that he give serious consideration to the proposal first made by the Tánaiste and now supported <Col N="746" /> by Deputy John Bruton that there should be a round table all-party discussion, because there are certain things we would like to say which with all responsibility we cannot really say in the publicity of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To be helpful and in accordance with the Chair's wishes, I am prepared to let the Whips discuss this matter.  As the House is aware, the Seanad is having a debate today on Northern Ireland.  Certainly the increase in violence is a matter of serious concern not alone to everybody in this House but to the people of this country and elsewhere as well.  I have no objection to allowing the Whips discuss what might be desirable in relation to a debate.  With regard to what Deputy Currie said, the Tánaiste issued an individual invitation to each political leader to come and talk to him privately about this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We hear that the Minister for Enterprise and Employment is telling his colleagues that the grass is greener over the next hill.  When will we see the legislation to introduce the changes proposed by the Culliton group in relation to the industrial agencies?  The reality is that progress on the Culliton report has come to a standstill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so, as the Minister concerned has just said.  He has a meeting every Thursday morning advancing the Culliton recommendations. The preparation of the legislation is well advanced and it will be brought to this House at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this matter of the promised legislation on the Culliton proposals on a number of occasions.  In the light of the story in today's <i>Irish Times</i> about the squabble between the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and the Minister for Tourism and Trade&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Some weeks ago a precedent was established whereby statements in relation to Greencore were made.  In view of the fact that there is now an imminent Government decision on this and in view of the internal tensions in the Government on this issue, would it not be appropriate that there would be statements so that the public would be assured that this company will not fall into foreign ownership in the future?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>1.  In page 6, before section 3, but in Part II, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;(1) The recommendation of the Commission on Social Welfare in relation to a common basic payment or minimally adequate payment shall be recognised as the Official Poverty Line.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Official Poverty Line rate shall be established at:</P>
      <P> (a)  for a single adult, £50.00 per week in 1985 prices,</P>
      <P>(b)  for a married couple, 1.6 times the weekly rate for a single person in 1985 prices,</P>
      <P>(c)  for each child under the age of 18 years, £10.00 per week in 1985 prices. </P>
      <P>(3)  The Official Poverty Line rate shall be indexed annually in line with the Consumer Price Index.&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole thrust of Social Welfare Bills each year should be to attempt to create a system which ensures relief for people who are in poverty.  I realise the Bill on its own, or even to a significant extent, will not be able to achieve that end.  I made the point on Second Stage that there is a need to examine the tax and social welfare systems to seek ways of eliminating poverty traps and to try to ensure that the rates at which people pay tax and at which people receive assistance, <Col N="752" /> through the social welfare system, are such that people have an adequate income to live on.  Bearing in mind that we are dealing with the Social Welfare Bill and not the Finance Bill one approach would be to establish a basic level of payment below which no one would be paid any less.  One simple way of doing that would be to establish an official poverty line.  There is much debate about what precisely constitutes poverty.  That debate is one which rages not only here but in other European countries.  The European Community has established a definition which is generally acceptable but it is not comprehensive in its operation or how it might be applied.</P>
    <P>I propose that the recommendation of the Commission on Social Welfare on a common basic payment, or minimal adequate payment, be recognised as the official poverty line.  I would point out that in 1985 terms for a single person that would be £50, for a married couple 1.6 times the weekly rate for a single person and for each child under the age of 18 years, £10 per week.  Clearly, those rates would be higher now.  I urge that the official poverty line rate be indexed annually in line with the consumer price index. If we take the single adult rate of £50 at 1985 prices and index it in line with today's prices, we are talking about £65 or £66.</P>
    <P>The establishment of an official poverty line would extricate the debate about poverty from the academic exercise of trying to decide whether one should take the 40 per cent line, that is 40 per cent of the average household income in any one year, or the 50 per cent line which some people would take or the 60 per cent line. The NESC published Report No. 89, in October 1989.  That report attempted in some detail to distinguish what these lines were, how they might affect income and how many people would be included or excluded from the category.  If one takes the 40 per cent line as the poverty line &mdash; I cannot recall the figures precisely &mdash; one is talking about something in the region of 20 per cent of the population. If we take the 50 per cent line we are talking about 25 per cent of the population <Col N="753" /> and if we take the 60 per cent line we are talking about 32 per cent to 33 per cent of the population.  Regardless of which line is adopted &mdash; and people will presumably dispute it &mdash; the fact is that the 60 per cent line is still below the figure recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare in 1985-86.</P>
    <P>If we establish an official poverty line we will at least have a base from which to work and we will know what we are talking about when we look at statistics. When the Minister gives us the numbers living in poverty we will have a gauge against which to measure what is being done.  I strongly argue in favour of this amendment and urge the House to adopt it.  Its adoption would not cost the State one penny.  It is simply a matter of policy and it would be well worth going down this road.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the concept of Deputy De Rossa's amendment, conscious of the growing poverty here at present.  Poverty in Ireland is reaching appalling proportions.  We have only to look at what is happening in our cities and towns, and the alienation of so many of our people from the authorities, to realise that it is the cause of crime and other social problems.  I support any measure which will reduce the level of poverty and its impacts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the Minister's attempts to grapple with this appalling problem.  The Minister seems to be very quick to introduce cuts &mdash; he has <Col N="754" /> done this in many forms in recent months.  I am referring, for example, to the circular letters issued to community welfare officers, which we in this House never see, and regulations.  Whenever the Minister brings forward so-called improvements, inadequate as they may be, they are deferred until July and September. Some of the circular letters issued to community welfare officers have had the effect of driving people even deeper into poverty.  Occasions which should lead to great rejoicing, for example, Confirmation, First Communion and Christmas, are turning into nightmares for families.  These occasions are turning into times of great stress for families where the breadwinner is unemployed or some of the members are affected by illness. Such families cannot provide for their most basic needs at these important times in their lives.  As I said, this is leading to an increase in the number of loan sharks and illegal moneylenders. The measures introduced by the Minister in recent times have had the effect of increasing this type of illegal activity.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made some token gestures.  Yet the Government has not taken the most essential step, that is, introduce a credit control Bill.  Some of the provisions in the Bill will come into effect in July while others will come into effect in late August-September.  I have tabled amendments which deal with this issue.  I wish to refer to a phone conversation I had with an old age pensioner from Dublin this morning.  She phoned me regarding the Minister's announcement of free colour television licences for old age pensioners.  This woman's licence is due to expire next week but she has been told that she will not be able to get a free television licence until next year as the scheme will not be introduced until later this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced improvements of approximately £2 per week for old age pensioners with effect from July. However, days after the Minister's announcement local authorities introduced increases of between 80p-£1 in the <Col N="755" /> rents for old age pensioners.  This meant that half the increase announced by the Minister was immediately wiped out by the increase in rents.  Instead of introducing a Social Welfare Bill every year, I ask the Government to introduce an overall social policy which will meet the needs of the old, the sick and the unemployed. What is happening is that an increase of £2.60-£2.80 is being given with one hand and half of it is being taken away with the other.  Old people and people who are marginalised regard the whole thing as a con job, a shifting around of figures and benefits so that there is no real improvement for those who are dependent on social welfare.  I have tabled a number of amendments which deal with the issue in a different way from that proposed by Deputy De Rossa.  Nevertheless, I believe our amendments would have the same effect.</P>
    <P>There is no use in the Minister shedding crocodile tears about the evils of moneylenders and poverty without doing something realistic and positive to tackle these problems.  Many of the provisions in these sections are anti-people and anti-family. I challenge the Labour Party to support some of the amendments I have tabled, which propose to reverse many of the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; measures, on which many Labour Party Deputies made their name, and which were introduced by the previous Government.  If a vote is called at 12 o'clock I hope the Labour Party Deputies will support our amendments because by so doing they will reverse many of those &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; measures and fulfil many of the promises they made to the public when they ran for election in November.  If they do not do this they will be seen as reneging on the goodwill and trust the people put in them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms. O'Donnell Ms. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. As Deputy De Rossa rightly said, we need to set a line below which we cannot expect people to live today.  The priority rates set by the Commission on Social Welfare have not been reached this year.  This is unfortunate.  Those rates were set at £65-£78 for a single person <Col N="756" /> and £104-£124 for a married couple.  I do not believe these rates are too much to expect in a modern Irish society.  Some of the measures proposed by the Minister in this legislation are to be welcomed. Our role in Opposition is to bring the best out in the Government, and not to knock the good measures proposed in the legislation.  I welcome the increases in the rates of child benefit and the reversal of some of the rather harsh measures which were introduced in 1992.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Commission on Social Welfare generally and the intellectual investment in it, if we do not implement the recommendations and adopt a reform approach, as recommended by the commission, we will be wasting time and denying all the good work done by the commission.  For that reason, I am disappointed that the priority rates have not been reached this year, as recommended by the commission. It is the only commitment on incomes in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which has not been honoured.  We have to compare the growth in incomes for those in the public sector with the growth in incomes for those on social welfare.  The difference is that the incomes of those in the public sector have increased six times more than the income of those on social welfare. This is unjustifiable.  We have to start making the correct choices.  Even though these choices may be challenged, it is a time for leadership.  I believe there would be cross-party support for the Minister if he moved towards achieving the priority rate set by the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the myths abroad is that our social welfare bill is getting our of control and is unsustainable.  Of course, the figures will show that the percentage of GNP being spent on social welfare has fallen even though the number of people claiming social welfare increased dramatically between 1986 and 1992.  It is important that we move beyond the notion of throwing percentages at the social welfare payments every year and start to tackle the question of exclusion and the non-income related aspects of <Col N="757" /> poverty.  If we continue to adopt a relief approach, as we have been doing for the past number of years, by giving percentage increases in social welfare which match the rate of inflation, we will not tackle the background, very serious and related problems of poverty &mdash; depression, disfunctioning families, alienation and alcoholism, problems which flow from exclusion rather than low incomes.</P>
    <P>I support this amendment.  I welcome some of the measures which have been brought forward and the Minister's reassurance yesterday that he will look at the carer's allowance in consultation with the Minister for Health.  This is a very good scheme.  Perhaps it is the scheme with most potential in terms of supporting the care of the sick in their homes.  There would be massive public support for the expansion of that scheme. Generally I support this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the concept of Deputy De Rossa's amendment.  It is a step in the right direction in that it imposes on us the responsibility to face up to the poverty problem.  If we refuse to recognise the scale of the problem we will not put in place the requisite policies. Poverty is possibly our only growth industry. Every family is affected in some way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa's proposal represents a move towards a basic income. That whole question has been addressed by many economic scholars, notably by the former Taoiseach, Dr. FitzGerald. While we have not progressed as far as some would like, the question needs to be addressed now.  Suggestions are made that the poverty trap can cause people to remain dependent on social welfare rather than take up employment.  There is another side to that equation.  A basic income of some kind could help resolve the problem.  People in receipt of social welfare are unwilling to take up offers of short term employment because at the end of it they will face administrative chaos in returning to the social welfare system.  Some kind of basic income structure would guarantee that people would automatically receive a reasonable level <Col N="758" /> of social welfare support.  This would help rather than hinder the transfer of people from social welfare to employment and it would give an assurance to people who might wish to take a short term job.</P>
    <P>The official poverty line, as defined by Deputy De Rossa, is £50 a week per adult at 1985 prices.  That cannot be regarded as excessive.  Claims are made that social welfare rates are such that they are a disincentive to leaving the system.  Anybody who is misfortunate enough to have to depend on social welfare is not living a life of luxury.  I welcome the increases in rates but they are not to come into effect for some time.  They will simply allow people to tick over.  There is no possibility of other than a basic lifestyle.</P>
    <P>I support the concept of the amendment, which demands that we face up to the huge poverty problem which needs to be tackled in a constructive way.  We must first admit the scale of the problem and then put policies in place to rectify it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the thrust of this amendment and with the comments made by Deputies Allen, Bradford and O'Donnell.  This Bill is another in a long line of fairly anodyne Social Welfare Bills.  It does not do anything basically to change the system.  The increases provided for are useful but they will barely keep pace with inflation, if that.  They will make no fundamental difference in real terms to the situation of people directly concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has promised a consolidation Bill later this year.  Part VI of this Bill, which deals with pre-consolidation amendments, does not give me hope that we will see anything creative in that Bill.  Everything we see here about consolidation is repressive and restrictive. It is a pity to deal with these Bills in this way.  Perhaps the Minister will give us his thoughts on how he might go about rectifying the position we are complaining about.  I realise that the making of these points is more ceremonial than anything else because the Government has a majority of 37 and, in spite of the row about the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; before the election, the Labour Party will vote <Col N="759" /> against this and other amendments.  It is not very satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The Minister might reflect on what he has heard and suggest a way in which between now and next year's Social Welfare Bill this House might give some sustained and direct attention to the problems at the root of Deputy De Rossa's amendment.  Nobody would suggest that the Commission on Social Welfare which reported some years ago has all the wisdom that needs to be applied to this matter.  Nobody would suggest that there is any one answer, but it is evident that in the way our system is structured there are enormous obstacles which prevent people who are receiving various forms of benefit and assistance from exercising their initiative to get out of that situation.  I am not saying this requires a fundamental shake-up in the whole philosophy of the social welfare system, but at least it requires a look to see which parts of the system are slowing down our response to basic problems and the changes which are necessary.</P>
    <P>Changes of the kind proposed by Deputy De Rossa and of the kind I have in mind would cost more money but there are parts of the system where there is an inbuilt pressure on the State to spend more money than is necessary.  I give just one example.  Young people seeking unemployment assistance are driven out of home by the system and the State spends money as a result.  If we change the system to avoid that kind of nonsense, we can liberate some of that money to be used in a more constructive and beneficial way in other parts of the system.</P>
    <P>Debate on this part of the Bill must be concluded at mid-day and Report Stage this afternoon, which is an obscenity in terms of parliamentary procedure on a Bill like this.  There will not be time in the course of this debate for that kind of review of the system.  I invite the Minister to tell us if he has any sympathy with the idea that between now and next year's Social Welfare Bill this House might be given an opportunity to look at some of these concerns in more detail and an opportunity of doing something more <Col N="760" /> fundamental about a system which we know to be defective, so that we can produce something more in tune with the needs of our times.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dukes has illustrated the reality in relation to social welfare generally and the whole question of eliminating poverty, need, dependency and exclusion from society.  It is not a simple matter of saying there is an official statistic and that is the end of it.  There is no simple official line.  There are a number of official lines to meet the different circumstances that exist.  The commission itself have found that and was happy when we took up its report as our reference point.</P>
      <P>One of the things I will do shortly is show just how much has been achieved since the commission's report first came out.  Also much has changed since that time.  People realise now that the most important thing to do for the long-term unemployed is to give them education and experience.  If substantial money is put into &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; education then those people can get out of poverty, and the vast majority of them will do so.  The idea of having a simple formula or official line that the party has to follow is too rigid and mechanical.  I saw what happened when that kind of approach was adopted and it was not good for anybody. I know that is not what the Deputy has in mind but it is what we would move towards.  I think this House is wise enough to make its own choices at budget time and consider the choices more during the year.  I am prepared to give consideration to what Deputy Dukes has suggested.  We will, of course, have the committee, but they will be dealing with legislation.  I know that what Deputy Dukes is suggesting is a pre-legislation stage.  I have no objection to that.  I would be quite happy to discuss any of the elements but I will not tie myself down to rigid arrangements of any sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The notion of a poverty line suggests that one can pick a particular level of income and say that those with less than this are poor and those with more are <Col N="761" /> not, but it is not as simple as that.  This is an all or nothing approach that does not reflect the reality of the situation. There is a continuum from very poor to very rich.  This problem has long been recognised by experts and researchers. One expert has likened the search for an objective or scientific poverty line to the quest for the Holy Grail.  There are a number of different ways of setting a poverty line.  One approach often used by researchers is to base poverty lines on income levels provided by the social welfare system.  This is obviously inappropriate as a target for social welfare generally.</P>
    <P>A second approach is to derive a poverty line based on the cost of a basket of goods and services considered to be the minimum necessary.  There are major problems with this subsistence approach. First, it may not accord with the common perception of what constitutes poverty and, second, as social welfare support improves poverty will be seen to disappear which is again at variance with the common perception of poverty as being relative to the average level of wellbeing of society as a whole.</P>
    <P>An alternative approach is to express the poverty line in terms of a proportion of average income adjusted for household size.  The problem with this approach, besides the arbitrary nature of the line chosen, is that even where social welfare changes succeed in making those on the lowest incomes better off in real terms, this would not reduce measured poverty unless they were also made better off relative to the rest of the population.</P>
    <P>The difficulty of choosing a single poverty line was acknowledged by the ERSI in its 1989 report on Poverty, Income and Welfare in Ireland.  In that report the researchers referred to the arbitrary nature of setting a single poverty line and instead used five different lines to show the nature and incidence of relative poverty.  By using a range of lines one can identify those households who are most at risk of poverty and this provides guidelines to the Government in deciding where our priorities should be. <Col N="762" /> For example, the ERSI report identified that households with children where the head of household is long-term unemployed face a particular risk of poverty and since the publication of that finding the Government had been directing resources to that group both by &ldquo;above inflation&rdquo; general increases and improvements in child support.  This is the way in which poverty lines should be used and not by setting arbitrary measures which do not reflect the complex reality.  It would be entirely inappropriate to arbitrarily pick a level of income as a poverty line for inclusion in the Social Welfare Acts.  Therefore, I do not intend to support this amendment.</P>
    <P>Let me also refer to an extract from the ERSI report on Poverty, Income and Welfare in October 1982.  They conclude that no entirely satisfactory and convincing method of drawing a unique poverty line was available.  They also pointed to several different kinds of approaches to measuring poverty.  I have probably said enough to indicate that there are a number of approaches and that each will have some relevance and some value but that there is no single approach which encapsulates all the different values.</P>
    <P>In so far as Deputies have suggested that we are not making progress in relation to priority lines and the lines generally, I announced on Tuesday that free colour television licences would come in from the beginning of April &mdash; Deputy Allen raised this question.  I know there are a lot of things happening at the one time, but let Deputies please give credit for the things that are being done.  As I announced, some of the regulations will be coming into operation immediately.  These include regulations which change and revoke decisions that were made last year.</P>

      <P>They will be laid on the table of the House.  I have to get this Bill through before I can finalise some of the regulations because this Bill gives me the necessary powers.  Some regulations do not require this power and I am making those regulations now in any event.</P>
      <P>In relation to reaching priority levels which several Deputies mentioned, the cost of going to priority levels is estimated at £354 million above the £180 million which is being provided here.  Progress has been made.  In relation to the social insurance payments, the priority rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare have already been achieved in the case of the old age contributory pension, the retirement pension, the invalidity pension, the widow's contributory pension schemes, the deserted wife's benefit and the long-term occupational injuries schemes.</P>
      <P>The disability benefit and unemployment benefit schemes are the only social insurance payments which are not yet at the commission's priority rate in 1993 terms.  About 67 per cent of the approximate 409,000 people in receipt of the various social insurance payments are receiving payment at a higher level than the priority rates of the commission.  A considerable amount was achieved by the budget, and this Social Welfare Bill achieves more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The priority rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare have been achieved for all long term social assistance payments: long term unemployment assistance, pre-retirement allowance, old age and blind pensions, widow's non-contributory pension, deserted wife's allowance, prisoners' wife's allowance and lone parent's allowance.  The rates of short term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare assistance are at present £2.70 per week less than the priority rates recommended by the commission. This year a major step has been <Col N="764" /> taken in the direction of achieving priority rates, with an increase of almost 5 per cent, or £2.60, in the weekly rates of short term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance. The weekly rate of the carer's allowance has gone above the recommended priority rates &mdash; although I do not think the commission had a carer's allowance in mind.  Of the more than 419,500 people in receipt of the various social assistance payments almost 83 per cent have a payment higher than the priority rate of the commission.</P>
    <P>Taking into account both the social insurance schemes and the social assistance schemes, 75 per cent of the total of almost 830,000 social welfare recipients receive payments at a higher level than the priority rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  While there is more to be done, the budget has taken steps in the right direction and a great deal has been achieved already. That reality often is not reflected in comments made outside the House, but those comments are made for a particular purpose at a particular time.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that there should be an official line set out in legislation.  It is my opinion that that is not the right approach and I do not consider that there is a simple, straightforward, single official line that should be set out officially. Adoption of that approach could lead to our legislation tying us into something that is disadvantageous to the people we want to serve.  I therefore have to oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>What work is being done by the Minister and his Department to resolve the outstanding anomalies in relation to pensioners who have had mixed and intermittent pension contributions in the calculation based years back to the mid-fifties?  Major problems are encountered by pensioners who have had mixed pension contributions and for those who went abroad to work for a few years and then came back.  Some work has been done but there are still anomalies outstanding and I should like to <Col N="765" /> know precisely what the Minister is doing to resolve those anomalies.</P>
      <P>Do anti-discrimination laws and equality Directives from the EC point to the need for the provision of widower's pensions?  How can widowers be treated differently from widows under the social welfare code, given the EC Directives on equality?  What is being done to resolve that anomaly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to put on the record of the House his thoughts on the major difficulties experienced in the calculation of means and in qualification for unemployment assistance and benefit for share fishermen.  Yesterday during Second Stage debate I spoke about the particular difficulty for that group.  There are hundreds of families involved in this issue. Every time that share fishermen are precluded by the weather from fishing, especially in the winter, they face difficulty in establishing their entitlement to social welfare assistance of one kind or another, and hence their entitlement to medical cards, rent relief and all of the other fringe benefits that come with qualification to social welfare assistance. What are the Minister's views on the treatment of share fishermen under the social welfare code?  I recognise that the Minister favoured an approach under which a company would be set up for each boat.  The fishermen do not favour that approach and they have given their reasons for that.  There are other options. Does the Minister insist on the establishment of a company structure?  Will he allow full benefits for the 7.7 per cent class A employee contribution and allow those benefits to be regarded as part of the individual's taxable income?  I understand that the Minister personally is not enthusiastic about that particular option. Would the Minister support the concept whereby an upper limit would be set for the period during which short term benefits could be claimed during the year &mdash; for example, a 12 to 16 week period? Would the Minister support the idea whereby a lower limit of benefit would be claimed without a time limit?  Would the Minister support the introduction of a special fisherman's insurance contribution <Col N="766" /> which would qualify the individual for full PRSI benefits when, through no fault of the fisherman, the individual is unable to be out at sea?  That is my preferred option but it is only one of five or six options.  Such a system is operated in other European countries, particularly in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>From 1 April the United Kingdom is to operate a system under which, in return for the payment of £7.75 per week per fisherman, to be paid 13 weeks in arrears, fishermen will be entitled to full social security benefits while not fishing.  Whatever option the Minister decides on, I appeal to him to resolve this difficulty within the next few months if provision cannot be made in this Social Welfare Bill.  We cannot allow another winter go by during which fishermen's families in maritime counties go hungry and have their electricity cut off or have to depend on the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to keep them fed for ten or 12 weeks.  I could give the Minister examples of that happening in my own constituency and my colleagues also have instances relating to other constituencies.  The problem would not arise in every constituency, particularly not in inland constituencies, but for too long that group of people has been neglected.  The Single Market places an emphasis on peripheral and remote communities.  In this regard we are failing our peripheral communities in some of the more remote regions of Ireland.  The fishing community is essential to some of the most remote points of our island.  We must ensure that the fishermen are kept in those areas and that we do not have further mass migration or emigration from the remote ports and villages around our coastline.  If the problem with the social welfare code is not resolved fishermen will not continue to go into their most important industry, an industry to which we look for further development of natural resources.  I ask the Minister to give his views on this issue and to say what he is doing in his Department to resolve the dilemma of share fishermen under the social welfare code.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay the debate unduly but I wish to respond to the Minister in relation to a number of points.  On several occasions the Minister referred to the adoption of an arbitrary line and in some vague way tried to relate that to a rigid approach to the issue of poverty.  If the Minister knows anything about my views on poverty and social welfare he will know that the last thing I adopt is a rigid approach to the issue.</P>
      <P>I know that there has been a range of research documents produced by voluntary organisations and State agencies which have calculated, at various times, that a significant proportion of the population lives in poverty, no matter what way it is measured, whether by the priority rates which the Commission on Social Welfare indicated it felt were severe, by the adequate income level which it recommended, or by the ESRI poverty lines of 40 per cent, 50 per cent or 60 per cent of average income.  No matter what way it is measured poverty exists and if you compare the statistics available &mdash; the only statistics I can find of a comprehensive nature were produced in 1987 &mdash; it is clear that there was a massive increase in the numbers of people living in poverty from 1973 to 1987.  The increased percentage of population living in poverty up to 1987 was 12.8 per cent on the 40 per cent line, 22.9 per cent on the 50 per cent line and 33.5 per cent on the 60 per cent line. Given that we had an increase in population during that time the numbers of people living in poverty increased dramatically up to 1987.</P>
      <P>The Combat Poverty Agency and others indicated that the circumstances which drive people into poverty are unemployment, low pay, lone parenthood and taxation policy.  Clearly, unemployment has increased massively since 1987; lone parenthood has also increased dramatically in the last decade and the studies I have read in relation to taxation over the last few years indicate that there has been a massive, disproportionate advantage to those on higher incomes compared with the low paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reason to believe that the <Col N="768" /> number of people affected by poverty has declined and if we are to treat that as a serious problem it is necessary to recognise it as such.  We have established a base line and we say that anyone receiving income below a certain level is poor; of course that does not mean that people marginally above that rate are not poor. Indeed there may also be rare circumstances where people marginally below that level may not, in the strict sense, be poor.  As the Minister said, it depends on family circumstances.  I am arguing for official recognition of poverty and I take as my model the study made by the Commission on Social Welfare.  It is disingenuous of the Minister to imply that that is in some way an arbitrary line because the commission spent a considerable time studying the subject and produced a vast volume in relation to its conclusions.  I am not arguing that incomes are the only measure of poverty; nobody argues that.  I am simply asking the Minister to take on board the view that the Government should establish a line below which people are regarded as living in poverty.  We should seek to rectify our system in regard to taxation, social welfare, unemployment and so on.</P>
    <P>The reason we must deal with it on a monetary basis is that we are dealing with the Social Welfare Bill which is primarily concerned with the rates and conditions under which income is paid through the social welfare system.  The Social Welfare Bill, in the normal course of the Social Welfare Acts in general, does not provide a policy.  We do that and it would make sense for Social Welfare Acts to incorporate an official line below which people are regarded as living in poverty.</P>
    <P>Nobody denies that the Minister has made improvements in the system in raising certain levels of income payments, etc., to a particular level.  He has also ironed out some of the anomalies in the system.  I very much appreciate the fact that the Minister has moved some way in reversing the cuts made last year. However, it is not right to pretend that the system is gradually moving towards a more progressive distribution of income <Col N="769" /> because that is not the case as long as we allow a situation to continue whereby the social welfare and tax systems exist virtually independent of each other.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement is not being addressed in the Bill and many other areas need calm and considered discussion with a view to change.  This Bill &mdash; and this kind of debate &mdash; is not necessarily the best way of doing it.  I urge the Minister to consider my remarks.</P>
    <P>My amendment is similar to a proposal made in 1991 on the Social Welfare Bill of that year by the present Minister of State, Deputy Stagg.  I must assume that if the argument was valid in 1991 for one third of the present Government it must have validity today.  I am not satisfied that the Minister is approaching this issue in the spirit in which it is proposed.  It is not an attempt to create rigidity, it provides that the level of income would be indexed annually in line with the consumer price index.  I would appreciate a more positive response from the Minister and, if it is not forthcoming, I will press my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Like many other Deputies I am frustrated at the short time we have to debate the large number of amendments to the Bill.  We are still debating the first amendment at 11.50 a.m.  That indicates the priority being afforded by this Government to the overall question of social welfare, that a Bill can be introduced affecting the standard of living of over one million people over the next 12 months, and taxpayers who fund the system, while spending part of two days debating Second Stage &mdash; effectively we began at 4 o'clock on Tuesday and finished at 7 p.m., three hours only, and some part of yesterday.  Today on Committee Stage we are endeavouring to deal with fairly complex issues while constantly looking at the clock.  The amount of time given to its discussion by the Government is an indication of its commitment and priorities in relation to the overall question of social welfare, tackling poverty and the growing under-class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we enter into a semi-academic <Col N="770" /> debate about arbitrary lines.  This prompts a comment I should like to make, which is that poverty and social welfare appear to be the most researched issues here; reports are written and produced on every aspect of both but very little follow-through action.  Like Deputy De Rossa, I give the Minister some credit in that some improvements have been effected.  But the question of priority rates under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is being reneged on in this Bill, in that the carpet is being pulled from beneath our poor, by the Minister issuing these circulars, the McCreevy dirty dozen, which have been rowed back somewhat.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of regulations that will be introduced in the House almost immediately.  In relation to the 12 issues raised by Deputy Stagg, now a Minister of State, I ask the Minister to spell out specifically how those cutbacks are being dealt with or revised by way of regulation, that he place on the record how he is drawing back on issues relating to, for example, maternity benefit, disability benefit, injury benefit, redundancy, part-time workers, deserted wives, equality, transitional payments, health board payments, disqualification and pay related benefits.  Will the Minister please deal specifically with these issues and inform the House how he is rowing back on the savage cutbacks effected last year objected to so strenuously by his partners in Government?</P>
    <P>I contend there is a dangerous complacency in relation to the issue of poverty. A frightening statistic is that there is £5.4 million alone owed in rents to Dublin Corporation.  While recognising that some people may place the payment of rent fairly low on their order of priorities that scale of debt owed to Dublin Corporation by some tenants clearly demonstrates the level of poverty.  What does the Minister do in response to such a problem?  By way of his circular to health boards with regard to exceptional needs he cuts the provisions under which such people can be helped.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Doyle, dealt with the question of widowers' pensions. <Col N="771" /> In replying to Second Stage debate the Minister said that widowers are accommodated to some extent by the lone parent's allowance.  He said also that a widower's pension would cost the State £50 million annually.  I find it difficult to relate that assertion to a reply to a parliamentary question given by his predecessor in this House last year in relation to the same problem when he said that, on the publication of the National Pensions Board's report, the matter would be dealt with and would cost £25 million in any one year.  We have been promised a report.  I know of people who have written to Ministers, now in Government, who have received letters of sympathy and condolence, when what these people want is justice, recognition of their plight and responsibilities.  This discriminatory position must be eliminated since there are at present 40,000 widowers nationwide.  In an age when we talk constantly about justice, clearly the position discriminates against them at present &mdash; 40,000 men and their dependants are directly affected.  I ask the Minister to give them some commitment, some sign of hope.</P>
    <P>We do not have time today to deal with the issue of the carer's allowance, the crock of gold promised to carers, the most committed people in our society who were dealt the coolest, confidence trick ever, a mere 4,000 people availing of that allowance because of its restrictive means-testing requirements.  I ask the Minister to row back on the very rigid income limits in regard to eligibility for that allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extraordinary to have to endeavour to debate so many important issues affecting so many of the less well off sectors of our community within such a short space of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully support the arguments advanced by Deputy Doyle in support of the position obtaining in respect of crews of fishing trawlers.  I ask the Minister to do something for them, if at all possible under the provisions of this Bill, by providing <Col N="772" /> a fisherman's stamp giving them full entitlement to PRSI benefits.</P>
    <P>The other point I should like the Minister to deal with in replying is the anomalous position obtaining in relation to islanders, some thousands of whom live off-shore in my constituency.  I remind the Minister that the cost of living on these islands is approximately 15 to 20 per cent higher than that for people living on the mainland.  Yet the Department of Social Welfare, in deciding on the levels of payment of social welfare, relates the increase each year to the national cost of living which does not relate at all to the reality on the ground for islanders who must have all their food and other commodities transported at substantial cost, on which the State imposes the further burden of VAT.  Therefore, the increases that the Minister claims are in line with the cost of living increases, or even slightly ahead, do not apply in the case of such islanders.  Social welfare recipients on certain designated offshore islands will have to be given a higher rate than that obtaining on the mainland.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Briefly, by way of reply, I should say in regard to the questions posed by Deputy Doyle in regard to mixed and intermittent pensions, indeed the overall problem of the pensions area, I introduced specific arrangements for the payment of <i>pro rata</i> pensions to people who had suffered gaps in their insurance records in 1988; that was one step with its attendant cost which overcame some of the problems.  Subsequently, in 1991, I addressed the position of people with mixed insurance records, that is the full and modified rates.  Regulations were introduced in November 1991 to deal with them, another portion of the problem.  It becomes more complex thereafter.  The National Pensions Board has been studying the overall question and I expect their report fairly soon, certainly by the <Col N="773" /> summer.  That major report will deal with many of the issues Members have raised in relation to pensions in the future which will, of course, have many attendant costs.  The whole question can be considered at that point.</P>
      <P>I have much sympathy with the points raised by Deputy Doyle in regard to widowers. Deputy Allen mentioned the cost of £50 million annually.  We must remember that there are deserted husbands and wives and, when one talks about equality, we must ensure there is equality in everything which makes the cost £50 million in total.  The European Community has been examining this aspect of equality for a long time.  The reason is its cost and implications right across the Community. Nobody is saying so but obviously that is the main reason.  We are pressing it to resolve that overall issue.  In the meantime, I have introduced the lone parent's allowance giving widowers an assistance-based pension applicable right across the board.  The other issue, an insurance fund, is of major importance.  Therefore, it is a matter for the contributors to the fund &mdash; employers, employees and the Government &mdash; to decide on the amount that they wish to contribute.  I accept that this is a problem and I will certainly consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy Molloy, the Deputy also raised the question of share fishermen. When I was Minister for the Marine I tried to sort out this issue but there were legal challenges, with the result that there was chaos.  In the meantime we required the self-employed to pay PRSI and this has proved very beneficial in that they are now covered for widow's and long term pensions.  Furthermore, I am now considering the question of whether special arrangements should be made for them.  In this regard the Deputy mentioned the question of a special stamp. However, there is always the danger that there would be a legal challenge and this is a matter we will have to look at.  I appreciate that it is important they have proper cover and when I was Minister for the Marine I pushed this issue.  I can assure the Deputy that we will pursue it <Col N="774" /> as a matter of urgency.  I also noted what the Deputy had to say about the islanders and perhaps I should visit them to see what the situation is and to see what can be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Both Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Allen referred to the general situation but we must remember that, between 1987 and 1993, the personal rate of long-term unemployment assistance had been increased by 56.6 per cent.  If we take inflation into account this still represents an increase of 30.05 per cent in real terms.  The respective increases for a married couple are 45 per cent and 20 per cent.  Indeed, the rates in relation to the short term personal rates of unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance are 63 per cent, 55 per cent and 53 per cent and in real terms 35 per cent, 28 per cent and 27 per cent. Therefore, as a result of the discussions that we have had in the House leading up to the budget and in the pre-budget forum and so on, we have been allocating money to fund increases in this area.</P>
      <P>I accept that we are very tight on time but this is not my fault as these increases have to be approved before the beginning of April.  Both the budget and the Estimates were late this year as a result of the election.  Yesterday I was asked if I would agree to a time schedule being drawn up by the Whips for today and I replied that I would agree to take the Bill in whatever way they wanted.</P>
      <P>Let me say in response to Deputy De Rossa that the way in which we are approaching the issue is the better one and I would not be in favour of inserting an arbitrary line.  The Deputy maintains that it is the only arbitrary line but there are others.</P>

      <P>This is a simple technical amendment which is being made on the advice of the parliamentary draftsman.  It replaces the words &ldquo;terms of vacations&rdquo; with &ldquo;term vacations&rdquo;.  I propose that this be accepted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>We dealt with this matter on Second Stage, but I would like to repeat my party's opposition to what I consider one of the most hare-brained decisions ever made by a Minister for Social Welfare in this House.  This decision was not fully thought out and I do not understand how the Minister intends to operate the so-called work schemes he proposes to introduce.  Basically, he is cutting unemployment assistance for third level students.  There will be no jobs available to them, except in cases of extreme hardship.  Will the Minister spell out how he proposes to administer this scheme?  At a time when we are attempting to simplify the social welfare code he will create more bureaucracy as a result of which students who apply for unemployment assistance, following their examinations in June, will have to be assessed, a process which will take two to four weeks.  If the assessment reveals they are experiencing hardship they will then be put on work schemes.  How does the Minister intend to implement those schemes?  The voluntary groups I have spoken to do not want any hand, act or part in this hare-brained idea because they do not have the resources to employ a student for three to six weeks.  The people operating the present schemes <Col N="779" /> which are supportive of the voluntary and community groups are anxious that they be extended for longer than the present 12-month period.  This scheme will be impossible to administer and will place a further burden on voluntary and community groups.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that local authorities and health boards will be asked to participate in the schemes.  This will create a huge administrative problem for public bodies.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to delete this section from the Bill.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister accusing our students of widespread fraud in this area and, if so, will he spell out where he believes such fraud is taking place?  If there is a low level of fraud &mdash; I would not even concede to that &mdash; the Minister should deal with it in ways other than cutting assistance to students, especially at a time when there are no outlets to Great Britain, the United States or the other countries to which students travelled in search of work in previous years.  There are no work outlets for students at home at present and if the Minister believes that 12,000 jobs are available he should make them available to the long term unemployed who are crying out for jobs and who are totally demoralised.  The Minister stated that 12,000 jobs will be available and gave a fictitious figure of £60 million for the scheme.  Later he said it would cost £90 million.  The true figure is between £6 million and £8 million.  This is money well spent because it assists students of middle and low income families, many of whom do not have the support of the higher education grants scheme which exists at present but has major restrictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a cost cutting exercise and is the second attack on students by a Fianna Fáil Government.  The ESF and maintenance grants were withdrawn last year and there is much evidence that this caused widespread hardship to students and their families.  This is the second attack on students in the past 12 months and it will create a greater divide among our population.  Access to education is a huge problem and this scheme will create <Col N="780" /> a greater problem for middle and low income families.</P>
    <P>This proposal is akin to one of the kicks of the Thatcherite Government in Great Britain in 1989.  It is regrettable that this proposal is being supported by the Labour Party who are usually very supportive of students.  It is a total undermining of the position of our students.  A survey by the National Union of Students in the United Kingdom following the 1989 cutbacks there to students states:</P>
    <P>There was a dramatic increase in levels of students debts.</P>
    <P>The economic recession also contributed to a worsening of the financial situation of students.  The survey revealed that even students who had found vacation employment during the summer did not earn enough to keep themselves throughout the vacation period.</P>
    <P>The recession also contributed to the high rate of non-payment of parental contributions.  During a time of increasing redundancies and rising unemployment it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain contributions.</P>
    <P>The number of applicants for hardship loans increased dramatically.</P>
    <P>The most serious conclusion which can be drawn from the survey is that the combined effects of the social welfare changes and the worsening recession will force present students to abandon their courses as well as acting as a disincentive to those wishing to enter or return to further or higher education. </P>
    <P>Many of the adverse effects experienced by students in Britain as a result of the last kick of a Thatcher Administration will be experienced here in the months and years ahead.  Students are under tremendous pressure at present because of forthcoming examinations.  The Minister is introducing this measure in a sneaky way, at a time when students cannot take to the streets in protest.  My party will be opposing this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is normal for the Mini-base <Col N="781" /> ster to introduce the section so, perhaps, I should do so at this stage.</P>
      <P>Section 14 provides that people in full-time education will not be entitled to unemployment assistance other than in such circumstances and subject to such conditions and for such periods as may be prescribed.  It also provides for a three-month disqualification period immediately following the completion of the leaving certificate examination at second level and at the same time extends the definition of &ldquo;qualified child&rdquo;.  For the purposes of those on social welfare, the child dependent allowance will continue even though the children may be over 18 years.  That extends the definition of &ldquo;qualified child&rdquo; to enable increases for dependent children over the age of 18 to be paid in respect of the three-month period of disqualification.</P>
      <P>It is evident that people in full-time education cannot be available for full-time employment.  They are in a position to take up short term work for the holiday period only.  I propose to make it possible for students to work with community, voluntary and other groups or organisations who could benefit enormously from their skills, enthusiasm and talents.</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen raised the position of British students.  It is true that one cannot claim unemployment assistance during a holiday period in Great Britain, Northern Ireland or in many countries throughout Europe.  This provision will bring us into line with other countries in Europe, but this scheme will provide an alternative for the students to whom Deputy Allen referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, will the Minister outline in detail the schemes he proposes to introduce, what organisations he has been in touch with and if they are willing to participate in the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that.  I propose to introduce a summer works scheme for students which would allow them do community work, voluntary work or work provided by public sector bodies and receive a wage approximating to their unemployment payments.  Therefore <Col N="782" /> they will get the same money for that period.  I envisage the scheme operating for a fixed period during the summer holidays, with the student working a certain number of hours or days in return for the payment he or she receives &mdash; students receive different levels of payment depending on their family circumstances.</P>
      <P>I intend to use the resources of the regional management structure of my Department to bring together people in full-time education looking for short term work with the various organisations operating in their areas who are in a position to provide them with such work. There are many short term employment opportunities available such as working with voluntary organisations, community groups, summer projects, local authorities and tourist related work.  Participants will be offered work for the number of hours or days necessary to earn the equivalent of their unemployment assistance entitlement and the wage costs involved will be met by my Department.</P>
      <P>I am sure many voluntary organisations working in the community would welcome the opportunity to utilise the skills and expertise of third level students for a number of weeks during the summer holiday period.  Similarly, local authorities, health boards and other public sector bodies could avail of that expertise for work that needs to be done in their respective areas.  This is a very innovative scheme which operates for the benefit of people in full-time education and of the many voluntary and community groups who provide a valuable service to their communities.  My Department is working on the details of the proposed new scheme at present and I will be consulting the organisations concerned in this regard.  The new scheme will be introduced in time for the 1993 summer vacation period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphasise that the purpose of this scheme is to provide for students a means of earning the same wage as they receive. Quite a number of students will work with voluntary organisations in any event and this scheme will provide for that. <Col N="783" /> Deputy Allen asked why we have not all the details of the scheme.  The answer is very simple.  If the Deputy wished me to follow the practice in other EC countries we would have no scheme.  I am introducing a scheme and that is an innovative move.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is attempting to cloak a fundamentally Thatcherite policy in pious, dishonest nonsense about community work.  The Minister's comments on community work and voluntary organisations would have some degree of credibility if it was not the case that voluntary organisations who are trying to get additional people on the existing social employment schemes were being turned down because of cutbacks enforced by the Minister's colleagues and that renewal applications of people on those schemes are being refused.  What we have here is a policy idea which incidentally was one of the first initiatives <Col N="787" /> taken by the Thatcher Government in 1979.  When they came to power one of their first moves was to stop unemployment assistance payments to third level students.  There might have been some case for this in the United Kingdom where the level of student grants bears some relationship to the real cost of staying in college but to introduce the measure here adds an additional financial burden to the existing difficulties in that the level of student support is not adequate to maintain students throughout the 30 weeks of the normal college year.</P>
      <P>The Minister has painted the same picture that is painted when similar proposals are introduced, that of the well-heeled student from the highly paid professional background opting out of home and taking a flat in order to effectively defraud the social welfare system by some legalistic loophole.  However, the reality is much different.  The sons and daughters of the well-heeled will not be affected by this proposal.  The people who will be affected are those on the margins, the people who are finding it increasingly difficult to put themselves through courses of third level studies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had fine words from the Minister for Education about promoting equity and greater educational opportunity.  Has the Minister any idea of the difficulties that families and young people face in order to get into third level college in the first place?  To even finish their second level courses they have run an obstacle course.  Sometimes people undergo peer pressure to opt out of school and there is a difficulty with regard to the loss of potential earnings by continuing in school or in third level education.  Families have to face difficulties in making up the balance between the cost of being in third level education and the inadequate student grants.  Now we have this proposal that says that if a person cannot get work, we will not give them unemployment assistance or that if people finish their courses they will be required to spend three months without any assistance. If one finishes one's leaving cert in <Col N="788" /> June 1993 it will effectively be November, between the waiting period and the three months, before one gets any pay.  Who is being penalised here?  The young people being penalised here are the young people who have the initiative to continue studying.  It is amazing that a 20 year old who does nothing will get unemployment assistance for the entire year, but a 20 year old who has the initiative to continue in college will be penalised by inadequate income during the school year and then by the loss of unemployment assistance during the holiday. These young people do not require any kind of stick to beat them into voluntary work&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Young people generally need no encouragement to participate in voluntary work.  The Minister is creating a two-tier system with regard to voluntary work for young people.  We will now have young people doing voluntary work because if they do not do it they will not get their unemployment assistance. Where does that leave the young people who wish to work on a voluntary basis as they have always done?  Where does it leave the voluntary organisations who may in other circumstances have opted to take somebody on a social employment scheme to do the same kind of work?  We are creating an impossible situation for the voluntary organisations and imposing a penalty on young people who decide to continue in courses of study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This proposal is not designed to impose some kind of penalty on the well heeled. It is a further obstacle to those people on the margins who find it difficult enough as it is to continue in third level education. This will make even worse our disgraceful statistics on participation rates in third level education which show <Col N="789" /> that the richer one is the more likely one is to participate in third level education. If one is in the middle bracket on a bus-driver's wage or on a postal worker's wage with a little bit of overtime, one does not qualify for the higher education grant at all.  This proposal on top of all that will ensure that the sons and daughters of those people will effectively be squeezed out of third level education under the grandiose pretence that this Minister wants more people doing voluntary work.</P>

      <P>This is a very interesting scheme which should be given an opportunity to work.  I congratulate Deputy Allen on his appointment as Fine Gael front bench spokesman on social welfare.  Deputy Allen will agree that this scheme will be interesting in Cork in relation to the summer recreational schemes organised by Ogradh Corcaigh which run for two months in the year. This scheme was started by VSI, Voluntary Students International, who came to Ireland with assistance from their own countries.  Deputy Allen knows as well as I how successful these schemes are, that they get financial assistance from Cork Corporation and that a great many local people are involved.  This scheme could benefit from the availability of students who no doubt will take up places on these schemes.</P>
      <P>This Minister has been very innovative. He has listened to suggestions and has removed anomalies and obstacles in the social welfare system during his term. The Minister's approach will help many communities.  People have been asking for some way whereby unemployed people could become more involved in local communities in, for instance, helping the elderly to paint their homes and so on.  There is potential here for involving people in those areas under the auspices of the local community associations.  We have repeatedly paid tribute to our many voluntary agencies for their contribution to society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Gilmore about an overlap in this area.  We will always have people who will give a contribution <Col N="790" /> on a voluntary basis.  This scheme will not conflict with their continued involvement.  We should give this scheme an opportunity.  It has the potential to play a part and give many students an opportunity to work in their communities in the summer months.  I would like the Minister's assurance that the less well off in our community who are attending third level institutions will have an opportunity to participate in these schemes and will, if possible, be given priority in them.  The Minister is to be complimented on his initiative in bringing this scheme forward.  I see great potential for it in my locality.</P>

      <P>I spoke at length yesterday on my party's opposition to this section.  We do not oppose the notion of integrating the voluntary sector and the community development sector as an anti-poverty strategy, and linking that with the unemployed.  That is a good idea but it must be voluntary.  The way the Minister has introduced this notion into the House has diminished the notion.  It is introduced in a negative way on the coat tails of an arbitrary and discriminatory provision which in a blanket way excludes all students from welfare entitlements.  The Minister will live to regret this provision in what is otherwise quite a good Bill.  I do not know how any Labour Party Deputy worth his or her salt can defend this provision, and I did not hear any of them defending it.</P>

      <P>They are not here at the moment, but they had every opportunity yesterday to defend it.  This goes to the very heart of the welfare system. The principle of adequacy and meeting a demand based on need has been one of the fundamental principles upheld by the Labour Party since its formation.  This is the beginning of the end for the Labour Party.  If they can defend this measure they are setting the pace for the loss of the next election.  They will not survive the next election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="791" /> The Minister has a good reputation in relation to social welfare but he will be remembered as the Minister who introduced compulsory workfare.  The concept of voluntary workfare and integrating the needs of the community and voluntary work with the needs of the unemployed is a good idea.  If the Minister brought the scheme back to this House by way of a well thought out comprehensive strategy my party would support it but it would have to be on a voluntary basis rather than students being forced to comply with such a scheme.  In relation to leaving certificate students, it will introduce discrimination on the basis of higher academic achievement.  Students will be told that if they stay in school until they are 18 years of age and do their leaving certificate they will be disadvantaged compared with people who do not remain at school until they were 18.  It is an arbitrary and discriminatory scheme. Students are a very easy target.  The Minister is probably reckoning that students have a very short memory and by the time of the next election&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Obviously the Minister is on a very sticky wicket on this.  The Minister is preventing students from <Col N="792" /> receiving social welfare payments and to soften the blow he has introduced a knee jerk reaction that he will give them all jobs.  This scheme has not been thought through.  If he was really serious about this scheme he could have consulted a whole range of community development groups and student representatives, a very organised and local group of people. There was no consultation with students or with the Department of Education.  I find it difficult to believe that the Department of Education, under a Labour Minister, could have agreed to this scheme. How can the Minister for Education justify this, given her commitment to students?  I wonder whether the unions have been consulted in relation to this scheme.  The SES schemes throughout the country are held up because of disagreements with unions.  Has the Minister considered public liability insurance for students working on the scheme?  The whole scheme is an administrative nightmare. It will cost far more to implement this work scheme than the Minister is hoping to save.  He said it costs £8 million each summer to pay students but he had no figures in relation to alleged fraud.  He has not presented a <i>prima facie</i> case to this House to show that the system is being abused by students.  If the Minister had come forward with a comprehensive and well structured scheme we would have supported it.  What he has introduced is a half-baked scheme which does not wash with anybody whereby a number of students will be excluded.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party will live to regret that they have been part of this proposal. The first time I ever met a Labour Deputy &mdash; Deputy Quinn &mdash; was at a students union rally outside the House.  The Labour Party have always supported students and I just cannot believe what they are doing to themselves.  I know one has to compromise in Government but to let this scheme through is the end of the Labour Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief as I recognise that other people wish to speak. Without being too repetitive I wish to support what has been said by my colleagues on the Opposition benches.  I wonder whether the Social Welfare Bill, 1993, which is an attack on the student population, is actually a forerunner to a work-for-dole programme which we may witness in 1994.  Are we trying out on the student population in the summer of 1993 something which the Department may wish to spread throughout the social welfare system in the coming years?  This scheme is ill-thought out.  In his contribution on Second Stage when the Minister said he was bringing this country into line with the system in operation in continental Europe he was not comparing like with like.  In continental Europe there is a reasonably adequate level of grant-aid for third level education but, more importantly, those students in Europe who wish to work in their own country have a much better chance of finding a job than students in this country where we have over twice the EC rate of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that the vast majority of the student population wish to work and only those who are unable to find work claim social welfare.  It is unfair to paint the picture, as this proposal does, that the majority of students are claiming dole during the summer months in an almost fraudulent fashion.  That is incorrect. In most cases people who want work in this country during the summer months cannot find it.  We will further penalise people who are not well off.  Those claiming unemployment assistance are means-tested and the weekly value of their annual student maintenance fee is taken into account.  Let us be blunt about it, this is simply an attack on a weak section of the community.  Students from the better-off sections of society will not be disadvantaged by this proposal &mdash; the majority of those people find work here or abroad.  Those who will be affected are those who can least afford this attack. As Deputy Allen has said, if 12,000 jobs are available those jobs should be given <Col N="794" /> to the thousands of long term unemployed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the existing arrangements where one of a couple is getting unemployment assistance and the other spouse or partner is in receipt of a social insurance payment or old age pension, the couple are limited to the appropriate married rate of payment. The limitation is also applied where both are in receipt of unemployment assistance. Section 15 extends these provisions to the pre-retirement allowance scheme. The legislative provisions for the pre-retirement allowance scheme require that any long term payment being received by the spouse or partner of a claimant for pre-retirement allowance be assessed against the claimant as means.</P>
      <P>This is not done in practice because of the harsh effect on claimants.  It would leave the claimant with less than the rate of the adult dependant allowance. Instead the provisions limiting the entitlement of couples in the unemployment assistance scheme are applied, since these are more favourable to the claimant.  Section 15 is designed to bring the legislative provisions into line with this administrative practice.</P>

      <P>This section provides for an increase in the ceiling up to which PRSI contributions are payable by employees and employers, with effect from 6 April 1993.  Paragraph (a) of subsection (1) increases the ceiling in the case of contributions payable by employers to £21,300, while paragraph (b) increases the ceiling in the case of contributions payable by employees to £20,000.</P>
      <P>These are the normal increases which take place each year to keep the levels in line with changes in wages generally. They take into account inflation and they keep the fund in a position to meet the requirements placed on it during the year.</P>

      <P>This is a tax on jobs at a time when 300,000 people are unemployed and the Government are endeavouring to get more people back to work by encouraging job creation.  This tax on jobs is well above the rate of inflation and I am opposing the imposition of a further tax on job creation.  It is ill advised and it underlines the Government's hypocrisy on the jobs question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>There is need for a detailed debate on the effect of PRSI on employment and on the contribution made by the working population to taxation in general.  I realise that PRSI is not regarded as taxation.  It has been argued in one of the NESC reports that PRSI should be evaluated as taxation although not taken into the tax net.  I am taken by the notion that rather than lifting the ceiling each year, the ceiling should be removed entirely and that all income should be subject to PRSI whether that income is derived from salaried employment, income from shares etc.  That would open up a series of options, for instance, the option of reducing the rate across the board.  There would also be an option to provide for the current £60 exemption limit to be available to all concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not have the current situation whereby a person who earns £59.99 does not pay PRSI and the person who earns £60.01 pays PRSI on the whole <Col N="800" /> £60 which is regressive.  I am not in any way decrying the advance that the £60 exemption is for low paid workers.  I do not want the Minister to get annoyed and feel that we are somehow denying his good works.  I am not in any way doing that, but I do think it is an area that requires comprehensive attention; it needs to be looked at in the context of the general taxation code and indeed the earlier debate on the effect that incomes have on the levels of poverty and on how we judge poverty.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that PRSI does create poverty traps.  It is something that needs to be addressed, not in the long distant future but as a matter of some priority if we are to seriously address the whole question of equity in the system of social insurance.</P>
    <P>The final point I want to make is that it is essential that we retain a social insurance system and that we do not allow it to be chipped away by various bits and pieces of changes here and there. One of my main concerns with the 1992 Bill was that it seemed to be undermining the whole concept of the social insurance system whereby people were paying for benefits and, having paid for them, the Minister would then come in with a Social Welfare Bill and wipe out some of those benefits or, in some cases, all those benefits. As far as I know, the only pay related benefit now payable is unemployment benefit.  The benefits are being chipped away and we need to be careful about that.  I ask the Minister, briefly on this occasion, to address the general issue of PRSI and perhaps at a later stage he could give us the opportunity of debating it at more length.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>To follow from the point being made by Deputy De Rossa, is PRSI a social insurance scheme or a tax?  Many people wonder because there has been a tendency over the last while to change the conditions of what is essentially a contract between the people who pay PRSI and the Department of Social Welfare to cover unemployment, illness or similar contingencies.  There has been a tendency to whittle away entitlements <Col N="801" /> under the PRSI scheme and the various measures introduced last year were an example.  There is a feeling of disquiet among those people who willingly pay PRSI as social insurance that it is becoming more of a tax on income.  If it is a tax on income, let us call it a tax on income.</P>
      <P>It is unfair that the various conditions of eligibility for social insurance payments are being gradually whittled away. For example, a woman telephoned me yesterday saying that she had taken a career break last year in order to look after her child with whom she was having particular difficulties.  She was a public servant and had paid PRSI contributions for 14 years.  When she inquired about her maternity rights she found that she was no longer covered for maternity benefit this coming November because of the changes introduced last year in the general maternity scheme.  Because she did not have sufficient contributions arising from the career break she was no longer entitled to maternity benefit although she had paid for 14 years into a system.  She had no idea that this was the case, she was horrified and said that this must be relevant to many women.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, there is a feeling of concern among the public, people who are willing to pay PRSI, as to whether it is a social insurance scheme.  It is not good enough that benefits will be whittled away in dribs and drabs and conditions changed unilaterally by the Government. Compare it with car insurance.  It is very unlikely that unilateral changes in the conditions would be introduced and if they were the policyholder would have a right in contract.  If the terms are being changed all the time that diminishes the whole system.  There is a need for a general debate on the PRSI system.</P>

      <P>I am a little surprised to hear the Fine Gael spokesperson attack the Minister in regard to the protection of the pay related social insurance fund. The Minister is actually giving the protection that is necessary.  Deputy De Rossa alluded to that as well; we do not want the benefits that would accrue from such a fund to be eroded in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="802" /> We have all been made very forcibly aware of regulations made by the previous Minister for Social Welfare who debarred a number of people who, hitherto, benefited under this type of fund.  I want to refer to the Minister's comments in relation to the regulations relating to disability benefit where 13 PRSI contributions were required.  The Minister made other changes in relation to dental and optical benefit so that 140,000 people can now avail of this benefit. We should recognise that various benefits have been restored.  There is only so much the Minister can do.  Certain language was used in relation to the regulations made by the previous Minister. The present Minister has a proven record in relation to social welfare but we cannot expect him to alter these regulations bringing these benefits to a huge number of people and also protect the fund.  It is important to recognise the necessity of protecting this social insurance fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy De Rossa's remarks.  We certainly need to protect our social insurance schemes. However, we must ask ourselves if the scheme adds to the problem rather than solving it.  At present PRSI is seen by most people as simply another tax on labour.  At a time when unemployment is at record levels we must be careful about adding further to the cost of job creation.  We are dealing with sections 16 and 17, but section 18, which deals with the PRSI exemption scheme, is probably nullified by the increases brought about under sections 16 and 17.  Admittedly this is basically a continuation of what we have done heretofore.  It continues to keep the cost of labour provision at an all time high.  The cost of employment here is much too great; taxation is much too high and we are creating a vicious circle of high taxation, high unemployment, high PRSI rates, etc.  When will we break this circle?  We have to keep a social insurance scheme in place for the tens of thousands of people who are dependent on it but perhaps we are attacking the problem from the wrong end of the spectrum.  It would be a better <Col N="803" /> approach if we tried to get our costs down and encouraged job creation.  Sadly, however, the penal rates of both PRSI and PAYE make it almost impossible for most employers to take on extra employees.  The good work being done through schemes such as the PRSI exemption scheme will amount to very little because the overall cost of labour, inclusive of taxes and PRSI, is much too high.  Until that central problem is addressed problems of unemployment and high taxes and other difficulties will continue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa said that this is an issue deserving of wide debate. The Deputy put forward some of his own views and suggested that all income should be subject to PRSI contributions. Various other measures to help reduce the burden on the individual employee or employer, or on the Government at the end of the day, could be suggested. That is, of course, a wider debate and a very important debate.  It is important that the issue be debated and agreed.</P>
      <P>I have felt for a long time that the social insurance fund is a particularly important form of security for the worker.  Anyone who does not recognise that would soon change his or her mind after talking to a widow whose late husband was not involved in the PRSI system or did not have sufficient contributions, meaning that the widow does not qualify for a contributory widow's pension.  Of course, mention was made earlier in the debate about the lack of help for widowers, and that is the other side of the coin.  In the case of a widow who is not eligible for a contributory widow's pension there is the non-contributory pension scheme, which is subject to means testing.  The social insurance fund has been very much a political issue over the years and it is an issue on which I hold a very strong personal view.  I am committed to the social insurance fund.  I believe in the fund very strongly and I am a strong supporter of it.  I believe in the fund's importance for pensioners, invalids, widows and all its other beneficiaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="804" /> I do not object to suggestions for enhancing or improving the fund, so long as the intention behind such suggestions is not to undermine the fund.  Very often when suggestions are made to improve the fund I am reminded of the wolf in sheep's clothing &mdash; people might say that there should be a different method for doing one thing or another but usually they really mean that beneficiaries should be means tested.  The adoption of means testing for beneficiaries would be particularly bad for workers.  I have stood by the fund very strongly and I contend that it must be protected and it must be assured.</P>
    <P>The Irish rate for employers compares very favourably with those of the rest of Europe.  Only one other European state, the United Kingdom, has a lower rate for employers.  The Irish rate of 12.2 per cent compares with the United Kingdom rate of 10 per cent, but the United Kingdom rate is taken from total income, which means that in fact more money is taken.</P>
    <P>I shall not take issue with Deputy O'Donnell, who is new to the House, but Progressive Democrats Deputies have in the past argued strongly in favour of doing away with the scheme, which they say is a tax.  One could say that everything one has to pay is a tax of some sort. Arguments in favour of the abolition of the scheme are usually put forward by those who have not suffered a bereavement or an occupational injury and have not needed assistance from the fund.</P>
    <P>It has to be recognised that both employers and younger people in work have to be pushed to make contributions. The Government is all for employers and gives them every support, they provide employment and, generally speaking, they are excellent, but the Government has to make a push to ensure that employees have full, proper and reasonable protection.  Of course, that is a requirement encountered in the Community as a whole.  The EC has brought in various directives to ensure that measures of this kind are complied with.</P>
    <P>It is particularly important to give an assurance that the fund is there now and will be maintained.  Ideas about ways in <Col N="805" /> which the fund could be better used are fine but at this stage all we are doing is keeping in line with normal changes, which are not inflationary changes but are changes and take into consideration payments such as overtime payments. The changes being made will not bring the resources of the fund up to the level necessary to meet the expenditure that will fall on it this year; the Government has to make up the difference and will do so.</P>
    <P>In general, I have been happy with the comments made about the fund in this debate.  It will be possible to discuss the exemption scheme at a later stage.  The arrangement is for a short term initial exemption.  Deputy De Rossa mentioned the £60 exemption limit.  It would obviously be preferable to have that exemption across the board; once again the question of cost comes into the equation in that the exemption would apply to everyone involved.  Those are issues that should be taken into consideration and further consideration will have to be given them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the fund there are 92,600 old age contributory pensions and 76,700 retirement pensions, giving a total number of beneficiaries in the old age and retirement area of just under 295,000. Those people are not in a position to earn any more and they have a pension from the fund as a solid foundation.  There are 190,000 people depending on the fund for disability and invalidity pensions.  It is the need to take advantage of disability and invalidity pensions that cannot be predicted.  Someone who is now saying that the fund represents just another tax might in six months or a year be thankful that the fund was not abolished.  The fund <Col N="806" /> has 99,000 contributory widow's pensions. Those in receipt of deserted wife's benefit amount to 34,000.  The total number dependent on the fund for unemployment benefit is 161,000.  At present 645,000 people depend on the social insurance fund.  The Government has an obligation to ensure that those people are looked after.  That is what is being done at this stage.  The Government is keeping the fund in line and is making sure that its resources do not fall behind.</P>

      <P>I should like to add to the comments I made earlier.  In relation to the increase in contributions, it appears that people will be paying more and getting less.  In the area of qualifying conditions for treatments, would the Minister confirm that 12,000 claims are affected by changes recently brought about by his predecessor?  Would he also confirm that £80 million to £90 million will be taken out of the system as a result of the proposals to tax short term benefits? I ask the Minister to comment on the 1991 report of the ESRI, which shows that the yield from the taxation of short term social welfare payments, based on 1987 figures, should amount to about £88 million.  It is suggested that the figure of £88 million is a conservative estimate of the likely revenue return.  Would the Minister therefore agree that he is asking more and more from workers and is giving less and less?  How does the Minister reconcile the plan to redistribute the moneys that will be taken from recipients as a result of the decision made in recent weeks to tax the disability benefit and the announcement made by the Minister on the same day that he plans in the near future to introduce taxation on unemployment benefit?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is asking for more from workers and giving less.  Will he agree that it is time to set up a national advisory group on social welfare?  At present the Minister may make decisions by way of regulations and circulars which are not brought to the attention of the Members or laid before the House.  This is most unsatisfactory because the goal posts are being changed almost daily, people do not know where they stand. Even new spokespersons in the House are confused about regulations and circulars which are never brought to their attention.  A national advisory group could lay down a firm policy and guidelines for those affected.  Such a group could also advise on policy in regard to social welfare and taxation.</P>

      <P>There is more opportunity than ever to receive information from the Department.  Family centres and voluntary organisations are able to impart information to people, particularly to those on social welfare.  There is widespread information available and all Members regularly receive circulars detailing changes in benefits and so on. It is important to say that, particularly in the light of Deputy Allen's contribution. It is well known that information from the Department of Social Welfare is widely available and it would be very wrong to give any other impression.  I wish to pay tribute to the Minister and his officials over the past five or six years for their efforts to ensure that people know their entitlements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of us may well have that information but the queues at my <Col N="808" /> clinic every week &mdash; and at those of Deputy Wallace and other Members &mdash; asking for information and expressing amazement and puzzlement at decisions shows that there is a serious lack of communication between the Department and the public.  I give credit to the Minister for making improvements in the system but we should not be complacent.  I tabled a question today about people's entitlement under the equality Act.  Many of them have to go to solicitors to get their rights and, indeed, solicitors advertise their services on television in regard to rights under the Social Welfare Acts. That is not acceptable.  The lines of communication are most unsatisfactory and I ask the Minister to react specifically in this regard.  He did not do so in relation to points made on Second Stage regarding the many thousands of people who are still trying to ascertain their entitlements. I have heard that when people go to solicitors to find out their entitlements under the equality Act they are asked for 10 per cent of whatever sum is awarded to them by the Department.  That is an outrageous, stupid, unfair and unjust situation and the Minister has a responsibility to rectify it.  The complacency exhibited by him today is unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Equal treatment was supposed to have been implemented in December 1984 when Deputy Allen's party was in Government.  However, the measure was not introduced then, perhaps it was regarded as too expensive and the fact that they did not introduce it has created enormous complications and legal challenges.  Eventually, the measure was introduced in two parts, in May and December 1986.  Alleviating payments were also brought in for a period of one year in 1986.  I took office in the latter part of 1987 and I considered that the alleviating payments could not be phased out instantly.  I argued with my Government to have those payments phased out over a period.  Members were pleased with my decision.  However, certain organisations and individuals felt that they wanted to challenge what had happened in the period between 1984 and <Col N="809" /> 1986, when we were not in Government. That is where all the trouble stems from.</P>
      <P>Many cases were heard in this regard and there were varying decisions.  As a result people made claims which were turned down here, in some instances by our courts on the grounds that it would result in double enrichment, what is called &ldquo;unjust enrichment&rdquo;, which meant a person being paid twice for a dependent spouse.  It did not seem to make sense because it was an illegal use of the directive at the time which led to a much wider situation and vastly increased charges on the taxpayer here.  It meant that families would be paid twice.  In other words, where the husband had been paid for his wife as a dependant she is entitled to be paid for him as a dependant even though he was at work.  That certainly baffled the courts and legal people generally. Certainly, it baffled the taxpayer, the ordinary man in the street.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Deputies should not come along and say this is a simple situation, we should just write a cheque and sort it all out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Information has been broadcast and made available to everybody. Certain people went to solicitors and took cases to go beyond what was thought to be the solution.  Some cases, somewhat surprising perhaps, succeeded. That was in respect of the case that was judged to be unjust enrichment here but was not regarded as such in Europe.  The taxpayer here was told that, as a penalty for what happened between 1984 and 1986, the same family had to be paid twice; that happened.  At the end of the day it is the Minister for Finance who must provide the money and the only place from where he can get the money is from the taxes about which we all complain. <Col N="810" /> That money was provided last year, is being provided this year and will be next year.  Anybody who is entitled to any amount will be paid.</P>
      <P>There are solicitors who contend that as they brought so many cases to the courts claimants should engage them and they will get the money for them.  Everybody is free to do as they wish.  This is a classical example of people engaging solicitors to fight different aspects and angles of their cases.  The Department pays out the money as quickly as possible and I reiterate that it will be paid out between this year and next year.  Therefore, nobody need worry about not getting their money, their entitlement, as they might regard it.  They will receive their money and there is no question about that.</P>
      <P>What has happened recently &mdash; some members have told me about this &mdash; is that when a person receives a sum of money another person on the same road asks: why did I not get mine?  Obviously, the person who received the money was involved in one legal case taken.  The other people will get their money.  It may be the subject of a parliamentary question later but everybody will get their money.  I ask Members, as public representatives, to cool it; the money will be paid to everybody involved, spread over last year, this year and next year.  The moneys promised last year were paid and money has been allocated in the budget this year with the final portion to be paid next year.  It was an unfortunate, sorry development.  Some people will use what most practical people would regard as very theoretical legal arguments to carry this matter somewhat further.  Members must decide whether they want to fan that flame, encourage and stimulate it, thereby encourging the legal people to engage in such exercises.  That is their option.  The reality is that the Department of Social Welfare are paying in accordance with the decisions taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

      <P>I welcome the Minister's latest statement that people do not have to engage solicitors to obtain their legal rights under the Acts, that everybody will be paid their due entitlement.  Nonetheless, the Minister should designate officials in our large towns and cities to give people information on their entitlements and legal rights rather than forcing them into engaging solicitors to obtain their entitlements. Irrespective of the historic position as to who is right or wrong, a serious position obtains.  However, I welcome the Minister's attempt to clarify it.  The Minister should follow up his statement with adequate lines of communication, in large towns and cities, so that people will know and understand the position and their legal rights.</P>

      <P>In a short debate it is unfortunate that we have been diverted down this road.  The Minister seemed to imply that social welfare recipients were in some way to be more criticised for pursuing their legal rights.  Whatever is in the law is their legal entitlement.  If this House chooses to change the law, so be it but, so long as the law remains as drafted, any citizen who can benefit therefrom is entitled so to do.

There appears to be a lower level of consideration given to married women in this case.  If that amount of money was owed to any other group of people, there would be blue murder about it.  There appears to be a sort of acceptance that it is all right to ask married women, who are legally entitled to this payment, to hold on, be complacent, sit tight, implying that in some way they do not have the same right as men.  If this money was owed to men in similar circumstances there would be blue murder about it.</P>

      <P>In regard to what the Department has done, the Department identified 111,000 married women from departmental records; that was some task.  More than 50 people have been working on this full-time. That work will continue for some time.  Resources have been made available and the issue is being tackled.  As I said, people have been identified from the records.  A circular was issued to each of these people &mdash; one cannot get any closer to them than that.

The remainder is due to be paid this year and next year.  We have to ask people where they were and what they were doing and for their RSI number as this money cannot be paid without first establishing the facts.  In addition, a substantial number of cases is involved.  As I said, it is an ongoing process and people can be assured that they will receive their payment.  The budget stated what would be done this year and the figures were included.  We must make it clear that the amounts determined by the courts are being used as the basis for the settlements made.</P>

      <P>Section 22 provides that people found to be fraudulently claiming a social welfare payment may be disqualified from receiving any social welfare payment other than child benefit for a period of up to nine weeks.  This provision will not prevent the person concerned from claiming supplementary welfare allowance in respect of dependants.</P>

      <P>This is an extraordinary and extremely harsh measure. It seeks to avoid the necessity for the Department of Social Welfare to prove fraud by taking people to court and having a case proven or disproven.  It would be interesting to know &mdash; I do not have the figures &mdash; how many cases of fraud have been taken by the Department and how many have been successful. I strongly argue that this is tantamount to the Department of Social Welfare taking on itself the rights of judge and jury.</P>
      <P>No provision is made for the right of appeal nor does the Bill make any allowance for the fact that the Department of Social Welfare makes mistakes.  A number of constituents of mine had payments deducted incorrectly on the basis of what is euphemistically called an &ldquo;overpayment&rdquo;.  It was subsequently found that the Department was wrong to reclaim this money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A later section also impinges on the rights of the social welfare recipients. Where a person is overpaid the Department of Social Welfare claims the right to reclaim the overpayment regardless of the legal rights of the individual.  As I understand it, the legal position is that where the Department overpays a recipient of social welfare where the <Col N="816" /> person can show that it was not his fault and he had taken reasonable steps to ensure that there would be no overpayment &mdash; the Department is not entitled to reclaim the overpayment.</P>
    <P>In the course of events for someone like myself it would be no great pain &mdash; if I am overpaid in my monthly salary &mdash; to repay the overpayment over a period of 12 months but for a person on social welfare, say, on an income of £50-£60 a week or £120-£130 for a couple with a child and with normal outgoings it would be a severe imposition to repay such an amount.  In many, but not all cases, the amount demanded can be quite steep.  I am aware of cases where social welfare officers have been generous and sympathetic. I am not attacking the Department of Social Welfare or the welfare officers of the Department but I am objecting to the fact that the Department and the Minister are taking to themselves rights in relation to social welfare recipients which they are not entitled.  They are narrowing the range of rights of poor people.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about section 22 as it automatically deprives a person of his benefit for up to nine weeks and, as I read it, for his dependants as well.  It is also stated that he will be deprived of the right to receive supplementary welfare allowance for himself but not for an adult dependant and, presumably, his child dependants.</P>
    <P>At present I am dealing with the case of a man who has been refused unemployment benefit for a particular reason under the current regime and who has also been refused supplementary welfare allowance by the community welfare officer.  In addition he has been refused a supplementary welfare allowance for his spouse and children.  This provision states that it may not be refused but this does not mean that it will not be refused in the case of dependants.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying that no one is advocating fraud but, in tackling the problem of fraud, we must bear in mind that all citizens must be treated alike, regardless of their status.  I appeal to the Minister to withdraw this section and <Col N="817" /> examine it again to see if he can find a better way of dealing with the problem.</P>

      <P>There was a plunder of the amendments today; I do not think anything survived.  I also had amendments down to section 22 as there are various aspects of it that need clarification. I think there is a conflict between this section and section 204 (4) of the Principal Act, particularly in relation to the supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
      <P>This section sets out the penalties for people found to be fraudulently claiming welfare benefits.  It gives the deciding officer the power to disqualify for up to nine weeks a person found to be fraudulently claiming a social welfare payment. This is quite a severe penalty, given that people who are signing on are generally in need.  I am concerned because there appears to be scant regard for due process. Will the Minister clarify whether a person can be penalised on the word of a deciding officer?  If that is the case, I think there is scant regard for the due process and it is dubious from that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No party is more in favour of tackling abuses of the system than my party and I welcome any efforts by the Department to tackle them.  In tackling abuse, however, we have to be very careful that we do not go overboard and in the process infringe civil liberties.  More importantly, this section seeks to stretch the hand of the deciding officer in the Department of Social Welfare into the territory of the health boards who have responsibility for administering the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Under section 204 (4) of the Principal Act any assessment or decision in relation <Col N="818" /> to supplementary welfare lies solely at the discretion of the chief executive officer of the health board.  This section seems to introduce a conflict between the decision of the deciding officer to disqualify a person from receiving benefit for nine weeks and the discretionary payment of a supplementary welfare allowance by the chief executive officer of the health board to meet the person's needs. The supplementary welfare allowance system is the final safety net.  I think we have to leave it to the discretion of the chief executive officer whether to pay that allowance.  I do not think it is appropriate that the deciding officer can reach into the health board's responsibility, as given in the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will agree that this section seems to introduce a conflict as between the power of a deciding officer in the Department of Social Welfare and the chief executive officer of the health board.</P>
    <P>On the question of disallowing supplementary welfare allowance, it seems to me that a single man without adult or child dependants would get absolutely nothing if the provisions of this section applied.  The penalty should fit the offence and it would be better to send the man to jail, where at least he would be fed, than to impose this penalty.  Are we saying to a single man found guilty of this offence on the word of the deciding officer, which is dubious in its own right: &ldquo;You are not going to get a penny from the Irish social welfare system for nine weeks&rdquo;.  I think that is very harsh and in some circumstances it would mean that a single person without dependants could be totally destitute.  Will the Minister clarify the situation because I believe there is a conflict?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled an amendment to the section to repeal the means testing of deserted wife's benefit.  I know we are running out of time and what I have to say will be a duplication of what I intend to say on amendment No. 40.  However, the supplementary welfare regime is so restrictive as a result of the interpretation of circulars by community welfare <Col N="819" /> officers that people are being denied unemployment assistance on the grounds of inadequate information.  In one case that has been brought to my attention, a married man with three children has been asked to provide his father's bank book but because his father refuses to do so, his son is being denied unemployment assistance.  As a result of this he is also being denied supplementary welfare allowance.  He is now destitute, although the circumstances are outside his control. That is happening in the Southern Health Board area.</P>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance is a scheme of last resort for those who are almost destitute and would be destitute without the scheme being in operation. The new restrictions being proposed by the Minister will mean that people will have no payments whatsoever and will go hungry.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment I tabled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>In my contribution yesterday I referred specifically to fraud. I was talking of those who commit fraud and as a result deprive others in the community of much needed financial assistance. We cannot close our eyes to the fraud that is taking place but at the same time we must ensure that in implementing the provisions of this section we are not defeating the purpose for which it is being inserted.  I am dealing with a case at present where an overpayment in excess of £6,000 was made because the individual was working and claiming at the same time.  I have very little sympathy for that individual because I feel he is depriving those in need of financial assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies have raised points about the sensitivity of the system but in my dealings in relation to overpayments, as Deputy De Rossa mentioned, I have always found the staff very helpful in arranging refunds to the Department. When we talk about fraud we would want to clearly define that we are talking about people who have deliberately abused the system.  This is going on and we all know that it is happening.  It is not easy to <Col N="820" /> detect people commiting fraud but when they are detected we must have a deterrent. We have to decide whether the Minister's proposal is the proper way to deal with the problem or if it is too severe. We must have deterrents.  Repeatedly we are told that so and so is in receipt of social welfare and working at the same time.  I am not suggesting that a man who is endeavouring to rear his family should not go out and earn a few bob but we know there are well-heeled people in the community who are abusing the system and we must endeavour to stop that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In my contribution I asked the Minister to elucidate on a point raised by Deputy O'Donnell.  Section 204 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, states specifically that it is the function of a chief executive officer of a health board to determine entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance.  Any member of a health board will be aware that chief executive officers, by and large, have derogated their responsibility to the superintendents of community care.  Is there a contradiction between the role of the superintendent of community care, the chief executive officer and the deciding officer of the Department of Social Welfare?  Section 22 states that where people are found defrauding the system they will not be entitled to supplementary welfare benefit for a nine week period except where an adult or child dependant is involved.  Am I correct in stating that a deciding officer of the Department of Social Welfare may be usurping the powers conferred on the chief executive officer of a health board?  Is this legal under the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981?  For example, what would happen if the chief executive officer of a health board legitimately stated that in his or her view an exceptional circumstance had arisen and that he or she had the power to authorise a supplementary welfare payment to a person in this category?  The chief executive officer would certainly contend that he <Col N="821" /> or she has every right to do so.  Like Deputy O'Donnell, I would cite the case of a single person who will receive no payment for nine weeks if he or she is found guilty of fraud.  If we were to apply the full rigours of the law and impose a prison sentence on a person found defrauding the system, that person would be fed and would receive an allowance. Therefore, this provision seems particularly harsh.  In view of the circumstances and contradictions in this section, I would like the Minister to clarify the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Deputy O'Keeffe's point, technically there is no conflict because section 200 of Chapter 6 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981 states:</P>
      <P>Subject to this Chapter, every person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet his needs and the needs of any adult or child dependant of his shall be entitled to supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
      <P>In this regard there is not a technical conflict, but there is a practical difficulty. In effect, we are trying to reduce the burden on the Department to take the person to court in every case.  Where there is a clear case of fraud, the Department would not have to take the person to court.  If a person is taken to court and found guilty of fraud, these provisions will apply.  They also apply in other situations, but when the person is not taken to court the provisions do not apply.  The provision we are dealing with is out of line with the other provisions.  Deputies may say that the other provisions are harsh, but this provision is out of line and we are trying to make it consistent with the other provisions.  It would mean that we would not have to take people to court when it has been established that fraud has taken place.</P>

      <P>Once the Minister signs regulations they are placed on the Order Paper and laid on the table of the House. I have just signed these regulations and they will be before the House shortly. There was a great argument about this matter earlier, but I signed the regulations today and the Deputy will have a copy of them tomorrow.  I can do no better than that.  Money was made available in the budget for this purpose and the whole system is back onstream.</P>

    <P>This measure affects all long term unemployed people.  Whether they are men or women makes no difference; the measure applies equally in both cases. These people previously would have to have had 13 paid contributions in the previous tax year.  Immediately 140,000 long term unemployed people will be brought back into the system and will be entitled to disability benefit.  People on pre-retirement allowance, those who are out of the workforce by option, will also be brought back into the system.  Some <Col N="827" /> of the people who failed to qualify would have been on unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit and supplementary welfare allowance.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>the number of women affected by the abolition of the general maternity benefits scheme; and, the steps, if any, he proposes to take to ensure that women have adequate financial support during the maternity period.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the Social Welfare Act, 1992, the Department of Social Welfare operated two maternity schemes. The scheme for women in employment covered women who qualified for leave from work under the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Acts, 1981 and 1991.  The general maternity scheme catered for women workers who did not so qualify, along with women claiming unemployment benefit or disability benefit who satisfied the relevant contribution conditions.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1992, amalgamated the maternity schemes, making maternity benefit available for the first time to women in employments not covered by the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Acts, 1981 and 1991, and ensuring that all women in employment have access to maternity benefit payments. Most women who previously qualified for maternity benefit payments are eligible under the new scheme. Women on unemployment benefit and disability benefit who are not eligible for maternity benefit under the revised arrangements can continue to claim these payments for the period immediately before and after confinement.  New flexible signing arrangements in relation to unemployment payments were also introduced, which eliminated the necessity for pregnant women and women who had recently given birth to attend for weekly signing at local employment offices.  The only group not catered for in the new arrangements are women claimants who are no longer active in the labour force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="828" /> It has been estimated by my Department that those affected number fewer than 100 per annum.</P>
    <P>These measures were taken in order to relate the payment of maternity benefit more closely to active labour force participation. New categories of workers brought within the scope of the maternity scheme as a result of these measures include contract workers with contracts of fewer than 26 weeks and employees who work for fewer than eight hours per week.  The scheme has also been extended to cover part-time employees earning more than £25 per week.</P>
    <P>The rate of payment under the scheme has also been improved.  As recently announced in the budget, the minimum and maximum rates of payment of maternity benefit has been increased by £5 per week to £65 and £159 respectively. All of these changes in the maternity benefit scheme are aimed at developing a comprehensive scheme which will provide women in employment with adequate financial support during their period of maternity leave.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the 100 women per annum who will not enjoy benefit because of their unemployment position, will the Minister cater for the needs of these women under the supplementary welfare regulations?  Will he assure the House that the needs of these women will be met and that they will not be affected by the exceptional restrictions placed by the circulars of 1992 on the health boards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have that matter examined.  There are many women who could also be eligible and would not have been in the scheme.  In that sense the implications are much wider.  In relation to people who might suffer hardship, I will certainly have that matter considered.</P>

      <P>It is a different question, and it does not impinge on the question before us.  Some of the guidelines will come into operation immediately and others within the next week or so.  We have to get the Bill through both Houses before I can make some regulations.  I have the power now to make some regulations and they have been made.  They are coming through the system and will probably be laid before the House by the beginning of next week.  The whole issue of supplementary welfare will be concluded, and the guidelines made available, as soon as the code of practice is worked out.</P>

      <P>No precise statistics are collected on the numbers of students that claim unemployment assistance during the summer vacation.  However, it is estimated having regard to changes in the live register, approximately 10,000 students claimed unemployment assistance following the summer examinations in 1991 and 12,000 in 1992.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister have any evidence in the figures he has given as to the number of fraudulent claims by students?  If so, how many prosecutions were taken and how many convictions were obtained?  The Minister in his speech said that the cost to the Exchequer <Col N="830" /> of paying for student dole in the summer is £8 million.  He referred to a doomsday scenario when all students claimed and moved into flats and he put a figure of £60 million on that.  What is the reason for this exclusion of entitlement to dole for students in the summer?  If the reason relates to abuse the Minister should convince us of that by bringing forward at least a <i>prima facie</i> case.  That is not being done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 14 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>The provisions for paying equal treatment arrears to married women for the period December 1984 to November 1986 are contained in the European Communities (Social Welfare) Regulations, 1992, SI No. 152 of 1992.  The regulations provide for (a) the payment of a higher personal rate in the case of certain social welfare payments, (b) the extended duration of unemployment benefit, (c) payment of a household supplement in respect of a dependent husband and/or dependent children and (d) payment of unemployment assistance.  Payment of arrears due is being made on a phased basis in 1992, 1993 and 1994 at a total estimated cost of £57.5 million.</P>
      <P>Payment of arrears due under phase 1, that is the higher personal rates and extended duration of unemployment benefit, commenced in August 1992 and are expected to be completed shortly at a cost of £17.5 million.  Payment of arrears due under phase 2, that is household supplement in respect of dependants and unemployment assistance, will commence in April.  Arrears due under phase 2 are being paid in two equal instalments in 1993 and 1994 at a total cost of £40 million.  Any amount of less than £100 will be paid in full this year.</P>
      <P>Claimants with potential entitlement to arrears were identified from my Department's records and reissued with claim forms in June and July of 1992.  A total of 85,060 completed claim forms have been received and 78,500 of those have been processed for phase 1 entitlement to date.  This leaves some 6,500 claims yet to be processed, the bulk of which are cases where further inquiries had to be made to determine entitlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="832" /> Of those processed 62,500 have been awarded payment and the remaining 16,000 were not entitled to arrears under phase 1.  A total of 62,300 claimants have received their phase 1 payments at a cost of £14.12 million &mdash; the average payment per claimant being £226.65.</P>
    <P>The total amount of arrears outstanding at this stage is estimated at £43.38 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there is widespreed confusion in relation to the payment of these entitlements? Is the Minister aware that in Cork alone 2,000 people have had to go to solicitors to have their claims processed and that solicitors in Cork, and I am sure throughout the country, are advertising their services?  Will the Minister put in place an information campaign to inform people of their entitlements and enable them to get information at their local centres rather than be forced into&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>More than 1,000 people who could be identified through the Department's records received letters informing them of their entitlements. There were also newspaper advertisements. Those entitled to the payment will be paid and people should be quite clear about that.  I hope the Deputy will bring that to the attention of his constituents and let them know that anyone entitled will be paid and that there is no need for them to incur the expense of <Col N="833" /> hiring legal people.  There have been legal cases that established the basis on which payments should be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

      <P>The Deputy will be aware from my speech in the House on Tuesday of my plans to withdraw the circulars mentioned and to replace them with a code of practice for those experiencing difficulty with fuel debts.  This code will be worked out in consultation with the health boards and the utility companies and will be published as soon as this process is complete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious of the need for good <Col N="834" /> quality information which clearly sets out the circumstances in which entitlement may be established or payments made.  I am committed to a policy of continuously improving the information available to both customers of my Department and to those who work in the area of welfare advice.</P>
    <P>An advisory group has been established under the chairmanship of my Department with representatives from all health boards.  The task of the group is to review all aspects of the operation of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme within health boards with a view to achieving consistency in the operation of the scheme.  Draft revised rent and mortgage guidelines are currently being examined by the advisory group and I intend to publish the content of these later in the year.</P>
    <P>The group will examine and update all guidelines currently in use in the administration of supplementary welfare allowance with the objective of producing comprehensive guidance on the scheme which will be published in due course.</P>
    <P>It is established practice within my Department to treat internal circulars, including circulars on the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, as confidential. Department circulars tend to be technical documents which are written for information of staff who are familiar with the subject material.</P>

The implication in the Minister's reply, that we are not fit to read the circulars intelligently, is not taken very kindly by me.  I learned to read when I was seven years of age.  It is not an adequate answer to say the Department is not prepared to put in the Library of this House circulars which they issue to community welfare officers which directly affect the income of those of my constituents who are living in hardship and need the back-up of the community welfare officers and the supplementary <Col N="835" /> welfare allowance system, which is being denied to them at present, specifically because of circulars 14/92 and 18/92.  I should like to ask the Minister a specific question.  Circular 14/92 and its alleged clarification circular 18/92 restricted the payment of money to constituents of mine who had problems with ESB bills and corporation rent bills.  Circular 18/92 sought to clarify the situation with regard to the ESB&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister has still not answered my specific question. Can the Minister give me a date on which circulars 14/92 and 18/92 will be withdrawn? Will it be next week, the week after or the following week?  I was told two weeks ago it would be shortly.  Now I am told again that it will be shortly. What does &ldquo;shortly&rdquo; mean to the people out there who are in need of money today?  They do not want £12.5 million, they want £30 to pay their ESB bills.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>his views on whether those in receipt of disability benefit are given adequate medical examinations before being disqualified from benefit on the grounds that they are fit for work, and on whether there should be greater liaison with their GPs and consultants, whose findings are very often at variance with those of the medical referees.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Medical referees provide advice, by way of a second opinion to that of the client's own doctor, which assists deciding officers and the independent social welfare appeals officers in determining claims.</P>
      <P>Clients who claim disability benefit are likely to be called for examination by a medical referee.  Cases are selected for referral on the basis of the initial certified cause of incapacity.  For example, a client certified as being incapable of work due to influenza for more than a few weeks may be called for a review relatively quickly.</P>
      <P>When a medical referee examination is arranged, the client's doctor is notified and invited to be present.  The doctor is also requested to furnish a report on the medical history and present condition of the client, including reference to any recent examinations by consultants, in order to assist the medical referee in considering the case.  Any consultants' reports submitted are carefully considered.</P>
      <P>At the examination, the medical referee establishes the client's past history of medical illnesses and of his or her current complaint.  The medical referee then tries to determine whether the client is suffering from the illness as certified by their own doctor to a degree that makes the client incapable of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In cases where the certified cause of incapacity is not confirmed, the medical referee carries out a full clinical examination. This involves examining the client's heart, lungs, central nervous system, blood pressure and, if relevant, urine analysis.  The purpose of these tests <Col N="839" /> is to determine whether the client could be incapable of work by reason of some other illness.</P>
    <P>Where a medical referee is of the opinion that the nature of the client's illness does not render him or her unfit for work, the case is reviewed by the medical adviser.  A deciding officer then decides the question of entitlement to benefit.  Where the deciding officer decides that the conditions for receipt of benefit are not satisfied the person concerned is informed in writing and is advised of the right to appeal.</P>
    <P>Where an appeal is lodged, that is in about 10 per cent of all cases for which examinations are arranged, a second medical referee examination is arranged. The second examination is conducted by a different medical referee and the client's doctor is again invited to be present and to submit any additional information and reports.  An appeals officer may, if he considers it necessary, request a further report from an independent consultant to assist him in determining the client's entitlement to benefit.</P>
    <P>The medical referee system works well and specific liaison arrangements are built into the administrative procedures.  As the Deputy can see, the client's own doctor is invited to be present at each examination and to submit medical opinions for consideration by the deciding officer.  The arrangements are kept under review to ensure that clients' needs are met.  If the Deputy has a particular situation he has come across I will be glad to have it examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Like most Deputies, I have received representations about the most bizarre decisions made by medical referees.  In one case which arose last year the notification that a person was fit for work had to be redirected from his home to the intensive care unit of Cork Regional Hospital.  In another case an appeal had to be postponed because the girl in question was undergoing an operation on the day the appeal was to be heard.  I suggest to the Minister that he <Col N="840" /> may be adopting a rather smug attitude to what is a serious problem and that while there is a need to weed out phoney claims genuine people are being badly treated under the system.  In many cases decisions are being made, after a cursory examination, that people are fit to work, which decisions are entirely contrary to the views of their doctors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The system is based on the decisions made by professional medical people and provides for two sets of appeals.  There will always be cases which give rise to a difference of opinion and cases where someone may not give full information to the medical referee, particularly to the first medical referee. As the Deputy will know from his experience &mdash; I know this from my experience &mdash; people may not give their full medical history to the first medical referee.  The Department of Social Welfare provides for appeal to two medical referees and a separate administrative appeal at the end of that process.  That is a good system and it works well, but it will not deal with every case.  Exceptions will arise from time to time but by and large the system will respond to these if they are brought to the attention of the relevant people.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister to follow up on his offer to review the system and, above all, to listen to the experiences of his colleagues in this House who have had to make representations on behalf of their constituents? I am not only referring to his colleagues on this side of the House; I am sure some of his colleagues on the other side of the House have had representations made to them in regard to similar cases.  I ask the Minister to conduct a review so that decent people who are being subjected to extra stress and pressure can have their cases for disability dealt with in a fairer system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be difficult to have a fairer system, but I accept that some people may find it stressful to be called before a medical referee.  In some cases, people do not explain their position properly to the medical referee.  That is the type of case I have come across.  It is very easy for Deputies and me to present individual cases, but the system has to cater for hundreds of thousands of people.  The system is based on the best medical evidence available at the time. Medical referees are there for that purpose. There is also the right of appeal to a second medical referee and, apart altogether from that, an administrative appeal.  When cases are brought to the attention of the Department by Deputies on behalf of their constituents we intervene again to try to ensure that no relevant points are missed.  In that sense, it is a good system.  I am always concerned to ensure that the system works well and that the people who are administering it are giving people the time and attention required.  I will take the points made by the Deputy in this respect into consideration.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Would the Minister not accept that the present system is an anachronism in this day and age in that a person who may have to undergo treatment by a leading specialist, who has at his disposal the best equipment the Department of Health can afford to make available, can be examined visually across a table by a medical expert with a little travel bag of tricks?  It is time we faced up to the reality that such a system cannot give fair play to anyone.  Regardless of the points made by the Minister about how good it is, the system should be abolished immediately because it cannot give fair play to anyone. For example, a decision could be made against somebody who has back trouble if there is no backup specialist expertise available.  A medical referee&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that in many cases people feel intimidated and degraded when they come before a medical referee?  Does the Minister carry out any analysis or <Col N="843" /> monitor the performance of medical referees?  Does he accept that disability benefit recipients are at a serious disadvantage at this stage in that they find it almost impossible to get consultants' reports on their condition due to the three and four year waiting lists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>By and large disability benefit is paid to people who cannot attend work for a certain period.  I know that in Ireland some people have been on disability benefit for six, eight, ten or 18 years.  One will not find similar cases in any other country in Europe.  Such people should be on invalidity pension but, as the House knows, this benefit is taxable.  In view of the fact that disability benefit will shortly be taxable I am sure some people will move from disability benefit to invalidity benefit.  We know that this anomaly has existed for a long time &mdash; many people who at regular intervals qualify for disability benefit should properly be receiving invalidity benefit. As the Deputy will know from the Social Welfare Bill, 1993, I am introducing a provision which will enable invalidity pension to be granted to people earlier, for example, in cases where a person has a serious life threatening or obvious illness.  It will be possible in future to draw up regulations covering these people.  Such regulations will not be ready tomorrow, but they will be drawn up.  This is a slightly complicated area and, as Members have often said, it should be possible to decide in less than a year that people in a certain category should go straight on to invalidity pension. Regulations in this regard will be drawn up, and these will cover some of the people to whom the Deputy has referred.</P>

      <P>What are the qualifications of these medical referees?  It seems ludicrous that a person who is deemed unfit for work by a senior consultant is, after a cursory examination, deemed fit for work by a medical referee. Are these men medical diviners?

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 8, 11, 18, 22, 27 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>The PRSI exemption scheme, as contained in section 18 of the Social Welfare Bill, is not expected to lead to any cost to the Exchequer.  Under the scheme, employers who take on additional full-time employees in the period from 19 October 1992 to 19 September 1993 will not have to pay the employer's PRSI contribution in respect of these employees for a period of two years from April 1993.  To the extent to which additional employment is created, PRSI income from employees will be increased.  In addition, as the workers will be drawn from the Live Register there will be a saving in unemployment payments.</P>
      <P>Making the scheme a permanent feature of the social welfare code would not incur significant costs, provided that the jobs concerned were not displacing jobs which would have been created anyway, and that the people concerned would otherwise be in receipt of unemployment payments.  However, if these conditions were not met, some additional costs would occur.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>We were beginning to address this question this morning on the Social Welfare Bill.  I remarked that sections 16 and 17 increasing the PRSI contributions compared most favourably with this scheme.  The Minister states that the scheme is operated at no cost to the State.  In view of the fact that 300,000 people have no work, would it not make good social and economic sense to implement this scheme in full for five or six years at least?  It has worked reasonably well and there is every possibility that if the Minister adopted this suggestion it would result in people being removed from the social welfare system and getting back into employment.  A small cost in the short term would be <Col N="847" /> justified if people could be got back to work in the medium term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme was due to finish on 19 March but I am having it extended to 19 September so that it will be in place when consideration is being given to plans for employment.  I will be working on supports for getting people back into work and I will be adopting a pro-active approach.  Many proposals have come from the Department of Social Welfare but it is hard to get them accepted because there is always some cost involved.  I have extended the scheme until September, when it can be looked at again.  If people are taken from the Live Register for a year or two it will not have a damaging effect in the long term on the social insurance fund.  If the scheme is used for people who would otherwise get employment, there is a cost.  There are some 1,100 applications under the scheme to date.  The extension to September will give us an opportunity to review the scheme in the meantime and possibly to go further with it.</P>

      <P>The pre-retirement allowance scheme, which I introduced in 1990, is for people who are aged at least 55 years who are getting long term unemployment assistance and who regard themselves as retired from the workforce. Those who opt for the pre-retirement allowance no longer have to sign on the live register and are paid by a book of payable orders which can be cashed weekly at a post office of their choice.</P>
      <P>There are currently 15,472 people in receipt of the allowance.  From July of this year these recipients will benefit from a higher rate of personal payment of £59.20 per week, together with an adult dependant allowance of £35.50 and a child dependant allowance of £12.80.</P>

      <P>I am attempting to find how many people have been removed from the live register under this scheme. Will the Minister agree that people in this scheme should remain on the live register?  We need to know where we stand.  The 15,472 people who have been ushered off the live register into this scheme represent a large number of unemployed people.  In the interests of transparency, would it not be more fair and honest to show them as being on the live register?  I note an increase of 35 per cent in the Estimate for this scheme.  Do the increases to which the Minister has referred account for this 35 per cent or does he envisage an influx of people into the scheme or a changing of conditions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two elements. One is the increase in the budget and the other relates to the additional people who came into the scheme last year when the age was reduced to 55.  The full year cost this year increased the Estimate very substantially.  Regarding the live register, it covers people who are fit for work, available for work and actively seeking work.  In 1990 I became aware that people aged around 60 have very little likelihood of getting employment, and in any event their health might not be good.  These people might have to travel, for instance, from Coolock to Dublin to claim unemployment assistance with all that entails, the cost of travelling, etc.  I thought that in the context of the dignity of these people they should have an option.  That is why I introduced this and the Government agreed to it.  The fact that they are no longer on the live register is incidental. This was introduced to facilitate the people I see in my community and clinics. People are free to take up this option if they wish to do so.  People are also made redundant, have a small pension, get a partial payment from the Department and have said they are not in the market for work.  However, this is a means-tested scheme and not open-ended in terms of expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take a philosophical approach to the statistics.  Will the Minister not agree that while the scheme has merits we are in a sense telling a certain age group that they have gone beyond the era of work?  At the age of 55 people can qualify for the pre-retirement allowance.  However, are we not telling people that when they reach the age of 55 they are removed from the workplace?  Is there not a certain negative vibe emanating from the scheme?  Are <Col N="850" /> we not literally trying to write off another generation in regard to the workplace?</P>

      <P>The simple answer is no, that is not true.  I know Deputy Bradford is quite a young TD and representative of the country as a whole.  Some of these people may undertake a small amount of work and we do not want to stop them doing that.  Under the legislation inspectors are chasing them just as if they were the same as everybody else, they are not, especially if their health is not good.  They have the option of coming back to the system if a decent job is available to them.  Otherwise, they have the option of not being corralled, policed and pursued by the system which would be the case.  They are happy about it even though the Deputy might not be. Philosophically, the Deputy can sleep easily because these people have opted into the scheme and are glad to have it.</P>

      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme health boards may pay a weekly supplement towards rent or mortgage interest payments to persons whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.  A payment towards mortgage interest may be granted where the interest exceeds £5 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a local authority tenant has opted to buy his own home under a tennant purchase scheme he will normally have the option to revert to tenancy should he encounter difficulties in making repayments.  Tenant purchasers who seek assistance from the health <Col N="851" /> boards are advised to contact the relevant local authority with a view to renegotiating the terms of their agreements or reverting to tenancy.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental working group, of officials from my Department and from the Department of the Environment, has been set up to examine issues of concern to both Departments in relation to rent and mortgage supplementation. The position of tenant purchasers who encounter difficulties with their mortgage repayments is being addressed in the context of this review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I am appalled at the Minister's response.  Surrender and regrant is something that was associated with the Irish land policy under the Commonwealth. To have an Irish Minister in an Irish Government suggesting to tenants of local authority houses who have made huge efforts to own their own houses that they should forego all of the moneys which they have spent by way of repayment and revert to tenancy is an absolute disgrace.  I would ask the Minister at this stage to direct local community welfare officers to make available to tenant purchasers the same assistance available to anybody else on a mortgage. Is there not something immoral about a State that can offer assistance to people who run into difficulties with £50,000, £60,000 and £100,000 mortgages but when people who buy their local authority houses run into trouble they will ask them to surrender their houses to the local authority and rent them back?  It is appalling.</P>

      <P>People in local authority housing have an administrative arrangement with the local authority and the Department of the Environment.  If there are administrative difficulties, there are means of dealing with those difficulties. The Deputy is asking for a different Department to enter into and participate in the policy of the Department of the Environment and to change arrangements that have been made.  Substantial discounts apply only to local authority purchasers and not to other purchasers. Specific, separate arrangements apply for local authority purchasers and the local authority is in an administrative position to deal with difficulties that arise in that area.  In effect, the Deputy is saying that the Department of Social Welfare should deal with all the difficulties of every other Department and that other Departments should be allowed to do what they like.</P>

      <P>I would consider it a priority to ensure that all social welfare claimants are aware not only of their entitlements from my Department but also from other organisations who offer advice and support.</P>
      <P>As this is the year of the elderly, special consideration is being given to the provision of information to older people. In this context, the various methods of transmitting information to older people are being examined to decide how best to inform them of their entitlements from this Department and from other agencies.</P>
      <P>In November last my Department produced an information leaflet for the blind in Braille, while also printing the written version in a manner which facilitates those of low vision.  The information is also now available on tape for those visually challenged and unable to read Braille.  Older people would represent a significant proportion of those who are blind or visually impaired.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="856" /> This is but the start of a process of more targeted delivery of information.  It is intended that the next production of the guide to the social welfare services will also be produced in Braille and on tape.  The information service is also looking at the prospects of the availability of social welfare information on computer disk and the uses to which interactive phones can be put.  The intention is that all sectors of Irish society will be aware of their rights and entitlements.</P>

      <P>I am constantly amazed at ministerial answers which are peripheral to the question asked.  Again I wish to ask whether the Minister will take the initiative to put in place a very simple method to inform not only the elderly &mdash; although, obviously, the elderly are of concern &mdash; but also other beneficiaries of essential services.  Every elderly pensioner has his or her pension book easily accessible, in a handbag or in a pocket. That resource should be used and the information should be provided in the pension book, or the book connected with any other social welfare payment, rather than there being additional leaflets and brochures that could easily get lost. It is important that beneficiaries be able to avail of documentation that they all have and look after.  A child benefit book, for example, contains much information which I have never read, and I am sure that not everybody else reads it either.  If that information were replaced by a list of telephone numbers and basic information every mother who has one of those books would have that information easily accessible when needed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal put forward by the Samaritans will be given consideration. Departmental resources have to be considered in relation to any of those developments.  One of the difficulties is the time at which the issue has arisen, in that changes are being made in the system of payment.  The Deputy made reference to child benefit books. Payment of child benefit is being changed to direct electronic fund transfer.  The most effective method of giving information, which reaches 96 per cent of the population, is the Aertel service.  Departmental information is given on the Aertel broadcast.  In addition to that, of course, the Department also provides free television licences.  I tried to explain the methods being used to convey information but the Deputy did not seem to want to know about other systems.  The Department is very anxious to convey as much information as possible.  The process is expensive and it does involve manpower. The number of people involved in the delivery of information has been increased.  I set up an information section within the Department, which is being expanded as resources allow, and that section is doing an excellent job.  There is an inclination to concentrate on the negative aspects but there is much solid, positive work being done, and good, solid information is available not only to Dáil Deputies but also to the general public. One of the difficulties is that, no matter what way the information is communicated, people would rather talk to someone and have their concerns dealt with, and this applies particularly in the case of elderly people.</P>

      <P>Far from being negative, I am trying to be helpful.  I ask that the Minister treat this proposal seriously and understand the point that already there is a resource that would provide information quickly and easily.  Does the <Col N="858" /> Minister recognise that it is one thing for a person under stress, at risk or perhaps even suicidal to have to look up the Aertel broadcast or try to find a brochure on social welfare services and it is another thing for that person to be able to reach into a handbag or up to a shelf, get a pension book and look up a telephone number that is needed, for example, that of the Samaritans?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to comment on the study referred to by the Deputy, as it contained a number of serious factual errors and was misleading in the impression it gave of the current situation as regards maternity benefit in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, let me say that the provisions of the Irish maternity benefit scheme are well above the minimum standards laid down in the EC Directive on the Protection of Pregnant Workers, as adopted by the Council of Ministers last <Col N="859" /> October.  Maternity benefit provides women workers with 70 per cent of their gross salary in the relevant tax year for 14 weeks, subject to maximum and minimum payments.  When tax refunds are taken into account, the current level of payment corresponds to take-home pay for many women.  Employees on low pay are guaranteed a minimum payment of £60 per week at present.  The Social Welfare Bill currently before this House provides for the minimum payment to be increased to £65 from July and it also provides for the maximum payment to be increased from £154 to £159 per week. The study referred to by the Deputy assessed that only 16 per cent of Irish women receive maternity benefits today compared with 40 per cent in the first half of this century.  This is not the case.  In 1991, 13,268 maternity benefit claims were awarded under the women in employment scheme, representing 25 per cent of all births in that year.  When one considers that only about 26 per cent of Irish women of childbearing age participate in the labour force, this is a fairly comprehensive and representative coverage.</P>
    <P>By far the most serious error made in the study, however, was the suggestion that a woman might not qualify for unemployment benefit or assistance, or disability benefit during and after pregnancy.  When the rationalisation of maternity schemes came into effect last year specific arrangements were put in place to ensure that women on unemployment benefit or disability benefit could continue to claim those payments for the duration of their maternity leave. More flexible signing arrangements have since been introduced for pregnant women claiming unemployment payments, so that they no longer have to attend for weekly signing during the 12 week period immediately before and after giving birth.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind people undertaking research that officials are available to clarify the interpretation of statistics published by my Department.</P>
    <Col N="860" />
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree, notwithstanding the points he made in relation to this research, that in European terms our maternity benefits scheme is not good?  The amount of maternity leave granted is in the lower bands compared to similar countries.  It is remarkable that this House has devoted a considerable amount of time and debate to the status of the child before delivery but has failed to pay much attention to him or her after delivery.  Will the Minister also agree that the cost of having &mdash; and delivering &mdash; a child is not taken into account in any meaningful way in relation to benefits?  The Minister did not refer to cutbacks introduced by the then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy McCreevy, last year.  Will he agree it is time we recognised that women have a right to a maternity benefit which is on a par with our European partners?  We seem to suffer many of the negative effects of EC directives without reaping any benefits. Will the Minister comment on the length of time for which women can avail of benefit and the matter of the percentage of pay?  I appreciate the points the Minister made in relation to the directive but the reality is that many elements in society wish to prevent women from availing of proper benefit.  Our record is not good, despite what the Minister said, particularly when we claim to be a child oriented country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in the middle range &mdash; or slightly above it &mdash; as far as the 14 weeks' maternity leave is concerned.  I was responsible for introducing a period of 14 weeks and, therefore, I am familiar with the system.  In Germany maternity benefit is paid for 14 weeks&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The minimum rate of £65 applies irrespective of the person's income.  We have also brought in part-time workers, who would not be covered elsewhere, and who were particularly in need of support.  We still maintained the minimum level even though part-time <Col N="861" /> workers could be earning as little as £25 per week.  When they now go on maternity leave they will receive £60, which will shortly rise to £65.  The net take home pay is, of course, affected by tax and there are different arrangements in EC countries.  Tax rebates are also paid.  However, I will keep the matter under review because I appreciate the need for adequate support during that period.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was examined by a medical referee in December 1991, who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  Accordingly, payment of disability benefit was disallowed with effect from 21 December 1991.</P>
      <P>The person appealed against the disallowance. He was examined by a different medical referee who also expressed the opinion that he was capable of work. He was then afforded an oral hearing by the independent social welfare appeals officer.  The appeals officer upheld the disallowance.</P>
      <P>The person furnished additional medical evidence following the appeals findings. This was carefully considered by an appeals officer who determined that it did not provide any grounds for a reversal of the decision.</P>
      <P>The person submitted a further medical report in February 1993.  This report has also been considered by an appeals officer.  I regret to say that an appeals officer determined that it contained nothing new which would warrant a revision of the disallowance.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was informed of this decision on 22 March 1993.</P>

      <P>I do not lightly ask a question about an individual.  However, will <Col N="862" /> the Minister use his good offices to have this case re-examined?  The person in question is a manual worker and he cannot do the type of work for which he is qualified.  He suffers excruciating pain in his left hand because of badly damaged tendons.  I am sure the Minister knows that the three doctors system and the appeals system often result in terrible decisions.  This is a case of that kind and I should like the Minister to have it re-examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly look at the matter and if the Deputy has any further information I will look into it.  The injury followed an accident at work on 10 August 1990 and the disallowance occurred from 21 December 1991.  The person was certified as having an incapacity, an injury to the thumb of his left hand, on which he pulled ligaments.  It is suggested that possibly he is a right-handed worker&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt about the fact that he suffered an injury to his thumb.  From the evidence presented it appears he had a tenderness in the soft tissue around the metracarpo-thalangeal joint of his left thumb, over the most lateral tendon of the anterior surface of his forearm.  I can see that, if he is a person who works with his hands and has to use both hands, there could be a problem.  There is a difficulty in that while the disability benefit system, for a certain length of time, will continue to pay on the grounds that one has an injury to one hand, in due course it will be contended that one is fit for other kinds of work, not necessarily the work in which one engaged previously.  That is one of the general principles.  In any event, I will examine the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

      <P>There is a large number of amendments submitted but all of them have been ruled out of order for good and cogent reasons, except amendment No. 24 in the name of Deputy Allen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 14, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) The provisions of the Data Protection Act, 1988, shall apply in full to any information obtained under this section.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) Section 31 of the Act of 1988 is hereby repealed.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I contend that in this Bill, the Minister is attempting to sneak through a provision which will allow him to allocate and issue personal social service numbers, a proposal which is basically a resurrection of one announced in 1989.  I believe this proposal will have very serious privacy implications for everybody.  I contend the Minister must now make a comprehensive statement on these proposals, informing the House exactly what he is about, because the Bill and explanatory memorandum are very limited in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept fully that there are advantages for the State in such a system.  However, a balance must be struck between the State's objectives and the safeguarding of the privacy of the individual.  In the absence of adequate data protection legislation I believe the privacy of the individual is very much in danger.  The Data Protection Act provides a general framework for data use but is insufficient in providing protection for the privacy of the individual.  In the absence of a detailed study of all issues and of legislation to contain and confine the use of <Col N="924" /> personal information, these proposals must be opposed by my party.  A detailed study should include comparative examination of the systems in place in other countries and involve the widest possible consultation with all of those who have an interest in this problem.</P>
    <P>I might remind the House that other countries have had very bad experiences with which I will not bore the House at present, brought about by the absence of adequate safeguards.  I contend that the mistakes which have occurred in other countries must not be repeated here.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to withdraw these proposals until such time as there has been a full debate on their implications and, more importantly, pending the publication and sanction of appropriate legislation to safeguard the privacy of the individual.</P>
    <P>I spoke with the Assistant Commissioner for Data Protection on Thursday week last.  I also pulled the latest report of the Commissioner, that of 1991, from the Library.  Dealing with threats to privacy, he stated that his general concern was also increased by specific developments in the Department of Social Welfare.  On student information, the report states:</P>
    <P>Firstly, regulations made under the Social Welfare Act, 1991, required <i>inter alia</i> universities and similar third level educational establishments to supply the Minister for Social Welfare with the names of all students registering with them.  Since this information has always been regarded as confidential, and could not be disclosed under the Data Protection Act except in the limited circumstances set out in section 8 (which permits but does not compel the disclosure of personal data) the Social Welfare Act 1991 has the effect of reducing the level of protection granted by the Act.</P>
    <P>As Commissioner, I feel it my duty to question, in principle, legislation of this kind.  Any proposal to introduce legislation likely to have privacy implications <Col N="925" /> should, in my view, be submitted to me for comment before any decisions is taken in relation to it.</P>
    <P>In relation to this, I would ask the Minister whether he has had consultations with the Commissioner or Assistant Commissioner and, if so, what their reaction was.  The report continues:</P>
    <P>This would avoid a clash with the principles of data protection and would allow for an informed debate on the issues involved, where necessary.</P>
    <P>Legislation cannot be justified merely on the grounds that its purpose is to prevent tax evasion or social welfare fraud.  As I have already stated, a balance with privacy must be achieved. As soon as I became aware of what was proposed, I took the matter up with the Department of Social Welfare. I am happy to say that they agreed, at my request, to take specific steps to ensure that all the principles of data protection would be followed in applying the provisions of the Social Welfare Act.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of this annual report of the Data Protection Commissioner in 1991 I would ask the Minister what steps have been taken to increase the protection of the individual. Would the Minister also spell out in detail here the implications of the proposal contained in section 23?  I will reserve further comment until I hear the Minister's views.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 23, to which amendment No. 24 refers, provides for the allocation and issue of personal social services numbers, formerly known as the Revenue and Social Insurance numbers. This number will become the unique identifier of all social welfare payments, thereby enabling my Department to exercise control over the various schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 23 (2) requires a claimant or beneficiary to provide such information, as may be prescribed, to enable a personal social services number to be allocated and issued while subsection (3) <Col N="926" /> requires a claimant for any social welfare payment to furnish his personal social services number and that of his dependants, if any.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare has taken over the task of issuing Revenue and Social Insurance numbers and a person must have a number before he can receive a payment.  Indeed, people are quite happy to have a number.  If people want to use it for any other purpose that is a matter for themselves.  It should also be remembered that the same number is used by the Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 23 of the Bill, as is the case with all legislation enacted by the Oireachtas, are already subject to the provisions of the Data Protection Act.  There is no need, therefore, for the proposed subsection (5).</P>
    <P>In so far as section 31 of the 1988 Act is concerned this provision was enacted to provide for the transfer of information between my Department and the Revenue Commissioners and for similar transfers between my Department, other Departments and specified bodies for the purposes of the administration of social welfare schemes.  The transfer of information of this nature is essential to operate the schemes and ensure that there are adequate controls in operation.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the vast majority of people receiving payments are bona fide and I have often made this point in the House.  I am also aware that fraud and abuse of my Department's schemes occur and I want the message to go out loud and clear that those who defraud the system will not be tolerated; in other words, we must have a system which is self-checking and correcting, which at present is the case.</P>
    <P>Like any large spending organisation my Department must have effective control measures in operation to protect the Exchequer and, ultimately, the taxpayer. That is the least the ordinary taxpayer can expect.  Within my Department the efficient delivery of social welfare services and the control of fraud and abuse of the system are two sides of the same <Col N="927" /> coin.  The need to control fraud and abuse has been given added emphasis in recent years with good effect.  Additional staff, costing £1 million, were assigned in 1991 and 1992 for this purpose.  Control activities within the Department were restructured to achieve greater effectiveness. Overall savings of £84 million were achieved last year and the targeted savings this year amount to an additional £27 million.</P>
    <P>The detection of fraud and abuse forms an integral part of the work of my Department with some 530 officers, about 13 per cent of the staff, involved specifically in control work.  All officers involved in the processing and payment of social welfare entitlements have a control function which involves the prevention and detection of abuse of the schemes and the elimination of fraud.  Specific control units operating at local, regional and national level within my Department seek and identify specific forms of abuse and devise appropriate counteractive measures.  Included in their work are inspections of employers in relation to their PRSI obligations, investigation of concurrent working and claiming social welfare benefits and reviewing claimants' means for assistance payments.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that all resources available to my Department are dedicated to the task of stamping out fraud and abuse and that the full rigours of the law will be applied where abuse is detected.  The penalties have been significantly increased in recent years, including fines of up to £10,000 or up to three years' imprisonment or both.  The proposed repeal of section 31 of the 1988 Act would hinder my efforts in controlling fraud and abuse within the system.  I am, therefore, opposing the amendment.</P>
    <P>To respond to the points made by Deputy Allen, the staff of the Department familiarised themselves with the provisions of the Data Protection Act.  In relation to the personal social services number I should stress that all we are doing is providing a convenient reference number for those who use our social services, <Col N="928" /> such as PRSI contributors.  With this number they will be able to check the benefits to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>It was proposed earlier that I should have wider powers but I have dropped this proposal as, before I could be given wider powers, the legislation would have to be well thought-out and discussed with the Data Protection Commissioner.  As I said, I have now dropped this proposal but it is both necessary and essential that we have such a personal social services number.  It is a modern way of doing business.  Nowadays everybody uses a plastic card, this card is useful and it is one which people are happy to have. Hundreds of thousands have been issued already and they will continue to be issued to all who use our social welfare services.  If they wish to use them for other purposes that is a matter for themselves. We will use these numbers only in respect of our normal activities with which the House is familiar and provided for in legislation.</P>

      <P>Again, this is a matter of concern to many Deputies.  I am sure there is as much concern on the Minister's side of the House as there is on this side about this matter.  We are not talking here about a person who, by choice, goes to a bank to obtain a banker's card, a cheque card, a Visa card or a Barclay card, have their name entered in a computer bank and uses this card for identification purposes, to withdraw cash and so on.  In this instance the Department will oblige each person who goes to them for assistance, on the basis of their entitlements because of contributions made or the circumstances in which they find themselves, to have this number.  It strikes me that social welfare claimants are being treated differently from other sections of our population.</P>

      <P>The section states: &ldquo;the Minister may allocate and issue a <Col N="929" /> personal social services number to a person in such manner as he deems fit&rdquo;. Therefore, everybody will not be given a personal identification number tomorrow. For instance, the self-employed will not receive a personal identification card from the Minister tomorrow.  Those entitled to headage payments whose tax affairs are not in order will not be required to produce a personal social services number identification card in order to qualify for payment.  Distinctions are being made between those who have to get assistance from the Department of Social Welfare because of unemployment or illness and those who do not have to. Second a claimant or beneficiary under the Social Welfare Acts shall be required to furnish to an officer of the Minister such information as may be prescribed which is necessary for the allocation and issue of a personal social services number under subsection (1).  What sort of information will be required?  When will it be prescribed?  We are being asked to agree to a section which effectively leads to an invasion of the privacy of a person who does not have sufficient money to survive. We are being asked to agree to this without knowing what precise information will be required and who, and how it will be decided.  We also do not know at what level of seniority the decision will be made as to who qualifies for a card.  I presume that if someone does not produce his card he will not get his benefit or assistance payments.  Who decides whether the Department is entitled to seek such information from the claimant?  There are so many holes in this section that it seems to me to be a slap-dash approach to what the Minister claims to be an attack on fraud.</P>

Will he clarify what he means by savings, because in the same breath he spoke about fraud?  Is he claiming that <Col N="930" /> fraud of £84 million was discovered in the system in 1991-92?  I may have misunderstood but in the same breath he spoke about fraud and savings of £27 million this year.  Is he claiming that fraud of this amount was discovered?  We had a debate earlier on the distinction between over-payment and fruad and will he define what he means by the following terms; fraud, savings and over-payments? Could he break down the total and give us a figure under each of those headings?  It is unfair and inaccurate to propose what I argue is essentially an invasion of the privacy of hundreds of thousands of people on the basis of spurious figures.</P>

      <P>I have to differ with my Opposition colleagues on this point. The introduction of a personal social services number is a good idea and my party support it.  I note the Minister has withdrawn previous measures which we would have had difficulty with because the Data Protection Commissioner indicated he had problems and reservations about earlier proposals.  We should be committed to the elimination of fraud in the system.  There appears to be considerable concern among the population at large about the real or perceived extent of fraud in the social welfare system. It is very important that the maximum resources go to people who are truly in need and any effort the Minister will make to root out fraud will be supported by myself and my party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the Second Stage debate I mentioned that the Minister for Social Welfare has requested Craig Gardner to report on the extent of fraud in the social welfare system.  The report has not been published.  It would be of general interest to Members and to others who have an interest in social welfare to have the facts.  If there is massive abuse &mdash; and the practitioners I have spoken to feel that the incidence of abuse can be as high as one in five: not that all of the claim would be published but part of it would be &mdash; we have to provide more resources for the detection of abuse if we are to continue to provide a caring service for <Col N="931" /> those who are genuinely in need.  I believe that the personal social services number will go a long way to cleaning up the system and streamlining the procedures which the Department has at its disposal.  As long as civil liberties are protected and the Data Protection Commissioner is satisfied that the Data Protection Act, 1988, is being complied with I could not support this amendment, and I would be happy to support the Government on this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is that the Data Protection Commissioner is not satisfied with the proposals.  Together with everybody else in this House I totally support any move by the Minister to eliminate fraud and bring about efficiency in the service.  Like Deputy De Rossa, I did not like the fact that the Minister lumped together efficiency, effectiveness, rationalisation, cutbacks and fraud in one breath.  Will the Minister give us a breakdown of the £90 million and quantify exactly the level of fraud that has been detected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Fraud takes place in many sectors of society but why are we continually focusing on the social welfare sector?  A stigma is being developed about social welfare recipients.  I know a lot about this because in my constituency there is high unemployment and people are made to feel bad because they are unemployed.  Earlier we raised the point that people are intimidated and degraded at times by the medical referee system. Under the guise of controlling fraud, the Minister is proposing to invade the privacy of the individual.  This is akin to a garda kicking down every door on a street when investigating an incident in order to find the culprit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify why the term &ldquo;personal social services number&rdquo; is used?  If there is an exchange of information between the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social <Col N="932" /> Welfare at present why is the present PRSI number not retained?  Whether the Department of Finance, through the Revenue Commissioners, or his Department allocate the number is academic once there is an interchange of information between the Departments.</P>
    <P>What is involved is the thin edge of the wedge, because under the guise of a personal social services number people will be obliged to produce this number in the first instance for social welfare and subsequently for education, health and housing services.  Eventually there will be an exchange of information between all these agencies and this will seriously impact on the rights of the individual. For example, if a person applies for an infectious diseases grant will he have to produce his personal social services number and, as a result, if he subsequently applies to the Department of Education for a job will the Department check through his past to find out some of the most private details of his life?  All those provisions empower the Minister to develop this matter at some future date.  The Commissioner was quite specific in his statement and it is not acceptable that the Minister should come into the House and say that he included extra provisions in the Bill, but withdrew them at the request of the Data Protection Commissioner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

      <P>I apologise, they were proposals and they were withdrawn.  I will withdraw the part of my amendment which states that section 31 of the Act of 1988 is hereby repealed if the Minister accepts the first part so that the Data Protection Commissioner can make a clearcut statement on the position and that further legislation to protect the rights of individuals may be introduced. That is a reasonable request.  We would all go home happy knowing that the privacy of the individual is protected.  I am aware it is not the Minister's responsibility <Col N="933" /> to introduce legislation in that regard, but further legislation relating to data protection is necessary.</P>

It will be necessary only for specified social welfare and revenue purposes.  That is what links it directly to the Data Protection Act, 1988. This card will be issued for specific social welfare and revenue purposes.  Section 2 (1) (c) states that the data shall be kept only for one or more specified and lawful purposes and shall not be used or disclosed in any manner incompatible with that purpose or purposes.  That is the direct link to the Data Protection Act, 1988.  The purposes are specified and they are lawful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 of the Data Protection Act, 1988 which deals with the protection of individuals with regard to personal data.  The Data Protection Commissioner is happy with the purpose for which we are taking this action because it is consistent with the data protection <Col N="934" /> legislation.  The person's name, RSI number, date of birth and sex will be coded on to the card.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know, we will have to wait and see.  It was about the universal use of a card that the Data Protection Commissioner spoke.  In his view the legislation introduced to cover the use of the RSI number or card should be limited to revenue, social insurance and related matters.  I assure Deputies that the introduction of this card is consistent with that and that it will be used specifically for those purposes.</P>
      <P>We have been issuing cards for years. At present people have a dark pink card which crumbles when it gets damp.  We are now introducing a modern plastic card which can be used in the same way as other plastic cards.  It can be updated when necessary and is convenient for the customer.  It will facilitate the increasing incidence of electronic fund transfers and it specifically relates to the service we provide.</P>
      <P>If we wished to go outside the specifics of our work, legislation would be required.  It would have to be brought before this House and debated in its widest context.  We are merely modernising our own system and on that basis I hope Deputy Allen will accept the assurances I have given.  I cannot accept his amendments but I assure him that he can rest at ease in his bed in Cork.  I would not like him to be concerned about the matter.  I do not wish to be involved in anything beyond my own specific portfolio.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to come to that.  I want to make a general point in regard to the time available.  While we on the Opposition benches were reasonably helpful to the Minister in regard to a time frame within which various sections might be dealt with, that did not overcome the difficulty whereby most of the sections were not debated.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the failure of the Bill to deal adequately with the provision of circulars issued by the Department to Members of the House.  I raised this matter a number of times with the Minister. Indeed, I raised it today at Question Time specifically in relation to the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  I tabled an amendment which sought to oblige the Minister to place in the Library any circulars or codes of practice he might issue to community welfare officers.  The Minister indicated that he thought those circulars would be too technical for Deputies to understand.  I do not know who drafted the Minister's reply but he should have a word with them about its implications.  The job of this House is to deal with legislation, we do so reasonably well and in a commonsense way given that the vast majority of Deputies are lay people.  I take exception to the implication in the Minister's reply with regard to the reason for circulars, which are for the eyes only of community welfare officers, not being sent out.  I also take exception to the fact that I received a letter from the Department telling me that Circulars 14/92 and 18/92 are for issue only to community welfare officers. I was elected to this House and I am entitled to see those circulars as is anybody employed by the Eastern Health Board or by the Departments of Health and Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="936" /> The Minister said that if I knew of any individual cases in which he might be able to help he would be prepared to deal with them.  My purpose in raising this issue repeatedly in recent months is not only to ensure that the problems of particular individuals, who may have the good fortune to come to my advice centres, are sorted out but because a large number of people affected by Circulars 14/92 and 18/92 will not be considered because they did not go to a TD or did not have a TD to represent them who has the ear of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I knew this matter was coming up today and I specifically made an inquiry of people in the health board as to how these circulars are being implemented.  I was informed that these circulars are being operated now and things have not really changed.  For instance after the first circular was issued the client was told that if he or she allowed the electricity bill to mount up to two bills they would be paid. Special circumstances have now come into play such as sickness, death, funerals, fire or junior and leaving certificate fees.  The bottom line is that there is no automatic entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance in this instance &mdash; I am talking about ESB bills &mdash; for people on long term social welfare. Christmas and very cold winters are not considered either.  Community welfare officers consider that the so-called clarification of Circular 14/92 leaves them in the same position.  All I am asking is that the Minister says today he will issue a further circular cancelling Circulars 14/92 and 18/92 so that the position will revert to that which existed prior to July of last year.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he is introducing a new code of practice and new guidelines and I have no problem with that.  I hope we will have an opportunity in this House to debate those guidelines and have an input to them.  Nevertheless, that is a separate issue.  In the period between now and the time at which the Minister issues the new code of practice people will continue to suffer as a result of the application of those circulars.  The Minister pointed out that he has allocated an <Col N="937" /> extra £11.5 millon or £12 million &mdash; the figure seems to vary&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure is £12.5 million.</P>

      <P>I applaud the introduction of the increase in the supplementary welfare allowance scheme and I hope it goes a long way in helping those who avail of the scheme.  However, people are being denied assistance.  This scheme is supposed to be the last resort, the safety net for people who cannot get unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit.  However, because of the operation of these two circulars people are being denied assistance.  It would not cost a fortune to cancel the circulars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the Minister of the opening paragraph of the Combat Poverty Agency report of 1991 which states: &ldquo;As the scheme of last resort in the Social Welfare System, the supplementary welfare allowance scheme has a critical role to play in preventing people falling into poverty.&rdquo;  That is the purpose of the scheme, but it is being undermined by the existence of these two circulars.  The fact that the Minister has already announced he intends to withdraw the circulars means the worst is over as far as he and the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, is concerned.  All I am asking is that he issues a further circular today or tomorrow cancelling these two circulars so that people who are in need will get immediate assistance rather than having to wait perhaps weeks &mdash; no one knows how long they may have to wait because the Minister has refused to tell us.  I was told three weeks ago that the new code would be introduced shortly and that the circulars would be withdrawn but we are still waiting.  There are people who need help and I appeal to the Minister to take action.  It is not acceptable for the Minister to give smart alec replies and make imputations about why I am raising this matter.  I am raising it because there are people in need of help. By cancelling the circulars a number of people &mdash; albeit small &mdash; will be helped, <Col N="938" /> and I appeal to the Minister to do so immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael agreed to the Minister's request to complete Committee Stage of this Bill in one day but it is the last time we will agree to this arrangement.  In future we will vote against such a proposal because the exercise today was unsatisfactory.  We are dealing with a budget of more than £3 billion in an area affecting more than one million people and we had very little time to consider Committee Stage.  A number of us are newcomers to this brief and while the Minister has officials, programme managers and advisers, many of us do not have such resources and must come to grips with complex and detailed legislation and regulations.</P>
      <P>I do not like the patronising and smart alec responses from the Minister to questions which are of legitimate concern to us.  If that practice continues, the future relationship will be very bad.  Because the Opposition is badly resourced we are dependent on voluntary people, committed to the cause of social justice, to carry out research for us.</P>
      <P>In relation to the circulars, I do not accept the almost secret society manner in which the Department of Social Welfare acts in dealing with people who are victims of society, economic failure and illness.  To have legislation and regulations circumvented by circulars is unacceptable. Legislators serving the people who elect us are not informed of these circulars &mdash; Circular 14/92 is a typical example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I left this House today &mdash; I have been here since 10.30 a.m. &mdash;to ask somebody to make a telephone call arising from a comment made by the Minister and I was informed that community welfare officers are continuing to exercise the conditions set out in the circulars.  To say that guidelines will be introduced in the near future is not good enough for me or for the people seriously affected by these circulars. The Minister may be able to wait but those people cannot.  I am not trying to over-dramatise the situation, but this weekend again, loan sharks and moneylenders <Col N="939" /> will be pressuring people to the point of suicide and still the Minister can only say that he will issue new guidelines. The opinion of the legal advisers of the EHB is that Circular 14/92 is illegal in that it limits by circular the entitlement given to people by the original legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that the supplementary welfare allowance has increased to £12 million.  That is because extra money is being paid out due to inefficiency and delays in the Department in processing legitimate claims, because of the strictures relating to appeals and fresh appeals and because of cases where people with successful appeals are dragged before medical referee again a few months later and the whole round starts again.  Another reason for the increase in the supplementary welfare allowance relates to the increase in rent supplements because of the housing crisis. People cannot get places from the local authorities and are going into rented accommodation.  The rent supplement is going directly to the landlords.  The increases in social welfare have been well matched by the cutbacks in the other schemes in operation.</P>
    <P>We as legislators try to do our best, but we need co-operation and consideration in relation to the legislation that comes before us.  I would ask the Minister immediately to withdraw these repressive circulars which are demoralising people and driving them into despair.  If the Minister wishes to issue new guidelines in the future he can do that but in the meantime he should withdraw the circulars that are badly affecting so many people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not repeat what has been said but I agree with the comments made about those circulars.  I am concerned that people are suffering immediately as a result of the circulars. This is the first time I have been involved in taking a Bill through the House like this.  I noticed that Second Stage was over-long but that Committee Stage, which perhaps is more important, is not long enough.  It is on Committee Stage <Col N="940" /> that Opposition Deputies may be able to make constructive contributions.  Today we were very constrained in time.</P>
      <P>I had tabled an amendment requesting the Minister to review the concept of child benefit and the notion of a child dependant allowance, and to introduce a system of age grading.  At the moment, neither the child benefit nor the child dependant allowance takes account of the greater cost of rearing older children. That is a big failure in our child support systems.  A great deal of research has been done on the varying costs to parents as children move through the different developmental stages.  The Combat Poverty Agency has given figures based on research into the different costs of rearing children.  I am sure the Minister has been acquainted with the figures they produced, and which were very well costed, as the Combat Poverty Agency made a submission to the Minister in relation to the budget.  This is one area in which we could enhance our child income support system to make it more realistic so that it would meet the adequacy criteria which is very important.</P>
      <P>The Commission on the Status of Women in their report also dealt extensively with the proposal that child income support by way of child benefit payments and the child dependant's allowance should be age graded.  I would impress that on the Minister.  I am sorry that my amendment was ruled out of order because technically it would have involved a charge on the Exchequer.  My amendment really just asked the Minister to review and accept the concept.  I would be grateful if he would do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a full and comprehensive debate.  Deputies have said that they could do with more time and I suppose they could, but we had an election, we have had Estimates, the budget and now the Social Welfare Bill. In financial terms we are facing into an extremely difficult year having regard to the number of unemployed people for whom we have to cater.  We are a relatively small country.  I listened this morning to a man on the radio saying that we <Col N="941" /> should have various benefits because they have them in Germany and France.  I am sure we should, but Germany and France have very big populations and they do not have the shape of population we have.  We have considerable difficulty in catering for the number of dependants we have, to whom workers have to contribute. We are paying 1.5 million people through the insurance as well as the assistance schemes.  People have said that from 25 per cent to 30 per cent of the population are on the poverty line or close to it, but we are paying a higher proportion of the population than that, because we are paying those on insurance schemes as well as those on assistance schemes.  To have paid a general increase which keeps everybody ahead of inflation is an achievement.  The latest indication is that inflation will be below 3 per cent and we have given increases of 3.5 per cent.  We are maintaining our position against inflation and are doing somewhat more than that.  We are improving some of the basic schemes.  Naturally I would like to do more and I will be pressing to get more from the national cake but we have to recognise that in this Bill and in associated measures we are providing £180 million extra.  That is a substantial allocation on the part of the Government. One can argue about individual elements of the social welfare code, and people will argue, because they are concerned to get more in a particular area.</P>
      <P>The pre-budget forum was very helpful in that people on different rates saw the problems of others and recognised the reality.  That probably brought more tolerance in relation to the allocation of resources.  People were very helpful in that regard.  I pay tribute to the different organisations who participated in the forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of issues have taken a great deal of time in this Bill.  One issue relates to the question of internal technical communications. I cannot say to an organisation, whether it be my own Department or the health boards under the Department of Health, that all the communications have to be made available <Col N="942" /> publicly.  Perhaps that is how they should be.  Once that happens more people are involved and in terms of internal communication one cannot send any short notes to anybody.</P>
    <P>A question has been raised about Circular 14/92 and that which superseded it, Circular 18/92.  I have given a commitment that they will be withdrawn and that the code of practice will not only be brought into operation but will be made available here on the table of the House. I will examine other areas where the entitlements of certain people may be affected.  I do not want to get into a situation where people cannot have ordinary working circulars.  I shall look at that aspect of it because frequently the circulars relate to the interpretation of entitlements.</P>
    <P>As we do not have very much time at our disposal and I do not want to delay the House unduly at this stage, I would like to thank the Deputies, and particularly the spokespersons.  I did not think I was patronising in any way.  When Deputies have a go at me I too will have a go at them.  We may as well be clear about that at this stage.  Some people said I was too nice before but I will not be that nice any more.</P>

      <P>I have here a copy of the summary of the Craig Gardner report which Deputies may wish to examine afterwards.  I could give a breakdown of fraud, abuse, unwarranted claiming and so on but it is all tied up in terminology. When you look at the beginning of the year and see the amount of money being spent and see that certain things are happening, specific action has to be taken to deal with them.  Very little fraud is involved in pensions.  Something which does occur is that increased incomes are not declared and when the person dies the money is handed on to someone else but quite an amount of that money has been recovered.  It is difficult to explain fraud.  Some people admit to fraud while some cases involving fraud are taken to court.  As Minister, my most recent <Col N="943" /> experience is of individuals saying: &ldquo;I accept this fraud has occurred, it should not have happened but please do not drag me through the courts&rdquo;.  That is the other side of the coin.  That brings me back to the point about having a facility for dealing with it without having to take people to court.</P>
      <P>I look forward to future debates and discussions.  I want to be as open as possible, bearing in mind that we are limited by resources.  Some very worthwhile measures are contained in this Bill, including a number of technical adjustments in the pensions area.  We have now had some experience of the Pensions Act, 1990, and the Pensions Board wish to make some adjustments.</P>
      <P>I thank the House for the consideration it has given to the Bill.  I thank the spokespersons for their contributions which, as always on social welfare, were interesting, lively and well-informed.  I think it is better to leave the legal people outside because it is the knowledge of the spokespersons that is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the press were in touch with me yesterday pointing out that I had indicated that they were not present when we were discussing these matters. They made the point &mdash; which I accept &mdash; that they were listening in and were watching it on television and were fully in touch.  I accept that absolutely.  I should say the same applies to Deputies and I would ask the members of the press to remember that when they are writing <Col N="944" /> about us the next time.  They were not slow to inform me they were actually listening to the debate and were watching it on television.  Perhaps it proved a point.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debates. - Payment for UN Peace-Keeping Duties.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrianFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. B. Fitzgerald Mr. B. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>For over 30 years Ireland has played a major role in peace-keeping operations all over the world under the United Nations flag.  Thirty-three thousand personnel have proudly represented Ireland in those operations. Many stayed on long after the central conflict was over to protect borders and to help restore normality in those countries. Currently we have men in ten of the 30 areas where there are UN peace-keeping operations.  About 800 personnel are involved.  During the past 30 years many have paid the supreme sacrifice in the promotion of peace.  Many have been injured and maimed.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately we have not been paid and we are owed quite a lot of money. We have always paid our contributions, in terms of both finance and manpower. Others who could well afford to pay and have very high budgets for their own defence forces appear to renege on their financial commitments to the UN and expect small countries like Ireland to suffer.  When so many of our troops are away for so many months of the year, one must ask whether they are adequately compensated.  That is, perhaps, a matter for another day but it must be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot afford to be owed in excess of $20 million.  We have just had a debate on social welfare and we saw the serious constraints on the budget in many areas. That kind of money could go a long way <Col N="947" /> towards building Tallaght hospital, for example.</P>
    <P>Every effort must be made to obtain what we are owed from the United Nations.  Pressure must be put on those countries who are reneging on their obligations to fund the peace-keeping obligations of the UN.  I would ask the Tánaiste what he proposes to do to obtain payment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring) Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to reassure Deputies that the question of arrears of funds owed by the United Nations to Ireland, which currently stand at approximately £6 million, is a matter of great and ongoing concern to the Government.  We continue to take every opportunity to make representations to all those concerned to urge the payment of our entitlement and the full reimbursement of arrears.  As recently as 19 March, I wrote in strong terms to the UN Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, seeking urgent action in the matter and have instructed our Permanent Representative in New York to continue to press for an early and satisfactory resolution of this problem.</P>
      <P>Throughout its membership of the United Nations, Ireland has had a strong commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter.  We have sought to give tangible expression to that commitment and to the role of the organisation in international affairs through our involvement in UN peace-keeping stretching back over 30 years.  It is a record in which Irish people take great pride.  Over 33,000 members of our Permanent Defence Forces have had the honour of serving under the United Nations flag.  Ireland contributes personnel to ten of the current 13 UN peace-keeping operations.  Several of our soldiers have been killed and many more injured in the service of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>The Government is conscious of the necessity for the United Nations to have adequate resources to carry out the tasks entrusted to it by the member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="948" /> We have, accordingly, been consistently supportive of the Secretary General's efforts to remedy the long-standing financial problems of the United Nations and have ensured that our annual contributions have been paid promptly and in full, even in times of extreme national budgetary difficulties.  Our national budgetary difficulties lend added urgency to the question of the payment of arrears due to us in respect of troops contributed to a number of peace-keeping operations.</P>
    <P>The reasons for the financial difficulties which have beset UN peace-keeping operations are well known.  The past and continuing failure of a number of member states to respect their legal obligation to pay their assessed contributions in full and on time places a huge and unfair burden on both the organisation itself and on those countries which contribute troops for peace-keeping duties. This is especially so at a time when the United Nations is being called upon to contribute to an ever-increasing number of peace-keeping operations.  If the UN is to function effectively, and respond to the many demands placed on the organisation, it is imperative that all member states pay their mandatory assessed contributions in full and on time.</P>
    <P>There has been an improvement in the payment performance of member states in recent years and this has enabled the UN to increase the rate of reimbursement to Governments that contribute to UNIFIL.  However, there remained a shortfall of $228 million on the UNIFIL account as of the beginning of January 1993, as compared with $231 million as of mid-July 1992.  The amount outstanding by way of reimbursement on arrears owing to Ireland stood at $15 million for UNIFIL at the end of February 1993.  The other major item of arrears is £0.8 million owned on foot of our participation in UNFICYP, the UN force in Cyprus.</P>
    <P>As regards our service in Lebanon, to which the Deputy particularly referred, I am satisfied that UNIFIL performs a valuable function in South Lebanon.  It provides an element of stability in a <Col N="949" /> region of major international concern as well as contributing to the security and humantarian needs of the local population. The continued presence of the Force also constitutes an expression of the commitment of the international community to the unity and integrity of the State of Lebanon.  Continued Irish participation in UNIFIL is fully consistent with Ireland's firm commitment to the United Nations and to our tradition of support for the principles and practices of UN peace-keeping.  The Irish contingent, by virtue of its long service and its reputation for professionalism, is a key element in the entire UNIFIL operation.</P>
    <P>Ireland's commitment to the cause of international peace and security through our participation in UN operations remains undiminished and we will continue to pursue vigorously the question of the arrears owed to us on foot of UN peace-keeping.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debates. - EC Restrictions on Intervention Beef.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The reduction in the weight limit of beef carcases going into intervention, which is about to be implemented, will deal a crippling blow to Irish beef producers and the beef industry in general.  Coming on top of other restrictions under the Common Agriculture Policy and restrictions which are part of the GATT process, either in the pipeline or already in effect, this measure promises very bleak times ahead for beef producers.  It means that up to 60 per cent of our beef and up to two-thirds of qualifying carcases which are currently eligible will no longer qualify for intervention.  While we clearly need to avoid excessive reliance on intervention, this restriction on weight limits takes away yet another plank from the floor which the intervention system had put under the market heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not heard much from the Minister on this issue and I am delighted he is here.  The Minister's performance on this issue has been nothing short of abysmal.  He has complained of not getting enough support from other member <Col N="950" /> states in this matter.  He should have learnt by now that on an issue of this kind one cannot wait for support to come, one must go out and build it.  He should be building it among other member states and the Minister has clearly failed to do so.  On Tuesday night of last week I attended a very large meeting of beef producers in Enfield, County Meath which was also attended by the Minister of State at the Minister's Department, Deputy Hyland.  I could not make up my mind whether I should laugh or weep as I heard the Minister of State say, on the one hand, that there is no chance of negotiating this measure and, on the other, say that the doors of the Minister and the Minister of State are always open.  The audience clearly got the meassage; he has nothing to offer but bluff. The truth is that this measure could have been specifically designed to undermine Irish beef production and that the Minister has failed to take any action to head it off.</P>
    <P>It is not that there has not been good advice available.  TEAGASC, for example, has pointed out other ways to further reduce quantities being taken into intervention, if that indeed is what must be done, and how that could be done in a way that would not discriminate uniquely against Irish beef producers.  These could be based on fat classes or on confirmation or could simply take the form of limiting the proportion of a plant's qualifying output that could be taken into intervention.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence so far that the Minister has listened to that advice or that if he listened to it he understood it or that if he understood it he took any action on it.  All we have had from the Minister has been his now habitual genial bumbling with vague assurances that everything would be all right on the day, the kind of assurances he has given so often since he was appointed about the carcase weight limitations, the prompt payment of premiums and about disadvantaged areas.  The Minister's response at the end of a meeting if he has no good news to give to anybody is to <Col N="951" /> wink, nod and smile and say that it will be all right on the day.</P>
    <P>On this occasion we know it is not going to be all right on the day because this measure is going to cut the tripe out of our beef industry.  We need to know if the Minister is going to wake up, and what he is going to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh) Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>In December 1992, the EC Commission without any prior consultation with the member states placed a proposal before the beef management committee to exclude from intervention all animals over 325 kgs, with effect from 1 January 1993.  Following strong opposition, particularly from the Irish delegation, within the beef management committee, the Commission changed the proposed limit to 340 kgs.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, at the December meeting of the Council of Ministers, I strenuously objected to the Commission's proposal.  I pointed out that, since it would render ineligible for intervention more than 60 per cent of our eligible steers, it would affect Ireland disproportionately. As a result of my pressure, and that of some other Ministers in the Council, the Commission decided to postpone the implementation of the 340 kg weight limit until 1 March 1993.</P>
      <P>In the first week of the new Commissioner's term of office, I went to Brussels to dissuade Mr. Steichen from proceeding with the 340 kgs limit.  I also made my views known to the new Irish Commissioner, Mr. Flynn.</P>
      <P>The case I presented both to the two Commissioners and at the December Council was that the proposed limit would be discriminatory as between member states and particularly so in Ireland's case; undermine the economics of extensive production and disrupt the market, not just in Ireland but in other member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While accepting that some measures were necessary to respect the annual limits on intervention in-take decided by the Council of Ministers last year as part <Col N="952" /> of Common Agricultural Policy reform, I made it clear that such measures must not discriminate against any member state; must not render extensive production less economic and must not disrupt the market.</P>
    <P>I urged that the Commission should enter into consultation with the member states in order to arrive at an alternative proposal that would meet these criteria.</P>
    <P>The week following my meeting with Commissioner Steichen, the Commission responded by modifying their proposal substantially.  The modified proposal was to phase-in the 340 kgs limit over the period to 1 July 1994 by introducing two intermediate steps &mdash; a limit of 380 kgs on 1 July 1993 and a limit of 360 kgs on 1 January 1994.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this substantial change in the Commission's position, I have continued to oppose their proposal. I raised it at each subsequent meeting of the Council of Ministers, in January, in February and again in March.  I have also raised it with Commissioner Steichen at a further bilateral meeting last week.</P>
    <P>At this point, I should make it clear that there is a substantial majority of the member states in favour of a weight restriction along the lines proposed by the Commission.  Nevertheless, because of the opposition maintained by those few member states who are against the proposal, the Commission postponed the final adoption of the proposal until Wednesday of this week.  Even then, the Commission, in adopting the proposal, decided that a report should be prepared on the beef market including the intervention system and the operation of the 380 kgs limit before the end of the year, that is, before the second phase comes into effect.  This decision to consider a report on the matter before the second phase was due to further intensive pressure which I brought to bear.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the final adoption of the proposal by the Commission and the possible outcome of the report due before the second phase, I intend to raise the issue again most forcefully at the next meeting of the Council of Ministers.  I <Col N="953" /> regard this important issue far from closed.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debates. - Knocklyon (Dublin) New School Proposal.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now clear that the former Minister for Education, Deputy Séamus Brennan, committed a gross fraud on the Knocklyon community in November last.  For his own electoral purposes, he circulated a letter dated 13 November 1992 stating that he had sanctioned the construction of Knocklyon Community School being &ldquo;a 400 pupil school with first year intake scheduled for September 1994&rdquo;.  The letter continued that he had instructed his Department to immediately begin the process and named consultants for the project.  It stated:</P>
      <P>An amount of £250,000 has been included in the Department of Education Estimates for 1993 to enable the project to proceed.  The school is scheduled to be built in two stages and will be funded over the financial period 1993-95.</P>
      <P>Following the circulation of this letter, I warned the local community to be cautious as at that time no Government spending Estimates had been finalised, approved or agreed for 1993 and it seemed to me that the Minister's letter was grossly misleading.  Nevertheless, it was my hope that it was a prelude to the school being constructed.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, a letter was circulated by Deputy Brennan, signed by a civil servant in the Department of Education, Mr. Noel Montayne, detailing plans for the construction of the school with a hand-written note added on by the then Minister accusing me of questioning his &ldquo;integrity on the Knocklyon school project&rdquo;. Sadly, I was right to do so.</P>
      <P>It is now clear that my words of caution were correctly voiced.  On 11 March 1993 the Minister for Education stated that the school was not included in the 1993 capital programme and is now clear that no construction will start in 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="954" /> There is no indication that the construction of the school will commence in 1994.</P>
    <P>The 11 March 1993 was the first Education Question Time after the general election.  In the days preceding it, knowing that he was about to be publically caught with his trousers down, Deputy Brennan who is now a junior Minister, engaged in a face-saving correspondence with the Minister for Education, making a pretence that she had in some way reversed a final decision made by the Government last November.  The media story that emerged following the Dáil Question Time was one of a row between Deputy Brennan and the present Minister for Education and was portrayed by him as a struggle between Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party with the former Minister being in some way let down by the current Minister.</P>
    <P>The truth is, of course, different.  The truth is that no final spending plans of the Department of Education for 1993 were approved by Government in either October or November 1992 and no such plans could have been approved until some days immediately prior to the budget. This was confirmed in an answer to a Dáil Question on Tuesday of this week by the current Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>The present Minister is being blamed by Deputy Brennan, and his supporters in Knocklyon, for what has taken place. It is clear, of course, that the current Minister has no commitment to the construction of Knocklyon community school.  It is also clear, however, that Deputy Brennan was simply involved last autumn in a piece of political chicanery for his own electoral advantage.  His commitment to the construction of Knocklyon community school was as much of a political illusion as were the trees planted some years ago by Deputy Ray Burke on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party the day before the Dublin West by-election which were mysteriously dug up and removed when the count was complete.</P>
    <P>Instead of engaging in a phoney interparty war with the current Minister for Education, Deputy Brennan should show some humility and come into this House <Col N="955" /> and apologise to the people of Knocklyon for his conduct.  He should also explain how a letter signed by an official of the Department of Education came to be written and used by him for electoral purposes, the contents of which have now been proved false.  The present Minister should also explain to this House what took place and should tell the House and the people of Knocklyon whether she or Minister Brennan is telling the truth about the events of recent months.  It is unfortunate that the Minister for Education is not here and that the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Aylward, has been sent in to bat this evening.  No doubt, he will provide protection for Minister Brennan.</P>
    <P>Parents in Knocklyon are entitled to know the true story and whether there is any realistic possibility of this Government constructing the community school that has been badly needed for so many years.  We should know the true plans of the Government, not just for 1993 but for the rest of its term, so that parents are in a position to take the necessary decisions for the future schooling of their children.  The future education of the children of Knocklyon should not be placed at risk by Government politicians who are either unwilling or incapable of telling them the true story.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  It is unfortunate, however, that he had to resort to personal attacks on Members of the House, and I am sorry that he chose to do so.  As the Deputy should be aware, the Department purchased a site of more than 11 acres in the Knocklyon area in 1982, when it was considered that the demand for post-primary places in the area would require the provision of a new post-primary school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throughout the eighties the question of providing a school at Knocklyon was reviewed on a regular basis.  In 1984 the former Minister, Gemma Hussey, decided to defer the opening of the school until 1988.  In 1988, following a further <Col N="956" /> review, the former Minister, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, decided not to proceed with the proposed school for Knocklyon but to retain the site in Department ownership.</P>
    <P>The Department has, since 1988, been regularly reviewing the needs at post-primary level, present and future, of the Knocklyon area.  In 1992 the former Minister, Deputy Séamus Brennan, met a deputation representing the Knocklyon post-primary committee at which the results of a community survey carried out by the committee were given to him. Following a further meeting with the Knocklyon committee and having considered all the facts of the case, the Minister decided in November 1992 that the school for Knocklyon should be proceeded with.  I emphasise that that decision stands.  Accusations of fraud against Deputy Séamus Brennan, the former Minister, are scandalous and should be withdrawn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>The letter issued by Minister Brennan was issued in good faith, and that is well known by Deputy Shatter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was envisaged at that stage that construction of the school building would commence in 1993.  When the present Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, took office earlier this year she undertook a review of the post-primary capital programme following confirmation of the capital allocation for 1993 in the published Estimates for Public Services.  Regrettably, it was not possible to include the project for Knocklyon in the 1993 programme within the allocation available and having regard to other commitments and priorities, <Col N="957" /> including the needs for disadvantaged areas.</P>

      <P>However, the inclusion of the Knocklyon school project in the capital programme will be reviewed in the context of educational planning criteria and in the light of available resources and other commitments and priorities.  Again I emphasise that the decision to provide a school at Knocklyon still stands.</P>

      <P>The Minister is convinced of the need for a more orderly approach to the process by which major building projects are selected for release to construction each year.  It is her intention to have future decisions on the progress of major projects, through the architectural planning process up to the signing of a contract, based on objective criteria related to relevant educational, building and financial factors.  It is also desirable that the criteria on which projects are selected, prioritised and advanced through the planning process be made known to the relevant school authorities and local interest groups.</P>

      <P>Despite Ireland's demands and encouragements to American firms to set up in Ireland and demands to the American Government, <Col N="958" /> renewed again last week during St. Patrick's Day celebrations, to allow more of our young Irish people to be legalised in the United States, Ireland continues to refuse passports to many thousands of eligible United States citizens who applied for Irish passports under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986.</P>
      <P>Problems arose when the 1986 legislation was being implemented and people eligible to apply for registration of foreign birth had to do so by 31 December 1986.  Many thousands of people in the United States, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand and other countries made application.  No special provision were made in the embassies and consul offices in those countries to deal with the huge numbers eligible to apply.  For that reason many applications were received on time but were not dealt with by 31 December 1986.  Early in 1987 the Attorney General advised the Government that an amendment to the 1986 legislation was required to enable registration after 31 December 1986 of applications that had been received on time but had not been registered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been trying for at least four years, and have approached successive Ministers of Justice, to have the necessary amending legislation brought in.  My pleas have fallen on deaf ears.  It is now a matter of great embarrassment to Irish diplomats, particularly in the United States but also elsewhere, that applicants are constantly writing to embassies asking when the matter will be clarified and sorted out.  There is no controversy attached to the amendment of the legislation, and it is, therefore, important for good relations with other countries that the Minister immediately arranges to have the amendment tabled.  The matter has been raised in the United States Congress by Congressman Ray McGrath and personally with the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Gerry Collins, but nothing has been done.  One applicant wrote to the Taoiseach but after three months had still not received even an acknowledgement of his letter.  The Minister may have come across applicants <Col N="959" /> caught in this trap while on her recent long visit to Australia.</P>
    <P>I now ask the Minister to introduce the amending legislation that will, after nearly six years, allow these people to get their Irish passports.</P>

      <P>I make this reply on behalf of the Minister for Justice and I apologise for her absence.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice explained in some detail the background to this issue in response to a parliamentary question on Tuesday last from Deputy Avril Doyle.  I think it would be helpful if I repeated now for the information of the House what the Minister said in her reply.</P>
      <P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986, which introduced certain amendments to the 1956 Act of the same name provides that a person born outside Ireland may register as an Irish citizen if he or she has an Irish-born grandparent or, in certain circumstances, great-grandparent. The applicant's details are registered in the Foreign Births Register in the Department of Foreign Affairs or in the Foreign Births Entry Book kept in missions abroad.</P>
      <P>The 1986 Act tightened up the provisions contained in the 1956 Act by providing, among other things, that the fourth generation applicant &mdash; that is, a person whose great-grandparent was born in Ireland &mdash; can be registered only if the parent through whom he or she is claiming Irish descent was already registered at the time of his or her birth.</P>
      <P>Section 8 of the 1986 Act contains a transitional provision which provided for a six months grace period, ending on 31 December 1986, during which the previous provisions continued to apply.  The period, however, related not to the receipt of applications, but to the completion of the process, that is, registration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the period of grace, the number of fourth generation applications for registration received by the Department of Foreign Affairs and diplomatic and consular missions abroad reached unprecedented <Col N="960" /> levels, in particular at the Consulate General in New York and the Consulate in Johannesburg.  Emergency measures were taken to deal with the large volume of applications, including the employment of additional staff and the sanctioning of overtime.  The result of that was that over 4,200 applications were processed in the 12 months ending 31 December 1986, a considerable achievement given that the overall total processed in the previous three years was somewhat less than that.  However, there remained over 3,000 applications from fourth generation, and mixed third fourth generation applicants which had not been registered by the end of 1986.</P>
    <P>When it was realised that the backlog of applications could not be dealt with by the end of the statutory deadline, the views of the then Attorney General were sought.  The advice received was to the effect that there is no legal basis on which to grant registration to those who had been caught by the deadline of 31 December 1986 and that amending legislation was required to allow for the registration as Irish citizens of those persons who had applied but whose applications had not been finalised.</P>
    <P>Since then, the position is that a number of other possible changes in the legislation governing Irish citizenship have been under consideration, and consultations in the matter have been taking place between the Departments of Justice and Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister for Justice made it clear on Tuesday last that the situation needs to be tackled as a matter of urgency, bearing in mind the many cases which have remained unresolved for some years.  The Minister also made it clear that it is her intention to submit proposals to the Government with a view to resolving this issue as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 25 and 54 together.  Prior to 1986, share fishermen were covered by PAYE and PRSI on the same basis as other workers.  In 1986, a High Court judgment ruled in the case of a particular fishing vessel that the skipper and his crew should not be regarded as employer and employee for PAYE purposes.  However, share fishermen continued to be regarded as employees for social welfare purposes until last year, when the High Court ruled that the relevant regulations were not valid.  As a result, share fishermen are now regarded as self-employed for PRSI purposes.  This gives them entitlement to long term benefits like pensions, but not to short term payments.</P>
      <P>I recently met representatives of the Irish Fisherman's Organisation to discuss this situation.  At that meeting, a number of options were raised, and these are currently being examined by my Department. One of the options being considered is the creation of a special contribution class for share fishermen; such an arrangement would, of course, involve the payment of a suitable level of contribution as well as the award of benefits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication of the report on the Second Commission on the Status of Women, which I see as an important development for the future of women in Irish society.  The minority report, consisting as it does of proposals <Col N="865" /> not contained in the majority report, serves as a very valuable complement. Both reports are being closely examined by my Department and an action list of measures to be taken in the area of social welfare will be drawn up.</P>
      <P>The section of the minority report to which the Deputy refers argues that married couples are discriminated against in the social welfare code, in that the rate of payment for an unemployed married couple with two children is less than that payable to two lone parents with one child each.  The reason for this provision is, of course, that provision for widows, widowers and all lone parents recognises the additional expense of bringing up a child or children without the support of the breadwinner/partner.</P>
      <P>It is generally recognised that economies of scale are achieved where more than one adult lives in a household.  This has been acknowledged in various independent studies including a study on the Irish social welfare system carried out by the ESRI.  The treatment of dependent spouses in the social welfare system takes account of these economies of scale.</P>
      <P>The question of increasing payments in respect of adult dependants would need to be examined in this light and also in the light of available resources. Furthermore, if efforts were made to reduce the gap between married dependants and single persons, measures would have to be taken to ensure that the support currently given to lone parents, widows and deserted wives was not eroded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no difference between the child support payments made by my Department to married couples and cohabiting couples, as both are treated equally under the social welfare code. Separated persons with children, may qualify for deserted wife's benefit or lone parent's allowance.  Child dependant allowances are higher with these payments than with some other social welfare payments.  All mothers, regardless of income or marital status, are entitled to monthly child benefit.  This will be increased in this year's Social Welfare Bill to £20 in respect of the first three children and £23 in respect of the fourth and subsequent children.</P>
      <P>As regards the living alone allowance and entitlement to free electricity and gas allowances paid with social welfare pensions to persons aged 66 or over, the purpose of these allowances is to recognise the extra expense which falls particularly on pensioners when their families have left home and to provide additional support for those pensioners in that situation. The allowance is not therefore payable if the pensioner ceases to live alone.  If a son or daughter or any other person moves in for the purpose of caring for the pensioner, they may qualify for the carer's allowance in their own right. The Deputy will be interested to know the maximum rate of carer's allowance &mdash; £53 at present will increase to £59.20 with effect from July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the free electricity and gas allowances and the free television licence the pensioner may have a dependent spouse, dependent children or a person providing full-time care and attention where the pensioner is an invalid living with him and continues to draw the allowance.  In 1990, I arranged that people over 80 years of age would continue to receive these allowances where <Col N="867" /> other people, which would normally disqualify them from receiving the allowance, came to live with them.</P>
    <P>In his question, about unemployment assistance the Deputy is referring to the provisions whereby the value of free board and lodging enjoyed by claimants living at home with their parents is taken into account in the means test.  The purpose of the assessment is to achieve a degree of equity as between applicants in different household circumstances.  This provision has been a feature of the unemployment assistance scheme since its inception.  The assessment covers the value of accommodation, meals, support and maintenance as well as the value of generally sharing in the standard of living of the household.  In 1991, it was estimated that the abolition of the assessment of free board and lodging would cost the Exchequer in excess of £50 million annually.</P>
    <P>Contrary to the Deputy's suggestion that these provisions have a negative impact on families they were specifically designed to recognise the additional supports that pensioners living on their own need and to bring about a degree of equity between different family circumstances in households.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 32 and 59 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the qualifying conditions for lone parent's allowance is that the claimant has the main care and charge of the children.  This is consistent with the <Col N="869" /> underlying objective of the scheme which is to meet the needs of people who have the responsibility of rearing children without the support of a spouse or partner.</P>
    <P>The existence of a joint custody order does not necessarily preclude a person from qualifying for lone parent's allowance. In the event that one of the parents has the main care and charge of a child, that person can, subject to the other qualifying conditions attached to the scheme, qualify for the allowance.</P>
    <P>The question as to how to deal with cases where joint custody orders have been made is currently under review within my Department.  The possibility of entitling one of the parents in joint custody situations to lone parent's allowance for example, by providing for one of the parents to be regarded for the purposes of the scheme as having the main care and charge of the child, is being examined in this context.</P>
    <P>There are other income support payments available for parents who do not come within the scope of the lone parent's allowance scheme such as unemployment assistance, or, if they are not available for work, supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>Statistics are not maintained which would indicate any developing trend in child custody cases towards joint custody orders under which the child resides equally with both parents.  In so far as child benefit is concerned, entitlement to payment is governed by regulations which confer entitlement to the mother in the first instance.  There are no provisions for sharing of child benefit between parents and my Department has never provided for this on an administrative basis.</P>

      <P>Legislation governing the supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides that a supplement may be paid to a person where his basic social welfare or health board payment is insufficient to meet his needs.  Regulations provide, <i>inter alia,</i> that a person may receive such a supplement in respect of the interest portion of his mortgage payment.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to a supplement is determined by the health board and the payment is calculated so that, after payment of mortgage interest, the person has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his family size, less £5.</P>
      <P>A change in the basis for calculation of mortgage supplements to include assistance in respect of the capital element of mortgage repayments would have major financial and other implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>As a result of the extension of <Col N="872" /> full social insurance cover to part-time workers in April 1991, many women are now becoming eligible for maternity benefit for the first time.</P>
      <P>The maternity benefit scheme pays women in current employment 70 per cent of their gross income in the relevant tax year, subject to a minimum weekly payment of £60 per week and a maximum of £154.  The Social Welfare Bill currently before the House provides for both the minimum and the maximum rate to be increased to £65 and £159 respectively.</P>
      <P>A husband on social welfare payments can receive an increase for his wife as his dependant even if she is working, provided she is earning £55 or less per week.  He can also qualify for full child dependant increases.  However, if a person who is an adult dependant on her spouse's social welfare payment is awarded a payment in her own right, in this case a maternity benefit payment, she ceases to be an adult dependant and consequently, the spouse is not entitled to claim an adult dependant allowance and the child dependant allowances are payable only at half rate.  Because of this, some part time workers earning less than £55 per week, with spouses on social welfare, can find that they are better off remaining as adult dependants on their husband's payment than claiming their own maternity benefit payment of £60 per week.</P>
      <P>This arises from the general provision in relation to overlapping social welfare payments in that an adult dependant allowance is not payable in respect of a person who is in receipt of a social welfare payment in their own right.  Where however the individual payment is less than that of the adult dependant payment the claimant may choose to opt for the higher amount.</P>

      <P>The main forms of social welfare support for spouses of deceased persons are the widow's contributory and non-contributory pension schemes and lone parent's allowance.  In addition, there are arrangements whereby a person may receive payment of their deceased spouse's pension or certain other payments for a period of six weeks after the death has occurred.  This arises mainly where the person was the adult dependent of the deceased spouse.  In these circumstances, widow's pension or lone parent's allowance is payable to the surviving spouse from the start of the seventh week after the pensioner's death.</P>
      <P>A woman whose husband has died may be eligible for a widow's contributory pension based on either her own or her late husband's insurance contributions. Alternatively she may be entitled to a means tested widow's non-contributory pension.  In the case of a bereaved man or woman with dependent children, a lone parent's allowance may be payable.</P>
      <P>My Department is conscious of the trauma and distress which people suffer on the death of their spouse.  For this reason, every effort is made to ensure that claims from surviving spouses are processed quickly so that their social welfare entitlements may be awarded with the minimum of delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It takes an average of three weeks to process a widow's contributory pension claim.  Due to the necessity to conduct a means investigation, it can take somewhat longer to award a widow's non-contributory <Col N="874" /> pension or a lone parent's allowance claim.  Where a deceased husband was in receipt of a retirement or old age contributory pension, his widow automatically qualifies for a widow's contributory pension.</P>
    <P>A person should claim the relevant pension or allowance within three months of the death of their spouse, in which case the pension or allowance will be awarded from the Friday following the date of the spouse's death.  Payment is authorised from the seventh week if the payment of the deceased person's pension. or other payment for six weeks is more favourable.</P>
    <P>Where an application is made after the three month period, payment is awarded from the date the application is received by my Department.  However, claims may be backdated for up to six months where there is a valid reason for the delay.</P>

      <P>My Department experienced accommodation problems at the Cork office during 1992 and was unable to conduct interviews immediately on the premises with its clients due to a shortage of suitable interviewing rooms.  Accordingly, delays in processing certain claims were arising.</P>
      <P>To improve service a restructuring of the Department's office was needed.  To facilitate this it was necessary to change temporarily the arrangements the office had with the Southern Health Board regarding the payment of rent and mortgage supplements.  Discussions took place with the health board and alternative arrangements have been made for a temporary period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="875" /> Rent and mortgage payments under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme continued to be paid at the Cork social welfare local office up to January 1993, when alternative and temporary arrangements were made by the Southern Health Board to pay the SWA clients through health centres in Cork city.  No complaints have been received from clients and the health board is satisfied that the present arrangements are working well.  In many instances clients are paid their supplements by post without having to call to the health centre.</P>
    <P>My Department is in touch with the Southern Health Board to arrange, as soon as possible, for the payment of rent and mortgage supplements to its clients at the Department's office when they attend once a month for signing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>The family income supplement scheme provides a weekly supplement to families with children, where one or more parent is in employment for at least twenty hours per week and where the income of the family is less than the prescribed weekly amount.  Once entitlement is established, payment in the form of a book of weekly payable orders, continues for 52 weeks while the claimant continues in employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All family income supplement claims are re-assessed on expiry of the 52 week period and any changes in the rate of payment normally arise as a result of changes in gross earnings or in the <Col N="877" /> number of eligible children.  By guaranteeing the level of payment for a definite period in this way, the scheme aims to provide a degree of stability in the claimant's anticipated income for the 52 week period.</P>
    <P>Altering the level of payment during the 52 week period as a result of changes in income, would mean that many claimants would face a reduction in or cessation of, their payment because of increases in income due to, say, overtime or wage increases or a reduction in the number of children.</P>
    <P>The fact that the family income supplement is guaranteed at a fixed rate for a period of 52 weeks represents a considerable incentive to work in that recipients can take up work with an assured level of support over an extended period. In practice, of course, the level of their payment will increase during the 52 week payment period, due to the increases in the prescribed weekly amounts which are normally announced in the budget.  This year, I have announced changes in the prescribed weekly amounts which will increase the entitlement of recipients by £12 per week on average from July 1993.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy's question relates to the tax clearance requirements as they apply to grants, subsidies and similar type payments.</P>
      <P>In 1988 the Government introduced the tax clearance system in respect of grants, subsidies and similar type payments from State and public authorities. The basic aim of this system is to ensure that individuals who benefit from public grants or subsidies have their tax affairs in order.</P>
      <P>Generally, the scheme operates on the basis that in the case of grants between £500 and £5,000 the applicant must indicate on his grant application the tax district dealing with his affairs, furnish his tax reference number and indicate that, to the best of his knowledge, his tax affairs are in order.  In the case of grants of £5,000 or more the applicant is required to produce a tax clearance certificate from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Originally, the scheme excluded payments which were wholly or partly funded by the EC.  However, as from 1 September 1991, the Government extended the scheme to such payments <Col N="879" /> other than those made under the Guarantee Section of FEOGA.</P>
    <P>It became clear, however, that the application of the tax clearance procedures in this time-frame to farmers in the disadvantaged areas seeking headage payments was likely to cause difficulty for applicants not having a tax reference number.  In those circumstances, the Government, while confirming that the extended tax clearance procedures would be maintained and would apply to all applicants for State grants and subsidies including those wholly or partly funded by the EC, decided to provide for a phasing-in, but only as regards headage grant applications by farmers in disadvantaged areas, as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the tax clearance procedures would be applied gradually so that for 1992 and 1993 applicants for headage payments who did not have a tax reference number would not be required to get one for the purpose of applying for a headage payment;</P>
    <P>&mdash;steps would be taken to improve and intensify publicity/education to allay any ungrounded fears about what tax clearance means, particularly in the case of persons in receipt of social welfare means-tested benefits and pensions.  The Revenue Commissioners, Teagasc and the Department of Agriculture and Food would be involved.</P>
    <P>&mdash;from 1 January, 1994, all applicants for headage payments must have and quote a tax reference number, as required under the tax clearance procedures.</P>
    <P>The gradual phasing in of the tax clearance procedures will provide ample opportunity for people in the disadvantaged areas who may not have a tax reference number to apply to their local tax office for such a number.  It should be stressed that from 1 January 1994 all applicants for headage payments will have to comply fully with the tax clearance procedures, and that the application <Col N="880" /> of the extended scheme introduced in September 1991 is otherwise unaffected.</P>

    <P>The latest estimate available of the cost of interest relief for the 1993-94 tax year, based on the interest rates prevailing at budget time, is £253m.  This estimate allows for the cost of the budget measures regarding the relief.</P>
    <P>The figures include a relatively small element of loan interest other than mortgage interest.</P>

      <Quest>if the 5 per cent increase in VAT on clothing and footwear is the result of the introduction of the Single Market on 1 January 1993, the resulting abolition of payment of VAT at the point of entry and the resulting budgetary problems; and if so, if it will be reduced in 1994 when VAT income for the year will return to normal.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget increase in the rate of VAT on clothing and footwear was not related to the abolition of VAT at the point of entry.  I shall be bringing forward proposals in the Finance Bill to offset the cash-flow loss arising in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in my Financial Statement on 24 February, agreements reached at European Community level permit the application of only one VAT rate in excess of an agreed standard rate minimum level of 15 per cent.  Accordingly, it was not possible to retain both the 16 and 21 per cent rates.  While the EC Directive requires that all the items at the former 16 per cent rate must ultimately become subject to the standard <Col N="883" /> rate, I was able to avail of the flexibility allowed by the EC agreement to move certain labour intensive services temporarily to the reduced rate of 12.5 per cent in the interests of employment. However, budgetary circumstances ruled out a more widespread application of a low rate to other goods and services, including adult clothing and footwear, which were previously at the 16 per cent rate, or a reduction of the standard rate. Accordingly, I decided to move these items to the existing standard rate with effect from 1 March 1993.</P>

      <P>Expenditure on the Supplementary welfare allowance scheme has increased from £44.8 million in 1989 to £101 million in 1992.  I am providing an additional £12.5 million in 1993 for expenditure on the scheme.  The substantial increase in expenditure in recent years is attributable to a number of factors.</P>
      <P>In recent years the grant has provided special increases in excess of the rate of inflation to people on supplementary welfare allowance, for example, the personal rate increased by 11 per cent in 1991 and approximately 6 per cent in 1992.</P>
      <P>In 1992 the Government substantially increased the allowances payable in respect of the clothing and footwear scheme, from £40 to £50 in respect of a child attending second level school and £25 to £35 in respect of a child attending primary school.  About 170,000 children benefit under this scheme and expenditure is met out of the supplementary welfare allowance allocation.</P>
      <P>The underlying increase in the live register in recent years has resulted in an increase in recourse to supplementary welfare allowances.</P>
      <P>A substantial proportion of the increase in expenditure is due to an increase in the amount of rent or mortgage interest payments under the scheme.  It is estimated that expenditure on rent and mortgage supplements has increased from £7 million in 1989 to £30 million in 1992.</P>

    <P>The person concerned also applied for assistance with her mortgage repayments in 1990.  Assistance with mortgage interest payments can only be given where weekly income after payment of mortgage interest is below the appropriate social welfare allowance rate less £5.

    <P>The person concerned has been advised of her right of appeal.  To date no appeal has been received.</P>

      <P>In its commentary on the recommendation that pension payments should be paid to each spouse, the Commission on the Status of Women states that a woman who is older than her husband must wait for him to qualify for the old age assistance pension before she qualifies for a payment.  Under the scheme, married women can in fact qualify for the old age assistance pension in their own right once they reach the age of 66, subject to a means test.</P>
      <P>Where both spouses satisfy the qualification conditions, payment is made directly to each spouse separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the old age contributory pension, entitlement to a payment is based on an individual's PRSI contributions <Col N="896" /> record.  Where both spouses have established an entitlement to the contributory pension, payment is again made directly to each spouse.</P>

      <P>The basic rate of disability benefit has not fallen behind changes in earnings. In the period 1988 to 1991 there was an increase of some 15 per cent in both average industrial earnings and the basic rate of disability benefit.</P>
      <P>I would also point out that the basic disability benefit rate has increased by substantially more than the rate of inflation.  Last year we increased it by 6 per cent, which was twice the rate of inflation.  This July, it will be increased by almost 5 per cent, again well above the rate of inflation.</P>
      <P>The phasing out of pay related benefit with disability benefit is part of a policy of directing available resources towards those most in need by increasing the basic rate rather than pay related additions. This policy is broadly in line with the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>The employer's PRSI exemption scheme was introduced in September 1992.  It applies to employers who recruit additional employees from the live register between 19 October 1992 and 19 September 1993.  The original closing date for recruitment under the scheme was 19 March 1993.  However, I recently extended this date to 19 September 1993 to allow employers to make maximum use of the scheme.</P>
      <P>No formal application relating to the person concerned has been received in the headquarters section of my Department which decides claims under the scheme.  However, inquiries have been made with my Department's relevant local office.  These inquiries indicate that an application form was endorsed by that office to the effect that the employee concerned might not be eligible.  This was because he had not signed the live register for the usual minimum immediately preceding recruitment.  It appears that, as a result, the employer did not forward the application for a formal decision.</P>
      <P>The employer concerned has been contacted and advised to submit an application form to the relevant section in my Department so that a formal decision can be given.  When a decision has been reached in this case I will communicate directly with the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64, 65 and 66 together.  The details of the proposed Collooney-Sligo route, which would be about 8.6km long, are set out in the Environmental Impact Statement prepared by Sligo County Council.  I am arranging for a copy of this to be placed in the Oireachtas Library.  In February 1992, I certified this project as acceptable on environmental grounds and, some weeks ago, I confirmed, with modifications, the compulsory purchase order for the acquisition of the necessary land. On 15 March last, I notified a road grant allocation of £3.06 million to Sligo County Council for the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="900" /> The scheme is one of a number of projects proposed for Cohesion Fund assistance.  Formal EC approval regarding the acceptability of the project and the assistance to be provided are awaited. I understand that Sligo County Council expect to commence prelimininary works in mid-1993.  Documentation for the main contract is being prepared and this is expected to be awarded in early 1994. The duration of the main works contract is expected to be three years and the scheduled completion date is 1997.  The level of employment on the scheme will be a matter for the contractor(s) concerned.</P>
    <P>In June 1992, Sligo Corporation submitted an Environmental Impact Statement for the proposed Sligo Relief Road and applied for certification in accordance with the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1990.  In view of my quasi-judicial role in the matter, I am not in a position to make any comment in relation to the scheme at this stage, but I hope shortly to announce my decision on it.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the problem mentioned following my recent visit to Killybegs.  Some of the largest fishing vessels have experienced access difficulties during low spring tides.  Provision had been made to carry out dredging works at Killybegs in the Fishery Harbour Development Programme 1989-1993. However, insufficient funds were available and the work was not progressed. The estimated cost of dredging Killybegs is put at £1 million.</P>
      <P>A new fishery harbour development programme is currently being drawn up for the 1994-1997 period.  It is intended to provide for the dredging works in this programme.  Pending finalisation of the new programme and clarification of its funding I am not in a position to give any definite timetable at this point.  However, I would regard the early carrying out of this work as a high priority.</P>

      <P>A standard clause of the OPRD requires member states when administering EC programmes to strictly observe Community policies or risk the Commission withholding payment of funds to the operation in question.  Both national and Community policy specifically prohibit grant-aid for second-hand machinery.  This policy ensures that projects are provided with reliable equipment at a substantially reduced cost and also avoids any risk of multiple grant-aid in respect of an individual item of equipment.</P>

      <P>Ireland, together with the other member states of the European Community, has continually taken the view that there should be special and differential treatment for developing countries in all areas of world trade.  In the context of the GATT negotiations, our approach is that any final agreement must reflect this view.</P>
      <P>There are 15 separate topics involved in these negotiations and there is still a considerable amount of work to be done on several elements before agreement can be reached.  It is not, therefore, possible, at this stage, to forecast the exact content of any final agreement.</P>

      <P>This Government is committed to ensuring that elderly people receive the highest quality of health care available.  The objectives of health policy, towards the elderly are set out in the report &mdash;<i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly.</i> They are to support the care of dependent elderly people at home for as long as possible and to ensure that when the elderly can no longer be cared for at home, that there are appropriate specialist and extended care facilities to meet their needs.  The priorities for service development at present are to strengthen community care services for elderly persons and their carers in the home, to provide more specialist facilities in acute hospitals, to meet the needs of the increasing numbers of elderly mentally infirm, and to implement the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made towards implementing the recommendations contained in <i>The Years <Col N="908" /> Ahead.</i> In recent years an additional £9 million was made available to the health boards to expand home nursing services, to provide more respite places, day care centres and day hospitals, to provide more departments of medicine for the elderly in general hospitals, to strengthen rehabilitation services and to develop services for those with dementia.</P>
    <P>The progress achieved in developing health services for the elderly will be maintained by the new Government. Under the Programme for a Partnership Government we will be developing a health service of the highest quality, so that people, particularly the elderly, can be confident that they will be well looked after should they need medical care. Among the priority issues in health for the Government which are of direct benefit to the elderly are the expansion of facilities for hip replacement, cataract and by-pass surgery and the implementation this year of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.  I have already had discussions with nursing home interests and I have indicated my intention to proceed with the implementation of the Act by 1 May this year.  A provision of £4 million has been made available this year for the phased implementation of the Act.</P>

    <P>In response to the problem of suicide the health services provide support to those immediately identifiable as distressed. A large proportion of suicide is associated with a recognisable mental disorder, most commonly a treatable mental illness.  Health boards are involved in a number of ways in promoting better coping skills through parenting programmes, pre-school playgroups, lifeskills education in schools, alcohol and drug awareness programmes and social support for elderly people living alone.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's intention that the promotion of mental health should form part of health promotion generally. As the Deputy will be aware, one chapter in the Green Paper on Mental Health launched in June 1992 discusses the challenge of promoting mental health and the prevention of suicide.  The Green Paper outlines the role mental health personnel can play in the prevention of suicide and emphasises the important contribution of voluntary bodies.</P>

      <P>Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, provides for the supervision of pre-school services for children under the age of six years and for the making of regulations in relation to such services.  When this Part is brought into operation health boards will be required to inspect services from time to time to ensure compliance with the regulations.  It will be necessary for the boards to put in place a new inspectorate for this purpose at an estimated annual cost of £1 million.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the House in reply to questions on 10 March, the next phase in the implementation of the Child Care Act will involve the commencement of Parts III, IV, V and VI which deal with the taking of children into care, court proceedings and the powers and duties of health boards in relation to children in their care.  These are the most complex provisions of the Act and also the most significant in terms of their resource implications.  It is my intention that they will be brought into operation as soon as the necessary staff, services and facilities that are required to underpin them have been put in place.</P>
      <P>When these provisions have been successfully implemented, I will proceed with the commencement of Part VII and the remaining provisions of the Act.</P>

      <P>When established, the medical genetics counselling service will be available to all, including members of the travelling community.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the recommendation of the second Commission on the Status of Women that he should review the present system of short term contracts for non-consultant hospital doctors, and the exceptionally long working hours frequently required of junior hospital doctors.</Quest>

      <P>All non-consultant hospital doctor (NCHD) posts are considered to be training posts. Existing postgraduate training programmes require that NCHDs spend periods gaining experience in a range of specialities in different hospitals.  Many NCHDs are in structured programmes which involve rotating through a number of posts over a two to three year period. The system of employing NCHDs on six month and one year contracts arises from meeting these requirements.</P>
      <P>A study group comprising representatives of my Department, Comhairle na nOspidéal and the Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board is at present examining medical manpower needs.  A major issue under examination is the balance between the number of consultant posts and the number of training posts. Any change in this balance has implications for both the number of doctors in training and the system of training.  I expect to receive a copy of the group's interim report in the coming weeks and I hope to circulate it as a discussion document to all the bodies with an interest in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>NCHDs are liable to be rostered for duty for an average of 65 hours per week. A programme for the implementation of the 65 hour week was agreed with the Irish Medical Organisation and put in place in 1989.  Over 400 additional <Col N="914" /> NCHD posts were created as part of this programme.  The hours worked by NCHDs in Irish hospitals are now the lowest in these islands.</P>
