      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of related requests under Standing Order 30 from Deputies John Bruton, Proinsias De Rossa, Mary Harney and Trevor Sargent.  I propose to call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their requests to my office.  Therefore, I call first on Deputy John Bruton to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I am seeking your permission for the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 30 to debate a motion regretting that Government Ministers have apparently not acted in either a collectively responsible, a conscientious or a truthful way in relation to Ireland's allocation of EC Structural Funds and requesting that Ministers state what information was available to the Government at the time of the publication of the National Development Plan and at the time that a debate was allowed to go ahead on that plan in this House.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, in accordance with Standing Order 30 I request leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following and important matter of public interest, namely, the statement by the President of the European Commission, Mr. Jacques Delors, following the meeting of the Commission yesterday, that he never gave any assurances to the Government that Ireland would receive £7.8 billion; the further statement by Mr. Delors that he had been asked by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, to delay a final decision on the funds until after the publication of the National Development Plan; the need for the Government to now give a full explanation to the House of its handling of the application for funds and its failure to deliver on promises it has made to the Irish people and the implications of the funding shortfall for the National Development Plan and job creation and, indeed, to explain how we have found ourselves in one of the most appalling periods of deception, fraud and political crookery that we have seen in this House in quite a long time.</P>

      <P>In accordance with Standing Order 30 I wish to ask the Taoiseach and you, a Cheann Comhairle, in view of the widespread public disquiet concerning the EC Structural Funds allocation to Ireland and the uncertainty about the full implementation now of the <Col N="2051" /> National Development Plan, to adjourn the business of the Dáil to allow a full debate on the matter in the House in order to answer some very pressing questions, particularly the reason Jacques Delors has not commented since 20 July.</P>

      <P>Sir, no business should be taken and business should not be interrupted until we establish whether we have truthful and competent Ministers dealing with European affairs on behalf of the people of this country.  My party rejects the taking of any business until the credibility of the Tánaiste is put to the test in this House and the credibility and collective responsibility of the Minister for Finance is also put to the test. This is the most humiliating fiasco in Irish international relations in recent years. The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance are unsuitable for office.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, it is regrettable that we have been unable, through the use of normal Standing Orders, to achieve a debate in this House on a matter of crucial importance to the credibility of this Government.  We have tried under Standing Order 30, and <Col N="2058" /> I have tried under Standing Order 143, to achieve a reasonable and rational debate in this House on very serious matters relating to a deception of this House by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance.  The fact that apparently the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment do not talk to each other about what the Government is doing, would lead one to wonder about this wonderful relationship between the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil.</P>

The Dáil should meet next Tuesday at the very latest to debate the integrity of the national plan submitted by the Government, the assurances given by the Government in relation to its funding and the status of the Government's statements in regard to operational programmes in view of the fact that apparently the funding no longer exists for the programmes which were put forward in ministerial statements.

    <Title>Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, 1993: Report Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 22:</P>
    <P>In page 5, lines 7 and 8, to delete &ldquo;a breach of the peace or whereby a breach of the peace may be occasioned&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the commission of a criminal offence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy G. Mitchell.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already made <Col N="2087" /> the case for the acceptance of this amendment by the Minister.  Section 6 (1) refers to &ldquo;a breach of the peace or whereby a breach of the peace may be occasioned&rdquo;. My amendment proposes that this very vague provision should be substituted by the words &ldquo;the commission of a criminal offence&rdquo;.  The Minister's amendment No. 23 proposes to delete the word &ldquo;whereby&rdquo; in section 6 (1) and to insert the words &ldquo;being reckless as to whether&rdquo;. I question the use of this language in a section which proposes to make the use of insulting words or behaviour, even in terms of the distribution of leaflets or posters, a criminal offence.  Yesterday we voted on an amendment which proposed to replace the word &ldquo;insulting&rdquo; with the word &ldquo;intimidating&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not see any reason for the inclusion of vague terms such as &ldquo;or whereby a breach of the peace may be occasioned&rdquo; in this section.  If one carries a poster with an insulting slogan with intent to breach the peace I suppose some penalty should be applied.  However, if a breach of the peace is occasioned by carrying a poster with an insulting slogan then we are getting very close to the situation where the right to free speech is criminalised.  I object very strongly to the language used in this section.  I have made the case for these reasonable amendments and I heard the Minister's reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the fact that my amendments which proposed to substitute &ldquo;intimidating&rdquo; for &ldquo;insulting&rdquo; were not accepted by the Minister &mdash; I was very surprised that she did not accept them &mdash; I support Deputy Gilmore's amendment which proposes to delete the section.  I am sorry that the co-operation extended by the Opposition to the Minister, and which has been made by her in many ways, is not being extended by her to these sections.  We are digging our heels in, so to speak, on this provision which is not desirable, cannot be defended and will not deal in any way with the crime problem as we know it.  I do not knw why this provision is included in the Bill if there is no demand for it.  During all my years as a public representative I never <Col N="2088" /> once heard calls for the carrying of insulting posters or the issuing of insulting leaflets to be made a criminal offence.  If they were intimidating or threatening, that is another matter but this is not a priority and since the Minister has not found it possible to accept my earlier amendment and has indicated she cannot accept these, Deputy Gilmore's amendment to delete the section should be supported by the House.</P>
    <P>We have made much progress on this Bill and I am saddened that in these sections, which give rise to concern by the law abiding majority, the House has been unable to agree on these amendments. I do not understand why the Minister wants to equip the Garda and the Judiciary with this power when there is no demand for it.  It is not needed, it will not in any way reduce the level of crime and yet we are inserting it here.  It is being included for the optics and it is regrettable that it will be used in these very vague ways against law abiding people, particularly law abiding youths living in areas where people might not be as knowledgable about their rights.</P>
    <P>I am sorry these amendments are not being accepted and I hope this is not an indication that as we proceed to other sections of the Bill there will be a hardening of attitudes because there are a number of items in the Bill which are of grave concern.  These sections, as they are being passed here, give rise to grave concern for civil liberties and will put no obstacle in the way of the criminal fraternity.  It is unnecessary to include them in the Bill and they are an intrusion on the rights of people who are not breaking the law.  People have the right to speak their mind.  We have seen this morning how people are being controlled in this House; now we are attempting to control people outside this House.  Fortunately, outside this House we have the courts to defend people because I seriously suspect that these sections are unconstitutional and will be set aside at the first challenge.</P>

      <P>In page 5, line 11, to delete &ldquo;6 months&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;3 months&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is fairly self-explanatory. We are suggesting that the penalty for contravention of the section should be three months imprisonment rather than six months imprisonment.  I would make the point that I made yesterday in a different context, that three months is a long time for anybody to spend in prison for a minor summary offence.  There is no particular reason why we would want to send people to prison for four, five or six months for what is in fact a relatively small breach of the peace.  There is no violence involved in this offence.  If there was violence involved they would be charged for that violence.  This is a behavioural offence, it is a summary offence and I would ask the Minister to agree that with the present overcrowding in prisons nothing would be achieved by a court imposing a four, five or six month sentence which could not be achieved by imposing a one, two or three month sentence.</P>

      <P>Unless there is very good reason for retaining the sentence at six months the case made by Deputy McDowell for a three month sentence is <Col N="2092" /> reasonable in the circumstances, particularly as I have reservations about how widely drawn the section is.  A custodial sentence of three months would be sufficient for this particular offence.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the amendment also which is calling for the reduction of the prison sentence although I must repeat the argument I made earlier that this section does not belong in this Bill.  The provisions of this Bill were intended to deal with problems of criminality in our community.  Problems have been raised and addressed about various forms of disorder occurring in local communities, on our streets, in public places and which were giving rise to considerable public concern.  This was because the Garda did not have the legislative power to deal with them.  They could not move people on; could not do anything about groups of people congregating, threatening people and stopping people on the street.  They could only do something if they actually caught people in the act committing a specific offence.  But what do we find being introduced by the Government?  We find a section introduced which is not intended to address the problem of criminality at all but rather is intended to address various forms of political protest, rendering illegal the carrying of various types of placards and banners that may be produced by people in the course of a march or demonstration outside this House or elsewhere.  Fair enough, some of them may be regarded as offensive and some may state things in a very exaggerated way.  But that is in the nature of political protest.</P>
      <P>We are muzzling opposition in this country.  Opposition inside this House is muzzled by one set of rules; opposition outside the House will now be muzzled by a different set of rules under the provisions of this Bill.  Soon we will be muzzling the Martyn Turners and the cartoonists, which will mean they will not be able to draw caricatures.</P>

      <P>It is ironic that on this day of all days, when the Opposition inside this House has been muzzled, we find that the very next business with which we deal is a section in a Bill which is intended to muzzle political opposition outside this House.  Certainly, I intend opposing it.  I have tabled amendment No. 25, which we will reach in due course, the purpose of which is to delete this section in its entirety.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That, too.  Certainly the proceedings in the House this morning were very relevant to the issues being criminalised under the provisions of this Bill.  I might point out that section 6 (1) reads:</P>
      <P>It shall be an offence for any person in a public place to use or engage in any threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to provoke a breach of the peace or whereby a breach of the peace may be occasioned.</P>
      <P>I imagine that if those provisions were applied to the proceedings in the House this morning all of us would be subjected to a Garda investigation or at least could be the subject of such investigation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>In the mad rush to find offenders I might just be picked up and find myself before the courts also.  Thanks be to God there is a caveat so that this House is saved from the implications of this type of legislation, but anybody out on the street will be subject to its provisions.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Minister that this type of activity could be very much part and parcel of normal political protest and/or demonstration on the streets. Therefore, we must be very careful about what we legislate for in terms of creating a criminal offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take on board the amendment seeking the deletion of a six months term of imprisonment and its substitution by a three months prison sentence on a number of grounds.  Quite clearly the interpretation of what constitutes &ldquo;threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour&rdquo; is a matter which will be decided differently at the discretion of the authorities than might be interpreted by those who engaged in the particular incident, march or activity that may result in a charge being levelled at <Col N="2095" /> them.  I contend this provision contains a very subjective element, particularly when one considers the protection afforded to the right to assemble, as enshrined in our Constitution, the right to protest and indeed freedom to protest. I might read into the record the relevant Article of the Constitution, that is Article 40.6.1.ii, which says:</P>
    <P>The right of citizens to assemble peaceably and without arms.</P>
    <P>Provision may be made by law to prevent or control meetings which are determined in accordance with law to be calculated to cause a breach of the peace ...</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Calculated to cause a breach of the peace&rdquo; is not the same as something that &ldquo;occasioned a breach of the peace&rdquo;, that might provoke a breach of the peace, or indeed that might be reckless in relation to a breach of the peace.  &ldquo;Calculated&rdquo; means something committed very coldly, ruthlessly and deliberately.  The Constitution is carefully worded to allow a fairly wide berth in one's exercise of the democratic process.  If we are to criminalise anything that may be construed as &ldquo;threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour&rdquo; then we are travelling a long way down the road which would appear to me to be in breach of specific constitutional provisions.  The least we can do is ensure that any penalties to be imposed would not be of a very severe nature.  Certainly, imprisonment may not be an appropriate penalty.  An extended prison sentence for an offence such as this is probably not only unnecessary but wrong.</P>
    <P>In regard to Deputy Gilmore's remarks about satirists and cartoonists, again their caricatures might very well be construed by a sensitive individual as abusive, insulting or likely to provoke a breach of the peace.  We must remember that interpretation of &ldquo;a breach of the peace&rdquo; can be extremely wide.  For example, its interpretation by a member of the Garda may not be the same as its interpretation by somebody who may be the subject of such investigation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2096" /> I can give the House a personal example of what I mean.  On one occasion I was engaged in a demonstration with another Independent Deputy of this House when we were charged with a breach of the peace, arrested, taken to Store Street Garda Station, subsequently charged with having committed a breach of the peace, ended up in prison and had to be released on a <i>habeas corpus</i> writ. Our breach of the peace amounted to nothing more than standing side by side with others who were protesting on the streets of this city.  So one person's interpretation of a breach of the peace may very well be another's interpretation of lawful protest and right of assembly, such as a trade unionist, activist or indeed an ordinary street trader.</P>
    <P>I have grave reservations about the provisions of section 6.  The very least we can do is ensure that any penalty to be imposed would not be as severe as that incorporated in the section as drafted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Costello indicated that he had grave reservations about the provisions of this section and its implications for one's constitutional rights, pleading that they would be in breach of a citizen's constitutional rights.  He contended that we should reduce the severity of the sentence.  I would hope that if any Member felt we were drawing up provisions in breach of constitutional rights and if that fact were brought to the attention of the Minister and proved to be correct, nobody would agree to any sentence, reduced or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My understanding is that the Minister is not stopping or preventing the general public who may wish to protest in a reasonable law abiding fashion fron doing so.  The words used by all Members who have contributed are contained in the line of section 6 which refers to threatening, abusive or insulting words.  That line must be read in conjunction with the following line which states: &ldquo;or behaviour with intent to provoke a breach of the peace&rdquo;.  Most people would agree that if somebody wants to have a demonstration they can do so but surely we cannot allow a person to have a demonstration <Col N="2097" /> with intent to provoke a breach of the peace.  The general public would not welcome a suggestion that we should allow people to demonstrate in that fashion and with intent to provoke a breach of the peace.</P>
    <P>In regard to the proposed reduction in the term of imprisonment from six months to three months, I do not know how the Minister or the parliamentary draftsman arrive at sentences of this nature.  I am sure it is worked out on the basis of criminal legislation and that a balanced approach is arrived at.  I await with interest the Minister's response.  I do not see anything wrong with the amendment and I would be happy to support it if the Minister is supporting it and if there are reasonable grounds for doing so.</P>

      <P>On Committee State, as all Deputies will recall, the tendency was to increase rather than decrease penalties.  I note that no similar amendment has been tabled in relation to section 7 which deals with the distribution of threatening material, etc.  It would be inconsistent to provide a maximum penalty of only three months for actual behaviour which was threatening but to provide a six months penalty for the distribution of threatening material, etc.  Having regard to the fact that we are tightening up on the threshold at which the offence would be committed a sentence of six months would be warranted for the more serious offences, under this heading.  I have listened very carefully to what all Deputies have said and in the light of substantial agreement I am prepared to accept the amendment from Deputy Michael McDowell.  Perhaps Deputy McDowell would be prepared to move a similar amendment on section 7.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 12 to 19.</P>
      <P>The whole purpose of this legislation is to address a problem that has been identified for us regarding public order, and people who are acting in a disorderly way generally in the community.  The sections we are debating are not designed to address that issue but rather various forms of protest, street demonstrations and so on.  Those sections are addressing a problem we do not have.  We have a certain amount of trade union activity which involves picketing of industrial premises, political protests and mobilisation of people for political purposes, the distribution of posters and various forms of literature and so on but we do not have a problem of disorderly protests. Neither do we have a problem with the distribution and display of material which could be regarded as offensive or threatening.  This section originated in the sixties when students occupied Georgian buildings, farmers camped on the streets and we witnessed the beginning of the civil rights movement, housing agitation in Dublin and so on.  Due to its paranoia &mdash; which was confirmed here last night by Deputy O'Malley &mdash; the Department of Justice panicked and decided it would have to be dealt with in a legislative way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the experience here this morning it may well be that the prognosis for public demonstration may not be the best.  People see on their television sets what is happening in this House and that critical issues of concern to the public, such as the loss of £600 million in assistance from the European Community, cannot be discussed here.  They can hear it discussed on radio and television, in the pubs, across the garden wall and they can read it in the newspapers but no matter what procedural method is used by Members of this House to raise it on the floor of the House it cannot be debated or discussed here.  In the teeth of one of the major disasters that has faced this country the House adjourns for virtually an entire week without an <Col N="2099" /> opportunity of debating the matter.  That is a recipe for encouraging public protest and outrage by members of the public and I very much regret it.</P>

      <P>I am relating my comments to the amendment which concerns the distribution and display of writing, signs and visible representation.  I am anticipating and trying to explain the reason this section should not be in this Bill and how it can be used to muzzle <Col N="2100" /> public protests and opinion, by drawing attention to the the fact that members of the public finding that a matter of such grave concern cannot be debated in the House, may decide to mount a demonstration about it.  If they show on one side of a banner a picture of Jacques Delors with a bubble from his mouth stating &ldquo;liar&rdquo; to the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance on the other side of the banner, will that be regarded, under this section, as a display of written material or a sign or a visible representation that is abusive insulting or obscene?  Will the gardaí be called to have them taken away and their banner or poster seized?  Will those displaying such banners or posters be subject to a term of imprisonment of three months?  In terms of public disorder where will that lead us?  We have few enough gardaí.  The figures the Minister supplied us with in the House last week show that their number is significantly down on the number recommended as well as the number the Garda state is needed in their corporate strategy.  Will their scarce resources be directed to seizing posters, leaflet material and banners from people engaged in legitimate political protest under the guise of public order?  That is what this section suggests.  This section should not be here at all.  It is a hangover from the sixties when the then Fianna Fáil Government thought it could rule forever &mdash; just as this Government with its huge majority thinks it can go on forever, that it can make all the blunders it wants and can cost this country hundreds of millions of pounds with each passing day and anybody who objected to that was muzzled by the use of the Chair in this House or by using a section such as this.</P>

I have very grave objection to a breach of the peace because I want to see a situation where we do not have breaches of the peace and public disorder. That is precisely why I do not want to see a provision in the Bill that will put the Garda against people engaged in public protest who demonstrate what they have to say in a visual manner.</P>
      <P>Let me make it clear that if the Minister does not accept my amendment, I intend to call a vote and, if necessary, to call a division.  I think this section of the Bill will undermine the legislation.  A great deal of concern has been expressed about using a Bill that is ostensibly to deal with problems of crime to address what is essentially a degree of political discomfort. I object to that very strongly.  I do not think it should be included in the legislation and I want to have it excised. I intend to put this amendment to the vote and to ask the House to divide on it.</P>

      <P>I have strong reservations about the wording of that amendment and indeed the wording of section 7.  The Garda powers under that section are too great.  That section empowers the Garda to move people <Col N="2105" /> taking part in a protest and carrying placards displaying insulting words.  The wording in the amendment, while objectionable, proposes to extend the provisions to provide consistency, but that would not be in the interest of public order.  To be consistent in respect of my earlier arguments I cannot support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>A penalty is prescribed in respect of Garda powers under sections 4, 5 and 6.  A person who is guilty of an offence is punishable by a fine or a period of imprisonment.  This section provides some further administrative procedures for the Garda which effectively are penalties.  For example, a person may be told to desist from acting in a certain manner, to leave the premises immediately and so on.  I suggest that the Minister should prescribe the penalties in a different order.  The amendment proposes that section 8 (a) should take account of provisions of sections 4, 5, 6 or 7.  There is a great deal of concern about interference with civil liberties in the areas covered by those sections.  The first penalty under section 8 states that a person guilty of an offence is liable to punishment.  The second penalty states that the Garda should first ask the person to desist from threatening, abusive and insulting words or behaviour and be asked to leave the vicinity.  A penalty of a fine or imprisonment should be imposed on a person only as a last resort. Does the Minister consider the order of the penalties as listed in the section are correct?  Should the prescribed penalties under existing legislation, which are severe, only be resorted to after the Garda direct people using insulting words or behaviour to act in an appropriate manner?  It might be more appropriate if in section 8 (b), which refers to Garda powers in relation to protesters or people displaying in writing or on signs what might be interpreted as likely to provoke a breach of the peace, be asked to desist as a first step, and leave the vicinity as the second step.  The order of penalties in the section are confusing and somewhat contradictory and perhaps the section <Col N="2106" /> might be reviewed before the Bill goes to the Seanad.</P>

      <P>Section 8 empowers the Garda to direct people who are acting contrary to section 4 in respect of intoxication in a public place, section 5, in respect of disorderly behaviour in a public place and section 6 threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour in a public place to desist or to move these people on.  The proposed amendment would give similar powers in relation to section 7.  I see merit in the suggestion that the powers of the Garda under section 8 should also apply to people acting in a manner contrary to section 7, particularly having regard to the tightening up of that section in regard to which there is agreement.  Despite Deputy Mitchell's concerns I am prepared to accept the amendment moved by Deputy McDowell.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 31:</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 41 to 43 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;9.&mdash;(1)  Any person who shall in any unlawful manner wilfully prevent or interrupt the free passage of any person or vehicle in a public place without lawful authority or reasonable excuse shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2107" /> (2)  Nothing contained in this section shall be construed so as to prevent the exercise of the legitimate rights of citizens to picket, protest, or assemble in a peaceful manner.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat concerned about the provisions of section 9.  My amendment proposes an increased penalty.  It states that if any person who in any unlawful manner wilfully prevents or interrupts the free passage of any person or vehicle that would be construed as committing an offence which should be punishable by law. However, I am fearful in regard to the wording of the section.  Therefore, I propose a change of wording in section 8 (1) and the inclusion of a further subsection which states that nothing contained in this section shall be construed so as to prevent the exercise of the legitimate rights of citizens to picket, protest, or assemble in a peaceful manner.  The section consists of only one sentence.  It states that any person who shall in any manner wilfully prevent or interrupt the free passage of any person or vehicle in any public place shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £200.</P>
    <P>People who wish to make a legitimate protest should not be regarded as committing a criminal offence.  For example, if people decided to picket an Ard-Fheis being held in the RDS and delegates were asked to use a gate other that the main one, the protesters should not be regarded as criminals.  However, under section 9 those protesters would be construed as wilfully preventing or interrupting the free passage of a person or vehicle in a public place and their protest action would be regarded as criminal.  I consider the wording of the section too strong, particularly in respect of trade union pickets.</P>
    <P>There are a few very dangerous sections in the Bill.  This section does not address the real problem and it has serious implications for the trade union movement and the right to make a public protest in a lawful manner.  If the Minister is not prepared to accept my amendment <Col N="2108" /> she should delete the section.  My amendment reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;9.&mdash;(1)  Any person who shall in any unlawful manner wilfully prevent or interrupt the free passage of any person or vehicle in a public place without lawful authority or reasnable excuse shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £500.</P>
    <P>(2)  Nothing contained in this section shall be construed so as to prevent the exercise of the legitimate rights of citizens to picket, protest, or assemble in a peaceful manner.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is a perfectly reasonable excuse to claim one is picketing because one is exercising one's democratic right to state one's view.  To prohibit that right is unacceptable, something which the House should not pass.  I do not believe that the Labour Party will support that section and I expect the Minister to delete the section or to accept my amendment.  The section as it stands is dangerous and will not be used by the Garda as an instrument to fight criminals.  If people protest in an unreasonable manner and block the traffic, it should be an offence; but I suggest that my wording meets that. Nobody should have the right to restrict the free passage of people in the course of their lawful business and that is why I used the words &ldquo;in a public place without lawful authority or reasonable excuse&rdquo;.  I would actually provide for an increased fine from £200 to £500 for such an offence.</P>
    <P>I have the strongest reservations about the wording as it stands.  I hope the Minster will accept my amendment or withdraw the section completely and perhaps introduce a wider provision in the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill promised for later in the year.  I would be surprised to hear that the Minister has not received representations from ICTU, the Irish Farmers' Association, the Association of Residents' Associations and the National Association of Tenants' Organisations as this is an improper intrusion into the democratic right of people to protest.  I hope <Col N="2109" /> the Minister accepts the principle of what I am saying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always worried about creating a serious offence for behaviour which is reasonably tolerable in society.  The fine to be imposed indicates that this is not considered to be a very serious offence.  At a later stage I will propose that we give the power of arrest for this offence, chiefly because there is no point in having a law preventing sit down blockages of streets, if the Garda have not a right to arrest the people involved.  It is futile if people keep moving on the street and the Garda have to allow that to happen without any remedy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell's amendment mentions the preservation of the right of people to assemble peacefully.  I sympathise with his concern, but the Constitution also guarantees that right.  In so far as we pass any Bill, it is always subject to the constitutional right of people to peacefully assemble.  Doubtless people who protest have legitimate grievances, but if one blocks a road in Dublin to make a point, inevitably there is somebody for whom that is an extremely serious matter.  A person may be trying to keep an appointment in order to get a job or bring a person to hospital and so on. There is great selfishness involved in insisting on making a protest regardless of the trouble being caused to other people.  People engaged in protests do not seem to think about the unfairness of what they are doing to people whose plight they cannot even imagine.  I am very hostile to people who block roads. Even on a Saturday afternoon in a suburb a blocked road in order to protest about traffic conditions in the area can cause a calamity for somebody in the traffic jam and that person is not being treated fairly in that sort of protest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general terms I sympathise with the Minister's draft of the proposed offence and I do not sympathise with people who think they can make a point by inflicting inconvenience on others.  I do not believe, as Deputy Mitchell suggests, that <Col N="2110" /> one has to have the right to inflict inconvenience on others to make a point. Sometimes the inconvenience is minimal, but sometimes it is significant and could ruin somebody's life in a way that would never be known or could cause severe annoyance in a way that cannot be imagined.  It is right to criminalise the interruption of the free passage of people in public places because we all have a right to use a road uninterrupted or unimpeded, whatever anybody else thinks about his right to protest.  The crucial word defining the offence is &ldquo;wilfully&rdquo;. A march down Grafton Street might slow me up some day, but the people who are marching are not wilfully impeding other people.  Where people block roads and refuse to allow other people to pass and wilfully interfere with other people's freedoms, I object.  If the offence proposed by the Minister did not include the word &ldquo;wilfully&rdquo;, I would be very worried about it.  An unintended or accidential consequence is merely unfair.  I now see that the Minister proposes to delete the word &ldquo;wilfully&rdquo;.</P>

I would prefer the Minister to leave the word &ldquo;wilfully&rdquo; in the Bill, because someone may say &ldquo;I do not care about you and I am going to stop you&rdquo;. This would be objectionable.  I would prefer the Minister to leave the section as it stands and I am sorry that I had to backtrack.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to outline the position under the law at present.  If a march or protest takes place on O'Connell Street, traffic will be disrupted.  Is it the intention to prevent any march or protest taking place in the public area?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the Garda will redirect traffic along one side of the street and allow the march to proceed on the opposite side.  In other words, marchers are allowed to exercise their constitutional right to assemble and protest and the public to go about their business along the public highway.  If protesters do not abide by the law then the Garda may arrest them for causing an obstruction.</P>
      <P>The Minister now proposes to include the words &ldquo;who, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, prevents or interrupts&rdquo; but the fact remains that a peaceful protest cannot take place in a public place without some disruption being caused.  We cannot implement legislation of this kind.  There is no point in passing this section as it stands.  By including the word &ldquo;wilfully&rdquo; we would at least have to ensure that the action was premeditated and calculated.  However, it should be said that it would be a matter for the garda concerned to decide if the intention was to provoke a breach of the peace.  We should also bear in mind that residents of communities organise demonstrations and marches to protest against unsocial or undesirable behaviour, such as &ldquo;rat running&rdquo;, to protect their communities. This may cause traffic disruption, but in doing so they are exercising their constitutional right.  What we are now saying is that they will not be able to do this, otherwise they will be subject to the rigours of this new legislation.  The Minister has gone too far in this amendment.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that in regard to the 1967 legislation there was a political agenda.  It was mentioned at the time that there would be barricades on the streets and that because of that there was a need for legislation to prevent the matter getting out of hand.  The last occasion on which the Garda had to intervene in a public gathering, protest march or demonstration to make arrests was the time Ronald Reagan visited the country.  By and large, we exercise our constitutional rights in an orderly fashion.  If we introduced legislation to deal with a non-existent problem it would be bad legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I advise the Minister to reconsider the <Col N="2112" /> matter.  My own view is that this section is not necessary and that the matter is covered under existing legislation.  If the section is implemented we will interfere with the rights of trade unionists, teachers and farmers.  Lawyers have yet to take to the streets, but we will never know when this may happen.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mitchell consistently referred to political marches where people carry placards.  Deputy Costello also adopted the same approach.  I would remind the Deputies that this Bill deals with the issue of public order and covers far more than political marches.  Rarely do we encounter difficulties with these marches even when they take place in Ballsbridge.  The Garda never have problems dealing with the people concerned.</P>

    <P>The point needs to be made that communities are encountering problems.  It was mentioned yesterday that groups congregate persistently at certain locations and cause a disturbance.  A number of areas come to mind in this regard.  We need to ensure that the Garda have the power under legislation to deal with this matter.  A man who wants to <Col N="2113" /> take his children to school or has to visit hospital at certain times to attend the dialysis unit should not be obstructed. While some protests can get out of hand, the majority of those who take part have nothing to fear.  In this respect I have not been convinced by the arguments made by the Opposition and contend that we should support the people who have been affected.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> When I hear arguments about what is intended, I wonder if legislation is more of a problem than a help.  The Minister withdrew the word &ldquo;wilfully&rdquo;.  The proof of a person's guilt must be strengthened if he wilfully does something.  A crowd coming from Croke Park, of its nature, may hold up traffic, but the people in the crowd are not doing it wilfully.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> There must be a decision as to whether people are wilfully holding up traffic, disrupting the flow of traffic and preventing people going about their business.  I cannot see how a case could be made otherwise.  That is why I was amazed to discover that the word &ldquo;wilfully&rdquo; and been deleted.  Deputy Mitchell has included the words &ldquo;wilfully&rdquo; and &ldquo;unlawfully&rdquo; both of which would at least <Col N="2114" /> justify charging somebody for breaking the law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>A very reasonable case was made by Deputy McDowell. I agree with almost everything he said, particularly in regard to the right of free passage of an individual.  No matter what the nature of a protest, surely it should never interfere with the right of free passage. Examples were cited by Deputies McDowell and Wallace such as a person going for an interview for a job, parents bringing children to school or people going to a hospital.  No matter what the purpose of the passage along a public way, there must be a right of free passage and I think Deputy Browne is accepting that point.  However, I agree with their views on the deletion of the word &ldquo;wilful&rdquo;.  It is imperative that that word be included in the Minister's amendment. If a problem arises because of a wilful act, it should be deemed to be an offence. The Minister should include the word &ldquo;wilful&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I undertook on Committee Stage to look at this amendment which is the same amendment Deputy Mitchell tabled on Committee Stage.  I know what the Deputy is trying to achieve.  He made a very good case, and was supported by other Opposition Members, at the time.  I undertook to look at it to see if certain elements of it could be incorporated into the wording of section 9.  I said at that time that there were reasons of a technical, legal nature which presented difficulties in regard to subsection (2) of the amendment which refers to the legitimate rights of citizens. I will not repeat what Deputy McDowell said but he very effectively and eloquently put the reasons for the legal difficulties in regard to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the cases cited by Deputies McDowell, Wallace and Fitzgerald, there are other situations where people block streets, roads, driveways and so on.  I have probably been the target of such blockages more often than any Member. I suppose, as a politician, one has to have a thick skin and put up with that kind of blockage outside one's dwelling which <Col N="2115" /> prevents one from either entering or exiting one's home.  I am not sure that our partners in life or, indeed, our families should have to put up with that but we did, as a family, put up with it over six months.  When it goes further than that and takes place in a public place where, for example, some of us might have our constituency clinics which may be located in a narrow street of a town or village and the blockage blocks not just the person it is aimed at but prevents business being conducted by people who have to earn their living in shops and business premises in these streets and towns, that is wilful obstruction.</P>
    <P>In relation to Dublin, representatives of the City Centre Business Association made a very strong case to me in relation to businesses being stopped. They are not talking about the legitimate protests about tax or any political issue of the day when people march down the middle of O'Connell Street, because they feel it is the legitimate right of somebody to protest.  They are talking about the wilful obstruction that takes place and where somebody going about their business or taking children to school or to a hospital is prevented from doing so.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that there is a power for the Garda.  We are not giving enough credit to the Garda.  One would imagine, listening to some Members, that every garda in the country is anxious to use this power to take pickets or people who are protesting off the streets.  Gardaí have as much common sense as the rest of us. They have considerable powers already and we have seen them operate and use those powers effectively and efficiently and with enormous common sense.  I have no reason to think that that will not continue.</P>
    <P>However, I gave you notice that I would like to amend the amendment before the House, and I think that will meet the concerns of a number of Deputies.  I wish to insert between the words &ldquo;excuse&rdquo; and &ldquo;prevents&rdquo; the word which was there, the word &ldquo;wilfully&rdquo;.  I hope that will meet the concerns some Deputies have with my amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not know why the Minister did not use that wording in the first place when it was in my original amendment.  I presume she wanted her amendment to seem so much different from mine.  She was very ungracious in commenting that people on this side of the House are not giving enough credit to the Garda.  The Minister is not giving enough credit to the Opposition who have given her a very constructive run on this Bill.  If that is the sort of insult she is going to throw across the House, she will find that we will not be so co-operative on committees in future.</P>
      <P>I wish to make it clear that in an adversarial system it is my job to find out what is wrong with a Bill and not in the public interest.  I make no apology to anybody for doing that.  No garda or Minister is going to do that job, just as I will not do the job of a garda.  It is my job, as a legislator, to ensure that what goes into a Bill is reasonable, and no Minister should in any way denigrate a Member for doing that in a positive and objective way which is how I moved my amendment. The inclusion of the word &ldquo;wilful&rdquo; is what I want and I am happy with that. Why it was not possible to do that generously without throwing insults, I do not understand.</P>
      <P>I wish to reply to some of the points made about my amendment.  Before he realised that the word &ldquo;wilfully&rdquo; had been dropped, Deputy McDowell spoke about people's constitutional rights.  These cases will be heard in the District Court. Why should people have to go to the Supreme Court to uphold their constitutional rights?  Do we not have a duty to uphold people's constitutional rights? For far too long we have relied on the Supreme Court, hidden behind their gowns&mdash;&mdash;</P>

A recent High Court ruling states that barristers will be paid what the market will bear, not what is just, fair or reasonable, which is the basis of the pay of everybody else.  The proposed amendment is more or less along the lines of my proposal.  The Deputy made a mess of this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No, but to get it right occasionally would do no harm.  Deputy Costello made a valid point in regard to the interruptions caused by marches. I am glad the Labour Party is aware of this issue.  I would have been very surprised if it did not speak against this provision.  Deputy Wallace suggested that we never see people getting into trouble with the Garda, that is the point. If the amendment I proposed had been accepted in the beginning &mdash; it is now being accepted &mdash; all the points of concern would have been met.  The problem of the City Centre Business Association referred to by the Minister is now being met by the Minister's proposed amendment to amendment no. 32, which is exactly along the lines of my amendment, that is &ldquo;without lawful authority or reasonable cause&rdquo;.  For people to give the impression they are not accepting the amendment is rubbish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that common sense is prevailing and that the extreme right wing views of Deputy McDowell are not being accepted by the House.  I am glad there is agreement between Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party on this matter. Not only does Deputy McDowell want this section to go through unamended, he wants the Garda to have further rights of arrest.  The amendment we have squeezed from the Minister meets the <Col N="2118" /> point I put forward and I will be happy to accept that amendment in place of amendment No. 31.</P>

      <P>I suggest, as a result of the debate, the Minister will consider in the Seanad inserting a new paragraph in section 8 (1) to include the substance of section 9.  In that way a garda would have the right to tell somebody wilfully obstructing a road to desist and the person would be under an obligation to comply with the order. Perhaps the Minister would consider that matter as it would improve the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal in amendment No. 33 is to reduce the penalty for a common assault in the District Court from 12 to three months.  I propose this amendment in the context of already overcrowded prisons.  A common assault may consist of a gesture, a slap, a punch or any action which results in actual bodily harm. Assault occasioning actual bodily harm may consist of an action resulting in a bruise, cut, abrasion or something of that kind.  A common assault is, by definition, a minor matter.  To put somebody, in this day and age, into jail for 12 months for common assault is unthinkable.  It is about time we considered the realities of what we allow District Court judges to do.  An assault which does not inflict harm does not merit sending a person to jail <Col N="2121" /> for six, nine or 12 months.  A prison sentence is a very serious penalty which ruins people's lives.  As we are dealing here with the District Court, we are dealing with an offence which, by definition, is a minor matter.  If a greater penalty is necessary in a case involving common assault, it may be dealt with in the Circuit Court.  The penalty proposed should be reduced from 12 to three months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 5 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I visited the Irish troops serving in Somalia between 7-11 October 1993 immediately following my visit to The Irish personnel serving in Lebanon.  It was a most reassuring visit and I am <Col N="2122" /> happy to report that morale was high and our troops are well settled in at Baidoa. Their accommodation, dining and other arrangements are excellent.  Baidoa is 150 miles distant from Mogadishu and the situation there is calm.</P>
    <P>While in Baidoa I met the commander of the French Brigade, General Quadri, who has been very helpful to the Irish transport contingent.  I met also with the district governors and members of the district council.  I restated Ireland's commitment to UNOSOM II and underlined our wish that the Irish contingent remain in Baidoa.  I performed the official opening of the Concern-run teacher training school and visited the GOAL-run Baidoa orphanage.  I also visited Mogadishu where I met the special representative of the UN Secretary-General, Admiral Jonathan Howe, the force Commander of UNOSOM II, Lieutenant General Cevik Bir and also the head of the force's Logistics Command, Major-General Williams.</P>
    <P>The second UN operation in Somalia, UNOSOM II, was established on 26 March 1993 under Chapter VII of the UN Charter with an expanded mandate, including: (a) to monitor that all factions respect the ceasefire; (b) to prevent the resumption of violence and to take appropriate action against factions which violate or threaten to violate the ceasefire; (c) to maintain control of heavy weapons; (d) to seize unauthorised small arms; (e) to secure ports, airports and lines of communication; (f) to protect UN, Red Cross and NGO personnel and facilities, and to take such forceful action as may be required against attacks on them; (g) to continue the demining programme; and (h) to assist in the repatriation of refugees.</P>
    <P>The principal duty of the Irish contingent is the provision of supplies to military components of UNOSOM II. The Irish contingent also assists the Irish aid agencies, Concern and GOAL, as well as other humanitarian agencies.  I saw their handiwork in the GOAL orphanage where one of the kitchens which had become begrimed from over-usage for many years had been steam cleaned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2123" /> The officer commanding No. 1 transport company is a unit commander of UNOSOM II and as such operates under the operational control of the force commander of UNOSOM II.  His immediate superior in the chain of command is the commander of the logistics support command. It is expected that one officer and one NCO will shortly be assigned to UNOSOM II Headquarters as a contingent liaison team, which is very important in terms of liaising between south Mogadishu, Mogadishu generally and Baidoa.</P>
    <P>A request has been received for three officers to fill staff appointments at force headquarters in mid-December.  These officers will fill a variety of staff posts, one as senior staff officer finance branch, one in operations and one in maintenance and logistics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that, like me, all Deputies are pleased to hear that the Irish troops have settled in well in Baidoa.  Is the Minister satisfied from his visit to Somalia that the force command structure is operating as it should? Reports which have been received suggest that the US force is operating on its own in Somalia.  Is the Minister satisfied that the command structure is operating properly?  It has been suggested that the US troops will withdraw from Somalia in the near future.  What role does the Minister envisage for the UN in Somalia after the withdrawal of the US troops? Does he envisage difficulties arising and the possibility of Irish troops being transferred from Baidoa to other parts of Somalia?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Command structures are in place.  I visited the area on a number of occasions, including last June, with a number of Army personnel so that I would be in a position to assure the families of the Irish troops that their fathers, husbands and sons were safe in Somalia.  I availed of the opportunity to speak at some considerable length to the then deputy force commander, General William Montgomery.  I was reassured <Col N="2124" /> at that time that the UN structure was working properly.  However, when the Pakistanis were killed by General Aideed's people the command structure seemed to unravel to some extent and there seemed to be a loss of direction.  I felt that the UNOSOM mandate, which is more specific and directed towards the provision of humanitarian aid, was becoming military in character.  Having visited Somalia recently I am satisfied that there has been a return to the stated aims of UNOSOM II.  Hopefully, General Aideed will come on side and a political rather than a military resolution can be found to the problems in Mogadishu.</P>
      <P>I should like to remind the House that events in Mogadishu are not reflected in the rest of Somalia.  For example, in Baidoa peace has been restored.  The French troops are working side by side with the Irish troops and the contingents are working hand in glove with the humanitarian organisations.  The Somalian district commissioner is in contact with the UN forces on a day-to-day basis and orphanages, hospitals and schools are operating.  This air of normality in Baidoa is not reflected in Mogadishu. However, events in Mogadishu do not reflect events in the rest of Somalia. There are a number of armed elements in Baidoa, but the UN troops are capable of dealing with these.</P>
      <P>With regard to the withdrawal of the US troops by the end of March under an edict from President Clinton, that is a matter for the US administration to decide and it would be inappropriate for me to comment on it at this stage.  Ireland will remain committed to keeping its transport company in Baidoa until such time as we are advised by our military authorities that we should adopt a different position.  It will then be a matter for the Government to decide which position we should adopt, having regard to the circumstances in Mogadishu at the end of February or early March when the rotation comes up for decision.</P>

That would be what I would envisage for our contingent and what I envisage to be Ireland's philosophical role in the United Nations and Somalia specifically.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>if berthing facilities will be available at Dún Laoghaire Harbour to cater for the new high speed car ferry which is due to commence operations in the spring of 1995; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of the Marine is holding discussions with Stena Sealink in respect of its future berthing requirements in Dún Laoghaire.  These discussions are taking due account of Stena's announcement last July of its intention to introduce a new generation <Col N="2126" /> of high speed car ferry on the Holyhead-Dún Laoghaire route in 1995.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware of the launch last July of the <i>Sea Lynx</i>&mdash; a fast ferry on the Dún Laoghaire-Holyhead route. This new service has expanded the ferry market and reduced to under two hours the travel time on the route.  This vessel has to date operated very successfully and can be viewed as a forerunner to the proposed new Highspeed Sea Service (HSS) ferry operation.</P>
      <P>Sea travel on the Irish Sea is expected to be transformed with the planned introduction, in 1995, of the world's largest high speed passenger and freight ferry.</P>
      <P>The HSS can be considered unique for a number of reasons.  Apart from its size and loading capacity, for the first time ever there will be a high speed ferry, capable of carrying ro/ro vehicles, coaches and trailers, as well as passengers and private cars.  The HSS is to combine the speed of the fastest sea transport, the comfort of a modern passenger liner and the versatility of a robust roll-on/roll-off freight ship.</P>
      <P>The HSS ferry will be the biggest high speed passenger and freight ferry in the world.  Its cruising speed is expected to be around 40 knots.  Conventional multipurpose ferries have a maximum speed of approximately 20 knots.  The new HSS is expected to be able to carry 1,500 passengers and 375 cars, or 50 trucks and 100 private cars.</P>
      <P>The coming into operation of this first vessel of its type will be a major boost to the central corridor and will bring significant benefits in terms of trade and tourism.  In particular, it will secure the position of Dún Laoghaire as a premier ferry port.</P>
      <P>My objective is to ensure, subject to planning, financing and local consultation, that Dún Laoghaire port will be ready to take this vessel in the spring of 1995.  Detailed work on all aspects of the planning of this work has been initiated by the Department of the Marine and this work is being accorded the highest priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will certainly keep the Deputy informed, as well as all other Deputies, <Col N="2127" /> councillors, public representatives and other interested parties, of ongoing developments in the context of the information sought by the Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

      <P>In view of the significant importance to the country as a whole of the introduction of this new high speed ferry between Ireland and Britain, can the Minister give us a categoric assurance that the necessary berthing facilities will be available before the spring of 1995? The information that has been given to me is that there are grave doubts that these berthing facilities will be available and in view of the fact that the work or even the planning of the development has not yet commenced and that there is a possibility that this new ferry could be lost to this country if that is the case, I want a categoric assurance from the Minister that that will not happen.</P>

      <P>In the light of recent events, I am not in the business of categoric assurances but I can tell the Deputy that my energy and my position as Minister for the Marine, which coincides with my position as a Member of the Dáil for Dún Laoghaire, will be utilised in order to ensure that the berthage will be available by March-April of 1995.  In fact, I saw a development plan map from the consultants, Iarnród Éireann, only a few days ago and I was most impressed by the configuration of what is proposed for the reception of the HSS operation.  However, I would like to assure the Deputy that if he would like either a public or a private briefing in the interests of what we both seek to achieve, namely, that Dún Laoghaire becomes a premier ferry port, I will make the briefing available to him on a week to week or a month to month basis as he wishes or, indeed, to any other Member.</P>

      <P>The Ministerial air transport service confers numerous advantages: it has proved to be extremely flexible where changes in departure times can be made to meet changing timetables; the availability of the aircraft for special tasks in times of crisis ensures independence of movement on critical occasions; its value has been proven during EMS, fishery and CAP negotiations and emergency occasions when scheduled air services could not be availed of; security is enhanced; the service can operate from military bases using military navigational aids and other facilities; the aircraft provides instant radio telephonic communications as required and confidential discussions or other work can also be carried out while airborne to and from destinations.  For these reasons I am satisfied that the maintenance and operation of the service in its present form is fully justified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 70 and 80 together.  As the Deputies will be aware, a number of the provisions of the Iberian Act of Accession in relation to fisheries fall for review at this time.  The Council must decide by the end of this year what changes, if any, should be made and such changes must come into effect as from 1 January 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two major elements involved in this review are the Irish Box and the specific control arrangements, the list system, the basic and periodic list, which apply to the Spanish fishing fleet.  The legal position in relation to the Box, and this is a Treaty provision, is that it will <Col N="2130" /> lapse as from 1 January 1996.  It is a legal provision in the Treaty and we are bound by it.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to the other controls (i.e., the list system) is that they will remain until the year 2002 unless the Council, by 31 December this year, decides by qualified majority voting to make changes.</P>
    <P>I should mention at this point that there is a desire on the part of the Commission &mdash; and this has some support among member states &mdash; that the position of Spain and Portugal should be normalised within the Common Fisheries Policy framework.  This is seen as being of particular significance in the context of the negotiation of the terms of accession of the Nordic countries to the Community.</P>
    <P>While Ireland has no objection, in principle, to the normalisation of the position of Spain and Portugal, we are only prepared to contemplate a balanced package of measures which, having regard to our experience of the fishing behaviour and practices of these fleets, would fully protect stocks in the Irish control zone.</P>
    <P>In any package of measures I will be seeking the following elements to be addressed: (i) the bringing of the size of the fleets concerned into better balance with the stocks available to those fleets; (ii) the establishment of an effective and transparent system of control and monitoring; (iii) pending the establishing of such a system, the retention of the current systems of control, and (iv) the continued non-operation by the Spanish fleet in areas where stocks are under pressure, and the ensuring of no increase in effort in other areas.</P>
    <P>The latest proposals presented by the Commission fall far short of the above requirements.  On the contrary, they amount in effect to the ending of all special controls.  Therefore, I have made it quite clear that those proposals are totally unacceptable and that major changes will be necessary.  This matter will come up for consideration at both the November and December Councils. I can assure Deputies that no effort will <Col N="2131" /> be spared in the securing of a satisfactory outcome.  On the matter of surveillance costs, I would see any diminution of controls on these fleets as a reason for an increased rather than reduced Community contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that failure to renegotiate the Irish Box or a similar concept for the protection of Irish fisheries as incorporated in the 1985 Treaty of Accession, will mean the deathknell of our fishing industry. In such circumstances does the Minister realise that not alone will Spanish and Portuguese fishermen clean out our entire fisheries stocks within the 12 mile limit but will even take limpets off the rocks on our shores?  While appreciating that the Minister is endeavouring to do his best within Europe, I must warn him that if he fails in this fight I can foresee no future for our fishing industry in that we have 20 per cent of EC fishery waters yet only 5 per cent of the catch.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Any failure on the part of the Minister in his fight for the protection of our 12 mile fishery limit would mean the end of our fishing industry.  I cannot overemphasise that point to the Minister because I have seen our fishing stocks being snatched by Spanish and Portuguese fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great sympathy with the views expressed by Deputy Sheehan and will certainly take them into account.  There is no doubt that the legal position is that the Box will go.  Our objective is to secure a balanced set of measures which, combined, will afford protection of the stocks in the areas concerned. As I said in my reply, these would entail fleet reduction, enhanced control and restricted areas.  On the question of the introduction of a conservation box, I should say that such a Box could be introduced only if it were necessary to <Col N="2132" /> protect Irish fishery stocks in a particular area and provided it was implemented on a non-discriminatory basis.  I should like to assure the Deputy that I do share his concern, although I would not be pessimistic as he is in regard to the potential death of the Irish fishing fleet.  With the new package on offer in the recent past, our fleet will have an advantage in what we will be commissioning and so on.  However, that is not relevant to the Deputy's supplementary questions.  I can assure hin that I will pay close attention to what he has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister fails to retain the present facilities for our fishery industry, would he endeavour to proceed along the lines of what is at present known as the Shetland Box?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I have all that in mind and assure the Deputy that all these options are being carefully considered at present.  Indeed, only yesterday I attended a Fisheries Council meeting in Luxembourg at which I addressed the issues raised by the Deputy.  The Deputy will be aware that we are bound by the 1985 Treaty of Accession and that the provisions of the treaty are weighted in favour of the Spaniards and Portuguese.  Therefore, the Deputy will appreciate that in going in to argue our case or fight our position, there is an 11:1 majority against us.  That is how serious the position is in relation to the end of the Irish Box.  As a result, I take into account very seriously what the Deputy has said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 7, 10, 21 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>The promotion procedures for officers of the Permanent Defence Force, which were agreed with the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, provide for the introduction of appropriate career development and counselling systems.  A pilot counselling project will be initiated in 1994 and it is hoped that a comprehensive system will be in place by 1995.  The counselling scheme will concentrate on the critical counselling of groups of officers faced with key career decisions of the type referred to by the Deputies.</P>
      <P>I would emphasise that this integrated promotion system has been the subject of extensive consultation with RACO and has been agreed with that association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The question tabled to the Minister was very specific in so far as it asked whether one particular recommendation would be implemented, one which, I would suggest, is very worthwhile. It is that those officers who are judged not suitable for further promotion would be so informed before reaching the age of 40.  That would be important to those officers serving in the Defence Forces in that they would then know they had reached their peak and depending on the nature of their work, could make alternative arrangements or perhaps seek alternative employment.  Would the Minister agree that if such were the case we would have a much happier force in that those officers who knew they had reached the peak of their careers could <Col N="2135" /> prepare themselves for a change of career before such became too late?  Will the Minister say whether he will be introducing this recommendation in 1993?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has a point in that so far as possible people are entitled to a degree of certainty.  That is why this pilot counselling project will be initiated in 1994.  The project will take into account the Deputy's properly expressed fears.  I might add that that pilot project was proposed and agreed with the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the continuous failure of the Government since 1990 to have additional general recruitment for the Permanent Defence Force, which is an absolute disgrace, would the Minister not agree that having officers who felt they could go no further in their careers leave before age 40 would provide an opportunity for their replacement, thus leading to greater movement within the Permanent Defence Force, something obviously lacking at present?  The Minister may correct me if I am wrong when I say that the average age of a sergeant is now in excess of 40 and the average age of a private 31 or 32, which is quite frightening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has a point. Like him I am very anxious to have a recruitment drive for the Defence Forces to take account of our obligations on the Border and, specifically, in relation to Naval Service personnel.  As the Deputy is aware 1,008 members of the Naval Service are officers and men where there is a high turnover.  I would be anxious that in both areas the issue of recruitment be addressed.  Also, the Army has a very important role to play in regard to internal security and there is a need to address its role in the context of its position in aid of the civil power.  In that sense the Deputy is right.  I am very anxious to have a recruitment drive as a matter of urgency.  The age profile of the Army is <Col N="2136" /> unacceptable.  The age profile of sergeants and non-commissioned officers is in the region of 40 and for privates it is between 27 and 30 years.  The foot soldiers, those at the lower end of the ranking, should be young people and, unfortunately, that is not the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister telling the House he did not have the support of his colleagues in Government, following his announcement in September that he was seeking Government approval to recruit 500 extra personnel into the Defence Forces?

Whoever gave the story to the journalist concerned was not doing me any favour and it was not done on a friendly basis.  There may be what is called a hidden agenda but sin ceist for another day.  In regard to the question of recruitment and the support of the Government, I have expressed the view &mdash; and I continue to do so &mdash; that there is a serious need for recruitment. The only way I can embark on that is with the support of my Government colleagues.

Negotiation on the terms of such a scheme have been entered into with the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers in the context of the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  It is also proposed to open discussions on this subject with the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association in the near future.  I am strongly in favour of career breaks.

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
      <Quest>the number of foreign fishing vessels boarded and arrested by the Navy to date in 1993; and his views on whether adequate resources are available to deal with foreign vessels poaching fish off our coast.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1993 to date the Naval Service has carried out 428 boardings of foreign fishing vessels and 53 of those boardings subsequently resulted in detentions for alleged illegal fishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Naval Service has seven patrol vessels which are deployed on fishery protection duties in the most efficient manner having regard to current and predicted <Col N="2139" /> fishing patterns.  Assistance is rendered by the Air Corps which has one helicopter located on board a naval vessel as often as weather conditions are suitable and one fixed winged aircraft which is dedicated to fishing protection.  The fixed winged aircraft will be replaced in 1994 by two new aircraft of a similar but more sophisticated design.  These are the two Casa aircraft being built in Seville by the Casa Company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the 428 boardings of foreign fishing vessels, and the detentions which followed, indicate not only a very active Naval Service but the extent of poaching by foreign vessels and the concerted effort by foreign vessels to rape our fishery stock?  Will he accept that there appears to be a conspiracy on the part of foreign vessels, particularly the Spanish, which involves a combination of guile and strong arm tactics?  The guile is displayed in the secret holds in these vessels and the strong arm tactics are displayed in the frequent instances of rammings and threatened rammings of Irish vessels. Will the Minister accept that we have a serious problem on our hands?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recall that some weeks ago I visited the Spanish authorities and expressed my concern in relation to the matters mentioned, particularly the size of fish being caught, the question of secret holds, the periodic list not being adhered to and so on.  I left them in no doubt as to our view of their behaviour.  Deputy Sheehan's original question was about the Irish Box and what happens when there is that type of behaviour in the Irish Box.  We have to prevent that type of behaviour occurring when the Irish Box will no longer apply after 1 January 1996.</P>
      <P>I wish to pay tribute to the Naval Service who are doing a tremendous job in very difficult circumstances.  I wish to pay tribute to the manner and the method used by Naval personnel in carrying out their duties.</P>

      <P>I join with the Minister in complimenting the Naval Service. In view of the extent of the problem can the Minister give the House any information on the estimated volume and value of our stocks which are poached in this fashion?  Does the Minister agree that we have a legitimate case before the European Community to obtain additional funding to develop the resources of the Naval Service and the Air Corps to counteract the threat to our fish stock?</P>

      <P>Funding is available. For example, we are receiving 50 per cent assistance for the Casa aircraft.  If the Deputy puts down a question to me I will be able to tell him in more detail the value of the fish being taken by the particular country he mentions; alternatively, I will be able to provide the information in the next week or two before the next Question Time.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of the value of the illegal take from Irish waters as well as the legal catch, does the Minister agree that a considerable sum of money is being transferred to our partners in Europe? Those who think we go to Europe with our hand out on a continuous basis should be reminded that a considerable amount is being taken out of the country as a result of the legal and illegal fish catch. Does he agree that because of the appalling way the Government is treating Naval Service recruitment the Irish Naval Service has neither sufficient personnel nor ships to deal with the ongoing problem of illegal fishing?  Does he agree that because of the illegal catch the EC is obliged to provide us with resources to ensure we can patrol our 16 per cent of EC waters so that we can uphold the law? Does he agree there is an obligation on the EC as well as on the Government to ensure there is sufficient personnel in the Irish Naval Service to deal with this very serious problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the Irish Naval Service is doing a great job in the <Col N="2141" /> circumstances.  As I say, they have seven ships at their disposal which are being used very efficiently.  In addition, with modern communications technology their task of communicating with each other, while difficult, will be made easier.</P>
      <P>I agree there has been illegal fishing. A case can be made that as a direct result of illegal fishing, moneys are being misdirected from Ireland to the country of the vessel that was fishing illegally.  There is a case to be answered.  I am considering very urgently updating the legislation, which will not only allow the courts to confiscate the gear and the fish and impose a fine but will also allow the courts to confiscate the vessel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very important. As the Deputy well knows, the problem is that the vessel must be released after the first offence and inevitably the second time the vessel is caught, both the name of the vessel and its owners have changed.  The offence should remain with the vessel and that is my intention in the context of what might be done in legislation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 13, 15, 25, 28 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>On 15 June 1993, during preparations for a practice shooting demonstration, an accidental discharge of a weapon occurred, resulting in an injury to a member of the Permanent Defence Force.  A court of inquiry was established to investigate the circumstances surrounding the incident and it is expected that the findings will be submitted to the General Officer Commanding the Curragh Command shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's reply.  I asked a similar question in June and was told that this investigation was taking place.  I would have imagined that it would have been completed by the end of October.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, ignored the advice of the Health and Safety Authority and approved regulations which removed all legal protection for soldiers at work. Does he agree that we now have a serious difficulty for members of the Defence Forces who are left without the security of the Health, Safety and Welfare at Work Act, 1989.  The reason I am pursuing this question is that the Minister for Labour ignored the agreement reached between PDFORRA and the Department of Defence and introduced different regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are dealing with the outcome of the investigation into the matter raised in the question, I agree that the process of investigation is rather slow. However, the findings of the court of inquiry have not yet been submitted to the General Officer Commanding the Curragh Command.  I understand the soldier <Col N="2144" /> injured will have no long term disability and that he returned to duty on 16 July.  The Deputy may take it that any recommendation made by the court of inquiry will be acted upon.</P>
      <P>As far as the Health and Safety Authority is concerned, it would not have been involved in this particular incident.  There was no reason to involve any outside body in the investigation.  I understand that this is a purely military matter and thus a matter for the military authorities. It was in that direction that the inquiry was sent.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of Defence Force Regulations the posting or transfer of personnel of the Defence Forces is a matter for the appropriate military authority.  In that regard I understand that while the availbility of a replacement may help to facilitate a transfer, this is not a necessary condition for consideration of an application.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> In practice it may be the case.  Does the Minister not agree that circumstances can change and a different barracks may suit better?  Is it not time that the Army considered the personal lives of those who serve in the Army?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>All that is taken into consideration as a matter of practice.  Personnel in the Defence Forces may apply for a change of posting or transfer to another unit in accordance with the Defence Force Regulations.  The commanders of the parent unit and the proposed unit are required to give their observations before the matter is forwarded for a decision to the brigade commander <Col N="2145" /> or the general officer commanding the command.  In the event of an applicant applying to move outside the command, the general officer commanding the command is required to give his observations and recommendations. If agreement cannot be reached the matter can be then appealed to the Adjutant General.  When applying for a transfer the availability of a replacement may facilitate the request, but, as I said in my reply, it is not necessarily a condition for consideration of the application.</P>
      <P>I can make available, if they are not already there, copies of the regulations and I will place them in the Dáil Library.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has a particular case or cases he wishes to bring to my attention, I will deal with them personally.  I would like to think that the Defence Forces can deal with problems of this nature and it should not be a matter for the Minister.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>the latest information available to him regarding the outbreak of the salmon disease, furunculosis, at a salmon farm in Bertraghboy Bay, County Galway; if the source of the disease has been identified; if it has been brought under control; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department was notified on 13 July by the company concerned that mortalities had occurred at <Col N="2146" /> their salmon farm at Salt Point, Bertraghboy Bay, County Galway.  The Department's senior fish pathologist subsequently inspected the farm and confirmed that the mortalities were due to an outbreak of furunculosis in one cage on the farm.  Under the direction of the Department the company took appropriate remedial action in terms of treatment, as well as the removal and disposal of mortalities.  Following treatment the number of mortalities declined significantly and the outbreak was quickly brought under control.  All fish on site are currently being harvested.</P>
      <P>Furunculosis is a bacterial fish disease which affects wild fish populations as well as farmed stock.  It is endemic to a number of wild fisheries and hatcheries and can also precipitate serious losses in marine salmon farms.  The source of the disease outbreak in this specific instance has not, I am advised, been identified. As with most such outbreaks, however, the source of the infection is likely to have been apparently healthy carrier fish not showing any clinical symptoms of the disease at time of transfer.</P>
      <P>Movements of fish to salmon farm sites from hatcheries are subject to clearance by the Department's fish health unit.  The issue of movement permits is dependent on the Department being satisfied as to the health status of the fish to be transferred.</P>
      <P>The prevention and control of disease is a primary objective for the Irish fish farming industry.  Disease incidence is being tackled through improved husbandry, site management and treatments as well as an ongoing programme of monitoring, inspections, movement control and research.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a longstanding excellent fish health status in Community terms, confirmed by the regular monitoring of all farms under the official disease control system for more than ten years.  This has been acknowledged by the EC Commission which last year approved a number of measures and programmes to safeguard the health of our fish stocks by preventing the introduction and spread of infectious diseases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not expressing a certain complacency in respect of this matter?  This is not the first outbreak of such disease or the first outbreak involving that company, but it is the worst outbreak so far.  I raised this matter in the House last April and the response I got then was similar to that which the Minister gave today.  Is the Minister aware of the context in which this question is asked?  Is he aware of the major concern being expressed by, for example, the Western Fisheries Board in relation to the future of wild fish stocks &mdash; both sea trout and salmon &mdash; and the adverse effects the disease is having on those stocks?  We have already seen an extraordinary merging of fishing interests who went to great trouble to raise the consciousness of people such as the Minister, his Department and the general public about their concerns.  Will the Minister indicate the measures he intends putting in place to deal with this problem once and for all?  It simply cannot be allowed to continue.  Also, will he consider the recommendations of the Green 2000 report in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be considering the recommendations of the Green 2000 report and I have replied to a question from some other Member on that matter.</P>
      <P>On the question of complacency, I share the Deputy's concern in regard to the white trout problem in the west of Ireland and Lough Currane in Waterville.  A number of committees, some of which included scientists, has been set up by the Department of the Marine to deal with the problem.  Only a few months ago I set up a task force with only one item on its agenda, to deal with the problem in respect of white trout.  I asked a prominent citizen of this country, Dr. Kenneth Whitaker, who has given great service to the country, to be chairman of the task force and he has agreed. He, along with the chairpersons of a number of other committees, will report to me during the next few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To suggest that I am complacent about <Col N="2148" /> this matter flies in the face of what I have done, what I am doing and what I will do in the future.  I am extremely concerned about the heritage of the white trout. Scientists have told me that there is no anecdotal evidence or scientific conclusions in relation to the possibility of an interconnection between farm salmon and the presence of sea lice on the fins or otherwise of white trout.  I must accept that scientific evidence because I am a layman in respect of these matters. However, I assure the Deputy that I will adopt a hands-on approach in repect of this problem and I will do so in the national interest, because such fish stocks are part of our heritage and for freshwater anglers generally.  I recognise the problem and I am doing my best within my own confidence and from the advice available to me to solve it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Question No. 62 in my name is similar to this question.  Question No. 62 refers to the disappearance of sea trout and the ongoing problem of sea lice infestation.  Question No. 83 in the name of Deputy Timmins, which refers to Ballynahinch fishery in south Connemara, is also connected to this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the national plan, the Department of the Marine was allocated only 1½ per cent of the total funds.  That is disgraceful given the potential of the marine area.  The most frightening aspect of that allocation is that only £9 million is to be spent on marine research over a period of seven years.  That is where the problem lies.  Does the Minister agree with the concern expressed by fishermen, hoteliers and people interested in angling about the disappearance of the sea trout and salmon from our rivers?  Will he agree that a resolution to the ongoing dispute between fishermen and fish farmers will have to be found quickly?  Will he agree that the position is becoming nasty and a great deal of misinformation is circulating.  With respect to the Minister, while I accept he is a barrister by profession, he has responsibility for marine matters.  Will he accept that the solution to this problem lies with himself and the Government?  At present, we are spending <Col N="2149" /> large sums of money promoting tourism, but it is similar to having a football pitch without a football.  From a tourism point of view, it is pointless inviting people to come here to fish if, when they arrive, there are no fish in our lakes and rivers.  We are no nearer finding a solution to this problem than we were four or five years ago.</P>

      <P>I accept I have a responsibility and I am facing up to it. The problem is being addressed by the involvement of scientists with the Fisheries Research Centre, the Salmon Research Agency, local fishery boards and the scientific sea trout working group.  An international conference on the exploration of the sea was held in Dublin last month and it reviewed the current research work on sea trout by Irish, Danish and Finnish scientists.  A study group has been set up as a result of that conference.  I also set up a task force with a mandate to secure the survival of sea trout which will report directly to me on measures needed to mitigate the decline in stocks.  The question of conservation bylaws, protecting existing stocks and the rehabilitation under a national stock enhancement programme and management strategies is also under review.  I can do so much.  I can go thus far and no further, but to suggest I am not facing up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51, 55, 58, 60, 66, 68, 81 and 97 together.</P>
      <P>The investigation into the <i>m.v. Havelet</i> incident was carried out under section 728 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894. The statutory remit of the investigation was to report on the nature and cause of the incident; the damage sustained or caused; and whether relevant regulations were complied with.</P>
      <P>The report, which has been published in full, finds that the <i>m.v. Havelet</i> took a very heavy toll to port in gale force conditions.  The consequent damage sustained by cargo lashings and attachments culminated in all vehicles shifting to the port side.</P>
      <P>The report also finds that the loading and operation of the <i>m.v. Havelet</i> and subsequent emergency procedures were conducted in accordance with relevant legislation and codes of practice.  There was, however, an apparent failure in some instances to instruct passengers in the correct method of donning life-jackets.</P>
      <P>In addition to the statutory findings contained in the report, the inspector who carried out the investigation recommended separately on a number of ferry practices and procedures which should be reassessed and improved.  These additional recommendations, which are of general applicability, address the following issues: carriage and securing of vehicles and cargo units; navigation in dangerous seas; safety announcements; ballasting operations; distress signals; crew familiarity with emergency procedures; identification of crew; baggage stowage; title of radio stations; weather forecasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Full details of these recommendations and the action being taken were announced on publication of the report. I have arranged however for these details <Col N="2153" /> to be circulated to Deputies.  The recommendations are being acted upon without delay.  I have instructed the National Ferry Safety Committee to assess current practices in relation to all of the areas listed and to report back to me as soon as possible on the scope for improvement.</P>
    <P>The Department, in the interim, has already reminded the industry by way of marine notices of the need to adhere to international guidelines on cargo securement and the hazards of dangerous sea conditions.  In addition the Irish Marine Emergency Service is to formulate guidelines to shipmasters on the circumstances in which distress signals should be deployed.  The titles of radio stations will be reviewed by the relevant authorities with a view to eliminating the risk of confusion in marine emergencies.  Ship masters will also be advised to avail of local forecasts, where possible, in addition to all other weather information at their disposal.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied we can deal with the various issues and introduce improvements in practices within the existing legislative framework, which is based on current international guidelines.  But if our assessment points to the need for a strengthening of the international legal framework which governs such matters, the International Maritime Organisation will be urged to expedite the necessary changes.</P>
    <P>I accord the highest priority to ferry safety, which is kept under ongoing review by the Department and the National Ferry Safety Committee.  These recommendations have been made in order to directly assist and inform that process.  I expect the National Ferry Safety Committee, which is chaired by the Department's chief surveyor and represents all the ferry companies operating into Irish ports, to report back within a short space of time.  I have also asked the Ferry Users' Forum to comment on those areas which are of relevance to that particular body.</P>
    <P>The press coverage of the contents of the report some days before its actual publication does not, in my view, warrant the carrying out of an investigation.  I <Col N="2154" /> have no doubt that Deputies will agree that our primary concern now must be to get on with the job of acting on the report's findings, and the additional recommendations made, in the interest of ferry safety.  The action now being taken is designed to ensure that ferries operate to the highest standards possible and that these standards are reinforced and improved on a regular basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Would he agree that the investigation is a whitewash job?  The present legislation led to the appointment of the inspector.  The report states that it is not his function to apportion blame or liability, but that is not satisfactory in guaranteeing the safety to Irish citizens travelling on Irish or other ferries.  The question of negligence and blame must be investigated by the Government. Does the Minister agree that the legislation should be updated, blame apportioned and regulations imposed which would prevent from travelling ferries not adhering to basic safety standards? There are a number of questions to be answered.  The ship was registered in the Bahamas and the report from the authorities there is different from the Irish report.  It does not mention a diesel spillage at the time the ship listed.  What was the reason for that omission and what dangers are involved in the spillage of diesel?  Why could lorries suddenly fall over in relatively calm seas?  Why does the report not mention that loading the ship was a rushed job because they were late arriving and people were still in the parking area when the ship sailed?  A number of serious questions should be answered and it does not benefit us or the Government to whitewash anything. We should ensure that this sort of thing never happens again, blame should be apportioned properly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This report is not a whitewash, it was produced within the terms of the Act.  The chief surveyor of the Department of the Marine has given an explicit report and considered all the points raised by Deputy Barrett including <Col N="2155" /> the problem with diesel.  He stands over his report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister admit that the Department was intimidated by the lawyers representing the company?  The accident was in March 1992, the report was completed in November 1992 and we had to wait almost 12 months to have it published, indeed it was leaked before it was officially published.  Can the Minister say who had the report before it was officially published because that might tell us who leaked it to <i>The Irish Times?</i></P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that emergency procedures which came into play immediately after the accident were seriously defective?  The passengers to whom I spoke had a number of major reservations about the performance of the company.  For example, the emergency announcements immediately after the accident were in French and any English speaking crew aboard were unavailable to the passengers; lights in the passages were switched off because of the risk of an explosion due to the leakage of diesel and the term &ldquo;muster stations&rdquo;, when the people eventually understood what was being said, was never explained, people did not know where to congregate.  Will the Minister explain the difference between this report and the report from the authorities in the Bahamas?</P>

I have the greatest confidence in the staff in the Department. Certain aspects of this report, as Deputies no doubt are aware, were given to Brittany Ferries some months ago and <Col N="2156" /> it called a press conference to discuss them.  The report was public knowledge long in advance of its publication.  The report of the chief surveyor is the final report and he can stand over it having carried out a thorough check on the vessel and examined all the complaints made.</P>

However, it uses phraseology such as &ldquo;the inspector would urge&rdquo;, &ldquo;would consider&rdquo;, &ldquo;would assess&rdquo; and &ldquo;would review&rdquo;.  That does not constitute firm recommendations about what course of action to take.  Will the Minister admit that this sort of language does not steer him in relation to what should happen in the future to maintain the safety of individuals?  The inspector did not apportion blame or responsibility for the accident.  Did the <Col N="2157" /> inspector examine the submissions made through legal sources in the context of drawing up his final conclusions?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to draw up a list of national coast protection priorities consultations have been held with and submissions sought from the various coastal local authorities.  The submissions <Col N="2158" /> received identified local coast protection needs.  The submission forwarded by Mayo County Council identified a large number of sites requiring attention.  The cost of the works identified by Mayo County Council alone exceeds £6 million.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan it is envisaged that £5.5 million will be spent over the 1994 to 1999 period on coast protection projects with the support of Structural Funds aid.  In order to maximise the return from the spending it is intended to identify priority projects for inclusion in the Department of the Marine's coast protection programme.  Finalisation of a list of priority projects and the nature of the works to be undertaken is subject to further detailed discussion with the coastal local authorities and agreement of an operational programme with the Commission of the European Communities.</P>
      <P>Among the criteria that will be applied to the final listing will be the value of the infrastructure at risk, the imminence of the risk and cost of protection works and of maintaining these works over their designed lifetime.  Of particular concern will be the maintenance of local infrastructure, tourist amenities and transport links to isolated communities.</P>

      <P>In thanking the Minister for his reply may I suggest, given the allocation of £5.5 million, that little will be done between 1993 and 1999?  I put it to him that Mayo County Council estimates that there would be work for 1,000 men for ten years if coast protection works from Louisburgh, Leckanvy, Murrisk, Bertra, Mulrany and Achill to Erris were carried out.  Some of the applications put forward in respect of areas where work requires to be done meet the criteria laid down by the Minister, in terms of tourist facilities and transport services to isolated communities.  I ask the Minister to consider including some of these projects on the priority list for 1993 to 1999.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point and I have the greatest of sympathy for the views expressed by him.  If he <Col N="2159" /> wishes to put forward any projects, in addition to the ones put forward by Mayo County Council, that should be given priority I would be glad to hear from him. For example, it is hoped to commence a dune management scheme at Bertra Beach, Westport, County Mayo, in the final months of this year.  This is currently being considered by Mayo County Council. I accept that there is a serious problem. I would remind the Deputy that while a sum of £5.5 million is to be made available for coast erosion works over the lifetime of this plan that last year only £200,000 was made available.  I am sure that Deputy Barrett and Deputy McManus would agree that the amount of money that was on offer during the past 12 months would not have been adequate in carrying out works at Killiney Bay or at Bray or other parts of Wicklow.  Therefore the figure of £5.5 million represents a considerable improvement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 33a:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;11.&mdash;Where the court is satisfied that parents of juvenile offenders should be asked to account for their role in controlling their child or children, such parents may be required by the court to give account to the court for their role and the court may, if the <Col N="2225" /> court deems fit, direct such parents to be at home or such other place of domestic residence as the court directs with their child or children at such times or part of such times and in such circumstances as the court directs the child or children to be at home or such other place of domestic residence as the court directs.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment, the wording of which may not be perfect, is to allow the courts to take into account the role played by parents and in narrow circumstances to tell them that they should be at home with their children. Let me explain the reasons I have tabled this amendment.  It is appropriate that the House should consider the matter and decide whether the courts should have this power.  It is desirable that they should have this power in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>One out of every three people in detention is a juvenile.  I think the figure is 695 or 31 per cent &mdash; as stated in the reply to a parliamentary question tabled by me &mdash; at a cost, according to a Young Fine Gael research document on juvenile crime, of £26 million a year.  One in six is under the age of 14.</P>
    <P>The first point I wish to make about the amendment is that it refers to juvenile offenders.  Parents should not be held responsible under the law for the actions of their children when they reach a certain age.  I do not have in mind the child who offends once or twice but rather young juveniles who constantly offend.  I am the father of four children and I realise that any child is capable of doing wrong &mdash; none of us is a saint.  I am not suggesting that this provision should apply in every case where a juvenile is involved but it should apply where the juvenile is a constant offender.  The court should have the right to require the parents of juveniles who are constantly offending to appear in court with the child and explain what they have been doing to control their child.  Furthermore, the court should have the right to direct that that child be at home <Col N="2226" /> between certain hours and that the parent should be with him.</P>
    <P>There are Members of the House who may think that is going too far, that it would be imposing a curfew.  At present if a child is a constant offender the judge may grant bail on condition that, under the supervision of the probation and welfare service, he will be at home every night after, say, 9 p.m., or at such times as the probation and welfare officer recommends.  If an offender has complied with the terms stipulated and if there is a disco on a particular night, the probation and welfare officer may allow the offender to attend it but stipulate he must be home by midnight.  In deciding on sentencing this juvenile offender, the judge will take into account whether he kept to his bond.  That is a curfew.  Some judges impose a curfew on people, again, in very limited circumstances and quite properly.</P>
    <P>One in six offenders is under the age of 14.  They should be at home at certain hours of the day.  Where they are constant offenders very often their parents are partly responsible.  This is not always the case but there are times when the parents are a contributing factor.  In fact, in some very limited circumstances, there is a suspicion that the parents are sending the children out to commit crime.  Thankfully, that is not normal and I am not suggesting that the procedure I described is normally used by the court.  Some parents simply do not take their responsibilities seriously.  I recall an eminent clergyman telling me recently that in a block of flats where there was a drug problem somebody reported to the father of a child that the child was abusing drugs.  The father's response was that he would kill him when he came in, not the response of any reasonable parent, which would be to remove the child from danger.</P>
    <P>It is time the Legislature gave the court the opportunity to hold parents accountable in these limited circumstances, particularly in housing estates and inner city flat complexes.  I do not imagine the same problem obtains in rural areas but, <Col N="2227" /> not being a public representative for one of those areas, I cannot say.  I know that in housing estates or flat complexes there are serious problems if a couple of children or a child of one family are constantly offending, intimidating or beating up other children, robbing, breaking into houses and terrifying old people.  The child is not the only one who should be before the court.  If he constantly offends his parents should be asked their role in that matter.  If a judge decides that a parent should be at home with the child at the times the child is ordered to be at home, what penalty should be imposed if the parent does not comply?  I am suggesting this approach in the first place because there is not much point in putting parents in prison.  That would take them away from the child and would not serve any purpose.  There is not much point either in ordering parents to pay a big fine as, in many cases, they could not pay it.  However, it should be possible for the court, in deciding at some time in the future whether those parents are responsible parents who should be left in charge of a child, to take into account as evidence the fact that those parents were not prepared, even at the direction of the court, to be at home at certain times looking after their children.  I want to make it absolutely clear that I am talking about a very small number of parents. Thankfully, the vast majority of parents take their responsibilities seriously. However, the parents of children who offend time after time should have to account to the court for their role in their children's behaviour.  If the child is ordered to be off the streets and at home at certain times, it should be possible for the court to direct that the parent must be home too.</P>
    <P>My amendment is in layman's terms and I am not suggesting it should be included, word for word, in the Bill.  I want to make it clear that we are talking about children and parents in domestic residences.  I am not talking about putting a parent into what might be called a home or reformatory.  I mention &ldquo;offenders&rdquo; but it would also apply to an &ldquo;offender&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2228" /> Will the House objectively consider my point?  This matter is worthy of consideration by the Legislature and it is time it was considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an interesting amendment.  Hardly a Deputy disagrees with Deputy Mitchell on the important role of parents of young offenders. Although I endorse much of what Deputy Mitchell said, we must look at this in a much wider context.  In reply to a question last week the Minister said she would be bringing in the juvenile justice Bill. However, these matters cannot be dealt with by way of that Bill alone.  The Departments of Health, Education and Social Welfare have a role to play.</P>
      <P>We can all give examples of total lack of parental responsibility.  Because of lack of control young people are out at all hours of the night.  On returning very late, around 4 a.m., from a function I drove through my own locality and came across eight different groups of young people.  They were no more than 16 or 17 years of age; some as young as 13 or 14.  At that hour of the morning those young children should have been at home.  Somebody had responsibility for them but that responsibility was not being faced up to.</P>
      <P>The reason I mention that matter is because, as everybody acknowledged in their contributions, society is changing and people are experiencing new problems and difficulties.  There is the problem of drugs, which we are endeavouring to tackle; the problem of deserted parents, single parents and widowed parents. Great pressure is put on these people in carrying out their responsibilities as parents.  It has been acknowledged that the vast majority of parents go about their duties and face up to their responsibilities.  Nevertheless, problems arise with young people becoming involved in crime.  Probation officers and gardaí say that it is the same people who are committing crime, but no progress is made in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should consider this matter before accepting the amendment. We are not dealing with the problem in <Col N="2229" /> the proper way.  There are other aspects to be considered, such as health, education and social welfare.  There is much criticism that we are not assisting people in the social welfare area.  We hear about the one million people on the poverty line, and there is no doubt that many sections of our community live in poverty. Even though a massive amount of money &mdash; almost £4 billion this year &mdash; is paid out in social welfare, it is not achieving the desired result.  I believe that the problem is related to education.</P>
    <P>In regard to Deputy Mitchell's amendment, the Minister should consider this matter in a broader sense and perhaps incorporate the provision in a juvenile justice Bill.  This is a very complex area and there are no easy solutions to the problem.  It must be considered in the context of health, education, social welfare and justice.  There are many young people committing crime today and the elderly are intimidated and terrorised by them.  I do not believe that this amendment would address the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I support this amendment.  It has been said here that we are introducing a form of internment.  Deputy Mitchell has made it quite clear that this provision would apply only to a minority of parents.  It is geared towards protecting society from young people who run wild, causing havoc, distress and suffering.  There is no question that every parent will be told to be at home at 11 p.m. every night.  Parents carry out a difficult role at a time when there are so many temptations for young people.  In cases where parents make no effort to look after their children, where the Garda know they are neglecting their children and as a result the children are causing havoc, we are not going overboard with this provision. Some people exaggerate and give the impression that we are trying to ensure that all parents are in the home at 11 p.m.  However, it is only in exceptional cases that parents neglect their duties and in those circumstances we must protect society.  I see nothing wrong with a judge ordering a parent, whom the Garda know <Col N="2230" /> is never at home at night, to be at home with their children by 10 p.m. or 11 p.m.</P>
      <P>It has been stated that the Garda are people of common sense and that they will not bring parents before a court if they are doing their job properly.  This provision would be implemented only in certain cases where children clearly need guidance.  This matter should be treated seriously and not in an exaggerated way, with stories of internment and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly) Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> In my last job I frequently dealt with young people who were in trouble with the law. It was often remarked among the staff in the organisation in which I worked that nowadays one needs a licence to do everything except be a parent.  Parenthood is probably one job for which people need most training.  I welcome the discussion on the role of parents in dealing with young people who find themselves in trouble with the law.  I do not agree that this amendment will meet the problem because provisions made in law should be capable of being implemented, but this provision would be unworkable in practice.  Deputies Browne and Mitchell said that the provision would be implemented only in exceptional cases where, for example, parents may be in the pub late at night, neglecting their children.  It is in cases such as this that it would be most difficult to enforce the law, because to put under a curfew people who are not in the habit of carrying out their parental responsibilities will not force them to do so.  In addition, probation officers, gardaí and others who are already very busy would be obliged to enforce the curfew on the parent of the offender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume that if a parent disobeyed a court order to be at home with their children at a certain time, there would be the possibility of the parent being criminalised. That would compound the problem. I stress that I am not arguing in support of parental irresponsibility. What I am arguing is that we should consider the practicalities and reality of life on the ground where these problems arise.  This provision is not the instrument <Col N="2231" /> with which to deal with such problems. For example, under this amendment a person could be directed to be at home with their child, but home may mean different things to different people. Home may be a flat, a house, a caravan, or, in the case of a separated couple, the father's residence or the mother's residence.  In these circumstances where will the parents be directed to stay?  In some cases there may be overcrowding or violence in the home.  All these circumstances need to be addressed before we direct parents to remain in the home. Such a direction might do more harm than good, causing further trouble and thereby increasing the workload of the Garda and the judicial services.</P>
    <P>Let us take the example of parents who are not neglecting their responsibilities but, despite all their best efforts, are unable to control their children.  In some cases the Garda, social workers and probation officers can verify that in spite of the best efforts of parents their children are still unruly.  I dealt with a case in my constituency last year where a 13 year old child was consistently beating up both parents.  How can one ask those parents to impose a curfew on their child?</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Wallace that this issue should be dealt with in a juvenile justice Bill and not in a criminal justice Bill which proposes a fairly blunt way of dealing with this problem.  I do not think these provisions are capable of being put into effect.  In addition, the Garda will be further tied-up bringing proceedings against families who are already in trouble with the law.  There is a need for a number of measures to deal with this problem, some of which should take account of the responsibility of parents to do their best to control their children and others which should offer residential options.  I would very much welcome a strengthening of the probation and welfare services, the liaison scheme and the community policing system.  We look for value in all areas of public expenditure, but the work carried out by people in these areas is very much undervalued at present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2232" /> It is very easy to call for measures which, on the one hand, appear to be strong but which, on the other, neglect the low key interventions made by the Garda, social workers and probation officers on a day-to-day basis to prevent many of these problems.  I would much prefer this issue to be dealt with by way of a juvenile justice Bill.  I am confident that the Minister will introduce such a Bill at the earliest possible opportunity. Like other Departments, her Department has been very productive in bringing forward legislation since the formation of the Government.  I am sure she will address the problem of juvenile crime at the earliest possible opportunity. I will be happy to comment at that stage on any proposed measures to deal with this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell should be complimented on focusing our attention on the level of crime committed by young people.  Many of the provisions in the Bill deal with the activities in which many young children, particularly those who live in urban areas, are engaged. Like Deputy Wallace, all of us have encountered gangs of juveniles and young children hanging around street corners late at night.  The reality is that very often these gangs are up to no good. I do not think any of us can say that parents should not be responsible for the activities of their children.  Parents bring their children into the world and they are responsible for their development, rearing, feeding and education.  In our Constitution we have given the family a central role in our society.  Parents should not take lightly their moral and spiritual duties to their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dilemma we are faced with here is finding the correct way to ensure that parents take their reponsibilities seriously.  We should provide support for parents who have unruly children.  Many parents who do not take their responsibilities to their children seriously are usually beset by many social problems &mdash; for example, they may live in disadvantaged communities.  We cannot separate one issue from the other and simply say that <Col N="2233" /> parents should be responsible for the activities of their children.  We also have to look at the support services required by families.</P>
    <P>I have a difficulty with the proposal that parents can be directed by the courts. It is one thing for a court to issue a direction to a young person who has been accused of an offence, but it is another thing to say that parents can be directed by a court to be at home or at such other places of domestic residence at certain times.  Under our present law, parents are not responsible for criminal offences committed by their children.  If parents are not prepared to abide by a direction from a court, presumably they will be in breach of the direction, will have committed an offence, will be subject to further action by the Garda and will be brought before the court.  This is not a practical or feasible way of dealing with the problem.  I do not think this provision could be implemented.</P>
    <P>Section 10 dealt with the wilful interruption of the free passage of any person or vehicle in a public place.  This presupposes there will be some interference and that it must be done in an orderly fashion.  If we go down the same road in regard to this provision we will create more problems than we can solve.  We have to look at the problem in a broader context and consider the supports needed by families.  Families in disadvantaged areas have been neglected to a huge degree.  The only children who attend playschools are the children of parents who can afford to pay for them.  This means that most children in disadvantaged areas do not get any kind of education until they enter primary school at four or five years of age.  However, by this time some of these children may already have been roaming around the streets with their older brothers and sisters. Under the Constitution the State has an obligation to provide education for children.  This education is not being provided for children in disadvantaged communities and the better-off communities are able to provide it themselves. This issue needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The home-school liaison scheme was <Col N="2234" /> the first step in providing support for families.  The level of social services in most disadvantaged areas is inadequate and needs to be considerably improved. We should consider the direction in which we wish to go in our society.  In this connection, I agree that the Minister should look at the problem of juvenile justice.  The amendment refers only to children.  Under the 1908 Act, youngsters up to the age of 12 are defined as children, 12-14 year olds are defined as young persons and older children are defined as juveniles.  Therefore, juvenile justice would only deal directly with the older age group but I presume the Minister proposes to cover younger age groups also when she introduces the new juvenile justice Bill.</P>
    <P>This is the appropriate forum for examining this problem which is becoming widespread in our society, where there is more and more offensive behaviour by younger children.  How to deal with that problem cannot be addressed in this type of legislation.  Therefore, having received our support for the fact that he has opened up the question for discussion, perhaps Deputy Mitchell should withdraw the motion at this time.  Hopefully, the Minister can give the Deputy an assurance that the matter will be comprehensively addressed, in the context of the Programme for Government as it is specified therein, by the introduction of a juvenile justice Bill within the term of this Government and that the matter will be dealt with at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the compliments passed by all the Members to Deputy Mitchell for opening up a debate on a very worthwhile topic but this might not be the appropriate Bill in which to address the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies have made comments that I had intended to make.  There is a juvenile justice Bill in the course of preparation in my Department and Deputies frequently ask the Taoiseach on the Order of Business when the Bill will be ready.  We have the benefit of a lengthy and very fine report which was <Col N="2235" /> carried out by one of the Oireachtas Joint Committees in this whole area.  It makes very valuable recommendations, many of which have been taken on board.</P>
    <P>As it stands now, the Bill contains over 150 sections which have been sent by my Department to the Department of Education in the first instance because obviously the area of juvenile justice goes right across the board into the areas of education, health and social welfare in particular.  Therefore, it is cumbersome legislation and we must be extremely careful to ensure that the proposals contained in the Bill, and whatever amendments that are made here when it comes to the House, are capable of being implemented.  Theory is fine but the practicalities, about which most of the Deputies have been concerned, are sometimes very different.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputy Mitchell because it is not fashionable to raise the question of parental responsibility.  For some reason, people feel that once their children have been reared to a certain age they should be entitled to do what they like.  We have had long discussion in Committee on this Bill and, indeed, on another Bill in relation to placing the onus of responsibility on parents. However, in doing that we must be careful because there are parents who have good parenting skills but, despite their very best efforts, one member of the family can often stray, perhaps only for a short period of time, and the question must be asked whether those parents should be penalised.  On the other hand, there are parents who have poor parenting skills through no fault of their own.  This comes back to the comments made by Deputy Gallagher and Deputy Costello in regard to supporting those parents to help them with their parenting skills.  There are other parents also, whom Deputy Mitchell mentioned and whom we want to identify, who are the parents of persistent young offenders and who actively encourage their children to become involved in crime.</P>
    <P>When people outside this House talk in broad sweeping terms about parental <Col N="2236" /> responsibility, the more conservative elements in society very often say that this form of crime emanates from the homes of &ldquo;latch key kids&rdquo; where both parents work, or from very deprived areas.  It probably emanates from both these areas but also from a much wider spectrum of the community.  It is very difficult to define the exact area that must be identified and that is what we are attempting to do in the juvenile justice Bill.  However, it is an extremely complicated process and I would not like anybody to think that it will be easy legislation to, first, prepare and, second, to get through the House.</P>
    <P>Very often, the influence of parents is diminished somewhat by peer pressure on children at certain stages of their development, at the end of primary school and the beginning of secondary school education.  I am sure parents find at that time that a boyfriend or girlfriend can have far more influence on an adolescent than a parent.  This is fashionably known as the time when children have to &ldquo;find themselves&rdquo;.  I suppose we all must say, there, but for the grace of God, go I.  We are all parents and any one of our children can stray or err and we must be thankful when they do not.</P>
    <P>This is an area which I would not like to take on board in this legislation and in fairness to Deputy Mitchell he recognises that there are certain difficulties in doing that.  He can be assured, however, that this matter is very close to my heart and one in which there is much interest in this House and support for taking action in this area.  There will be no delays in bringing forward a juvenile justice Bill but I want to put on record that it is not uncomplicated or concise legislation as people outside this House might wish to believe.</P>

      <P>Listening to some of the points made by Deputies Costello and Gallagher, I was reminded of a recent event in England where two young children &mdash; I think aged ten and 12 &mdash; apparently killed a three year old boy having abducted him from a shopping centre.  One aspect that made a very <Col N="2237" /> strong impression on me at that time &mdash; when the identity of the boys who committed the crime remained unclear &mdash; was the sense of horror that gripped most parents of children of that age at the thought that their child could actually be the perpetrator of such a terrible crime.</P>
      <P>When these boys were eventually brought to court &mdash; and I do not know what has happened to them since &mdash; as frequently happens on these occasions photographs were not permitted but there was an artist's impression of the scene showing the three magistrates and the young boys sitting in the court.  One of the boys had no parent accompanying him, the other had his father with him.  It struck me as a very poignant scene that one boy had no parent to sit with him while facing those accusations in such terrible circumstances.  I wondered whether it was because the parents of the boy were so horrified or so completely destroyed by what had happened that they could not participate in the proceedings or, alternatively, because the child had no effective parents.</P>
      <P>I remember looking at the artist's impression of the man who was sitting with one of the boys and thinking what a terrible experience it was for him to be in that court in such circumstances, and doubtless being mobbed by tabloid journalists anxious to make the point in some glib way that he was to some extent the father of a monster.  It struck me that it is very easy to imagine, in circumstances of this kind, the various motives and explanations as to why this crime was committed.  Perhaps the magistrates or the social workers now know the circumstances that give rise to this crime but it occurred to me that it is very easy to make judgments about parents, parenting skills and parents' inadequacies, judgments which may or may not be right but which could be very wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While appreciating that Deputy Mitchell's proposal is to grant a power to be invoked in certain circumstances &mdash; and I know people feel there are many irresponsible parents who breach their <Col N="2238" /> parental obligations in relation to society and their children &mdash; we must be extremely careful that we do not end up pursuing the notion of parental responsibility further than is practicable.  There has been much talk &mdash; I suppose my party has done as much as any other party &mdash; about increasing parental accountability for child crime, but the Victorians, or, to be more precise, the Edwardians did that because the Bill the Minister proposes introducing, the Juvenile Justice Bill, will set aside and replace the provisions of the Children Act, 1908, which is now very antiquated and full of inadequacies and idiosyncrasies.  The reality is that they thought of such power.  As I understand it the provisions of the 1908 Act were to deal with ordinary events, that, in the case of every child offender, his or her parents were to be present before the court when the child was being dealt with. In addition, there is a provision in the 1908 Act that where the court is satisfied that the crime committed by the child arose from the neglect of his or her parents, it has the power to punish the parents in respect of their neglect.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the House will realise that what is being discussed under this amendment is not an entirely new idea.  Clearly it is something that should be considered long and hard and to which there are no simple solutions.  I am not suggesting that Deputy Mitchell is being simple-minded in his proposal, but what is of the utmost importance in all of these things is practicality. There is no point in assuming that our courts system, as at present constituted and as it is likely to evolve given current constraints on resources, will be in a position to effectively supervise family life for the vast majority of child offenders.</P>
    <P>For that reason I am opposed to the concept of creating a new power of effective curfew for parents.  What struck me, based on my experience, was that very few parents, if any &mdash; perhaps the Minister will have some figures on this &mdash; have been punished under the provisions of the 1908 Act.  Indeed, the fines provided for under that Act probably have become minimal and its provisions effectively <Col N="2239" /> have become unworkable.  I do not recall ever hearing of occasions when parents were rendered liable for penalties under the provisions of the 1908 Act.  If the provisions of that Act have not been implemented by the courts, probably for humane reasons, it is highly unlikely that there would be much use made of the proposal advanced by Deputy Mitchell.</P>
    <P>I would be against such a proposal.  It would be better to deal with it in the context of a review of the juvenile justice system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister and Deputy Costello for their complimentary comments and to those Members who contributed to the debate on this amendment.  In introducing this amendment I made it clear that my objective was to have the matter discussed within the context of this Bill. I do not intend to press this amendment. Lest I am accused of saying something I did not say I should point out that Deputy Michael McDowell was not present for my introduction.  I did not say, or mean to imply, and I went out of my way to so indicate, that there are many parents who breach their parental responsibilities.  I made it clear I was talking about a small minority of parents and in circumstances in which the child or children was or were constant offenders.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say she is considering this matter in the context of the juvenile justice Bill which is probably the best vehicle for its consideration. Nonetheless, it was beneficial to have had this preliminary discussion on the matter because, for the reasons I stated, it is desirable, if we are to ask young children who are constant offenders to account for themselves, that, in certain circumstances, parents should also be asked to account for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a precedent &mdash; here I am relying on memory and I think it was Deputy Gallagher <i>(Laoighis-Offaly)</i> who raised the point &mdash; for parents not being capable of being involved in the guilt or associated with the crime or crimes carried out by their juvenile children under the Street <Col N="2240" /> Trading Act.  Again if I recall correctly, the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism was advised that it might be a precedent to be followed.  I am not suggesting that a court would take this factor into account in all circumstances. I made very clear the specific and narrow circumstances in which I proposed such provision be invoked.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to press this amendment but we have had a very fruitful and worthwhile discussion.  I am also glad that the Minister is considering the matter in the context of the juvenile justice Bill.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the question of a school for autistic children which is located in James Connolly House, in the grounds of the James Connolly Memorial Hospital in Blanchardstown, County Dublin.  This school was based in St. Loman's Hospital in Lucan for a number of years and was reinstated on the site in Blanchardstown about three or four years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many problems have been encountered with this school over this period, its present structure is quite unsuitable for the needs of the children.  Effectively, the building is a portacabin, has been described as unhygienic, dangerous and unsuitable for the children's needs.  The children's parents are very concerned that their children be provided with the best care possible and have been lobbying for some time to ensure that a proper <Col N="2241" /> building, suitable to their needs, is provided.</P>
    <P>The views I express are not mine only, they are those of key officials in the Eastern Health Board.  I took the trouble to visit this school.  In my view, speaking as someone who is not an expert on the needs of autistic children, it is quite unsuitable.  I wish to quote the following from a letter written by key officials of the Eastern Health Board to the Minister for Education, earlier this year:</P>
    <P>This prefab has long passed its useful life span.  It consists of two classrooms, toilets, and office and eating area.  The toilets are unsuitably placed giving rise to problems of management and control. Toilet training is part of the social skills programme for these children. The ceilings are low and, as some of the children are now of adult build, the whole structure is totally unsuitable.  It has been condemned by the Office of Public Works and by officials from the building section of your Department. [that is, the Department of Education] who visited the school on 2 March 1993.  The health board (patron) has no other suitable premises available and there is no accommodation available in local schools....</P>
    <P>However, I should point out that a site is available very close to these portacabins, the present hostel accommodation available to these children, and where they remain on weekdays.  The children from my constituency with whom I am acquainted travel across to the school on a Monday morning, may return home midweek but certainly would return home on Friday evening.</P>
    <P>There is urgent need for some action to be taken to deal with the deficiencies of this building.  This matter is a hobby horse of mine and I have made representations about it several times. Indeed I raised it on the Adjournment in Seanad Éireann a year or two ago.  People will have and idea of the type of difficulties some parents encounter when I say that the child is collected by a bus service at 7.55 a.m. approximately on a Monday morning.  The set down time for that child <Col N="2242" /> to get to the school is 9.15 a.m., yet class does not commence until 10 a.m.  On Friday afternoon class concludes between 3.15 p.m. and 3.20 p.m.  One particular child is not scheduled to arrive home until 4.45 p.m., but sometimes it may be later.</P>
    <P>I hope it will be possible for the Minister to give us reassuring information in regard to what might be done.  This matter must receive priority.  Based on population trends in the Eastern Health Board area, it is estimated that services will be required for 140 to 160 autistic children.  The school would be for a smaller number, because presumably there is a number of other schools available.  I hope the Minister will have some encouraging information on this ongoing and very difficult problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity which the Deputy has presented me with to clarify the Department of Education's position in relation to this matter.  This three teacher school catering for autistic and emotionally disturbed children is located in two separate premises.  Twelve autistic children attend the main school building, comprised of prefabricated accommodation located on the premises of James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Blanchardstown.  Residential accommodation is available next to the school.  A further eight emotionally disturbed children are in residence, and at school in a large private house four miles away known as Court Hall.</P>
      <P>The school authorities are seeking the provision of two permanent classrooms and associated ancillary accommodation to replace the existing prefabricated classrooms at James Connolly House, which my Department agrees are unsuitable. The accommodation at Court Hall is satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials of the Department of Education met with a deputation from the board of management and representatives of the Eastern Health Board in March of this year to discuss the position. At that meeting the school authorities suggested a possible site for a new <Col N="2243" /> building if approved by the Department. I understand that the site in question adjoins the existing school premises and also forms part of the James Connolly House grounds.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive report has recently been received from an inspector in the Department of Education suggesting a range of possible options on the future development of the school.  This report is under consideration in the Department and the officials will be in contact with the school authorities at an early date to discuss the matter in detail.</P>
    <P>Pending the outcome of these discussions, the Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to give any commitments on possible capital funding at this stage.  However, I wish to assure the Deputy that both I and the Department of Education have a strong commitment to the development of special education, and the special needs and interests of these children will be foremost in influencing any decision taken in this matter.</P>

      <P>I regret the Minister is not in the House to hear about this very important issue.  We are calling on the Minister to provide funds for the replacement of Ballymackney school outside Carrickmacross.  The present school was built in 1847.  It is hardly necessary to outline the condition of a school built during the famine.  The school has three classrooms, to which a prefab was added in 1979.  There are two toilets in the school, one for girls and one for boys, which are shared with the teachers.  The school has been condemned by the public health medical officer on the basis of insufficient space per child, inadequate toilets, only one tap supplying drinking <Col N="2244" /> water located in the yard and the school's general condition.  The play area is totally inadequate.  Also the school happens to be on the Dundalk-Cavan road, a very dangerous road, which the children have to cross to go to the playground.  One small room is used as a staff room, for meetings and also by the remedial teacher.  That room is badly placed in that it is beside the toilet facilities.  Also the school furniture is antiquated.</P>
      <P>In 1977, 130 years after the school was built, the other school in the parish was closed down.  At that time it was decided that a central school should be built to replace both schools.  At present 116 children attended the school.  A site was purchased and in 1988 the present parish priest, Fr. O'Reilly, completed the formalities and the necessary funds were raised by the people.  When I was Minister for Health, my colleague, the then Minister for Education, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, met parent deputations and ensured that the school progressed to the stage were everything is ready except funding from the Department.</P>
      <P>Planning permission, which was again applied for in 1992, was granted.  Naturally, the parents are very frustrated because they do not have their school.  I am calling on the Minister for Education to provide funding in 1994 to ensure the building of this school commences. Under the National Development Plan funding should be available in 1994.  I thank the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Stagg, for coming in to take the Adjournment Debate.  I would ask him to impress upon his colleague, the Minister for Education, the need to have this school built as rapidly as possible.</P>

      <P>It gives me great pleasure to join my colleague in Cavan-Monaghan, Deputy O'Hanlon, in urging the Minister for Education to provide adequate finance in the 1994 Estimate to have the Greenfield primary school project for Killanny parish underway in the coming year.  As he has outlined, it is a very urgent project as the present school is one of the oldest in the country. <Col N="2245" /> Its location along the Dundalk-Cavan road or the Dundalk-Carrickmacross road means it is dangerous.  As in the case with many other schools where building projects are in the pipeline, we have prefabricated accommodation which is inadequate and unsatisfactory.  The parents, teachers and pupils involved have been very patient in the past but they are now very anxious to get the project underway. I urge the Minister for Education to endeavour to have this project included in the 1994 building programme.  I know the Minister for State, Deputy Emmet Stagg, who is standing in for the Minister this evening will impress our views on her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure both Deputy O'Hanlon and Deputy Kirk will appreciate that the reason the Minister is not present is that she is attending the Education Convention.</P>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity which the Deputies have presented me with to clarify the position in relation to this matter.  This is a four teacher school which had an enrolment of 120 pupils in September 1992.  The existing accommodation consists of three permanent classrooms and a prefab classroom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department has approved the provision of a new school to replace the existing unsatisfactory building.  The total estimated grant-aid for this project will amount to £165,000.  The architectural planning of the new school is at an advanced stage and planning permission <Col N="2246" /> has been received from the local authority.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies will appreciate, every school invariably makes the case that its project is deserving of special consideration.  The Department of Education would be more than delighted if, in a world where resources were unlimited, every scheme could proceed at the same time.  However, as the Deputies will be aware, because of the large volume of major building projects on hands and the limitations on resources, it is possible to allow only a certain number of projects to proceed to construction in any one financial year.  Unfortunately it was not possible to include this project in the national schools capital programme for 1993.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education is well aware that conditions at the existing school are far from satisfactory and that the existing permanent accommodation dates from the middle of the last century. I am also aware that the school authorities have been pressing for a new school for a number of years and that a previous building scheme had to be abandoned in 1987 due to the difficult financial situation at that time.  Therefore I wish to assure the Deputies that the Department accepts that this is a project deserving of the highest priority in the context of projects to be allowed to proceed to construction in 1994.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 27 October 1993.</P>

      <P>Since no gain to the Exchequer is involved, services between Government Departments are, for administrative convenience, generally provided free of charge.

A similar arrangement for the year 1993 was announced in this year's budget.</P>

Included in the board's remit was the question of measures to encourage a higher degree of home ownership by members of the Defence Forces and also how local authorities could meet the housing needs of military personnel in the context of the plan for social housing and the public capital programme.  Married Army personnel have an equal claim on local authority housing with other members of the community.</P>

      <P>The Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes provide for the payment of a special increment of £3.46 a week in addition to his basic pension to a soldier for each year of his pensionable service in excess of 21 years but not exceeding 31 years. As a general rule, this special increment ceases to be payable when the soldier pensioner becomes entitled to a Social Welfare retirement pension (at age 65) or to a contributory old age pension at age 66.  The personal rate of either social welfare pension is considerably greater than the maximum special increment. Exceptionally, the increment continues to be payable up to 70 years of age in the case of a pensioner who was discharged prior to 1 August, 1978, provided he is not in receipt of a Social Welfare retirement pension.</P>
      <P>The withdrawal of the special increment is in accordance with the principle of co-ordinating occupational pensions in the public sector with social welfare pensions in the case of employees who are fully insured under the Social Welfare Acts.  Soldiers are so insured. This matter was examined by the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces. The Commission did not recommend any change in the present arrangements.</P>

      <P>The recently submitted National Development Plan sets out the framework for the development of the fishing sector over the period 1994-99. The plan will involve an investment of about £137 million in the industry over that period.  The investment will be carefully targeted to maintain and strengthen the industry's contribution to the national economy, and, in particular, its contribution to growth and employment in coastal communities through a series of integrated measures in the fleet, fish processing and marketing, aquaculture, fisheries harbours and training.</P>
      <P>A fully detailed operation programme to underpin the plan is currently in preparation. I will, of course, keep Deputies informed of the detailed allocations and detailed priorities set in the operational programme.</P>
      <P>Turning to the matter of obtaining a fair share of the European catch, the imbalance between the share of European Community fish resources in the Irish region and the quotas allocated to Ireland has been a source of considerable concern for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a memorandum addressed to the Council of Fisheries Ministers in the context of the mid-term review of the Common Fisheries Policy, Ireland made an objective and reasoned case for increased quota allocations to the Irish region.  The Council of Ministers in December 1992 directed the Commission to make a detailed response to the Irish memorandum, which the Commission tabled at the June 1993 Council.  The Irish case and the Commission response was <Col N="2180" /> discussed at the Council in Luxembourg yesterday.</P>
    <P>Frankly speaking, I am not happy with the response which the Commission made to the Irish case.  I made my view quite clear to the Council and the Commissioner yesterday.  However, in the subsequent discussion, it became clear that most of my ministerial colleagues are not prepared at this time to see additional fish allocations made to the Irish region. As this was the case, I made a strong unilateral declaration for insertion in the Council minutes to the effect that Ireland remains extremely dissatisfied with its allocation of fish stocks and will continue to pursue this matter until a successful outcome is achieved.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that I am considering carefully what options are now open to me in this matter and will have no hesitation in taking the steps necessary to achieve a satisfactory solution for Ireland.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>While naval cadetships and the academic content of naval training are already recognised in full, I understand that there have been difficulties in accepting the practical content of naval training as automatically equivalent to merchant shipping requirements.  Naval vessel and merchant vessel &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; practices are quite different in many respects, reflecting the specialised nature of both of the respective services.  However, the Department is reviewing the practical scope for increasing the present level of <Col N="2181" /> recognition of naval qualifications and I am hopeful that a way forward will be found to facilitate such a step which will be acceptable to all concerned.</P>

      <P>Demand for eels has been increasing in recent years and this is reflected in the increased number of people wishing to fish for eels, the level of catches and the prices being paid for eels.</P>
      <P>It is now necessary to upgrade our legislation to keep pace with these developments through improved management and control.  The Department is at present preparing draft amending primary legislation to take account of this.  The principal thrust of the amendments being considered is to give the same level of control-protection to eels as are afforded to salmon and trout.  These relate mainly to: 1, sales of eels; 2, carriage of eels; 3, possession of eels; 4, exports of eels.</P>
      <P>The question of suitable penalties for breaches of conditions attaching to eel authorisations is also being considered. This will strengthen the hand of the enforcement authorities considerably in controlling illegal eel fishing activities.  I am giving this amending primary legislation priority within the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of the possible close connection between illegal eel fishing activity and illegal organisations I have referred this to my colleague, the Minister for Justice as this is essentially a law and order matter.  I would like to stress here that there is excellent close co-operation between the staff of the fishery boards and the Garda Síochána.  In the <Col N="2182" /> case to which I think you refer in the Lough Ennel area, the eel fishery there is the property of the ESB and again their protection staff are working closely with the gardaí in controlling this illegal activity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61, 62, 73, 85, 90 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall that earlier this year I established an expanded research, conservation and management programme to address the decline in sea trout numbers.  The programme builds on measures undertaken in previous years and has been further intensified in a number of key respects during the course of the year.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive research programme for 1993 has been underway with additional emphasis on stock sampling data from river systems and sea lice biology and distribution.  This work has included and expanded sea lice monitoring programme for salmon farms and a joint river sampling programme-netting survey of sea trout stocks in rivers and estuaries undertaken by the Department in conjunction with the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards and the Salmon Research Agency.</P>
      <P>The Scientific Sea Trout Working Group, which represents all the scientists involved in the national sea trout research programme, has reconvened this week to assess and evaluate the results of the 1993 research programme. I have asked the working group to report to me as a matter of urgency, to advise on the future direction of the research effort, and to make recommendations on action needed in order to halt the decline in sea trout stocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also pleased to inform Deputies that the International Conference on the Exploration of the Sea, which met in Dublin last month, reviewed the current research work on sea trout by Irish, Danish and Finnish scientists.  The conference has established a study group to improve international knowledge of sea trout and to help in the future management of stocks.  ICES has noted that <Col N="2185" /> there is a dearth of information on the species generally which prevents any real understanding of population fluctuations. The study group will address these gaps.  I very much welcome this important initiative which will co-ordinate and direct international sea trout research and which will contribute directly to our own work on this complex issue.  In addition to the continuing research effort, the national sea trout action programme this year includes strengthened conservation by-laws to protect existing stocks and rehabilitation measures under a national stocks enhancement programme.  Management strategies for fish farms have been enhanced and formalised, with particular emphasis on the development of agreed fallowing guidelines, bay management strategies and fish husbandry practices aimed at minimising lice loads and disease incidence on fish farms.  In this context I established an advisory group on fallowing strategies, including representatives of fisheries and salmon farming interests. The group has now recommended a framework of policy guidelines for fallowing strategies.  Using this framework, assessments of individual fallowing site proposals will take place over the coming weeks, under the aegis of the Department, which will involve all concerned interests including salmon farmers, fisheries boards, fishery owners and the Salmon Research Agency.</P>
    <P>I have further augmented the action programme by convening a task force, with a mandate to secure the survival of the sea trout, which will report directly to me on measures needed to mitigate the decline in stocks.  The group, which is compact and representative of all relevant interests, is chaired by Dr. T. K. Whitaker.  I have asked the task force to report to me at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>I have always made it clear that different perceptions as to the cause of this complex problem must not stand in the way of concerted action to save the sea trout.  I am confident that national and international research effort and our overall co-operative programme of <Col N="2186" /> action will help us to achieve that objective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67, 69, 77, 84, 98 and 144 together.</P>
      <P>It is necessary at this time to review and update the sea fishing fleet management framework in order to develop the Irish fleet to its maximum potential and in particular:</P>
      <P>&mdash;to bring individual parts of the fleet into line with the stocks targetted by them;</P>
      <P>&mdash;to meet EC fleet targets;</P>
      <P>&mdash;to facilitate the entry of modern vessels;</P>
      <P>&mdash;to secure access to EC Structural Funds, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2189" />&mdash;to improve the safety of fishing vessels.</P>
    <P>A number of actions are proposed in the discussion document, to advance these objectives:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the introduction of a decommissioning scheme;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the division of the fleet into categories, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the development of a new licensing system.</P>
    <P>It also entails the taking of steps to regularise the position of small boats operating as part of the Irish fleet but which for various reasons have not been formally registered.</P>
    <P>With these objectives and aims in mind and having regard to the major importance of these issues the Department of the Marine released on 28 September last a discussion document.  The purpose of this discussion document is to ensure that the fishing industry has every opportunity to assess the implications of these proposals so that the widest possible consultation will take place.</P>
    <P>This consultation process is now in full swing.  It entails the following:</P>
    <P>&mdash;a copy of the document has been sent to every registered owner of a fishing boat;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a detailed briefing has been given to representatives of the major fishing organisations;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a series of regional meetings which are advertised widely locally in advance at some ten venues has been organised and three of these have already been held;</P>
    <P>&mdash;written views have been sought on the document through advertisements in the papers, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;further detailed discussions will be held with fishing organisations when the consultation process is completed.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing every registered owner has been advised on a strictly <Col N="2190" /> provisional basis of the specific consequences for him or her of the adoption of the categorisation criteria advanced in the discussion document.  Each owner has been invited to review the provisional categorisation of his or her boat and given a period of eight weeks to get back to the Department.  In the letter, it is explained that the categorisation of a boat is subject to review in light of any appeal made or in the light of developments arising from the public consultation process.</P>
    <P>I envisage that this public consultation process will continue for a number of months.  When the process is complete, and after discussions with the fishing industry organisation, there will be a full scale review of the proposals advanced in the discussion document with a view to meeting as far as this can be done, all reasonable concerns expressed before finalising the policy early next year.</P>
    <P>As regards EC constraints on categorisation, the position is that fleet categories are specified and that fleet management must be in line with these categories.  That is not to say that there is total inflexibility in the means employed to implement categorisation and I will be reviewing these means in the light of the outcome of the discussion process.</P>
    <P>However, I must emphasise that one of the key objectives of the present categorisation criteria is to ensure that no fishermen will be prevented from continuing with the fishing activity which he or she has practiced in recent years. Moreover, the categories chosen are broad categories and many boats fall into multiple categories.</P>
    <P>As regards the position of the fleets of other member states, the fact is that all member states with fishing fleets are required to make reductions in the size of their fleets.  On the other hand, following a tough battle with the Commission, including the initiation of an action in the European Court, exceptional treatment was accorded the Irish fleet allowing it to increase its fleet.</P>
    <P>Turning to the matter of the introduction of an appeals procedure, I am of the view that the existing process of direct <Col N="2191" /> representations to the Department, or Ministers, the Ombudsmans Office and ultimately the Courts are adequate to deal with individual cases where a person may feel aggrieved at individual decisions taken.  This is something, however, which I am prepared to keep under review.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 88, 91 and 96 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total investment of £137 million will be made in the fisheries sector over the <Col N="2196" /> period of the National Development Plan.  This investment will underpin an integrated programme of development in the fisheries sector, which covers the following areas:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the fishing fleet</P>
    <P>&mdash;fish processing and marketing</P>
    <P>&mdash;aquaculture</P>
    <P>&mdash;fishery harbours and</P>
    <P>&mdash;training.</P>
    <P>The details of the development programme and, in particular, the allocations of funding between the various areas, the eligibility criteria for the measures and the procedures for applying for grant-aid have not yet been finalised. These details will be part of the detailed Operational Programme for the Fisheries sector, which is currently in preparation.</P>
    <P>As regards the appeals mechanism mentioned by the Deputy, while, as I said, the detailed procedures have not yet been worked out, I can assure the Deputy that the development programme will be monitored and overseen by a Monitoring Committee on which will sit representatives of the European Community, the Irish administration and sectoral interests.</P>
    <P>As regards the fishing fleet in particular, the main aim of the proposed investment is to modernise and restructure the fleet so as to take up unused fishing quotas, increase catches of non-quota species and bring the fleet into better balance with available resources. As a consequence of the investment, the fleet will be better able to compete with the fleets of other member states operating around the Irish coast.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The penalties prescribed <Col N="2197" /> under current legislation for fisheries offences are amongst the toughest in the Community and provide in certain cases for fines of up to £100,000.  Where persistent offenders are concerned, in addition to any other fines and forfeitures, the courts have discretionary powers under the Acts to order the confiscation of the offending boats.</P>
      <P>Repeated transgressions by any fishing vessels of measures designed to conserve stocks and protect the livelihood of fishermen are totally unacceptable.  Indeed, there is evidence to suggest that existing powers of confiscation, applicable for second or subsequent serious offences, have been circumvented by the transfer of boats to new ownership.  The Department is currently reviewing the legal aspects of the matter in consultation with the Attorney General's Office and I am considering whether the relevant legislation could be amended to increase the likelihood that vessels guilty of a second or subsequent offence will be confiscated.</P>
      <P>Until such time as the matter has been fully assessed and all the legislative implications have been carefully examined, it would be inappropriate to anticipate the conclusions which may be reached or the actions which may be taken.  I would add however that the work involved has reached an advanced stage and I am hopeful that proposals for amending legislation to address this and other fisheries matters can be brought to the Government next month.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in previous replies, I am extremely concerned with the emergence over the last year of the practice of having secret holds on fishing vessels.  The Naval Service have detected sixteen such cases in the last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At my request the Department of Foreign Affairs has conveyed our serious concern at this development to the appropriate authorities in both the UK and Spain.  Both countries have agreed to cooperate and to take appropriate action to eliminate the practice in so far as vessels on their respective registers may be concerned. In addition, the matter has been brought to the attention of the European <Col N="2198" /> Commission.  I have raised this matter at a recent meeting with the Spanish Fisheries Minister and it is being actively pursued in the context of liaison meetings between senior officials of both administrations.</P>

      <P>As I informed the Deputy on 9 March 1993 in reply to a similar question, the Main Guard is owned at present by Clonmel Corporation. It will not, therefore, be possible for the Office of Public Works to provide funding for restoration works.</P>
      <P>Restoration of the building is, however, included in the programme put forward by the Office of Public Works for the next phase of EC funding.  In the event of such funding becoming available and if the Corporation wish that the building be restored, it will be necessary for the Corporation to transfer ownership to the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <P>Tipperary (SR) County Council submitted proposals in 1990 for a major realignment scheme on the N74 between Cashel and Tipperary, at an estimated cost of £10 million.  The Council was informed that, in view of the limited funds available for works on National Secondary roads and the competing demands for these funds countrywide, it was not possible to provide funding for the scheme.</P>
      <P>In recent years, a total of £310,000 has been allocated to the Council in respect of sight distance improvement works on the N74 between Cashel and Tipperary, including an allocation of £150,000 in the current year.  The provision of funding for further improvements works on the route will be considered when the 1994 Road Grant allocations are being determined.</P>

      <P>The 1992 GMS Agreement identified an opportunity for achieving cost effective prescribing through the operation of an incentive based drug target scheme for all GMS doctors.  Savings achieved over and above individual doctors targets will be divided equally between the practice concerned and the local health board for investment in practice development.  A support structure has been put in place through the local health board general practice units to facilitate general practitioners in meeting their targets.  I should emphasise that this is an incentive based scheme aimed at encouraging rational, safe and cost effective prescribing and freeing up resources for the development of general practice.  As such, a considerable number of GMS doctors are successfully operating their targets in 1993.  There are no penalties involved for failure to meet individual targets.</P>
      <P>I will be keeping the operation of the drug target scheme under regular review to ensure its effectiveness.</P>

These techniques include the application of casemix measures, this approach allows hospitals and individual practitioners to compare various aspects of their work load in a standardised way and to review it with their colleagues and their peers in other sites.  Other areas of evaluation of performance includes clinical audit which will give clinicians a better idea of whether their work is providing the best outcome for their patients.  My Department is promoting several initiatives in this area.</P>

      <P>The capital grant scheme for the provision of recreational facilities which was administered by my Department was amalgamated in 1990 with the amenity grant scheme operated by the Department of Environment and the local authorities, who are now responsible for processing such applications.</P>
      <P>The funds available to my Department under this scheme are fully committed to existing projects and it is not possible, therefore, to provide funding for any additional projects under this programme at present.</P>
      <P>The question of the allocation of a grant for the completion of the community hall referred to could be considered in the event of funds being made available to my Department in the context of the 1994 Estimates for Public Services.</P>

      <P>The pupil-techer ratio at primary level was 27.5:1 in the 1988-89 school year.  Following successive improvements, including implementation of provisions made in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, the ratio has been reduced to approximately 24.2:1 in the current school year.  The Programme for Partnership Government provides for a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio to 22:1 by 1996.</P>

      <P>A teacher who has opted to have his/her name placed on the appropriate panel may refuse any offer of a post if it is over 28 miles by road from his or her present school.  There are at present no proposals to change the rules which govern the operation of the panels.</P>
