      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 4, 8 and 2.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) No. 4 shall be taken without debate; (2) in the case of the Second Stage of No. 2 the following arrangements shall apply; (i) the opening speech of the Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party, the Progressive Democrats Party and the Technical Groups shall not exceed 30 minutes in each case; (ii) the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed 20 minutes; (iii) a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a speech in reply not exceeding 15 minutes; (3)  the Dáil shall meet tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. and shall adjourn not later than 4 p.m; (4) the Second Stage of No. 3 shall be taken tomorrow and the arrangements in paragraph 2 above shall apply in relation to the debate.

      <P>In relation to promised legislation, the Government has indicated its intention to ensure the commercial future of Aer Lingus.  This involves legislation to permit an equity injection from either the State or some other source.  Will the Government clarify first when it is intended to introduce this legislation and second, in order that the matters may be sorted out expeditiously, what Minister is responsible for Aer Lingus in view of the fact that one Minister is meeting the unions today while another Minister, who is directly responsible, has declined to meet the same unions?</P>

      <P>As has been stated on a number of occasions, the Government is awaiting the corporate plan for restructuring of Aer Lingus.  Until that plan is available it would not be reasonable to expect further comment from the Government in that regard.  In answer to the second part of the question, no such legislation has been promised.  In relation to meeting the unions at Aer Lingus, the Minister responsible has met the chairman on a number of occasions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the Taoiseach has confirmed that a budget will be introduced in 1993 and has given the date for it, may I ask him about a measure that was promised in the last budget?  In the January 1992 budget the Minister for Finance said that maternity benefit would be introduced for adoptive parents. However, the Department of Social Welfare has declined to introduce this benefit <Col N="1243" /> until the Department of Labour, now the Department of Enterprise and Employment, introduces regulations and legislation to provide for leave arrangements for adoptive parents.  I understand the Department of Enterprise and Employment has so far, after a full year, failed to produce this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;`cycle lane' means a road over which there is a public right of way for pedal cyclists only;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments refer to a proposal that reference should be made in this Bill to cycle lanes.  Second and Committee Stages of this Bill involved a considerable amount of debate, some of which concerned the principle of whether a national <Col N="1246" /> roads authority should be established independently or in the context of a wider policy on transport.  I had hoped in the aftermath of the general election, and with the formation of a new Government, that there might have been a rethink in relation to this legislation.  It is regrettable that such a rethink does not appear to have been undertaken.  That is reflected in the list of amendments before us.</P>
    <P>The question of the provision of cycle lanes was debated extensively when this Bill was in Committee and I do not want to rehash the entire discussion.  What is at issue is legislation which will provide a fast lane for the spending largely of European money in the construction of roads. During the lifetime of the last operational programme for Structural Funds a total of £650 million was invested in road construction, of which about £500 million was EC funding.  Most of that money was spent and is being spent in providing improved facilities for motorists.  These amendments seek to give recognition to those road users who do not use motorised transport but who instead prefer to use the more environmentally friendly method of cycling.  It seems a waste that large sums of public money are spent on road construction while only a small amount of money is spent on the provision of cycle lanes.  Very few of our roads have cycle lanes.  A small number of experimental cycle lane schemes exist.</P>
    <P>This Bill is concerned with establishing a road authority to oversee the construction of new road projects.  Legislation must be enacted to provide for cycle lanes in the construction of new road projects.  Those who cycle around urban areas will know that it is now a very hazardous method of travelling.  It is unsafe and the only way to make it safe it to provide cycle lanes.  If a large amount of money is to be spent on constructing roads, at least a portion of that money should be used to provide a safe method of transport for those people who opt &mdash; in line with Government policy &mdash; to use their bicycles rather than pollute the atmosphere with cars.  I commend these two amendments to the House.</P>

I was not involved in the debate on the earlier Stages of this Bill but I was amazed that there was no recognition of the necessity to incorporate cycle lanes from the beginning of a project, rather than adding them at a later stage when it would be dangerous to do so.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that one can cycle &mdash; I would not want to do it myself &mdash; from Denmark to the south of Germany on a cycle lane network?  It would be virtually impossible for me to cycle out to Dún Laoghaire because there are no cycle lanes available between the city centre and Dún Laoghaire.</P>
      <P>There is no recognition that people are aware of the damage that cars do to our environment and that they are looking more to other forms of transport, including the humble bicycle.  I ask the Minister to consider accepting this amendment.</P>

      <P>The issues involved in these amendments were dealt with by the special committee.  Section 60 of the Road Traffic Act, 1968, allows for regulations to be made assigning different parts of the roadway to different traffic. Cycle facilities currently in use include cycle lanes, cycle paths and cycle tracks. It might help in relation to Deputy Gilmore's amendment if I again briefly explain these terms.  A cycle lane is part of the carriageway segregated by road markings and is similar in appearance and effect to a bus lane.  A cycle path usually runs alongside a footpath and is raised above the road carriageway.  A cycle track forms part of the public road but is segregated from the roadway and the footpath.  The definition of a cycle way in section 68 of the Bill is very close to that in Deputy Gilmore's amendment and it is quite clear that a cycle way will be a public road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I explained on Committee Stage, these provisions in the Road Traffic Acts that deal with traffic and parking measures, including cycle facilities, are being considered in the context of the new Road Traffic Bill, with a view to <Col N="1248" /> amending them.  I expect to introduce the Bill within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>Second, the major proposals from the DTI in relation to cycle facilities and the consultation process that is necessary to bring those into force is well advanced and I look forward to the final report which will incorporate some exciting proposals in relation to this area.  As far as Deputy Gilmore's amendment is concerned, I cannot accept it for the reasons I have given.  However, he will be aware from the proposed Road Traffic Bill and the DTI proposals which are imminent in relation to these and other matters, that careful consideration will be given to enhancing facilities for cyclists and encouraging that mode of travel as much as possible.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his explanation of a cycle lane.  Although there are not many of them here I visualised what one might look like before tabling the amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister's reply is similar to the reply he gave on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Order of Business this morning I deliberately asked about the promised Road Traffic Bill.  During the course of Committee Stage debate the Minister responded repeatedly to a number of amendments, including this one, regarding road matters concerning non-motorised users of the road or road safety by stating that they would be dealt with in the promised Road Traffic Bill.  The Minister stated also on Committee Stage that the Road Traffic Bill would be circulated to Members before the Roads Bill was taken on Report Stage.  Therefore, Members who had tabled amendments addressing matters that he said would be dealt with by the Road Traffic Bill would at least have a copy of the Road Traffic Bill before dealing with them on Report Stage.  I appreciate that, because of the election and the formation of a new Government, there has been an inevitable delay in the production of the Road Traffic Bill.  However, it puts us in a difficulty today in dealing with those amendments on the Roads Bill which <Col N="1249" /> the Minister says are road traffic matters because we do not have a copy of the Bill and, therefore, do not know how these matters will be dealt with in it.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the issue of cycle lanes can simply be relegated to the Road Traffic Bill.  The Roads Bill is substantive legislation that will govern the manner in which investment in roads will be dealt with for the foreseeable future because there will be a substantial investment in roads.  References can be made to cycle lanes and similar matters in the Road Traffic Bill but unless provision is made to invest in them they will not materialise. The legislation is primarily about investment in roads.  Unless cycle lanes are included specifically in the proposals for the investment in roads and are enshrined in this legislation they will not be provided. The Minister's response is unsatisfactory and I would like the Ceann Comhairle to put the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;`hard shoulder' means that part of a road adjacent to the portion of the road on which vehicles travel;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 3 is clear.  It sets out to insert in the Bill a reference to the definition of a hard shoulder.  The purpose of amendment No. 12, following that, is to include an assessment of the condition of the hard shoulder in the later provision for the assessment of the condition of roads. There was a lengthy debate on these issues on Committee Stage where it was pointed out that hard shoulders have a great many uses, which the Minister acknowledge at the time.  They are used obviously as places where people can stop <Col N="1250" /> in emergencies; they are also used, in some cases effectively, as slow lanes or lanes for very slow moving traffic.  At times of very heavy traffic a hard shoulder can sometimes <i>de facto</i> become an extra lane.  This is most noticeable on a Friday evening approaching Newbridge, a situation which I hope will be resolved next June when the Newbridge bypass is opened.  Hard shoulders have a function and we want to make it clear in the Bill that we recognise their functions and uses.  In amendment No. 12 we should include the conditions of the hard shoulder in the assessment we would like to see of all roads from time to time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained to Deputy Yates during the special committee debate, section 10 (6) already places on obligation on local authorities to carry out inventories of public roads at the request of the Minister and in such a manner as specified by him.  It was the practice in the past to carry out an inventory at five yearly intervals and this is reasonable given the extensive milcage of roads for which many local authorities have responsibility.  In addition, the environmental research unit carries out annual or two yearly assessments of the network of national roads providing data for the full network on skid resistance, pavement condition and so on.  My Department is also co-ordinating an important project to develop an up-to-date data base for national roads which will bring together and augment information on traffic, physical condition, capacity and safety.</P>
      <P>In the amendment to section 10 there is a reference to roads, including the hard shoulder.  This is unnecessary since &ldquo;roads&rdquo; is defined in section 2 as including the hard shoulder, and is provided for in line 38, page 8 of the Bill.  A separate definition of hard shoulder in section 2 is not necessary either since the term is well understood.  The definition of that term alone out of the long list of items referred to in the definition of a road is hardly warranted.  In the light of my explanation I hope that the Deputy will agree to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1251" /> As Deputy Yates said there were lengthly arguments in relation to the hard shoulder on Committee Stage.  The issues of whether the research and the capacity of local authorities to examine this and the consequential roadworks which would be involved were fully addressed. If the Deputy wants it defined in this way he would presumably also want to do so on other issues.  It seems unnecessary as it is already adequately covered in the basic understanding of what a roadway is, which has been the same for years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's position in regard to these matters. However, it is not enough for him to say there is no need to define this because everybody understands it.  The Minister knows perfectly well that local authorities apart from anything else, are involved in endless litigation involving arguments about where roads begin and end and where the edge of the road happens to be. In amendment No. 3 we seek to define a term that, as the Minister points out, occurs later on in the text of the Bill on page 8, line 38, without any explanation. It is not enough to say that everybody knows what it is.  If there is an argument in a court about it one will quickly find that the judge will say it is not sufficient to say everybody knows what it is, there must be a definition.</P>
      <P>I am unhappy with the idea that the assessments should be made only every fifth year, nor am I happy with the idea &mdash; I mean no disrespect to the Minister &mdash; that the Minister would specify on each occasion which matters he would like local authorities to include in the range of their assessment.  Since we are dealing principally with national roads, although the provisions cover other roads also, we must have as much clarity as possible.  I regret the Minister is not more understanding, he should accept these amendments to have more clarity in this issue.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 28, after &ldquo;improvement&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, provision of public lighting&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This matter was debated at some length in the special committee.  I was not present at the special committee but having read the report several times very carefully I found it very difficult to understand the Minister's thinking on this matter.  He observed at one point &mdash; I quote from column 17 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>I am not anxious to reach a point where public lighting would be regarded as separate from all other facilities.  It should be embraced in the overall development of our proper road network.</P>
      <P>We agree with that.  It is for that reason we have put forward this amendment. We want to make it clear in the definitions included in this Bill that the provisions are intended, among other things, to have regard to the level of lighting on public roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate in the special committee many references were made to the difficulties that arise for motorists in passing from a well-lit area into an area that is totally unlit.  In wet weather it creates a major physical requirements for a change in the receptive capacities and adjustments of the eye and those areas are places where accidents are likely to happen.  Equally, drivers travelling from an unlit into a lit area may find the appearance of shadows passing before them from time to time because of lights of other oncoming vehicles.  There is a need to improve the standard of lighting, particularly in merging lit to unlit areas in a way that contributes to safety.  For <Col N="1253" /> that reason we have proposed amendment No. 4.  In amendment No. 6 we have gone on to make the same point more clearly in a different connection.</P>
    <P>I take it I may refer to the other amendments very briefly.  They are designed to carry that concern with public lighting into the other appropriate parts of the Bill.  There is always the question &mdash; as we consider the progress that we will make on national routes &mdash; as to whether we should look in a more systematic way at the requirement to light longer stretches of road.  It is the practice &mdash; and it is specified in all the contracts &mdash; on all major routes built in recent years and currently under construction that there is lighting at all intersections and junctions. It is very laudable indeed.  I would ask the Minister to consider whether we could learn any lessons from some of the practices in continental Europe.  It was the practice for quite a time, for example, that all of the motorways in Belgium were lit during the hours of darkness and I have had experience of this.  In 1979 when we had a major increase in the price of oil, one of the economy measures introduced by the Government there was to cease the lighting of motorways at night. It was found very quickly that the number of accidents and fatalities increased very rapidly after the practice of lighting the motorway at night was discontinued.  It has been my own experience, Sir, after extensive driving on motorways on the Continent that the lighting of those motorways at night is a major contributory factor to safer driving.  The fatigue of drivers is far less and the standard of driving improves enormously because there is a lesser demand on drivers to use so much of their attention simply to locate themselves on the road. They have more attention and energy to devote to how they position themselves in relation to other traffic.  The Minister will probably reply that this would cost a lot of money in terms of new contracts, but I would like some consideration given to it.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that we are increasing the number of dual carriageways and motorways as standard roads in the country. <Col N="1254" /> We are extending the range of this problem and an increasing number of drivers will be using those roads, probably travelling at fairly high speeds, who have not been previously used to that type of motor travel.  It requires a new kind of mental discipline from drivers different from the way they approach driving on our picturesque and winding roads.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister agree with the simple proposals we have made in amendment No. 4 and the other amendments? They are not designed to tempt him down a road, literally or figuratively, that will cost a lot of money.  However, we would like these references included in the Bill to make it clear that we regard the lighting of public roads as a proper part of our consideration of the quality, design and construction of those roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendments proposed by my colleagues.  My amendment No. 47 proposes the provision and maintance of adequate public lighting.  I read the special committee debate with great interest.  Obviously the major consideration in relation to the public lighting of our roads is safety.  It is very disconcerting for any driver to go from a well lit road, travelling at a reasonably high speed, into an area that is not lit or is inadequately lit.  Purely in the realms of safety these amendments should be considered.  There should be a consistency in the lighting of our roads.  This was referred to previously in the special committee.  To use a local example &mdash; the Bray/Shankill bypass &mdash; there are areas along that bypass that are not sufficiently lit and are dangerous, particularly at the bridge near Bray.  It is dangerous driving from a well lit to an unlit area, particularly when travelling at high speed and then being suddenly plunged into darkness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One issue that concerns me is the cost cutting exercise followed by some local authorities who turn off lighting on minor roads and only provide lighting at major junctions.  While we want to save money and use it as effectively as possible, this practice should not be followed.  I would <Col N="1255" /> ask that the Minister consider the inclusion of these amendments on safety grounds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support these amendments. There are two issues involved here.  One is the provision of public lighting on new road developments, particularly motorways.  I agree with the comments of Deputies Dukes and Keogh in that regard, particularly Deputy Keogh's point in relation to the Bray/Shankill bypass which was built at a cost of £25 million or £26 million.  That bypass is effectively an urban motorway and as such justifies being publicly lit, but apart from lighting at junctions along the bypass it is completely dark.</P>
      <P>The second issue is the maintenance of public lighting on national roads.  I agree with Deputy Keogh's point that some local authorities, due to financial difficulties, turn off public lighting on some national roads for certain periods of the year.  Dublin County Council of which Deputy Keogh and I are members, during the course of last year due to a shortage of funding and the inadequate road grant made available to it by the Department of the Environment had to cut back on public lighting.  There were times of the year when some major national roads around our capital city were unlit, for example stretches of the N11 on which I and many Members of this House travel regularly.  Driving along that motorway from lit stretches into dark stretches is extremely dangerous.  The lights along that motorway were not put back on until the beginning of October. It gave rise to a situation where the approach roads to Dublin were in an extremely dangerous condition because of the intermittent provision of public lighting.  It is not just a question of providing public lighting, but of the Minister providing the resources to the local authorities to provide for the continuous public lighting of those roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate when replying who exactly will be responsible for public lighting on national roads?  Will the National Roads Authority be taking <Col N="1256" /> on this responsibility and, more particularly, will it fund the provision of such lighting?  Additional roads are being built now with the assistance of European money, the resources are not being provided to maintain those roads and, in particular, in this case the standards of public lighting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I would support the motion concerning the provision of lighting on national roads. There are certain junctions, particularly in rural areas, that are highly dangerous coming on to the national primary roads. Special allowance should be made for the provision of lighting in those areas because they are often the blackspots where accidents occur.  The Royal Oak road on the way to Kilkenny is a very serious accident spot, as a I learned to my cost.  Public lighting should be provided at dangerous junctions where accidents are likely to occur.  I ask the Minister to pay particular attention to ensuring safety of motorists by way of public lighting at junctions on the national primaries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very clear from contributions on this amendment that the Deputies opposite are not as much concerned about whether public lighting is spelled out in terms of section 2 (4) because it is already covered in the understanding of road improvement, but they are more concerned with the adequacy or inadequacy of public lighting on the national roads generally.  I would have to express the same fears in relation to our overall ability, in terms of financial resources, to meet those continuing needs.  We have moved away from the question of the amendment to where resources are to come from and how the National Roads Authority will deal with these matters in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of the Environment by way of the national roads grants provides for the upgrading of these facilities but not for the maintenance which remains the responsibility of local authorities. Last year there was a problem in County Dublin and it was resolved.  A <Col N="1257" /> number of councillors exploded the myth that had been put to them by management in regard to resources for the provision of public lighting on roads and lights were put back on.  Deputy Dukes made a comparison with Belgium but we do not have the same volume of traffic. Standards for national primary or secondary routes lighting relate to traffic. We have overall about 50,000 miles of road.  Pitted against the UK or France it is one person to one mile compared to two in France, and four in the UK.  That gives an indication of resources available to deal with the provision of public lighting for our roads.</P>
    <P>New carriageways carry a very high volume of traffic since their construction, the volume of traffic on other routes, which were the responsibility of the local authorities up to that time has reduced considerably, leaving resources available to the local authorities for the maintenance of the lighting scheme.</P>
    <P>The National Roads Authority in the final analysis will be involved in these schemes for the future and it will be up to the National Roads Authority, in consultation with the local authority, to devise the best way possible to allocate resources for these purposes.  I take the point that public lighting on the national routes is a very important factor in terms of road safety.  However, I do not want to convey the impression that we will have &mdash; and I am sure Deputy Dukes and other Deputies understand this just as well as I do &mdash; the type of resources which the public might demand and which taxpayers are not in a position to supply. The basic points being made were in relation to the upgrading of facilities to improve road safety.  I am as anxious as the Minister for the Environment, in the context of the resources available to me, to ensure that we have not only the best road standards that we can afford but that they are maintained and enhanced to the maximum.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I note that you are indicating to Deputy Keogh that the Deputy may speak again when we come to amendment No. 47.  I do not want to cut off Deputy Keogh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I detect the Minister is not too keen to go down the road &mdash; a dreadful malapropism &mdash; set out in these amendments. I would like the Minister and his Department to think again about some of these aspects and I am worried by some of the Minister's comments.  First, the very construction of a new national road, because there are obligations of maintenance, can create extra burdens on local authorities that very often have not been recognised.  Second, it is not enough for the Minister to say &mdash; and leave it at that &mdash; that the construction of new roads reduces the volume of traffic on other roads.  That would be fine if the world remained static but it does not.  I will give the Minister a perfectly simple example. The Minister should have the facts before him because I gather he will open the Newbridge bypass shortly.  When the Naas bypass was opened it became a good deal easier to travel through Naas and go out the Waterford road through Kilcullen, but since then the volume of traffic going down to Waterford has increased to the point where the town of Naas is now as congested as it used to be before the bypass was opened.  The fact that we open new roads does not and cannot be expected automatically to lead to a reduction in the volume of traffic on existing roads and, therefore, cannot be taken to mean that local authorities have more leeway in their maintenance budgets.  They do not.  Desirable as it is, the very fact of constructing a new road of a higher quality than those that were there before can sometimes create an additional need for expenditure on maintenance by local authorities.  The <Col N="1259" /> Minister is basing his refusal of these amendments on some very dubious propositions.</P>
    <P>I am perfectly aware that because of higher volumes of traffic in other countries standards of construction elsewhere may be different from what they are here; but I assure the Minister that I have driven extensively over many years on every kind of road in this country and in every other member state of the European Community and, more often than not, the effect of the volume of traffic on road design is reflected in the number of lanes built in the road and not necessarily in the kind of surface that is provided. Neither is it necessarily a factor that determines whether a road is to be lit.  At night a driver's degree of comfort and ease will be improved and the degree of stress and fatigue reduced by a road being lit whether or not there is a large volume of traffic on that road.  The fact of lighting the road in itself reduces stress and fatigue. That would be the case for any given level of traffic volume going across that road.  So to argue that since our traffic volumes are lower than traffic volumes in other countries we do not need the same kind of standards is, with all respect, purely specious.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not inclined to specify things in the way we want them specified. My colleagues on this side of the House will agree with me that because the Minister is reluctant to sharpen the definitions set out in this section of the Bill &mdash; that is basically what these amendments are about &mdash; the Minister, his successors and local authorities will have trouble in the future.  They will find themselves with less resources than we might wish them to have and facing local authorities that would wish to have more resources than they have.  The less clear the definitions in this Bill, the more room for argument. The clearer we make the definitions, the more we can be sure in future years what will be the arguments between local authorities and the Department of the Environment or the National Roads Authority.  It is a pity if the Minister loses <Col N="1260" /> this opportunity to clarify those definitions.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 30, to delete &ldquo;the Environment&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Transport&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This matter was debated at great length in the special committee, with the Minister at one stage getting a little huffed because he felt that somebody had accused him of empire building.  Of course, we know that the Minister does not indulge in empire building, although there is a Member of the Seanad who might take a different view of that. However, that is another day's work.</P>
      <P>The difference between the circumstances surrounding the debate in the special committee &mdash; these matters were discussed on 14 July last year &mdash; and the circumstances today is that we now have a new Government which has done all kinds of weird and wonderful things to the make-up and construction of Departments. We have the Minister for Employment and Enterprise, we have a Minister for Arts and Culture and apparently half of Mullaghmore, we have a Minister for Arts and Culture and most of RTE and another Minister who seems to be in charge of maintenance in RTE.  Creative as they may be, some of the changes made seem to be totally pointless and in some cases downright mischevious because they have led to more confusion than anything else.  But the change we propose arises from the proposition that we should have one Minister with a clear brief to look after all aspects of transport instead of having the Minister for the Environment, the Minister for Transport, the Minister for the Marine and perhaps other Ministers involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the debate in the special committee the Minister agreed in <Col N="1261" /> principle with the need for a co-ordinated transport policy.  We will not have a co-ordinated transport policy if we have separate Departments looking after different aspects of our transport networks, each having their own arguments with the Department of Finance about their resources and each making separate deals in order to get what they want.  That is not the way to achieve a co-ordinated transport policy.</P>
    <P>The basic logic of this Bill should be carried through into the way the Government wants transport policy, because this Bill seeks to set up an authority that can take a co-ordinated, integrated approach to the construction and maintenance of the 6 per cent of our roads that are national primary roads.  The very logic of this Bill is in the same family as the logic that says we should have one Minister for Transport.  I invite the Minister to tell us whether, after all the commotion and creative rearrangements that have been made in Government, he thinks he and his Department should be the subject of a little more creative thinking than they have been up to now.  Given that we talk so much about the need to get over the disadvantages of our peripherality, to compete with the fact that the British now have the Channel Tunnel to link them to Europe and the need for integration and transport planning from an environmental point of view, it would make eminent sense to look at the structural change we are talking about.  It would make a lot more sense than some of the changes which have been made.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude with a reflection which receives far too little attention. There is no means in our Government making policy where we can do anything which would even approach an energy audit of the way we organise our transport.  Our railways are run totally separately from our roads.  Air and sea traffic are in totally different compartments. Some of them are not alternatives in that, in the nature of things, we need overland transport on this island and we need either surface transport across the sea or air transport.  The time will come, and it is not that far away, <Col N="1262" /> when we will have to apply a rigorous system of energy auditing of how we plan our transport system.  That job will be made immeasurably more difficult if we have different Departments looking after our transport network.  I bet my bottom dollar that when it comes to doing that they will all want to use, for very good reasons, different systems for measuring the energy input for a given level of output.  They will all have different ways of measuring the output of the particular mode of transport for which they are responsible.  The result will be total confusion and we will not get anything like a proper view, whereas if we had one Department it could come to an integrated and unified conclusion about how conceptually we go about measuring the energy efficiency of our transport system and that could then be used, with some effect, as a basis for the rational planning of our transport system.</P>
    <P>We know the Minister is a modest man who likes to get on with his job but he should start clamouring for the same kind of attention through creative reorganisation in the areas for which he is directly responsible and some for which he is tangently responsible and accept the amendment and the spirit behind it.</P>

      <P>I join in congratulating you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and wishing you well.  This amendment raises an issue which I was anxious to raise in another amendment.  It was amendment No. 1 which was ruled out of order because it was disposed of on Second Stage.  The issue is whether, in fact, the establishment of a national roads authority and the concentration exclusively, as we have in this Bill, on a roads strategy is the correct way to proceed with regard to our roads and transport policy.  My view is that it is not the correct way to proceed.  What we need is a co-ordinated transport policy which takes account of the need for investment in roads but which also takes account of, and puts in an overall transport context, the need for investment and development in rail and other forms of transport.  I believe that is particularly urgent because, as we know, <Col N="1263" /> the Cohesion Fund is to be used partly for transport purposes.  Over the years there will be funds available from the Cohesion Fund and from the continuation of what is known as the peripherality programme on the Structural Funds from which roads are funded.  It seems that there is need for co-ordination so that the country gets the best possible result from the investment of European money and the investment of local money in our transport needs.</P>
      <P>The concentration which we are getting and which is reflected in this Bill is exclusively on roads and that is regrettable.  It is also quite frightening that the Minister seems to believe, judging from his response to an earlier amendment, that if one builds more roads one reduces traffic.  I see the Minister shaking his head but it is what I understood him to say.  We were talking about the pressures on local authorities with regard to the need for maintenance of roads and so on.  The Minister expressly stated that because more roads were being provided there would be less traffic and less maintenance by local authorities. All the experience is the more roads one builds the more traffic one gets. Deputy Dukes referred to the Naas by-pass. In my own constituency I can refer to the utter traffic chaos that now exists in the Blackrock area following the construction of the Blackrock by-pass.  It was bad before but there was never the kind of chaos we have now.</P>
      <P>In the UK, for example, a recent study shows that the continued construction of additional roads there has led directly to a huge increase in the volume of traffic. In the United States there is probably no other city that is more road-bound than the city of Los Angles.  It is choked with traffic.  One cannot advance the argument that because one builds more roads one solves the traffic problem.  In fact, it goes the other way.  Roads are like rivers; if one builds them they fill up with traffic. There is a very strong argument for developing a transport strategy as against a roads strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is all about providing a fast <Col N="1264" /> lane for the European funds that are available for road construction.  Let us look at the Operational Programme on Peripherality, 1989 to 1993.  It shows quite clearly a total investment of £818 million of which £515 million was a European contribution, the bulk of it being for road construction.  This is about money from Europe.  Money available from Europe for the peripherality programme is being syphoned into the roads area. There was concern on the part of the construction industry, that they were not able to get their hands quickly enough on that money and there was a certain amount of irritation about the delay in processing road plans through local authorities and so on.  The Government's solution was to establish a national roads authority which would provide the fast lane to the European money.  That is what the National Roads Authority is about and what this Bill is about.</P>
    <P>It is wrong, because it is motivated not by the transport needs of the country or by any kind of rational planning to decide the extent to which roads, rail and other means should contribute to our transport needs.  The National Roads Authority will cut out much of the need for consultation, discussion and so on at design and other stages and the construction industry will get its hands on the European money as quickly as possible to build as many roads as possible.  What we should have is a National Transport Authority which would look at the overall transport needs of the country and not this kind of European driven investment and preoccupation with road construction, underpinned by the astonishing approach of the Minister for the Environment who believes if one builds more roads one gets less traffic.</P>

      <P>I extend my congratulations to you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle on your election.  I am sure you will be an excellent referee in this House.  I do not wish to be repetitive on this amendment.  I would agree with my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, that we seem to be in single minded pursuit of European money for roads.  What I am <Col N="1265" /> concerned about is that we should have a transport strategy, as has been said and that we do not look at roads in isolation.</P>
      <P>I referred earlier to cycle paths.  We need to look at all modes of transport including rail.  We need to have an integrated approach to transport in this country and I do not believe that going down this road is the way to achieve that.  We will need a roads authority to look after the roads but if it is not part of an integrated strategy, which is not referred to at all in this Bill, then we will fail in what we are trying to do.  Fine if we are in single minded pursuit of the European money &mdash; at least we will get it and spend it and the construction industry will be delighted &mdash; but I do not believe that in any planning one can look at something in isolation; it must form part of an overall plan.  I ask the Minister to consider this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the proposal that we substitute the Minister for Transport for the Minister for the Environment in the context of this Bill, it is not the first time we heard the argument for a single transport authority.  It is clear from some of the comments made that there is not a realisation that in the technical assistance programme of the operational programme on peripherality there is a very genuine effort to develop a common evaluation of the methodology used and of all transport types so that ultimately we get the most balanced system possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies are ignoring the reality of the transport situation in Ireland today where there is such a huge dependence on roads compared to any other system of transport.  Over 90 per cent of freight and 96 per cent of vehicular traffic depend on roads.  There is a 75 per cent dependence for exports and a huge need to develop systems for industries in the west and other parts of the country where there are not alternative systems in place. Notwithstanding that, in the operational programme for peripherality, provision was made for the Belfast-Dublin rail route, upgrading of the Dublin-Cork, Dublin-Waterford routes and in the <Col N="1266" /> Dublin Transport Initiative tremendous emphasis is being put on the possibility of upgrading public transport, which is essential in terms of a point made earlier by Deputy Owens about environmental considerations and easing traffic congestion.</P>
    <P>In the programme for peripherality there are evaluation systems.  It is not possible to get European funds to do what one likes with and my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, is as interested as the Deputy in ensuring that our transport system is developed in a way which is not, as Deputy Gilmore said, just a singular approach to roads.  In selectively quotating the amount of European money spent on roads at £515 million, it must be remembered that it is £515 million out of £3 billion, so clearly there are very many other considerations to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>There is also the argument against a single transport authority in terms of the reliance on local authorities to carry out these functions and the introduction of the National Roads Authority as a management co-ordinating and integrating facility, with the local authorities still doing virtually all of the work.  One would have to link the local authority and a single transport authority into the rail system and into airport and sea port management. It is not feasible to deal in a single Department with the system as it now stands.  But there is need for the Departments and the different authorities, whether it is Aer Rianta, Córas Iompair Éireann, or Bus Éireann etc., to have the maximum collaborative and co-ordinating effort so that funds from Europe and national resources are developed to create a transport system which meets all needs.  The greatest example of that is the Dublin Transport Initiative.  Their interim report demonstrates very clearly the question of moving away from the belief that roads and roads only are the solution to the problem.  I concur with that.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be misunderstood in terms of my earlier contribution about available resources to local authorities.  I <Col N="1267" /> did not say that the development of new roads would reduce traffic but that it should reduce traffic on certain routes and that this would release resources to local authorities.  The counter argument was made earlier, and I accept it, that traffic keeps growing and we have to increase resources to meet that.  But I am quite sure Deputy Dukes would be the first to say in another debate: &ldquo;Cut public expenditure and get the EBR right&rdquo;. These are some of the constraints that come into this as well.</P>
    <P>I am as concerned as Deputies opposite to ensure we have an integrated transport policy.  I do not accept the view that it can be done in one single Department. Deputies who have sat at the Cabinet table will know that different Ministers' views impacting on a situation is healthy. If we were to think today of amalgamating Aer Rianta, the seaports, airports, railway systems, and the link that roads have with local authorities, we would have a lot of problems on our hands.  One of the first steps I took when I became Minister for the Environment was to establish a linkage with all the other transport agencies and Departments.</P>
    <P>My effort with DTI is a convincing demonstration that, as far as Dublin is concerned, the emphasis is being taken away from roads and put onto public transport, consultation and finding solutions which will bring the people together.  To meet the points made on this Bill I cannot go further than demonstrate the actions I have taken &mdash; not what I will do in the future but what I have already done.  I do not see myself running a singular Department but rather I see myself with a responsibility in all the other areas to find the key which will bring the different units together in the best way possible to solve our transport problems within the constraints of existing resources.</P>

      <P>What the Minister has said for the last three minutes makes the case for our amendment.  For the Minister to congratulate himself on having set up all <Col N="1268" /> these links with other transport agencies again suggests that he perceives things in the same way as we do and he is making the case for the amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister should try to understand statistics and not be seduced by them.  We know the proportions of total passenger traffic and total goods traffic that move around this country by road.  If one looks at passenger movements between Tallaght and the centre of Dublin one will find that they are 100 per cent by road. This is because there is no other means of transport, but that is not to say there is not a very good case to be made for providing another means of transport which would be more energy and socially efficient and have less harmful effects on our environment.  That might be good value for the whole community.</P>

      <P>If we look at the text of the Bill, it means that June 1993 is earlier than &ldquo;such day or days as may be fixed therefor by any order or orders of the Minister&rdquo;.  At least we have found out that the Minister does not intend to do any of this until after 1993.  It now seems the Minister is telling us that, to the extent that this Bill requires the expenditure of money, he is kind of Augustinian on it; let us spend the money but not yet. Could the Minister explain what kind of <Col N="1270" /> phasing he has in mind for spending this money and why he does not want to be led into the temptation of spending any more money by a simple amendment that will give effect to this Bill in 1993?  After all, if we say the Bill comes into operation on 1 June 1993 we are not thereby saying that the public lighting on every road has to be improved with effect from that date. We are not thereby saying that the Kildare bypass has to be in hand in 1993. Let us be reasonable.</P>
      <P>To rule an amendment like this out of order on the basis that it may produce a charge on the Revenue will prevent all of us from saying almost anything about the Bill because we might induce the Minister to agree with us that it is a good idea to spend money sometime on something.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 10, to delete lines 36 to 43 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Where it is proposed to make regulations under this Act, a draft of each regulation shall be laid before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas, and shall not come into effect until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>For the past two months we heard much about change in the way political business is done and, in particular, the way business is done in this House.  This is only our second day back but so far I have looked in vain for any evidence of this change.  I hope this amendment might elicit the first glimmer of that change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill makes provision for the Minister to make regulations in a range of areas.  In fact, it gives the Minister quite extensive powers.  Two subsections of section 7 deal with the making of regulations by the Minister.  The subsection I am seeking to amend provides that regulations made by the Minister will stand unless they are annulled by the Houses <Col N="1271" /> of the Oireachtas.  We know from experience that never happens by and large because we do not have the means here to do so except by way of a procedure which, in practice, does not work.</P>
    <P>In theory, it is possible for a motion to be tabled annulling regulations but I do not recall it happening or when a motion of that kind got onto the floor of the House for debate.</P>
    <P>What is proposed in subsection (2), which I am seeking to amend, is a procedure which is unworkable.  The ministerial regulations are made and will stand unless they are annulled.  In practice there is no provision in the House for a debate on secondary legislation of that kind.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides, in relation to regulations which come under two sections of the Bill, for the regulations to be brought before the House for approval.  My amendment seeks to follow that principal in relation to all the regulations made by the Minister &mdash; they would be brought before the House and would not take effect until a resolution is passed giving them effect.  Under that safeguard the Houses of the Oireachtas would have an opportunity to debate regulations, the content of which in many cases will put meat on the bones of the legislation before us.</P>
    <P>The principle, in fairness, has been conceded in subsection (3).  My amendment seeks to extend that principle to the generality of regulations made under this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Gilmore's amendment.  There would be a degree of consistency in the legislation if this amendment were accepted.  The buzz word now is &ldquo;transparency&rdquo;.  If we allude to the notion of transparency and accountability, this amendment should be accepted.  The Minister should take that into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to support this amendment because the whole question of regulations has been a hobbyhorse of mine for some time.  On every <Col N="1272" /> occasion I have spoken on Second Stage of a Bill for the past five years, when the Bill involves the making of regulations, I have made this point.  I would much prefer to see the kind of active approval of the Dáil that is required in Deputy Gilmore's amendment, and in relation to two sections of this Bill, applied in every case where it is proposed to make regulations.  That would require other changes.</P>
      <P>I have made this point on a number of other Bills and I have a feeling I will be making it for a long time.  The point has been dealt with by various Ministers who said it would be cumbersome to use this kind of procedure in all cases where regulations are made.  They argue, quite rightly, that there are cases where Ministers make regulations about matters that are more routine than questions of policy. That is quite true.  The way to deal with that is to make it clear in the text of the legislation that there are areas of routine processing of the consequences of the provision that are properly the Minister's and for which the Minister must be accountable to this House when we debate the Estimates for his or her Department or discuss the policies followed by that Department and so on.</P>
      <P>There are instances where it would be absolutely nonsensical to require the making of routine humdrum day-to-day decisions to be brought before this House.  There are too many cases in legislation of regulations to be made by Ministers which, in fact, are substantial decisions and which under the passive procedure we are used to, are laid before this House.  As Deputy Gilmore said, a procedure is there that notionally can be used by this House but which would be very difficult to operate and which, if the House ever managed to use it to set aside something done by a Minister, could sometimes mean that an objectionable provision was in force, for example, for the length of a summer recess and 21 sitting days before or after that summer recess.  It could happen that a measure would be in operation for six to eight months and then notionally be set aside by this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1273" /> That is a very bad procedure indeed.  It will require Ministers, their Departments and the parliamentary draftsmen to take a new look at the extent of the powers they wish Ministers to exercise by regulation and to make a much more balanced and well-judged distinction between routine matters and matters of substance.</P>
    <P>The provision contained in this Bill and in so many other Bills is nothing less than plain, straightforward, lazy draftsmanship. It is going back to what seemed to work reasonably well in the days of the high stool and the quill pen and is trying to transpose it into modern legislation. It does not work.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to support Deputy Gilmore in this proposal.  I hope that Deputies Gilmore, Keogh and myself will make the same case when we speak on other Bills that contain this pernicious provision about making regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the fears expressed but, in the main, they are groundless.  The Bill deals with the primary legislative format and the administrative and procedural elements are dealt with through regulations.  In terms of introducing legislation, Deputy Dukes will be familiar with the length of time it takes from the time the Minister first says he is preparing legislation to deal with this matter, the subsequent effort made to try to combat opposing considerations from other Departments and pressure on the draftman's office, to come to the final day of saying it is in early stages of preparation, it will be ready within the next couple of weeks, and then to have the Bill.  He, better than anybody else here, knows that it is a tedious and difficult route.  A considerable bank of that work is done in the primary Department to try to see to what extent we can speed up these developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to hold my hand across my heart and say that everything possible in terms of the primary legislation is dealt with.  We would all like to see that improved but, as it stands at present, what would happen if we were to go down the road suggested in the amendment <Col N="1274" /> would be to delay further the day when this Bill comes into force.  It would take more time to get the Bill through the House and would clutter up the work of this House.  If there were anything substantial by way of policy in the regulations it would be a matter for the House to decide whether that should be put into the regulations.</P>
    <P>I take the point that it is not always something that is highlighted here or even the powers to do it that are highlighted. Perhaps there are further improvements that we can make in the light of experience to distinguish between the administrative, procedural elements which are normally enshrined in the regulations and other more serious areas.  We are trying to find a balance while enacting as much legislation as possible.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that we have all the answers.  Clearly the more understanding there is of the need for something the more public goodwill there is in following it through because it is not just a question of enacting laws; it is a question of their implementation.  Public goodwill, understanding and backing from all sides of the House are important.</P>
    <P>There is nothing I can do in the context of this amendment.  In so far as it relates to my own activities, I will have a searching look at other Bills coming forward to see if there are further efforts that can be made to put into the primary legislation any elements which have that policy nature.  I do not want to give any commitment because one of the pressures is to try to bring forward as much of that legislation as we can.  If we go down the road of wanting to cover every detail and have every &ldquo;i&rdquo; dotted, the Deputy knows what would happen.  I would be glad to bring any experience I have in these areas before any committee.  I assure the House that nothing will be contained in the regulations other than administrative and procedural tools for implementating the legislation.  As far as I can humanly do so, I will ensure that policy questions and serious matters are dealt with in the primary legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may misunderstand <Col N="1275" /> what we object to.  It is not the fact that Ministers have to make regulations or come before the House.  There is a lack of definition about the kinds of things that legislation allows Ministers to do by regulation.  I have seen it in other Bills.  There are things which Ministers are required to do by regulation which should not need a separate regulation. There are cases where we can give powers to Ministers in the legislation itself to get on with the job and not have to come back to the House looking for this kind of spurious sanction for what are routine matters of day-to-day administration.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, there are matters which legislation allows Ministers to do by this kind of passive regulation formula that deserve debate and examination in this House.  That is why the formula is there in the first place.  There are matters which Ministers are allowed to do by regulation which seem so important to the drafters of the legislation that they actually require the regulations to have an affirmative vote of this House before the regulation can come into effect.  The dividing line between the two categories is drawn in the wrong place.  I have never objected to legislation where this has arisen.  I have never had any difficulty with matters where Ministers were required to come before the House to get an affirmative statement from the House that the House agreed.  I have never found a matter that was not a proper matter for the active form of approval for these regulations.  I have found in a number of matters which were proposed for the passive form, ones that should have been more appropriately dealt with by the active form.  That is the point Deputy Gilmore made earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equally, I have found matter in legislation in passive form that should not have to come before this House if the original legislation were properly drafted. Of course, nobody wants a mountain of regulations coming before the House. The Minister should remember that there is another procedure which is frequently used in this House for far more important items than are to be dealt with by regulation <Col N="1276" /> here, that is, we can have matters brought before the House and decided without debate.  We do not like using this procedure very often but we have an example this morning.  Where matters are clearly within the framework of something that has been agreed by the House, that is a procedure that can be used if we wish to use it.</P>
    <P>The choice, therefore, is not between the present situation and having a mountain of matters before the House taking up a lot of time.  It requires simply a rational distinction to be made between the kinds of things that should be submitted to the House &mdash; if they are worth submitting they are worth debating and getting the affirmation of the House &mdash; and the kind of things that should never come before the House after the primary legislation has been passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not interested in having the Minister for the Environment come into the House with every tittle tattle of administrative detail and having to get the approval of the House before regulations are made.  That is not the purpose of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very pleased to hear him say that while he occupies that office it is his intention to confine the making of regulations which would not require the approval of the House to purely administrative and procedural matters.  That is a very welcome change in the Minister's Department because I recall a number of cases where regulations were made which involved very substantial policy matters. I recall, for example, the regulations governing environmental impact assessment, involving a very substantial body of policy, were not debated in the House but were delivered to me by courier a couple of days before Christmas in the year they were made.  We had the building regulations under the Building Control  <Col N="1277" /> Act.  The dog regulations which became the subject of a certain amount of controversy were made quite hastily on foot of a number of radio programmes, media comment and so on.  They gave rise to considerable public agitation when the Minister's predecessor came to the conclusion that certain categories of dogs were dangerous and had to be muzzled. Unfortunately, it was not just the dogs that were muzzled; this House was also muzzled in the process because we could not debate the regulations.  It would have been better if we had the opportunity of doing so.</P>
    <P>The Minister is concerned about the fact that bringing regulations before the House may cause undue delay.  We are now to have four standing committees of this House to address legislation and so on.  That appears to be an ideal vehicle for the examination of secondary legislation and perhaps some means could be found under that formula whereby secondary legislation of this kind could be examined.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately we are dealing here not with the Minister's goodwill but with legislation and while the Minister may say that it is his intention to confine the making of these regulations purely to administrative and procedural matters, the legislation says something completely different.  Subsection (1) of the section concerned states that the Minister may make regulations prescribing any matter or thing in the Act.  It is quite a wide ranging provision.  That is what we are seeking to amend by providing that regulations must be brought before the House.  It is an important principle.  I regret that the Minister has not seen fit to extend the principle outside sections 10 and 17, where he has conceded it.  He should concede it in the other areas.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1278" /> In page 11, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4)  Where an order referred to in subsection (3) has been made, the road authority concerned shall, as soon as may be, gave notice thereof to its members.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Yates's request in the special committee that local authority members be kept informed of ministerial decisions I now propose this amendment to oblige local authorities to inform their elected members of relevant orders made by the Minister under this Bill.  These are the orders which have been exempted from the notification procedures of the Statutory Instruments Act, 1947 following an amendment adopted by the special committee.</P>
    <P>As explained in the special committee, these orders are made only after intensive public consultation processes including public notification and the consideration of representations and objections, usually through oral hearings or public local inquiries.  The orders in question involve ministerial approval, the abandonment of or extinguishment of a public right of way over a regional or national road, approval of motorway schemes, toll schemes, toll by-laws and environmental impact approvals.  I believe this amendment meets the concern expressed by Deputy Yates.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 11, to delete lines 8 to 15.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is in the same family of amendments as the one we debated a few moments ago.  Section 9 enables the Minister to delete references to main roads, county roads and so on.  It effectively <Col N="1279" /> gives the Minister <i>carte blanche</i> to recategorise roads.  Section 10 also deals with the Minister's power to classify roads.</P>
    <P>Section 10, however, is subject to regulation and, interestingly, that is one of the regulations which would have to be brought before the House.  Section 9 somewhat negatives the arrangement that is provided for in section 10 because it enables the Minister to make changes without going through the procedure which would require him to bring a regulation before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes to give power to the Minister to modify or adapt existing enactments.  It might, therefore, be helpful to understand the purpose of these provisions. Section 9 provides that the Minister can make an order amending any legislative provision either in an act or statutory instrument which has a reference to any of the old road classifications such as main, trunk, link, county or urban roads. These will be replaced by references to new classifications &mdash; national, regional, local &mdash; as set out in section 10.  For example, it will now be possible to substitute the word &ldquo;local&rdquo; road for &ldquo;county&rdquo; road if it occurs in an Act or regulation.  However, in drafting it was not possible to simply provide for the general substitution of one term for another in this section because each case has to be judged individually.  For example, in some cases an existing main road will become a national road; in other cases it may be classified as a regional road or, in an extreme case, a local road. There is no sinister intent behind this power since it just provides for the continuation in force of the existing legal provision by ensuring that the most up to date reference to the road classification is included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope Deputy Gilmore will accept that this is largely a technical amendment which will enable existing law to continue to be effective without imposing any additional obligations upon any person. Although Deputy Gilmore finds it difficult <Col N="1280" /> at times to accept what I say in these matters, there is not anything sinister, underhand or ulterior behind it; it is purely a technical arrangement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 12, between lines 44 and 45, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(iii)  have regard to the conditions <Col N="1281" /> of any planning permission relating to the development of the road, and in particular the need for the road authority to take in charge the road concerned, and if necessary to complete any outstanding works on the road from monies provided in the developer's bond,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with the declaration of a road to be a public road and relates to a subsection of section 11 which sets out the various things to which the road authority shall have regard when it is declaring a road to be a public road. The Bill provides that it has to satisfy itself that the road is a general public utility and it has to take into account the financial implications and so on.  My amendment seeks that it would also have regard to the planning permission relating to the development of the road in the first place and in particular the need for the road authority to take in charge the road concerned and if necessary to complete any outstanding works on the road from moneys provided in the developer's bond.</P>
    <P>What I am attempting to get at in this amendment is the unfortunately widespread practice of many developers who leave housing estates and roads in housing estates uncompleted.  In my constituency there are several housing estates, many of which were built years ago, and even today road surfaces have not been completed or road works finished off.  Quite understandably, that is a matter of great irritation to people who buy houses in those estates.  They pay money on the assumption that the development is to be completed.  They buy their houses very often on the basis of glossy brochures presented to them the day they visit the showhouse and then find years later that many aspects of the development have not been completed and, in particular, that the roads have not been completed.</P>
    <P>I know that the issue also concerns planning legislation but my amendment seeks to make provision in the roads legislation that in considering the declaration of a road as a public road <Col N="1282" /> the road authority will have regard to the planning permission which was originally granted and to the need for the developer, if it is a private developer or, if the private developer is no longer there, as is very often the case, the local authority, to complete the roads concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I promised during the special committee to look at the issues involved in unfinished housing estate roads and to report back.  It is the practice of local authorities to ask for adequate money or insurance bonds before granting planning permission for the development of housing estates in order to ensure that all ancillary work, including the construction of roads, is carried out satisfactorily. The local authority will often lay down conditions with regard to the phasing of the development &mdash; for example, not allowing the commencement of phase two of the development until phase one has been completed to its satisfaction.</P>
      <P>Before taking an estate road in charge the local authority inspects the road and, if necessary, presents the developer with a list of works to be carried out before taking it in charge.  In some cases of noncompliance the local authority can take enforcement action, its powers having been strengthened in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1992.  However, due to the problem of some development companies going into liquidation and trading again under a different name, the preferred mechanism is to ask for adequate money or an insurance bond.  Local authorities are using their powers to good effect now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Problems arose in the past, however. Local authorities have on occasion laid down inadequate conditions or, alternatively, have demanded inadequate bonds.  Where problem estates exist at the moment they usually date back a number of years.  Because of the improved vigilance by local authorities in these matters the problem of unfinished housing estates has diminished over the last number of years.  Therefore, I do not see the need to accept Deputy Gilmore's amendment, especially since the section <Col N="1283" /> already obliges the local authority to consider the financial implications before taking a road in charge.  If major problems arise in the future, however, the Minister has power in subsection (3) to prescribe criteria for the declaration of public roads which could if necessary include reference to this issue.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  A road authority shall not abandon a public road unless a majority of the elected members of the authority so decide.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a discussion on this subject in the special committee.  There seemed to be some lingering uncertainty in the Minister's mind as to whether the abandonment of a road in the way provided for in this Bill would be a reserved function. The Minister indicated that he would consider the matter more closely between then and this Stage of the Bill. I wonder if the Minister had the opportunity to give this any further thought or whether his new colleague since then, Deputy Stagg, whom I welcome, has managed to give further consideration to this matter.  The concern is &mdash; as expressed by Deputy Yates at that time &mdash; that a local authority could find itself in a position where a decision would be made to abandon a road without the members of the local authority being so aware.  The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that this would not happen. My understanding from the debate in the special committee was that the Minister felt that could not happen even under the law as it stands and that it was made clear <Col N="1284" /> in section 12 (7) of this Bill that this could not happen.  Is the Minister of State in a position to say anything more definite at this stage on that matter?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the concerns which was expressed at the special committee related particularly to those sections of an old road that are cut off when a new road is being constructed. With a new dual carriageway a slice of the old road is cut off and falls into disuse. It becomes derelict and is used for all kinds of purposes.  A declaration is made that it is no longer a public road and, therefore, there is no longer an obligation on anybody to maintain it.  It becomes effectively a kind of no man's land.  There are many such cases and, in addition, roads which for one reason or another end up declassified as public roads.</P>
      <P>What members sought to achieve at the special committee was that the decision to abandon a public road would be a reserved function of the elected members of the local authority who would be in a position to take into account all the considerations involved and the needs of the public good.  They would also be sensitive to public opinion on the matter.  It is important that this issue be left in the hands of the elected members of a local authority.  I do not see why it should not be.  There is doubt as to whether it is and in order to clarify the position the Minister should accept the amendments that have been tabled.</P>
      <P>There are a number of options he can select.  If he does not like the wording of one amendment he can accept any other one.  He should accept them and stitch in the principle that a decision on the abandonment of a public road, which is a major decision and could have many implications in a local community, should only be made by the elected members of the local authority.  It would be quite wrong if it were made by anybody else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a brief point to support these amendments.  One of the points it relates back to is local democracy. We talk about devolving power down the line.  There would be a fear on <Col N="1285" /> behalf of local authority members that their considerations in relation to roads and so on, would not be taken into account so Deputy Gilmore's point is a valid one.  Those who know an area best are the ones who should make the decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem of cut-off sections of roads referred to by Deputy Gilmore is tackled by amendments Nos. 133 and 134 and will be dealt with later.  As was explained to Deputies in the special committee, abandonment of a public road will be a reserved function under this section. There is, therefore, no need for these amendments, a fact accepted by the special committee.  However, I should explain again that under section 12 (7) the making of an order abandoning a public road is the responsibility of elected members of the road authority as is the consideration of objections and representations in relation to any such proposal. This provision adequately meets the Deputies' concerns and there is no need for these amendments.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second of Deputy Flanagan's amendments, my commitment to devolution has been put on record many times.  I am of the view that elected members with local knowledge are in the best position to weigh up the pros and cons of any proposed abandonment and to consider the objections made.  I am not convinced that the issue is of such moment or that I or my officials have such special expertise to bring to bear that it is necessary to obtain ministerial approval for the abandonment of local roads or that an absolute majority of the elected members rather than a simple majority is required.  In my view that is contrary to the spirit of devolving powers to local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event, the Bill contains safeguards. Ministerial approval is required where the abandonment relates to a national or regional road but that is only because the Minister classified it as such in the first place.  The consideration of objections would still remain with the <Col N="1286" /> local elected members.  Section 12 (10) (b) gives the Minister reserved power to make regulations, including the setting of criteria for abandonments, with which local authorities would have to comply. This power could be used if evidence came to hand that the devolved powers were being abused, something I am confident will not happen.</P>

      <P>In page 15, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(10)  Where a portion of a national road is downgraded the Authority shall continue to provide the necessary funding for the maintenance of the downgraded road.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This issue was also discussed at some length in the special committee.  At that stage the Minister had the kindness to point out that this amendment was not relevant to section 12 as section 12 does not deal with downgrading but with abandonment. He went on then at a later stage in that debate to undertake to look again at section 69 of the Bill, as it was then, in this context which I do not think is entirely relevant.</P>
      <P>The point at issue here is that there are cases where, owing to the construction of a new road, the old road remains in existence.  It still continues to have its function.  What we are worried about, and indeed more worried because of what the Minister said this morning, is that once the new road is built the Department of the Environment will make allocations in relation to the cost of maintaining the new road but the new road having been provided, it will lose all interest in the old road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage, Deputy Creed gave an example which the Minister seemed to understand.  There is a national primary route that passes <Col N="1287" /> through Macroom.  It is proposed to by-pass Macroom and local people fear that since Cork County Council presumably will be given some contribution to maintain the by-pass, they will not get funds to allow them to maintain the road that goes through Macroom.  It will still be the main street of Macroom and people would like to see it maintained.  If the Minister of State tells me that this is not the appropriate place for the amendment, them I am quite happy to be told that I should put it somewhere else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained on Committee Stage to Deputy Yates, this amendment to section 12 which provides that downgraded sections of national roads shall continue to be funded by the National Roads Authority is not appropriate to section 12 which deals with abandonment of public roads.  I presume that Fine Gael is not proposing that abandoned roads should remain the responsibility of the National Road Authority.  It is, however, inappropriate to discuss here as I presume what is involved in the amendment in the downgrading of a road from national to regional or local classification. I do not accept that as a general rule the National Roads Authority should continue to fund the maintenance <Col N="1288" /> of roads which are no longer classified as national.</P>
      <P>The existing network of national roads is already extensive and a policy of this kind could add some hundreds of kilometres of roads to the network for which the National Roads Authority would have responsibiliby.  This would dilute the funding available from national funds.  Also the EC Commission would not provide European Community Structural Fund assistance for both the new and existing road running in parallel.  This would mean a 100 per cent funding from the Exchequer for these roads, diluting the funds available for national roads still further.  There may be cases in which it will not be appropriate to downgrade a national road and, in such circumstances, I will retain the national classification. However, as a general rule, the existing road would be reduced in classification once a by-pass or re-alignment has been provided.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 15, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  (a) Each road authority shall ensure that in carrying out its functions to maintain and construct public roads, due regard is had to the needs of various road users, including pedestrians, pedal cyclists, disabled persons and parents or guardians of children in prams, etc.</P>
      <P>(b)  Each road authority shall therefore, at least every five years, carry out a survey of its road users and categorise them as follows:</P>
      <P>(i)  pedestrians,</P>
      <P>(ii)  pedal cyclists,</P>
      <P>(iii)  motorists (including buses and motor cycles),</P>
      <P>(iv)  road users with special needs (i.e., disabled persons and parents and guardians of children in prams, etc.).</P>
      <P>(c)  Each road authority shall then apportion the resources available to it for road maintenance and construction in accordance with the proportion of road users in each category.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In amendment No. 23 which I tabled at the special committee I am seeking to arrive at a situation whereby there would not be a narrow definition of road user, particularly with regard to the maintenance of roads.  Over the years, particularly as local authorities have found themselves hard pressed for money, with competing demands on them from various road users, very often a number of categories of road users are forgotten.  I refer to pedestrians, cyclists, people with special needs &mdash; disabled people attempting to move about in wheelchairs or parents pushing prams or buggies, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1290" /> Such people are forgotten about when it comes to the allocation of funds.  A local authority will be given money for roadworks in a given year.  It knows that the road surfaces on which cars travel are in a bad condition so it decides to apply its money to the repair of road surfaces.  It forgets that there are other road users who use footpaths and who might need to cross the road, elderly people for example who would need pedestrian crossings and so on.  There is need for those to be maintained.</P>
    <P>The amendment seeks to require all road authorities to take into account the needs of all road users.  The formula which I have proposed was that a survey would be carried out every five years. Road users would be defined under a number of different categories and funds would be allocated in proportion to that. The Minister, in the special committee, indicated that he had some sympathy with the principle but felt the formula was too restrictive.</P>
    <P>The Minister has put down two amendments which require road authorities to consider the needs of all road users and I am quite happy to withdraw my amendment in favour of the amendments proposed by the Minister, realising that it is probably the best I am going to get on this.  It stitches into the Bill a recognition that there are road users other than motorists and that their needs will be, in some way, protected in the legislation.</P>

      <P>I am sympathetically disposed to the principle that prompted Deputy Gilmore to put down this amendment. I realise that he does not intend to pursue it and will accept the Minister's amendment.  I am sure Deputy Gilmore was prompted to put down the amendment by his intimate knowledge of urban situations but in rural areas a number of differences arise which would cause it to be impractical.  For instance, there would be massive changes seasonally in the levels of traffic and the type of traffic that would use rural roads.  It would be very difficult to stipulate at what time the five-year survey should happen and there <Col N="1291" /> would be major differences from one time to another.</P>
      <P>My most serious worry would be that local authorities would use a points system effectively to abandon sections of road which might have relatively little usage, perhaps with one house or business on them.  In that regard, I very much welcome amendment No. 26 which would allow local authorities to provide for users of roads to make a specific input and they would not necessarily leave themselves open to litigation on foot of that.  In rural areas more likely than in urban, there is frequently an availability of small plant materials or labour in a particular area which allows local people to have a positive input into road maintenance and which heretofore has been precluded because of the major difficulties that arise in relation to insurance.</P>

      <P>In page 15, line 24, after &ldquo;subsections (1) and (2)&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and municipal authorities including town commissioners in their jurisdiction&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment is self-explanatory.  We want to include among the local authorities referred to in this section municipal authorities that include town commissioners in their area.  I wonder if the Minister could tell us whether there are any plans for the re-organisation of these authorities and, if so, when we are likely to see them.  If we see them, are we likely to find that they give them any functions in relation to roads?</P>

      <P>Subsections (1) and (2) of this section very clearly set out the respective responsibilities of local authorities for the public road network.  The 27 county councils and five county borough corporations will be responsible for national and regional roads in their areas. County councils, county borough corporations, borough corporations and <Col N="1292" /> urban district councils will be responsible for all local roads in their areas.  This division of responsibility reflects the reality that the urban districts have largely had no responsibility for main roads and indeed in some cases have even asked the counties to take over responsibility for their own local urban roads.</P>
      <P>Town commissioners do not have any responsibility for public roads under existing laws.  No change is therefore being made in the position of town commissioners or small urban councils.  In practice they would not have the staffing or financial resources to take on the task. I am satisfied that the division of responsibility proposed in this section is sensible, coherent and practical.  It means very little change and reflects the relative capabilities of the local authorities involved.  UDCs and boroughs will retain responsibility for their urban roads.  For all these reasons, I see no basis for the proposed amendment.</P>

As I have said many times, I want to see local authorities upgraded.  In regard to road maintenance, the practice has grown over the years because of the incapacity of town commissioners and small urban councils to manage this.  It applies mainly to the county systems.</P>

      <P>In page 15, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) (a) A person or group of persons may, with the consent of a road authority, carry out maintenance works on a local road.</P>
      <P>(b)  A consent under paragraph (a) may be given by the road authority subject to such conditions, restrictions and requirements as it thinks fit.</P>
      <P>(c)  Where a road authority gives its consent under paragraph (a) and the works have been carried out in a bona fide manner and in accordance with every condition, restriction or requirement specified under paragraph (b)&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the works shall be deemed to have been carried out by the road authority, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  the person or group (and each member thereof) who carried out the works shall be indemnified by the road authority against all actions and claims howsoever arising in respect of the works and the carrying out of works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  A road authority may provide <Col N="1294" /> materials, plant, equipment and the services of its staff to a person or group carrying out works under this subsection.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Over the years the issue of private citizens repairing roads has arisen time and time again.  Local authorities have taken the view, rightly, that they could leave themselves open to legal actions in respect of any injury, death or damage caused by substandard road repair work undertaken by private individuals. Local authorities have therefore been reluctant to allow people repair their local roads, much to the frustration of local voluntary groups who are willing to provide materials and manpower.</P>
    <P>This subject was raised again during the special committee and I agreed to reconsider the matter.  In response, I am introducing this amendment which will allow local people repair local roads if they have obtained the consent of the local authority.  This power will not apply to regional or national roads, which must remain the sole responsibility of the local authority.  The road authority will, however, be able to impose conditions, restrictions or requirements when consenting to such work.  This will ensure that any work is properly and safely carried out and will not subsequently create a hazard to road users.  If the work is carried out in accordance with the terms of the consent and in a bona fide manner, then any liability will rest with the local authority and not the private citizen who carried out the work.  It is in the interests of the local authority therefore to ensure that the work is carried out correctly.</P>
    <P>The amendment will also allow local authorities to provide materials, equipment, plant or the services of its staff to private individuals or voluntary associations carrying out the work on a local road.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to tell at this stage what impact this will have, but it does at least open the door for co-operation between local people and local authorities in the maintenance of local roads.  This could be very worthwhile at times of financial restraints, such as exist at present.  I do however want to stress that the purpose <Col N="1295" /> of this amendment is not to relieve local authorities of their statutory responsibility for local roads, nor does it imply any substitution of private effort for State and local authority funded works.  Its purpose is to respond to a genuine local demand, to increase the total effort being put into road maintenance and to reflect the views which were genuinely expressed to me during the course of the debate on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a certain ambivalence towards the provisions of this section.  I welcome it for the very practical reasons that the Minister has set out. Many of us, particularly rural Deputies, find that the situation that the Minister addresses here arises frequently.  It is a bit naive of the Minister to say that we should not take this in any way as being a step back by local authorities from their statutory duty to maintain roads.  Frequently, such situations arise because a local authority has for many years failed to carry out any of the required work in keeping sections of road up to proper standards.  I know this is a problem the Minister meets frequently in his own constituency and is one that I meet in my constituency very often.  It is one that most of us in rural areas meet with appalling regularity.</P>
      <P>I have ambivalent feelings about this. On the one hand, I can see the practical value of allowing people, who up to now have been driven by frustration to make these offers but were stopped because there was always a doubt about the insurance status of the work to take the kind of action that this amendment permits them to take.  It would be idle to pretend that this will not allow local authorities to feel in some cases that they are now off the hook.  Any Deputy who has been agitating for improved lighting on roads will have found in the past few years, as I found, that the county manager will be very nice and say.  &ldquo;Yes, we will put up a light if the local people can make a contribution&rdquo;, which is usually to cover the total cost of erecting the pole and making the connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1296" /> What we have here, and let us not put a tooth in it, is a method for the handing over by local authorities to private citizens of a part of their responsibility.  The Minister is limiting it to local roads and he is quite right to do so.  It is in respect of local roads that the problem arises in the first place.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister does not think I am carping.  I welcome the practical effect this will have.  Work will be done that people were prevented from doing up to now by a legal question mark.  However, it represents a move away by the local authorities from some of their statutory responsibilities and we should not present it any other way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy Dukes's ambivalence about this amendment.  I recall the discussion at the special committee. My sympathies are with the Members who sought some arrangement whereby, particularly in rural areas, people who wanted to make some contribution to the maintenance and upkeep of a road could be facilitated in doing so without exposing them to liability.  That is fair and reasonable and makes a lot of sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern is that the formula the Minister has introduced here will go beyond that.  We all know that local authorities are short of money to carry out road maintenance.  I chaired a meeting of my local authority last week dealing with roads and traffic matters.  There were 14 different items tabled by members of the authority looking for an improvement in this section of road, an improvement in a footpath or public lighting.  They all got the same reply &mdash; there was no money to do it.  My concern is that after this becomes part of the roads legislation there will be an addition saying something like this: however, the residents or the residents association concerned may, if it wishes, do the work itself or apply to the local authority to have it done under this formula.  There is plenty of precedent for that.  For example, in a similar matter like the provision of road signs &mdash;&ldquo;caution children&rdquo; signs and so on &mdash; there is a waiting list for those kinds of signs in <Col N="1297" /> my own local authority area.  A scheme was introduced some years ago whereby, if one did not want to join the queue waiting for one of those signs to be provided by the local authority, a residents' association or a group of people could put up the money and the sign would be provided.  What happened in practice was the areas that were able to come up with the money got road signs and the areas that were not able to come up with the money did not.  The local authority, in effect, stopped providing the signs itself. Everybody who looked for a &ldquo;caution children&rdquo; sign was told that if they put up the £120 the sign would be erected.</P>
    <P>The same thing has happened in relation to schools.  A number of years ago because the capitation grant made available to schools was so low the system of voluntary contributions was introduced. Parents of school-going children could make a voluntary contribution to the upkeep of the school.  The voluntary contributions have grown and now constitute three-quarters of the cost of upkeeping a school.  The whole system has now come to depend on that kind of approach.</P>
    <P>By all means a formula has to be found whereby a person living at the end of a country boreen which needs maintenance and where realistically the local authority will never get around to doing it, if the person concerned is in a position and wants to maintain it, they can do so without being exposed to liability, but under this formula local authorities will simply pass responsibility for road maintenance on local roads over to local communities. We will end up with a two-tier road system whereby national roads are very well funded, backed up by EC money and so on and are maintained.  They will be the primary responsibility of the roads authority and the local authority but local roads, including roads within housing estates and so on, will effectively be thrown back on the local community. There will be good roads in an area where people can afford to pay for them and bad roads where people cannot, with the local authority, in effect, copping out of its responsibility to maintain roads.</P>

      <P>I agree with the points raised by Deputy Gilmore.  I appreciate that the Minister is trying to meet a need expressed to him at an earlier stage but there is a danger in it.  I can quote other instances, for example, the planting of trees.  People or traders in the locality may make a contribution and have trees planted while other areas which may need them more will not get the trees because they are unable to come up with the necessary contribution.  That is a very genuine fear that has been expressed.</P>
      <P>I do not know if we will come up with a two-tier road system because we have it to a great extent already.  The Minister will have to take this into consideration. It may seem to be nit-picking to some extent in that he has tried to come some way on this.  I appreciate that, but there is a danger here and I ask him to suggest some way of circumventing it.</P>

      <P>I, too, thank the Minister for trying to come up with some solution to this problem but like other Deputies I worry that it will be found to be the answer to the problem.  In my constituency, Cavan-Monaghan, the road situation is so serious that people would like to be able to do something with the roads to give them some leeway at silage making times and so on. However, I am seriously concerned that it would be seen to be a way out for the county councils not to do the necessary road repairs.</P>
      <P>There is one road on the borders of Cavan-Monaghan where parents cannot go out to meet schoolgoing children because they cannot bring prams on the roads.  We have an extremely serious problem in that area which needs to be addressed as quickly as possible.  I accept that the Minister has made an effort to improve the situation as far as legal rights are concerned but I am afraid the Minister and the county councils will be allowed off the hook.  There is a desperate need to repair the roads in Cavan-Monaghan in the immediate future before people can no longer travel on them.  That is the reality in that area at present.</P>

      <P>I am amazed at the introduction of this proposal.  I cannot believe it.  I well understand what people are saying.  There are people in rural areas and in some urban areas as well, who would like to be able to have works carried out but the local authority does not have the money to provide these services. What is now being introduced is a complete and absolute cop-out by Government to get somebody else to pay for something that they, and through them the local authorities, are taxing people to provide.  This is a new area that will not be provided for in estimates at all; the people will pay for this.</P>
      <P>There are a number of anomalies in this.  What equal access will there be to this new proposed service or facility?  For example, take a group of old local authority houses which are down a narrow county lane.  Will they, housing maybe ten or 15 unemployed people, or ten or 15 old age pensioners, have equal access to this facility as a successful businessperson will have?  Will each group in society have the same right to gain access to road improvements or whatever through this proposal?  It is an absolute cop-out and it has been introduced at local authority meetings in the past, invariably by supporters of the main Government party.  It has come about as a result of the failure of the Government to provide money to local authorities to enable them carry out their statutory functions.</P>
      <P>We hear a great deal in this House about the Constitution.  I cannot understand how this will be constitutional because there will not be equal access to the service.  At some later stage, I can see local authorities faced with a tight financial situation, will perhaps approve of jobs being undertaken in a substandard fashion.  This will result in claims against the local authorities which their insurers will have to underwrite. Ultimately what will happen is that local authorities will end up spending more money.  It is incredible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing in that proposal which is helpful.  It is saying to people: we are very sorry; we are in Government to do <Col N="1300" /> a job and we have appointed people to do a job.  We do not have enough money available but if you are lucky enough to have money yourselves, or can raise it, you can carry out improvements to your local road, provide public lighting or do whatever you like.  We will empower you to do it and we will cover you in the event of liability so that nobody can say: &ldquo;I tripped and broke my neck on a road that was badly completed as a result of a scheme undertaken by local people&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is unbelievable that the Government should come in with a proposal like this before the budget.  It is a total and absolute cop-out and an abdication of statutory responsibility.  The Government propose to do this willingly, knowing the consequences full well.  Nobody knows the position better than those of us who travel on a daily basis through rural areas where no money has been spent on road maintenance for years.  We all recognise the need to do something about it.  There is no point in circling around it and saying there is not enough money.  The people who live in those areas see adequate finances becoming available through various bodies at present.  Take, for example, the £8 billion being trotted out for various purposes over the last six months.  The people who live in those areas who are about to be given permission to carry out their own road improvements, with the approval of the local authority and the Government, will look askance at the £3 million per day which is allegedly being made available through the system.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 15, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7)  (a) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (5), and save as otherwise provided by law, a road authority may take measures to limit, restrict or reduce the volume or types of traffic using particular roads.</P>
      <P>(b)  In particular, a road authority may take measures to limit, reduce or restrict traffic in residential areas by&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the erection of signs,</P>
      <P>(ii)  the provision of ramps, chicanes, traffic signals or other physical means of limiting traffic,</P>
      <P>(iii)  the enforcement of speed limits from 5 miles per hour upwards.</P>
      <P>(c)  A road authority may, by resolution of its elected members, declare an area to be a &ldquo;Traffic-Controlled Zone&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d)  A Traffic-controlled Zone shall be defined, by reference to a map as an area which by reason of its residential, <Col N="1303" /> architectural or other characteristics, requires special measures to limit, reduce or restrict certain types of road use.  A road authority may take such measures as it considers appropriate to control traffic in the Traffic Controlled Zone.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is one of the amendments which I mentioned at the special committee.  The Minister gave an assurance that the problem which this amendment addresses would be dealt with in the Road Traffic Bill.  I asked him at that stage if the Road Traffic Bill would be with us before we came to Report Stage and he assured me that it would.  It is not and on Committee Stage I indicated that, if it were not, I would retable this amendment and seek the Minister's agreement to it.</P>
    <P>This amendment is largely about an urban problem that is commonly known as &ldquo;rat running&rdquo;.  Contrary to the Minister's belief, when you build more roads you do not reduce the volume of traffic on either those roads or the adjacent roads, but in fact it is my experience that you increase it.  In my constituency I can think of a number of areas adjacent to either the main N11, which has been improved and modernised over the years, or adjacent to the Blackrock by-pass, which was also provided in recent times, which now have a very serious problem of rat running.  People who cannot move quickly enough on the main road divert into residential areas and use them as a shortcut to get around traffic bottle necks, onto other roads etc.  The problem now is that traffic is going through roads which were never designed to cater for that volume of traffic.</P>
    <P>There are parts of my constituency where people complain that they simply cannot drive out their own front gate in the morning because of queues of traffic on residential roads.  These people bought houses in housing estates and now find that the estate roads, which were built and designed purely to cater for the estate's own traffic, have in effect become major through-ways and are being used by people commuting through them.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to deal with this and <Col N="1304" /> it is complicated by the fact that the local authority is the road authority and the Garda are the traffic authority.  There is constant confusion between the two. Even getting a very simple measure like a set of double yellow lines, traffic lights, a yield sign or whatever, can involve a very complicated procedure between the Garda, the local authority, the traffic division etc.  My amendment is to enable road authorities, in particular local authorities, to deal with this problem themselves by a range of measures that I suggest, such as the erection of signs, which is a very simple and straightforward one; provision of various physical means of controlling traffic, whether it is ramps, chicanes, traffic signals and so on; the enforcement of speed limits of as low as five miles per hour.  If in some of these residential areas there was a very low speed limit, it would have the effect of discouraging traffic because many of the people who use these rat runs do so in order to make time.  They find it quicker to go through a residential area than to stay on the main road.  If a five mile per hour speed limit were placed on such roads it would not be a problem for the people who live in the estates but it would discourage other traffic using the estate roads.</P>
    <P>I have also suggested the creation of traffic controlled zones, which I understand operate very well in some other countries.  The amendment gives road authorities a certain amount of flexibility to deal with these kinds of traffic problems. Road engineers tell me that there is no quick fix to this kind of problem.  It seems to be a problem that will have to be approached on an experimental basis. It is a complex problem because if you provide one measure on one road it may have a knock-on effect in another road. The roads authorities need a certain amount of flexibility to deal with this problem themselves.  It is a massive problem and it is one about which I get most complaints from constituents: they are tired of the volume and speed of traffic. They cannot let their children out to play in front of their own houses.  They find that their roads are unsafe.  They are <Col N="1305" /> plagued with noise and with heavy volumes of traffic travelling at speed in areas which, at one stage, were quite peaceful residential areas.  The amendment is designed to deal with that.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that he was going to deal with this in the Road Traffic Bill.  We do not know what is in the Road Traffic Bill because we have not got it yet.  This may not be dealt with in the Road Traffic Bill.</P>

      <P>I take great pleasure in supporting this amendment.  Deputy Gilmore and I share a constituency and I can vouch for the fact that one of the main issues we encounter every day in relation to the problems of our constituents has to do with traffic problems, traffic calming and traffic management measures, because of the difficulties and problems which Deputy Gilmore outlined. We cannot afford to wait.  I do not know when the Roads Bill will come into effect but we cannot afford to wait any longer than the coming into force of this Bill.</P>
      <P>In the special committee the Minister said he shared the sentiments behind the amendment as it was put at that time.  He gave a commitment in relation to the Roads Traffic Bill but unfortunately we cannot wait.  I ask him, if he shares the sentiments behind the amendment, to share with us our feeling of frustration that we cannot deal with traffic measures in our own local authority areas because we do not have the power to do so.  The method in place at the moment is cumbersome and unworkable.  It is not good enough that we cannot deal in any way with the difficulties that our constituents are faced with.  I ask him to bring sentiment to bear on this and accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment for the same reasons that Deputies Gilmore and Keogh have outlined.  I would add to what they have said the reflection that the problem is not related only to housing estates and areas that are contiguous to main roads that get clogged up during heavy traffic.  There is another <Col N="1306" /> dimension to the problem which is to be found in a great many places around the country.  Even in areas surrounding towns that are not very large, one will find this problem.  Where there are blockages of traffic on a main road there is always the temptation for motorists to take this kind of avoiding action.</P>
      <P>There are other cases where this kind of problem arises at specific times.  For example, near football grounds, racecourses and any other area where, from time to time, there is a big event which results in large volumes of traffic and parking. In some cases the problem is even further compounded by the fact that on what are normally relatively quiet estate roads not only is there traffic coming through to avoid bottlenecks but there is an unusual amount of parking.  That creates a double hazard particularly in relation to children who use the roads in the estates they live in as play areas, which we all know happens regularly. There is an extra problem in that, very often, children and other pedestrians are shielded from the view of motorists by large numbers of parked cars and vans. It would be entirely appropriate to have a provision of this kind in our standing body of legislation on how we deal with, construct and manage roads.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on his new appointment. I support the amendment.  Unfortunately one of the problems with developments that take place in most urban areas is that, in the early stages of development roads are not finished, and so on.  Finally, when a good smooth surface is applied to many of the roads in new estates, speed becomes a problem and if that estate happens to be a link between two congested roads, one then encounters the problems referred to by the other speakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great deal of merit in the amendment.  One of the problems that we have had in the local authority of which I am a member is that the Western Parkway toll bridge has deflected traffic further out into places like Captain's Hill in Leixlip, causing problems in a residential <Col N="1307" /> area there.  We have spent the last 12 to 14 months trying to find statutory ways and means of restricting the flow of traffic and so far we have failed.  According to all the information we have, it is virtually impossible to do something that is within the law and readily available in order to control that kind of traffic.</P>
    <P>The same thing happens in some of the older developments in the country where there is perhaps a set of traffic lights on the main street of a town or village.  We have this problem in my own town of Maynooth where the traffic automatically selects an alternative route and to beat the traffic lights motorists race from one end of the parallel street to the other. The result is that the unfortunate people who live in these areas are in danger of their lives at all times.  I agree with the amendment and I hope the Minister sees fit to meet the suggestions as far as is possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I said on Committee Stage that I had every sympathy with this amendment.  While I did not specifically say that Deputies would see the Road Traffic Bill by the time we reached Report Stage, I was hopeful and that was the expectation &mdash; I think the word &ldquo;expectation&rdquo; was the word I used because one can never be too sure about these things &mdash; but needless to say in the meantime there were survival stakes at risk and I did not even know if I would be back here to pick up the cudgel again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the powers that are already contained in road traffic legislation which enable a variety of different matters relating to speed limits, restriction of road users, bollards, ramps and other traffic calming measures to be introduced, I am perfectly satisfied that the role for local authorities &mdash; I will demonstrate that in the Road Traffic Bill when I introduce it &mdash; in terms of their direct involvement in all of these areas without any archaic, restrictive impositions from the Department of the Environment and without the need for approval from the Department of the Environment and a lot of <Col N="1308" /> consultation with local people is the best way to go forward in these areas.</P>
    <P>Subsection 6 (a) gives considerable enabling powers to local authorities to do the kind of things to which Deputies referred.  It will be quite possible for them, even within that and notwithstanding other powers that I intend to provide in the Road Traffic Bill, to take a number of decisions which will be quite helpful.  The introduction of traffic calming may be fairly complex and require legislation.  We have to await the outcome of consultation that is going on in relation to that to see the overall position <i>viz-á-viz</i> what the Dublin people are saying themselves.  Deputy Dukes rightly makes the point that there are corresponding problems in different parts of the country, but that should give us a broad notion of what it is we have to do. We should await that before we make final decisions on the broad list of measures we might introduce.</P>
    <P>We already have very considerable powers at local authority level which I am going to enhance.  This section provides further powers to local authorities to take other measures which they deem fit.  The best place to resolve these issues is at local authority level with local representatives consulting the people.  A broad ranging national legal framework is not able to take account of some of the points that Deputy Gilmore made, for instance, when major road improvement takes place.  Presumably before a full road route is completed traffic tries different options, but the problem should be resolved when the total road network is completed.  That is some years down the road and in the interim many people living in estates have definite problems and we need to address them.  I will bring forward in the next couple of weeks the Road Traffic Bill and that will demonstrate further the raft of powers that I want to see managed directly, without my involvement, at local level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister has repeated his sympathy for what I was attempting to do in this amendment and that he has given some cause for <Col N="1309" /> hope that he may address it somewhat in the Road Traffic Bill.  However, I am at a loss to understand why he has not taken the opportunity to do so in this Bill.  What is at issue here, as Deputy Keogh said, is current and urgent.</P>
      <P>In my constituency we are currently at local authority level dealing with a proposal to erect bollards on a number of roads in Blackrock.  It has turned out to be a rather controversial proposal. People on the roads concerned seem to be, by an large, all for it; but those living on adjacent roads fear it may result in a knock on traffic problem for them all and are not too keen on it, to put it mildly. That is the kind of solution, for example, that the Minister recommended in this Bill.  We may provide &ldquo;any amenity, structure or thing&rdquo;&mdash; I suppose bollards would come under the category of &ldquo;thing&rdquo;&mdash; for the safety and convenience of road users.  Quite clearly we can do that.</P>
      <P>That is a physical solution, but some of the solutions may not purely be physical solutions.  There might be a range of things that need to be done which might involve speed limits, traffic measures and so on and that, unfortunately, is not provided for here.  There is an urgency about this and I am disappointed the Minister has not accepted the amendment.  Hopefully, the Minister will deal with this as a priority issue in the context of the Road Traffic Bill when it eventually appears before us.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1311" /> In page 16, line 41, after &ldquo;may&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;request the Minister to&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These two amendments derive from a concern which was expressed on Committee Stage that the National Roads Authority was being given very considerable power at the expense of local authorities.  The purpose of the two amendments is to seek to reduce that authority.  If I may speak specifically in relation to amendment No. 32, which deals with the revoking of a section 59 agreement which might be made between two local authorities over a road matter, the provision in the Bill is that the section 59 agreement made between two local authorities cannot be revoked save with the consent of the National Roads Authority. That seems to be giving a power to the National Roads Authority that is excessive and in amendment No. 32 I seek that the revocation of a section 59 agreement should be with the consent of the local authorities concerned rather than specifically the National Roads Authority.</P>
    <P>In amendment No. 31 I seek to reduce the degree to which the National Roads Authority will direct individual local authorities by making a provision that a request from the National Roads Authority would go through the Minister, since the Minister would be accountable to this House in a way that the National Roads Authority would not be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments proposed would negate the whole purpose of this section but deny the NRA the power to direct the making of an agreement, though significantly not the making of a joint arrangement.  Even the Minister would have the power only of requesting the local authorities to make an agreement if the NRA asked him to so act. There would be no power to specify what terms would be included in the agreement and the local authorities could revoke the agreement the following day even if they agreed to the Minister's request.  So why bother to have that power if it is so weak?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1312" /> We went through this in great detail on Committee Stage.  Amendments were accepted at the time which ensured that the NRA would first request road authorities to make agreements or enter into arangements before it could use its power of direction.  Only if they refuse to act will the NRA be able to give a direction and then only after consultation with the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I want to stress again that section 59 agreements are very important in the roads context.  They permit road projects to be planned and implemented in the most efficient way possible and avoid having to artificially divide up schemes to take account of local authority boundaries. Under such an agreement one local authority carries out all the work on a project even though it crosses the local authority boundaries.  It is therefore important that the NRA should have the reserved power to insist on the making of agreements.  If it did not, the only real alternative would be to take over the project itself and this should always be the last resort.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a classic case of local authorities losing whatever power they have in this area.  Irrespective of how it is dressed up the bottom line is that the National Roads Authority can tell the local authorities what to do.  If there is a section 59 agreement the National Roads Authority can, at the end of the day, require local authorities to make section 59 agreements between them.  Where section 59 agreements exist the National Roads Authority can instruct a local authority to revoke them. The power that local authorities now have, for example, to uphold section 59 agreements and decide not to revoke them will ultimately be taken from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister proposes going about it in a very polite way.  At first the local authorities will be requested to do so.  If they refuse the request they can ultimately be directed but only after they have been consulted.  It is a transfer of functions from the local authorities to the National Roads Authority and I am opposed to it. <Col N="1313" /> These amendments give effect to that opposition.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 33:</P>
      <P>In page 18, to delete lines 47 to 51.</P>
      <P>This amendment underlines more emphatically what I said in relation to the previous one.  One of the buzz phrases these days is the &ldquo;principle of subsidiarity&rdquo;. The Minister intends to substitute the principle of subservience for the principle of subsidiarity with this section.  In effect what section 15 (1) of the Bill means is that the Minister may give a direction to a road authority to do anything.  It refers to any of the functions assigned to it by any enactment, including this Act, relating to any road matter.  The Minister for the Environment can tell the roads authority what to do, how to spend money and where to spend it.  It is openended.  It is a very dangerous principle to have enshrined in the Bill.  My amendment is to remove it.</P>
      <P>Other sections of the Bill give the Minister specific powers to give directions to the local authorities where it is quite clear that is relevant in the context of setting up a National Roads Authority and introducing a new system for classifying roads. There is no need for the Minister to arrogate to himself a power to give an openended direction to local authorities about any matter relating to roads.  The effect of this section is to take away from local authorities their sovereignty in matters relating to roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From here on local authorities will simply act either as some kind of agent for the National Roads Authority in some cases or some kind of subservient body <Col N="1314" /> to the Minister.  The elected members of local authorities will not call the shots anymore at local level, but the person calling the shots will be the Minister for the Environment.  It is a fundamentally undemocratic provision.  It flies in the face of everything that has been said about the principle of subsidiarity.  It flies in the face of the Programme for Government about extending the principle of democracy and devolving powers and so on to local level.</P>
    <P>I know we debated this issue on Committee Stage and that the Minister at that stage was not disposed to change his mind, but a lot has happened since then, not least the Minister's own political survival.</P>

I have seen no evidence of it since I came in here this morning.  Perhaps this will be the first opportunity to show that what is said in the Programme for Government about subsidiarity, devolving powers to local level and extending the principle of democracy does mean something and that we will not enshrine in legislation a provision that robs local authorities of their road functions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision which it is proposed to amend is one of the most obnoxious in the Bill.  Although it looks very innocent, it specifically provides that the Minister may give directions to a road authority in relation to any of the functions assigned to it by or under any enactment, including this Act.  If there is any existing enactment or any future enactment that has anything to do with the functions of a road authority it may be disturbed or interfered with or set aside by a direction from the Minister.  I do not see any reason for doing that.  As Deputy Gilmore has said, the Bill contains very clear powers for the National Roads Authority and for the Minister.  It is clear that in relation to national roads, given <Col N="1315" /> the general shape of what is proposed in this Bill, roads authorities cannot be independent free standing agents as far as the construction of national roads is concerned.  To give the Minister power to give directions in relation to functions of road authorities under any enactment is going much too far.</P>
      <P>There are other similar provisions in this Bill and on Second Stage, looking at some of those provisions, I was moved to say that once again what we see in this Bill is what I call the belt and braces approach to securing the Minister's position under this legislation.  Elsewhere in this Bill the Minister is given specific powers, some of which we may agree with.  Those who drafted the legislation decided what kind of powers they wanted the Minister to have and then, just in case there was something they missed, they put in another provision that says &ldquo;in case there is something else we have missed or have not thought of up to now we are putting in this provision to make sure the Minister has the power to second-guess either himself, his Department or the local authority&rdquo;.  It is a very bad way to write legislation.  As Deputy Gilmore said, it completely overturns any notion of a distinct separation of powers or a hierarchy of functions between different levels of authority.</P>
      <P>It is a feature that I find comes up with disturbing frequency in legislation from the Department of the Environment.  We found it in this legislation and we found it in other legislation from that Department. It is an indication of a view or a mood in that Department and perhaps in the Minister that does not seem to have caught up with the idea that many of us want to give local authorities and local groups of all kinds, more powers to decide their own actions rather than constrain them increasingly in tighter and tighter strait-jackets and subject them increasingly to second guessing on the part of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister wishes anything to be clear in relation to the balance of functions between the National Roads Authority, <Col N="1316" /> the local roads authorities and the Minister himself let that be set out specifically in relation to each specific function where there is need to do so. But let us not get into the business of giving the Minister, as a kind of an after thought, the sweeping powers that are given by this section.  It is unnecessary and anti-democratic and it flies in the face of any kind of re-organisation of local government.  It makes me shudder to think that it is the same Minister and Department who produced this legislation who will come into this House at some unspecified stage in the future to give us proposals for further local government reform.  If this is the mind-set they are using, then the local reforms will not be worth an awful lot.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; has come up time and time again.  It is not that I would accuse the Minister of trying to subvert local democracy but there must be this fear, particularly with regard to this section, amongst members of local authorities that all powers will eventually be stripped away from them. It is not enough that we do not have sufficient money to do whatever it is we want to do but any powers that we may have had are slowly disappearing.</P>
      <P>I cannot but feel that is a very genuine fear.  To have this section enshrined in the Bill seems to confirm that the fear may be more realistic that people might think at first glance.  Even though this is a small section of one Bill it gives a lead. It is one of the first Bills that we are examining this term and the lead we should be giving is to show that there is an openness and change.  Maybe because the Bill was drafted before the election this openness and change does not seem to come through.</P>

      <P>I wish to place on record the functions during the last 12 months that were delegated to local authorities from my Department and those which are about to emerge in the next week, as an example of how I want power to devolve in strange contrast with any efforts that were made for a very long time to so do.  There should be no question in anybody's mind and the record is there to prove it.  Further examples will be available in the very near future to demonstrate that I am concerned to ensure that at local authority level the maximum freedom and autonomy is available to local elected members and administrations.</P>
      <P>My amendments require that ministerial directions to local authorities under section 15, and to the National Roads Authority under section 41 and ministerial guidelines under section 15, must be laid before both Houses of the Oireacthas.  There was much debate on this on Committee Stage.  It is strange, if one reads through that debate, and those who were present will know and others can confirm, that the contributions went in diametrically opposed directions. There was opposition, as Deputy Gilmore rightly confirmed here today, to the ministerial directions to local authorities or to the NRA, and there was the demand, as the debate proceeded, for the Minister to retain and take powers from the NRA as the NRA was going to be too powerful.</P>
      <P>It is quite extraordinary for a man with the experience of Deputy Dukes to try to read something sinister into a provision which is contained in the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, the Industrial Development Act, 1986, the National Development Corporation Act, 1986, the Forestry Act, 1988 and Safety Health and Welfare Acts 1989.  That is just a sample.  Let us get the facts right. There is a childish approach, to my mind, emerging from some of the contributions in that every local authority in this country is perfect and everything is going on at 100 per cent pace and that there are no problems whatsoever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put on record, as Minister for the <Col N="1318" /> Environment, that I see a great difference between the capacity of local authorities to provide local services.  I see a great difference between those who run very efficient systems and those who do not.  I had, in the course of the last 12 months, to resort to giving a direction.  I do not like it.  It is not something that I particularly want to have but in circumstances where there are local difficulties and there is not the proper response, Deputies Gilmore or Keogh would be the first into this House demanding that I take action.  If I were to say I do not have the legal powers, I would be told it was a cop-out.  So let us get some straight sense into this.</P>
    <P>These are not laws which we want to operate every day but there will be, and there have been in the past, circumstances in which it was absolutely essential that somebody responsible to the people as a whole had the authority and ability to act in this way.  That is not just in relation to roads.  It could well be in relation to housing or other matters. We had, on the one hand, the demand to leave the NRA totally independent. We had the totally opposite demand: they have too much powers; take the powers away.  The only way in which I can find a proper balance is to act in the way I have done.  The previous Acts in which a similar provision is contained demonstrate that.  I reject out of hand the accusation that has been levelled at the Department of the Environment and its officials that they were trying to establish a norm or a set of circumstances for themselves which was unique and did not apply anywhere else or in any other Department.  It is totally unfair criticism in the face of 12 months during which local authorities have been given, through legislation and regulations, more powers than they ever had.  In a great number of cases, they do not understand the powers they have.  They have power to do a number of things and have freedom in relation to matters which, in some cases, they do not seem to appreciate.</P>
    <P>Somebody must take overall responsibility in a democratic system to solve problems and this mechanism has been <Col N="1319" /> used very successfully in the past.  It is an exceptional measure, not one that I invite or would want to use but we must ensure that a local authority will take appropriate action in circumstances where all the other local authorities in a region have brought developments to a certain pitch and is not held back because of the resistance of one particular area.</P>

      <P>As a member of a county council it would be indefensible of me not to rise and say that, while conceding the Minister must take an overall view of local authorities, the problems encountered by Carlow County Council are not because the county council will not make decisions, it is basically that there is not money to do anything.  I have been a member of the county council since 1979, which is not a long time but in the early years the county council dealt with genuine problems.  At this stage, if money is not allocated to specific cases the local authorities cannot act.</P>
      <P>It is unfair of the Minister to blame local authorities for lack of housing and the condition of roads.  County councils are not responsible for many of their difficulties, they just cannot do anything about them.  The Minister has the power to tell the local authorities what to do.  If the county councils had power to tell the Minister what to do, they would solve many problems.  The Minister should not pass the buck.</P>

      <P>The Minister's last intervention is most regrettable.  It betrays an attitude to local government which is completely at variance with stated Government policies and the high minded talk about devolution of powers, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that this provision is the same as that contained in other legislation.  That may be but there is a major difference in the relationship between the Minister for the Environment <Col N="1320" /> and democratically elected local authorities and the relationship between a Government Minister and a board of directors appointed by that Minister.  All the legislation, the Post and Telecommunications Act, the IDA and all the various other bodies to which he referred are appointed by the Minister and accountable to him.  There is merit in it where those bodies would, through the Minister, be accountable to this House. That is perfectly understandable but this is different.  We are talking here about the Minister giving direction, not to a body appointed by himself, but to a body or bodies, in the case of local authorities, which are elected by the people.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that local authorities are not perfect and may hold up things. He might not like the manner in which they respond to public opinion and the way to get through that is for the Minister to have the power to tell them what to do.  That is the kind of logic that justifies dictatorship and says that if one does not like the democratic wish of the people, one can find some formula to ride through it.  That is what this Bill is all about.</P>
    <P>This Bill is about shortcutting the concerns that very often manifest themselves at local level &mdash; concern about a new road proposal, road plans which people are worried about going near their homes, destroying communities, etc; the type of concerns that have been expressed publicly on things like the eastern by-pass and a number of other road proposals that can very often give rise to a great deal of heat and local concern.  The Minister is saying that if the local authority cannot do business, if it responds to public concern locally and the Minister does not approve, the Minister can tell the local authority what to do.</P>
    <P>This raises a question as to what is the point of people electing local councillors to represent their views and make decisions on their behalf if, at the end of the day, the Minister can tell them what to do.</P>
    <P>I made the point earlier that there are many sections of this Bill &mdash; it is quite a large Bill &mdash; where the Minister has given <Col N="1321" /> himself specific power to give directions to the local authority.  In some cases it makes sense, for example, in areas where the directions are specific but this is a very general power.  As Deputy Dukes said earlier, it enables the Minister to tell a local authority to do anything in relation to roads.  For example, we had a discussion earlier about the abandoning of a public road.  The Minister assured us that the decision to abandon a public road would be a reserved function for the elected members of the local authority. So far so good, until we come to section 15 when the Minister may give a direction in writing to a road authority in relation to any of the functions assigned to it or any enactment and the local authority shall comply with such direction.</P>
    <P>Let us take the case of the abandonment of a public road.  The Minister, under this section, can give a direction to the local authority to abandon a public road and under this section it would have to comply.  Where is the reserved function of the local authority in that case?  The Minister makes the decision. That is standing democracy on its head. It is an undemocratic provision.</P>
    <P>I regret the Minister's contribution because his attitude implied that he does not trust local authorities or their elected members and that, like wayward children, they will have to be periodically corrected by the Minister.  That is a very bad attitude towards local authorities and a very bad start to the Minsiter's second term as Minister for the Environment, particularly at a time when local government will have to be reorganised and local authorities given devolved powers.</P>
    <P>One of the major functions of a local authority is in relation to roads and if local authorities do not have independence in decision-making in that area, as they will not have after this section has passed, then they will have lost a major power to the Minister and will, in fact, be subservient to him.  I regret that the Minister is taking that approach.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 40:</P>
      <P>In page 19, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) The Minister shall make regulations providing that any function relating to roads, other than national roads, conferred on him under any enactment (including this Act), or on the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána under the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1987, shall be performed by a roads authority, in lieu of being performed by him or by the Commissioner, be performed by the roads authority from a date specified in the regulations.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section deals with the functions of the roads authority.  Under the provisions of section 17 (3) the Minister can make regulations providing that any function performed by him or by the Garda Commissioner shall, where the Minister feels that it could be performed more effectively by the roads authority in relation to national roads, be assigned to the roads authority.  My amendment seeks to make a corresponding provision in the case of local authorities in respect of non-national roads.  We referred earlier to the area of overlap between local authorities as road authorities and the Garda Commissioner as the traffic authority.  Quite clearly in subsection (3) the Minister proposes that this be streamlined in the case of national roads, that he may transfer <Col N="1324" /> to the national roads authority his own functions and the Garda Commissioner's functions, as he sees fit.  National roads will have a regime under the National Roads Authority and these matters can be dealt with expeditiously.</P>
    <P>In fairness, the same provision should be made in relation to local authorities that there should be the same transfer of functions.  If it can be done for a national road in the case of the National Roads Authority, then it should be possible to do it for non-national roads in the case of local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to oblige the Minister to make regulations devolving his non-national road functions and those of the Garda Commissioner to local authorities. I am sympathetic to the principles which underlie this amendment but as I explained to the special committee this Bill is not appropriate for the devolution of road traffic functions.</P>
      <P>This Bill contains a substantial measure of devolution to local authorities. The powers to extinguish public rights of way and to abandon public roads have been devolved to the elected members of local authorities.  Previously these powers could only be exercised with the consent of the Minister following an oral hearing or public inquiry into any objections.  Now the whole process, including the consideration of objections, will be in the hands of the local authority. The requirement to notify the Minister of temporary road closures has been abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down an amendment on Committee Stage proposing to give local authorities power to make by-laws controlling skips.  These by-laws will not require ministerial confirmation.  These are examples of my desire to remove unnecessary controls on local authorities.  I will shortly be proposing draft regulations under the Local Government Act, 1991, for the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas, to remove certain statutory controls which apply to local authority operations.  I hope, also, to be in a position to bring forward a new local government <Col N="1325" /> Bill which would confer broad new powers on local elected representatives, for example, to make by-laws dealing with matters of local concern and activities which are seen to cause nuisance or to be in need of regulation.  More specifically in the whole area of parking, traffic management, control and speed limits I see scope for a far greater local authority role and I will make a start in implementing this approach in the Road Traffic Bill now being drafted.</P>
    <P>All of this, of course, I am doing as somebody who, according to Deputy Gilmore, does not trust the local authorities. I said in my earlier contribution with regard to ministerial powers that only in exceptional cases do I see them being necessary.  The broad picture is that I trust the system.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to give powers that no other Minister before me gave and I will give more.  I have responsibilities under the Postal and Telecommunications Act, the Forestry Act, and so on, but my relationship with local authorities is different.  I also have responsibility to the taxpayer.  Between direct and indirect subsidies and contributions of one kind or another to local authorities, the national Exchequer, through the Government supplies over 70 per cent of their financial means.  In the case of other bodies under my aegis, I do not provide 70 per cent of the funding from the taxpayers' resources.  Clearly that relationship is different.</P>
    <P>I have the greatest of dependence on local authorities.  That is why, in broad measure, I am bringing in these provisions, with more to follow.  I do not want the notion to go abroad just because there are local authorities I would like to see step up their performance, in the same way as this country needs a stepping up in performance in so many other areas, that this is a slight on the system or on publicly elected members.  I do not accept that.  I am looking for excellence. I am going after it and I am providing the legal framework to achieve it.  Embodied in every Bill I have brought before this House over the past 12 months is the principle of devolution.</P>

We will be increasingly vigilant to ensure that he fulfils these fine statements he is making about devolving powers to local authorities and that he does not negate them by doing what he did in relation to the previous matter we discussed here.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 27, 37 and 39 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the currency crisis which began in September 1992 all members of the Exchange Rate Mechanism fulfilled their formal commitments to support the Irish pound in accordance with the rules of the mechanism.  During this period we, like other member states, pressed the German authorities on several occasions to reduce their interest rates.  German interest rates were high for domestic German reasons.  In our view their high levels were preventing a reduction in interest rates in other EC states.  They were also militating against a relaxation of tensions in the EMS, both because of their effect on the value of the Deutsche Mark and because the markets perceived <Col N="1328" /> high interest rates to be inappropriate for certain economies.</P>
    <P>The Government noted last week the intervention by central banks of other members of the ERM in support of the Danish currency, even though in some cases they were not obliged to do so under the ERM rules.  This intra-marginal intervention is helpful in managing a currency when it is under speculative attack.  It is allowed under the ERM rules but is at the discretion of the Central Banks concerned.</P>
    <P>Both intra-marginal support and the reduction in German interest rates would almost certainly have eased foreign exchange market tensions and would have been helpful to the Irish pound if they had occurred much earlier.  I am not convinced that they would have been adequate to avoid devaluation of the Irish pound if they had just occurred in the days immediately preceding the devaluation.</P>
    <P>However, Ireland does not control German monetary policy, and that pressure from many EC states as well as Ireland had failed to produce a reduction in German interest rates until last week. As regards intra-marginal intervention, this is one of the areas Ireland has explored in discussions on reform of the ERM.</P>
    <P>I do not consider that the recent use of intra-marginal intervention and the reduction of German interest rates should change my view that maintaining the Irish pound in the narrow band of the ERM is in the national interest.  Whatever our feelings about the past, it is a fact that both developments have contributed to an easing of foreign exchange market tensions in recent days and their appearance should also actually make it easier to maintain the Irish pound in the narrow band of the ERM.  Furthermore, the new spirit of co-operation in defending ERM currencies evidenced by intra-marginal intervention is to be welcomed and I hope that, even in advance of any formal changes in the ERM rules, this type of co-operation will continue to be a feature if it is needed.  Finally, the events last week have not in my view eliminated <Col N="1329" /> the advantage to Ireland of keeping our currency in the ERM's narrow band.  This policy has conferred significant benefits on us in the past and it offers the best prospects of monetary stability now also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Would the Minister consider that the preferential treatment by the Bundesbank and central banks of other EMS countries towards the Danish krone was a comment on the ineligibility of our currency to remain within the ERM?  Is he aware that there is a widespread belief now that, even though he has succeeded in maintaining our position within the narrow band, participation in the ERM in the wider band might be more appropriate; and if he would outline the policy considerations which cause the Government to reject this option?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe we were the only ones rejected.  The Danes were rejected earlier.  Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain and Portugal were also rejected at earlier periods.  We held the bottom of the band for a long period.  We were mainly at the bottom but interspersed with the Danish krone or the French franc.  The Danish krone was under severe pressure during Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of last week.  It had been reported widely that they would take some action and it is not for me to speculate on what kind of action they would have taken, but the pressure of that, the fact that the pay policy agreement in Germany was signed last week and the fact that all member states were concerned about the future of the system led all those things to happen, but the intra-marginal relief which was offered to us at the very last moment was far too late.  We had been seeking it for several months.  I am not sure if the other countries which fell out of the system or devalued sought it, but there were wider band countries; two are still in the system Spain and Portugal.  While it was regettable that we did not get it in time &mdash; certainly it would have been useful &mdash; but on its own it probably would not have been enough.  The cut in German rates <Col N="1330" /> was also necessary.  I would have to say that, even at that, the Deputy will be aware that the Danish rates today are still well in excess of 20 per cent, so it is hard to know what would have happened if these things had occurred earlier.  I am not certain that they would have relieved all the problems.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Thank you.  I take it from the Minister's speech yesterday that he would agree that Irish interest rates will be subject to a premium now because of devaluation.  Would the Minister indicate how he sees Irish interest rates going for the remainder of the year and what kind of differential does he expect between German rates and Irish rates to be in place, say, by the late autumn?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in his analysis of what I said yesterday. Last June we were within ¼ per cent on the differential, that is, ¼ per cent as against the 1 per cent that the Bonn market was charging.  I always said that when we devalued one of the major disadvantages was that we put a premium on rates.</P>
      <P>That premium was, for several years following the 1986 devaluation, 1 per cent.  We made a strong effort to hold parity.  Sterling was perceived to be the major market difficulty and was seen to be the issue that probably finally broke our will.  Naturally, we will continue to review our monetary policy and the position would be to hold it and make the necessary changes and adjustments to hold that line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On interest rates, the premium rate should be of the order of 1 per cent.  We have to get it back to about 1 per cent.  I believe that to bring it under 1 per cent would not be possible, certainly in the <Col N="1331" /> short term or even in the foreseeable future, taken that the 1986 position lasted seven years.  I will not argue for under 1 per cent.  We must first try to get back to the position of last September, which is hopefully what the various unwinding of the pre-devaluation period should give us fairly shortly.  We are not quite on that yet.  It is still over 13¾, but I hope to see it unwind back to the pre-September position between now and the autumn.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The submission from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, to which the Deputy refers, was made in confidence. I am not prepared to give any particulars about this submission or to disclose whether any particular company was named.  I do not intend to take any further <Col N="1332" /> action on foot of the information provided by Congress.</P>
    <P>I am not aware that officials of my Department were subjected to the pressure to which the Deputy refers.  As the Deputy is aware, there is regular contact between the Department and the financial sector in the interest of good management of our financial affairs.  No official of the Department has indicated to me that there were pressures of the type to which the Deputy refers from any financial institution in relation to Government policy on the exchange rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister has said is a very comprehensive answer in terms of rejecting charges on the record publicly made by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and by its secretary-general. Does the Minister believe that we can draw the lesson from the nature of his response to the ICTU contribution to the debate at a crucial stage that perhaps the debate got overheated and highly intolerant and it is not conducive to good public policy making or debate to have that happen?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing further to say about the Congress of Trade Unions involvement, but I suppose it would be the understatement of the year to say that the debate did not get overheated at times and that rumour did not build up on rumour.  One of the things I learned from it is that political rumour mongering is nothing when it comes to financial rumour mongering.  Anything can be said and it goes as part of the game regardless of how serious it may be.  My officials are always dealing with financial institutions. They are not always amicable, particularly over a period like the last few months.  The general lessons of the issue are being analysed in the Department and elsewhere and hopefully the experience will lead to stronger policy in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>Between the end of August 1992 and the end of December 1992, the last date for which published figures are available, the external reserves fell by nearly £940 million, despite offsetting factors, including an upward valuation change of £71 million in December and net Exchequer foreign borrowing of about £1,070 million in that period.  This left the level of official external reserves at £2,113 million at the end of 1992.  In addition to this reduction in the level of the external reserves the Central Bank incurred liabilities to the European Monetary Co-operation Fund in respect of certain interventions to support the Irish pound. At the end of December, this liability amounted to £716 million, compared to nil in August.  These figures exclude any foreign exchange swaps the Central Bank may have arranged; information on such swaps has not been published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to inflation, the average <Col N="1334" /> increase in the consumer price index will be of the order of 3½ per cent compared with 1992.  Exclusive of interest rate developments &mdash; the basis used to measure price changes in most countries &mdash; the prospect is closer to 3 per cent.  I would point out that it will return the annual inflation level to about the level we had anticipated before the turmoil in September.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, in the period of turmoil there were some Irish firms which took positions which did not support the currency. Some firms acted from the desire to manage their resources prudently and protect themselves from currency fluctuations. This was undoubtedly one factor in the pressure which built up on the Irish pound.  The ICTU report referred to by the Deputy was submitted in confidence and I am not prepared to give any particulars about this submission nor do I intend to take any further action.</P>
    <P>I have noted the comments about speculation made by the Governor of the Central Bank.  My own view is that I would welcome some regulation to prevent excessive speculation internationally. However, given the integration of the markets worldwide, any moves would have to be supported by the major countries and require international agreement.  We can only exert a small influence on the markets.  I will be raising this issue in the discussion at the Council of Ministers when the report of the Monetary Committee on the EMS and the currency turmoil is presented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the fact that information on foreign exchange currency swaps are excluded mean we will not get that information at any time?  Does the Minister consider that it is sufficient to say that he does not purport to make any comment on the list of alleged speculators submitted by the ICTU and whether it is good enough to let it lie at that?  Thirdly, may I ask him whether he thinks that the experienece of the last few months may not well recur, especially since we have no control over the direction of sterling, and whether he intends to take any initiative concerning the <Col N="1335" /> reform of the ERM and, specifically, if he will comment on the suggestion by the Governor of the Central Bank that some form of tax on pure speculation should be instituted at a European level to help deter the experience we have all been through?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The swaps are not published. When the annual reports come out they give some data; but the swaps or dealings between the Central Banks are normally, but not exclusively, not published.  They would not in the normal course change the figures.  The major figures are those that I have given.  I do not have the swap figures.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, as I said to Deputy Cox, I have examined this matter and I do not intend to do any more about it.  With regard to speculation, there is an ongoing review in the Department of what happened and the various transactions that took place.  I take a different view on that.  We will shortly be talking to the Central Bank and others about the transactions. There are things that can be put in operation.  The Department of Finance, contrary to the perceived view, got considerable outside advice not only from the business, banking and financial community within Ireland but they also brought in experts from the European Community over last autumn.  They looked at and suggested many initiatives which I believe would be very helpful in the future.  I assure the House and the Deputy that I will leave no stone unturned in analysing the events.  I do not think anybody could say at the moment what the policy is in relation to sterling and I will not attempt to do so.  We must be very careful.  It is obvious that sterling has weakened.  There is still uncertainty about whether they are following a policy of reducing interest rates, holding them or increasing them.  The volatility in the markets will continue as long as that is the position.  We are, on an ongoing basis, looking at our policies and the lessons we can learn from what has happened.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is, of course, aware of the devaluation of the Irish currency within the European Exchange Rate Mechanism since this question was tabled.  This measure has resulted in a sharp fall in interbank interest rates.  Larger business borrowers and those businesses whose borrowings are related to interbank interest rates are already benefiting considerably from this trend and the threat of further increases in the general level of mortgage rates has receded.  Over the course of the year it is hoped that interbank rates, both at home and elsewhere in Europe, will ease further and this should allow scope for a reduction in retail interest and mortgage rates from present levels.  The Government will continue to press the case for further interest rate reductions, in particular in Germany, at every suitable opportunity.  It will also seek to advance the development of the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System so as to ensure that it will be in a position to cope effectively in the future with crises of the kind experienced over recent months.</P>

      <P>In view of the severity of the crisis in which this country has been plunged over the past number of months, would the Minister not consider it expedient to initiate on emergency meeting with his colleagues in the Council of Ministers with a view to ensuring that there is no recurrence?  Would the Minister not agree that it is now timely to put in place measures which will ensure that <Col N="1337" /> there is no possibility of a recurrence of this crisis?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish I could.  We have three main opportunities of raising this issue and trying to make further changes in the system.  There is an ongoing review.  Governments and Central Banks have a report which will be available shortly.  I believe the monetary committee almost finalised their work yesterday and the ECOFIN council at the March meeting will discuss the matter again.  It is hoped that by May the necessary reforms of the system can be dealt with.</P>
      <P>There are other matters which I mentioned yesterday.  Though a country may not be in the ERM they are not out of the EMS and countries have obligations within the EMS which it is very important they should fulfil.  One of those obligations is to take into account countries that are affected by your policies.  There are many issues in that area that should be dealt with which, quite frankly, are being ignored at present.  We put all these issues forward in the technical working groups.  I put them forward at the last ECOFIN council meeting and at an ECOFIN council meeting that coincided with the Edinburgh Summit.  In the drafting of the final report Deputies can be assured that we will continue to push for these reforms.  Practically every country within the system, bar one or two, is seeking reform.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick-East):</i> In reply to a supplementary question on interest rates, the Minister indicated that he expected a premium of about 1 per cent to apply as a result of devaluation.  I also asked him what the differential would be between Irish rates and German rates.  I take it it will be far more than 1 per cent and we are talking about 1 per cent on top of a differential.  Could the Minister indicate what the differential is now?  Am I right in thinking that it is about 8 per cent and that the Minister is predicting a differential of 3 to 3.5 per cent when things settle down as the year goes by?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The differential today would not be as high as that.  We are talking about a 14.5:9 position.  At our best we got back to a quarter.  If we got back to normality I believe it would be 1 per cent plus.  The Deputy probably noticed today that the National Treasury Management Agency in its first deal since devaluation yesterday got an extraordinarily competitive deal from Deutschebank which would be perceived in the markets as the key bank of the six in Frankfurt.  That would give heart, but I would have to be frank and say that a differential of anything under 1 per cent has never been suggested to me as attainable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that as long as monetary instability lasts in the European currency markets the interest rate problem will not go away because, in the absence of exchange controls, resort to their use shows weakness that becomes an immediate signal to the market that is negative and, in the alternative, we really have no other policy instrument?  Does the Minister have any view of alternative policy instruments that might take the pressure off the interest rate as being the only response to currency crisis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Domestically we have a problem to stabilise the September position which was 13.5 to 13.75 and then to unfold that.  That is a domestic consideration we have to try to handle.  After that we are looking at the international position.  We must look beyond sterling. The House agreed yesterday that the concept of linking our currency with sterling is all on the down side.  Italy's position justifies the Deputy's analysis.  Italy is a member of the G7 although it has lost all of its reserves, like the UK and France. It is extraordinary that three of the strongest countries in the world and members of G7 have lost their reserves totally. An examination of interest rates in those countries shows that Italy is still somewhere in the margins of 12 per cent; Spain after two devaluations, is not much less; Belgium is moving away from them, <Col N="1339" /> which indicates the pressures in the system.  I agree with what Deputy Noonan said yesterday about Belgium.  I would like to be able to say today that the pressures are moving away and that we have found corrective action but that is not the reality.  The factors still to come are the general election in France in March, on 18 May the vote in Denmark and later in the year, the UK position. All that comes within an 11-month period when we are meant to be moving towards setting up the forerunner of the European Central Bank.  Nobody is talking at European meetings about the economic and monetary institute which was to start on 1 January.  Deputy Cox has spoken about this many times.  All these matters are of great concern on the international front.  We have to deal with the problem of getting to the September position on the domestic side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the problems facing the Community in relation to the exchange rate difficulties and the wide gap between interest rates in different parts of the Community is damaging the principle of European union and makes a total farce of the effort to have competition throughout the Community?  Would he agree that countries cannot compete on a fair basis if there is a wide gap between interest rates and exchange rates?  Could he tell us what he and his colleagues intend doing to ensure that there is fair competition within Europe, particularly in light of the single European market that came into being on 1 January?  Would he also tell us what proposals he and his Government have to deal with the reality that 30 per cent of our trade is with Britain?  Despite the fact that we do not want to be linked to sterling, the reality is that Irish business will fail unless something is done in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked several questions.  Regarding markets, the French do 40 per cent of their trade with countries that have devalued; the Danes do 16 per cent of their trade with the <Col N="1340" /> United Kingdom and, if one adds in the Nordic countries, they would have a far higher percentage than us.  As a country we should not over exaggerate the position. Like most other countries we have compiled with the Single Market obligations. This year our budgetary position has worsened considerably because we did away with VAT at the point of entry and the £200 million cash flow that involves and the DIRT retention tax which is a loss of £90 million.  That was done in order to follow the criteria laid down to give us economic and monetary union.  That is the convergence programme. We put our convergence programme through the full rigours of the European Community last summer and we got a clean bill of health.  The clean bill of health lasted for a considerable time but it is not so clean now.  I suppose we did not have to do some of the things other countries did but at least we are able to stay within the narrow bands and are in the system.  The convergence programme is the mechanism to try to ensure that we move to this position in an orderly way both on exchange rate, interest rate and other economic policies.</P>
      <P>Every political party in this country &mdash; and certainly the Government &mdash; believes in economic and monetary union.  It was going extremely well until last summer. There are now issues that will have to be addressed.  President Delors and Vice-President Christophersen and others made that clear this week.  I have already answered what we have to achieve in the short term for Irish business.</P>

      <P>Deputy Durkan's question was designed to see what could be done in terms of alleviating the burden on business and mortgage holders.  May I ask the Minister a question about the inflation side of that coin?  Did I understand the Minister to say in response to the priority question that he estimated the impact of devaluation on the pound to bring us back to the September situation? What will the impact on inflation be this year and in a full year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the currency <Col N="1341" /> crisis when we were looking at the 1993 position it was about 3.25 per cent.  The Deputy will appreciate we did not have all the factors of outturns last July or August for 1992.  This was the model during the year.  This was the model during the year for looking at the projected position for 1993.  After continuing on from September the decline was, firstly, to about 2.5 per cent, then under 2 per cent and latest indications would be somewhere in the region of 1.5 per cent.  Economic commentators and the Government would have agreed with that figure.  Following devaluation it is somewhere in the order of 3 per cent.  We are still working on that and in the normal tradition for budget day, I would announce the Government's projection for the year, but it is somewhere in the order of 3 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister see any scope for an immediate measure to try to bring down our interest rates to raise additional borrowings, particularly in sterling where the rates are exceptionally competitive &mdash; 6 per cent rates &mdash; and where the currency tends to be at a discount with the expectation of a decline in the value of the currency? Would he see that form of borrowing as offering him scope, through his own borrowing policy, to drive down interest rates in the domestic market?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We followed that policy to drive down interest rates by borrowings, as I replied to Deputy Noonan a few moments ago.  The NTMA were looking at bond issues and other issues, not in sterling, but it is a moving target and very few people will take that chance at present.  There are other currencies, the Swiss franc and the Deutsche Mark, in which we got very attractive rates. In recent months we have not used US dollars, we have borrowed in Deutsche Marks or Swiss francs.</P>

Does the Minister believe that this is a valid suggestion to be pursued in terms of Ireland's domestic policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Peter Sutherland's paper was very detailed.  To comment on one aspect would be very unfair. There is a lot of work to be done before this can happen.  I referred earlier to the Economic Monetary Institute.  Is that going to commence on 1 January?  I assume it is and I referred to the work that will be involved before we have a European Central Bank.  As far as our policy is concerned we wish to be on &mdash; that term which I do not like &mdash;&ldquo;the fast track&rdquo;.  We wish to be part of the group going forward; we wish to continue to converge our economy in line with the guidelines which are set down.  I would not like to speculate on precisely how long it will take the Community to achieve that, or what policy objectives will be set out.  I said last summer, before <Col N="1343" /> the crisis, that a great amount of work had to be done to reach the 1999 target with which the Deputy is familiar.  There are two targets in the Maastricht Treaty, which does not start till next January, if everybody ratifies it.  One is if the majority of countries are available in 1997 it will start, or if not a minority will start anyway in 1999.  There are not too many speeches made about that timetable these days and we will have to wait to see.</P>

    <P>Details of the Government's 1993 allocations of national lottery funds will be set out in the forthcoming abridged volume of the Estimates for Public Services. The national lottery appendix in that volume summarises the expenditure for national lottery-funded programmes <Col N="1344" /> across all Government Departments.  It would not be appropriate to answer questions on specific schemes in advance of the publication of the Government's proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Government taken action to ensure that voluntary groups who are providing essential services, which all of us would want to see funded permanently, should not be dependent on arbitrary allocations from the lottery.  Could I ask her further if the Government accepts that greater priority in the allocation of national lottery funds should go to health, as has been the almost universal wish of the public when surveyed on this subject?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that when this national lottery was set up it was not money that belonged to the Government?  It was a clear decision that the lottery would be set up for given purposes and there is a Government decision in relation to the setting up of the lottery.  One was that 50 per cent would go to sport and recreation, another percentage would go to the promotion of the Irish language and the remainder would go to the health services to compensate voluntary organisations who, because of the introduction of the national lottery, would lose out on their own fund raising activites.  Therefore, for the Minister of State to say we should wait for the Book of Estimates is not answering the question.  The question is: is this Government making a policy decision that a certain percentage of the national lottery funds will be allocated to sport and recreation, another percentage to the promotion of the Irish language and culture and the arts, and the remainder <Col N="1345" /> to the health services?  The Government either has a policy or it has not.</P>

      <P>The question which the Deputy asked was in relation to the plans to allocate the funds.  Those plans will be revealed on the 17th when the Book of Estimates will be published.  At that stage the Deputy will be in a position to question the individual Ministers concerned in relation to the policy proposals in their own areas.  He will be able to ask all the questions, which I know he is dying to ask, in relation to Government policies in the health areas in respect of voluntary bodies, and so on.

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State consider adopting a new approach in view of the high level of concern about the way lottery funding has been allocated in the past?  Would the Minister consider allocating that responsibility to <Col N="1346" /> local authorities where there would be less danger of abuse?  There would also be an opportunity to prioritise projects within a particular locality and to enable public accountability at local level.  I wonder if it would be possible in a case like this to apply the principle of subsidiarity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern that the allocation of funds from the lottery would be very transparent and the procedures absolutely above board.  The criteria by which any organisation would receive lottery funding would be very clear.  The reality has been in the last couple of years in relation to amenity grants, which I think are grants the Deputy is referring to, and which the Deputy wants to be spent by local authorities, that the funding in this area has been in respect of projects to which there were commitments given a number of years ago.  We were talking last year about carry-over funding and if and when new funding becomes available it may well be appropriate to look at the mechanisms by which these funds are distributed.</P>

It was to obtain an opportunity to push the Minister's thinking in a particular direction in the way this money would be seen to be transparent on the one hand and go to services of recognised priority.</P>

      <P>The Government was <Col N="1349" /> very much aware of the situation of mortgage holders and other borrowers in deciding to devalue the Irish pound within the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.  Since then wholesale interest rates have fallen sharply.  As a result the threat of further increases in the general level of mortgage rates has receded.

      <Quest>the assessment, if any, he has made of the financial implication for Ireland of the failure of Switzerland to ratify the European Economic Area Agreement in view of the fact that Switzerland accounted for almost 28 per cent of the total proposed Cohesion Fund, from which Ireland would be a key beneficiary.</Quest>

      <P>It is not possible at <Col N="1350" /> this stage to determine whether the non-ratification by Switzerland of the European Area Agreement has any financial implications for Ireland.  Discussions will commence shortly between the European Community and the other EFTA countries concerned with a view to bringing the European Economic Area Agreement into operation as speedily as possible.  These discussions will also consider whether any technical modifications to the agreement are required in the light of Switzerland's non-ratification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain why no assessment can be made when it is clear that Switzerland was due to contribute 28 per cent of the total value of the Cohesion Fund, which consists of 1,500 million ECUs?  Clearly, as one of the cohesion countries, there must be some basis on which we can assess its implication?  Secondly, will the Irish Government insist that that loss be made good by the other EFTA countries or will we be prepared to write it off?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We certainly will not be prepared to write it off.  The stance we are taking in the negotiations and discussions that are proceeding is on the basis that we expect the loss to be made good by the other EFTA countries.  As the Deputy will appreciate, it was only on 6 December that the Swiss decided in a referendum not to take part in this agreement.  As the Deputy says, Switzerland's share of the contributions to the fund was set at 28 per cent, although this is not explicit in the text of the agreement. There is that scope for maneouvre and discussion.  The General Affairs Council of Ministers, at its meeting on 1 February, mandated the EC Commission to enter into discussions with the remaining EFTA countries with a view to drawing up an agreement on the implementation of the EA agreement. Those discussions have only commenced.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept, on the basis of the proposition she has advanced that we would expect other EFTA member states to make up the <Col N="1351" /> loss, that it logically follows that the Irish Government's position would be to refuse to bring an instrument of ratification back to this House to allow the European Economic Area to proceed unless that loss is made good?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have explained to the Deputy, the developments in this area are very recent, the European Council of Ministers has taken a position and negotiations have commenced in the last week.  It would be appropriate to wait for the outcome of those discussions before coming to any conclusions one way or the other.  Those will be very carefully considered by the Department. Obviously, the benefits of a mutual market area are of great benefit to the EFTA countries and with that in mind this cohesion money is coming to us.  Our position at present is that if on the EFTA side one country has pulled out, that is EFTA's problem. Obviously, the details will have to be teased out in discussion and, if there are modifications, the Deputy may be quite sure that those negotiating for Ireland will have Ireland's national interest very much to the fore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 38, 69 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the decrease in employment in the bakery industry in recent years.  I am also aware of the views of the Flour Confectionery and Bakers' Association that this decline is attributable to the 21 per cent rate of VAT on flour confectionery and biscuits.  However, studies by the sectoral development committee (1990) and the IDA (1987) both highlight a heavy over-capacity in the industry, particularly in the bread baking sector, and indicate that the closures are part of a rationalisation process for a more efficient, market-led industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out that bread is zero-rated for VAT and that the standard rate <Col N="1353" /> of VAT applies to all flour confectionery and biscuits sold in this country, irrespective of country of origin.  Similarly, cakes and biscuits produced in the State and sold in the North are liable to the rate of VAT pertaining there, generally the zero rate.  Thus, the VAT treatment is of no relevance to purchasing patterns at trade level; this will reflect consumer preference and relative cost competitiveness at the production level.</P>
    <P>Application of the zero rate to flour confectionery and non-chocolate biscuits, that is parity of treatment with Northern Ireland, would give rise to a substantial loss in revenue and, accordingly, consideration of any such measure can be carried out only in the context of the normal budgetary process.  Deputies will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to detail my budgetary plans at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if he agrees that this industry is in a state of crisis and that there is a serious threat to large numbers of people employed in the industry?  Can the Minister give any assurance to the employees in this industry, which has formed a very valuable part of local economy throughout the country, that the Government is concerned about the position and is planning to take some action to alleviate the stress confronting the families whose wage earners were and are employed in this industry?  Finally, could the Minister give us his Department's estimates of the job losses so far, and the potential job losses because of the current situation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the points the Deputy is making about the industry. In a previous ministry I spent a lot of time dealing with this industry for one reason or another.  Employment has declined steadily in the bakery industry since the early eighties.  Unemployment stood at 5,350 last year as compared to 9,390 in 1980, which is a loss of just under 3,950 jobs.  The closures and job losses reflect the process of ongoing rationalisation which is taking place all over the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It has gone on for 12 years.  It has been looked at in detail.  The sectoral development commitee report on the industry predicted that this trend would continue, that the industry was too fragmented and inefficient, there was a change in consumers' tastes and their purchasing powers away from what tended to be the small craft bakery into other areas.  Details in both reports are more or less the same.  When the zero rating for VAT purposes was introduced for food generally, which included bread, it took that into account.  That has been maintained since.  The food subsidies were removed some years ago but there is still a zero rate for bread.  I have seen some of the arguments and know the industry is going through a difficult time, but that is not because of the VAT position. Products exported to the North, or elsewhere, will be sold there at the rate of VAT in that location; that would be a zero rate in Northern Ireland.  If there are products coming in here from the North they will be sold at 21 per cent.  I am not talking about bread but about chocolate biscuits, non-chocolate biscuits and other confectionery.</P>
      <P>Last year this and other industries were worrying about imports from the North and they asked us to bring in the new VAT regime to make sure that those companies were registered for VAT, and that was done.  Any bakeries bringing in products here must charge and register for Irish VAT, subject to the turnover limits that apply to Irish traders.  Those figures are small for foreign-based bakeries which do not have a presence here but a supply goes to the State under the distant selling arrangements which I understand, from letters from the bakery industry and Deputy Molloy's questions, are required to charge VAT once their sales in the State exceed £27,000.  That is lower than the normal registration limit.  That was something we brought in in the 1992 Finance Bill to try to stop those kinds of imports.</P>

You cannot take flour confectionery or the non-chocolate biscuits on their own, you have to look at the other standard rate food items.  You are talking about a huge amount of Exchequer money.  I have told the industry that we will look at some of the issues raised by them.  However, the kind of money involved is excessive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Some 230 projects have been approved for the International Financial Services Centre to date.  These projects involve about 170 companies and 26 of these companies are currently located in the Custom House Docks area.  A further 19 companies have entered into specific commitments to take up accommodation in the area and additional companies have made substantial progress towards agreement on relocation.  These companies are among the most significant of the IFSC-approved companies both in terms of their size and office space requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible for all approved companies to locate in the Custom House Docks area at present, as four of the five <Col N="1356" /> current buildings in the area are fully let, and the fifth is in process of being let. Because development of the site is still ongoing, many of the companies have had to enter into short leases for accommodation outside the area.  In recognition of this position, a condition is included in the tax certificates issued to companies requiring them to locate in the area as soon as suitable space becomes available.</P>
    <P>It is hoped to commence construction of a further building in the area shortly, much of which is already pre-let.  I intend to maintain pressure on companies to honour the commitment in their tax certificates to relocate to the docks area in so far as it is possible for them to do at present.  I am confident that this will result in the completion of the letting of the final block and in the completion of the pre-letting programme for the Harbour Master 3 building.</P>
    <P>The projects approved for the International Financial Services Centre are committed to creating over 3,200 new jobs on a phased basis.  About 1,300 jobs have already been filled, which is in accordance with the projects' agreed phasing programmes.  Some 415 of these jobs arise in the 26 companies which have so far located in the centre.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister if he considers that sufficient progress has been made in this area since last August, when he estimated that of the 138 approved, only something like 21 had taken up location there?  May I ask him if the special tax rate of 10 per cent applies even in circumstances where a company has refused to take up location there?  In respect of the Minister's comment on job creation, may I ask him how many of net new jobs, as distinct from jobs transferred from the high street have been created?  Finally, may I ask the Minister, having regard to the fact that the Germans are the main investors there, whether he has any view about the impact of devaluation on the future of the services centre?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in that last year we had considerable difficulty trying to get companies to relocate <Col N="1357" /> to the area.  It was unacceptably low, as I said in the House at that time.  I have just outlined that there has been a considerable improvement in the situation since late 1992.  We put considerable pressure on companies.  I have personally written a number of times to about 60 of the bigger companies that we targeted who will have the benefit of the 10 per cent tax and who did not appear to be making much effort to move in.  We had, at that stage, at least two of the buildings completely vacant and a good part of a third building.  We have reversed that position totally in the last number of months.  There is still some space in the last of the five buildings.  There are 19 companies negotiating with the owners of those buildings at the moment.  It looks as if they will all be filled.  The new master plan for the area is to be launched in about a month, for the continuation of the development, Harbour Master 3. One block in that is to start during 1993. It has been delayed somewhat.  It was meant to start at the beginning of 1993. That is almost totally pre-let because it was ridiculous to have companies who had no accommodation having to wait. The Dublin Docks Development Company and the developer have provided for leisure and residential facilities in the plan.  I have no reason to believe that any of the German companies have any difficulties.  It was not so much devaluation which caused them a problem but rather the double taxation agreements. Those difficultues have been sorted out since last autumn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister respond to my question about net new jobs?  May I ask the Minister if he does not think it anomalous that companies who did not locate in the centre and who are benefiting from the tax designation, especially if the situation is that companies who have been approved and for whom there is not room at the centre, are still benefiting from the special tax rate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason they are benefiting is that they are new jobs.  I do <Col N="1358" /> not have a figure for how many may have moved in.  The criteria used in the certificates is based on new jobs.  I assume, by and large, they are new jobs. If there is any change in that, that agreement is made at the time they discuss the certificates.  Sometimes what happens is that one company would manage a number of the certificates on behalf of individuals or the special investment products down there, and they are generally new jobs.  I agree with the Deputy. What was happening initially was that a number of the companies came into the city, took up office accommodation and made no attempt to move into the area designated.  Last autumn when I said we would have to move on the legislative powers we have to rescind those licences, which I will honour if they do not move in, has changed the position greatly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister comment on whether he believes there may be some relationship between the failure of companies to move into the centre and the very high price per square metre to find letting space within it?  Would he comment on whether he believes it makes sense to have in such a centre a pricing policy for space which runs at about three times the average price available for office space in Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever about existing space that argument will not arise in relation to the new space.  The original quoted figures have now been reduced several times.  Perhaps the prices that we quoted last spring were not realistic. The market took care of that also. Those prices have been substantially reduced in individual agreements.  For the new accommodation they have used a different pricing structure and have pre-let the sites even before the building commences. That is the sensible thing to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Approximately 74 per cent of the scheduled works on the River Boyle Catchment drainage scheme have been completed to date.  Due to a combination of circumstances outside the direct control of the Commissioners of Public Works, the cost of the scheme is running significantly over budget.  The future of the scheme is being reviewed urgently at present within this context, in consultation with the Department of Finance.  The possible implications of carrying out work in some environmentally sensitive areas is also being considered. Until such time as the review is completed and decisions are taken I can give no assurance that all of the scheduled work in the scheme will be undertaken.</P>
      <P>I am aware that progress on bridge works has fallen behind that on channel excavation and this situation is being taken into account in the review to which I have referred.  There are no proposals at present to recruit additional staff for this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give us an assurance that, when he talks about a complete review of the scheme, this does not represent a plan to wind the scheme up, which is echoed in my question? Would the Minister agree that part of the problem of over-spending goes back to the redundancies in this scheme in 1987 and 1988?  What is happening at present is that all the permanent staff are here, the supervisory people, etc., all the machinery is there and all these aspects are working to about half their efficiency, simply because the Minister does not have construction workers for bridges and so on.  The Minister did not give the <Col N="1360" /> figure but I understand the construction on this scheme is only 50 per cent complete while, as he states, the channel works are in excess of 70 per cent completed. I would like the Minister to address himself to the question I have raised as to what the review really means. There must be some idea within the Department whether that means a review for better or for worse.  Would the Minister not agree with me that efficiency could be greatly improved if we had more people there?  The inefficiencies to which he has indirectly referred are due to policies pursued by his Department in 1987 and 1988.</P>

Basically it is a full review of the scheme.  I am not going to anticipate the outcome of the review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to see this in the following context: does he realise that the existence of 500 farmers is at stake?  What we are talking about is an entire community clinging by its fingernails to existence.  In the event of the scheme being scrapped &mdash; and the Minister's tone is quite ominous &mdash; the option is emigration in the long term, as soon as the safety valve of emigration is opened, and the dole queue in the short term.  May I suggest to the Minister, within the context of the Cohesion and Structural Funds that there be a very definite examination of the possibility of including this for EC funding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the last point, I will investigate that for Deputy Higgins.  I am sorry if the Deputy is reading something into my reply and saying that there is something very ominous <Col N="1361" /> about the answer.  If you initiate a review of anything it would not be very fair to those involved in the review to come into this House and try to pre-empt whatever decisions they might take.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister to see this problem in the light of his own Government's stated policy to create jobs?  He will have on his desk, I understand from the managers of the scheme, a proposal that if 20 additional workers were taken on seasonally during the summer, the scheme could probably be wound up in two years.  If they were braver and took on 40 additional seasonal workers &mdash; and I emphasise seasonal workers &mdash; it would probably be wound up in one year.  There is good economy in employing workers on this scheme because it could be done efficiently.  The supervision is there so there will be no cost for supervision of additional work and the structures are there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Government is reviewing the figures on the growth rate, as the Deputy will appreciate, following the devaluation of the currency last Saturday week.  The economic projections are being revised in the light of the information.  For example, it is anticipated now that the unemployment figure will be somewhat less than had been envisaged in the original projections. Obviously the forecasts in relation to imports and exports, which were a central feature of economic forecasting, are being revised in the light of the changing economic circumstances in the budget speech.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I am staggered that there are no figures but I will not make any comment.  The EC, which probably has bigger problems doing sums, suggests that in 1993 the forecast growth rate for the Community at large will be only .075 per cent and it predicts, as a result, a further growth in unemployment in the EC.  By what means can the Minister come to this House and suggest to us that any reasonable projection for Ireland is likely to see unemployment decline rather than grow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that the original forecasts for 1993 which had been prepared in the Department of Finance have been adjusted in the light of the devaluation because that affects such items as imports and exports.  As the Deputy knows, exports account for roughly 70 per cent of demand in the Irish economy.  Those export figures and projections are being adjusted because of <Col N="1364" /> devaluation.  That adjustment currently means that the anticipated unemployment figure a month ago for 1993 is now lower.  The EC have again adjusted their own growth forecast downward and obviously the Department officials in preparing economic projects have to keep an eye on our trading partners' situation and build into our own projections adjustments based on adjustments made by our trading partners and other member states' projections.  The Deputy will appreciate that we are not dealing with something that can be written down on tablets of stone.  The whole picture has been, will continue to be assessed and will form part of the whole budget assessment process.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I waited with some trepidation for your verdict, Sir, in case this amendment might be declared to be out of order because it involves a charge.  I am glad to say, Sir, the Government promised to spend money that it does not yet have; it does not seem to constitute a charge on the Exchequer.  The purpose of the amendment is to try to tie the Government into getting on with the programme. On Committee Stage, the Minister felt it would be unreasonable to tie the Government in the way the amendment suggests.  He did, however, go on to say that the Government was committed to completing the programme but he did not say by when.  He spoke of a period of 12 to 15 years and doing all we could to reach the target.  This amendment is designed to encourage the Government to get to a measurable point on that road by the year 2010 &mdash; which is 15 years from now.  On Committee Stage, the Minister indicated that in 1987-88 the Department assessed the long term investment requirements for our main roads as being more than £3 billion.  In that context, setting a target of having 60 per cent of the programme done in 15 years time is, in all conscience, a modest enough one.  Because I understand the technicalities of these matters I know that <Col N="1415" /> the amendment, even if it were made, would have no force in law or constraint on the Minister, and therefore I do not intend to press it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 46:</P>
      <P>In page 21, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i) fufill a road safety role,</P>
      <P>(j) train local authority staff,</P>
      <P>(k) harmonise road markings on roads with those in member states of the European Community,</P>
      <P>(1) carry out tests on all soils and materials used in road construction,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to set out certain requirements more clearly than they are in the Bill.  The intention is to insert in section 19 a number of extra specific functions for the National Roads Authority in dealing with safety, with training local authority staff, harmonising road markings with those we find in other members states of the European Community and carrying out tests on soils and materials to be used in road construction.</P>
      <P>This matter was looked at to some extent on Committee Stage but I am not entirely happy that we will necessarily see all of it done, and that is not an accusation of ill-intent against the Minister.  What we wanted to do here was to emphasise certain aspects of what we believe the obligations of the authority should be.  There will be many opportunities for the Minister and for the authority to have regard to these matters.  If I could pick just one of them for a very brief comment it would be the matter of road markings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two problems here to which we would like the Minister and the Authority <Col N="1416" /> to give attention.  The first is the inadequacy of road marking generally, even on our national primary routes, to say nothing about the secondary roads and the county roads.  We spoke earlier about lighting.  There is also a grave danger &mdash; and many Deputies will know what I mean &mdash; that if you are travelling, particularly at night, you may come to a section of road that is not properly marked.  It is a very disorientating experience to go suddenly from a stretch of road that has nice clear white lines running down the middle, to a fairly wide section of road that has no markings at all on either side.  That is not uncommon. It is not uncommon on sections of roads that have recently been repaired because it seems to take some local authorities rather a long time to get around to putting down the road markings.</P>
    <P>That is difficult enough for people who are used to that situation, as most of us in this House are, but for tourists suddenly to find themselves on a stretch of tarmacadam that has no markings on it at all must be a rather frightening experience.  Added to the fact that quite often there are eccentricities in road building here it is not uncommon to find oneself coming over a rise and to find a bend just lurking on the other side of the rise, sometimes an unmarked bend. There is a very substantial case to be made for more attention to be paid to road marking.</P>
    <P>Another example I would give is one that I come across virtually every night, it is where the Naas by-pass at its western end now merges into the dual carriageway between the end of the by-pass and Newbridge.  You go from a stretch of road where markings are extremely good to a stretch of road where markings are very bad indeed.  Again, in wet weather particularly, or in foggy weather, that can be a danger so I ask the Minister to ensure that the Authority will pay proper attention to these points.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to bear in mind the question of harmonising road markings here with road markings in other member states of the European Community.  We are not the only ones <Col N="1417" /> who need to look at our practices in that regard.  Given the fact that we want to develop tourism to the maximum possible extent, the more we can do to ensure the road environment is as similar as possible to what people are used to in other member states the better it will be.  It is difficult enough for the average tourist coming here from anywhere, with the exception of the UK, to find himself or herself driving on the left hand side of the road without having to cope with a totally different set of road markings.  I know a lot of work is underway in that regard but I would ask the Minister and the Authority to pay particular attention to this and speed it up.  There was a great deal of discussion on Committee Stage about signs &mdash; that is not really what we have in mind here &mdash; and it is an area where the greatest possible commonality of approach would have benefits.</P>
    <P>Having said those things, Sir, I will ask the Minister to bring them to the notice of the Authority and I do not intend to press this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 48:</P>
      <P>In page 21, to delete lines 43 and 44, and in page 22, to delete lines 1 and 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision I am seeking to delete by this amendment is that at the bottom of page 21 and the top of page 22 of the Bill which states that the National Roads Authority shall not be liable for damage caused as a result of any failure to maintain a national road.  It seems that exposes the public in a rather unfair way, if the National Roads Authority fails to maintain a national road and nobody can hold it accountable for not doing so.  Many private citizens would wish they could be insulted in such a way against possible litigation and it puts the general public in a very unfair position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the National Roads Authority.  The National Roads Authority should be liable if there is an accident, or if somebody is in some <Col N="1418" /> way injured as a result of a failure on the part of the Authority to maintain the national roads properly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms. Keogh Ms. Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms. Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Gilmore.  I do not know if we seem to be straying from the idea of accountability if we include this section.  It does seem very straightforward that the Authority should be liable for damage that is caused as a result of their failure to maintain a national road.  The Minister earlier spoke about having standards of excellence, and rightly so.  I imagine the outcome here would be that people would not be striving for the excellence which he wants and we need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I might make a brief point on that.  This is an area which &mdash; I am sure the Minister is aware of this &mdash; has been the subject of some legal wrangling for quite some time.  Unless I am greatly mistaken, the only case of misfeasance which has been successfully taken has been against a road authority for apparently not having done its job properly.  I may be wrong about that, but I do not think so.  There is an enormous potential danger here and an injustice would be done by having the provision in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I know it is trite and banal &mdash; we hear it every day &mdash; to talk of the damage to motor vehicles caused by the condition of some of our roads.  It has got to the point where there is an enormous yawn when you talk about such damage.  If you take it further, you find that the dangers lying in wait for the motorist are much more diverse than that.  Indequate road markings, for example, can lead a motorist astray, sometimes with disastrous results; bad lighting and defects in the construction of a road can have the same effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all familiar with places where there are bends and where the camber has altered significantly, which can be very dangerous indeed.  That serves to underline the point that any public authority has a duty to the people who are using the facilities it provides.  I believe <Col N="1419" /> that in this House we should be very loath to give any kind of blanket exemption of the kind stated here.  The Minister may very well say that the responsibilities of road authorities which are in existence at the moment will continue, but that is not the point.  We are setting up a new authority that, in a sense, is a cap over all of them.  I would see a danger that if we exempt that overall body from any responsibility, others will argue that if they are acting on behalf of the National Roads Authority, or at its direction or, indeed, at the direction of the Minister under the sweeping powers that he is being given under this Act, they too can be exempt from any liability in this regard.  The Minister did not give any persuasive reasons on Committee Stage for this exemption so, unless he has a new reason, he should accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (4), which Deputy Gilmore's amendment opposes, applies the non-feasance immunity already available to local authorities to the National Roads Authority.  Local authorities are at present liable for damages in respect of misfeasance, that is where they negligently undertake work on a public road.  They are not, however, liable in respect of non-feasance, that is where they fail to maintain a road or to maintain it adequately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 60 of the Civil Liability Act, 1961, provided for the abolition of the immunity in respect of non-feasance. However, this section only comes into force when an order has been made by the Government.  The Government in recent years have considered the matter and decided that section 60 should not be brought into operation at present because our road network is not yet sufficiently developed to justify the imposition of an additional obligation on road authorities.  If section 60 were brought into force it would place an additional financial burden on local authorities in defending and meeting claims for damages for non-feasance.  This would divert resources from road development and <Col N="1420" /> simply result in a further deterioration in road conditions.  The question of bringing the section into force will be kept under constant review.</P>
    <P>In an ideal world that is the kind of provision we would all like to see in place because it has its own force &mdash; provided the resources were available &mdash; in terms of ensuring that everything we do on roads is adequate to meet the needs. However, we have to face the realities that the resources to do that on a very comprehensive basis throughout the country are not available to us.  If we were to do this it would only mean, in current financial constraints, that it would have to be at the expense of some other competing and equally deserving considerations.  For those reasons, I am unable to accept this amendment.  If we ever reach the stage &mdash; I hope we do &mdash; that we have the kind of resources that would give us a national network, which we could stand over and say is absolutely perfect and meets the needs, I do not know who will be standing here at that stage.</P>

      <P>The Minister has drawn some very fine legalistic distinctions in replying.  I believe the citizen who is injured or has his property damaged as a result of a failure on the part of the roads Authority to carry out work would not be too reassured by the kind of distinction the Minister has drawn.  This provision should not be included in the Bill and I believe the roads authority should take its chances before the courts like everybody else and should not be granted the kind of favourable treatment that this Bill proposes to give with regard to any possible case taken against it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 49:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1421" /> In page 22, line 5, after &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;not&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is an extremely important amendment. The provision in subsection (6) which I am seeking to amend is that works carried out by the National Roads Authority &ldquo;shall be exempted development for the purposes of the Planning Act, 1963&rdquo;.  In other words, the National Roads Authority will not have to apply for planning permission.  The question of public authorities being exempted from the requirement to apply for planning permission is a matter that has been debated widely both in this House and elsewhere and the view was very strongly taken by bodies like An Taisce, by many environmental organisations and by myself that public bodies should not enjoy a status in our planning laws which is different from that of private bodies. A public body wishing to carry out works should have to submit its works for planning permission in the normal way.  Perhaps if that were the case, we would not be faced as we come into the House every day with a picket from people who are concerned about what is happening in Mullaghmore or, perhaps later, people from Luggala or about the many issues like that which arise from time to time. These arise when public bodies proceed to do works and all they are required to do under the 1963 Act is, at best, consult in some kind of a general way with the planning authority, but they are not required to submit their plans for planning permission in the normal way, like everybody else.</P>
    <P>This Bill is providing for a situation where the major road developments in this country will be the responsibility of the National Roads Authority.  Functions that currently belong to local authorities will be transferred to the National Roads Authority: the ultimate functions in relation to the line of the road, its design and, in many cases, the actual carrying out of the work will be transferred to the National Roads Authority.</P>
    <P>According to this subsection, the National Roads Authority will not have to apply for planning permission to the local authority.  It will be regarded as <Col N="1422" /> exempted development.  This should not be the case.  In this Bill many of the safeguards the public have enjoyed up to now with regard to road proposals cannot be taken into account.  Ultimately the decision on road proposals was taken by the local roads authorities concerned and these authorities, acting through elected councillors, and responsive to the public, were able to take account of public concern.</P>
    <P>Because the local authority was the planning authority it was able to take account of the impact of road proposals on the planning and development of its own area.  Here we will have a situation where the National Roads Authority will be the body responsible.  Under his legislation it will not even have to comply with the terms of the local authority development plan.  At most, the NRA will have to take account of it.  If the road proposal is in breach of or at variance with the development plan there is a procedure whereby submissions will be made, but ultimately it will be the National Roads Authority who will make the decision.  It will not even have to go through the normal procedure for materially contravening or varying a development plan that any other development would have to undergo.</P>
    <P>Therefore, road proposals under this legislation will enjoy a form of exemption that no other work of its kind will enjoy. That is wrong and there should be a requirement for the National Roads Authority to submit their proposals for road development for planning permission. For that reason, I am proposing the deletion of the exempted development status afforded to the National Roads Authority from the legislation. The NRA should be required to apply for planning permission if it is proposing to build a road, motorway or whatever.</P>
    <P>Even though the Government have decided not to proceed with the eastern by-pass I see in today's newspapers that there is now a proposal for a tunnelled version of the eastern by-pass to come out under Sandymount and Booterstown.  If, for example, that proposal were to be proceeded with by the National Roads <Col N="1423" /> Authority there would be no requirement on the National Roads Authority to apply to Dublin Corporation for planning permission for it.  I think that is wrong and it should be remedied in the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment not only in the context of this Bill but in the context of the activities of public agencies generally.  As Deputy Gilmore has said, we find all too often that public agencies carrying out work which, if carried out by a private agency would need planning permission, do not require planning permission.  It is true that consultative processes exist and these are gone through solemnly in all the appropriate cases but one wonders sometimes whether they make the slightest difference. It is somewhat different in relation to roads.  It has been my experience &mdash; and I think that of many Members of this House &mdash; that the public hearings and inquiries that are held are in fact real exercises in consultation.  A party colleague of the Minister's in my own constituency lately said he felt that the public inquiry to be held into the Kildare by-pass would be a non-event. The Minister should speak to Councillor Ó Fearghail and put him right on this. They are worthwhile exercises.</P>
      <P>However, that does not take away from the central point.  We have public authorities who are allowed to carry out all kinds of development without being subject to the same kind of scrutiny that private agencies or individuals would be. We see the results of that in all kinds of ways.  Many public projects are very badly planned.  In the days when we built local authority houses &mdash; before the Minister's time, indeed, it is a long time since we built any decent number of local authority houses &mdash; all that was required was for the local authority to have an area zoned in its development plan for &ldquo;housing&rdquo;. There was no further specification than that required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the days when we had enlightened Ministers for the Environment, like Deputy Kavanagh, and substantial numbers of houses were being built, they <Col N="1424" /> simply built six, eight or ten houses to the acre, or whatever their standard was at the time.  We got very, very bad planning and that can be seen in local authority housing estates all over the country. In many cases we had bad planning in terms of the quality of the houses and even where the quality of the houses was good we had bad physical planning of the estates.  That was the direct result of the public agencies not having to undergo the same kind of scrutiny of their proposals as a private developer would.  No private developer would be allowed, even today, to build a number of houses in the same space as a local authority would without providing a minimum of amenities, a minimum frequently not provided by our local authorities when they are building houses.</P>
    <P>It is a dreadful reflection on the lack of confidence we have in our own ability to guide these events that we require private individuals, or even speculative builders who want to build a small number of houses, to conform to all kinds of criteria to avoid strip development, in some enlightened local authorities areas to build in clusters rather than in lines and yet we have no such specification for local authorities when they come to carry out the work.  It is not an argument to say, as the Minister said during Committee Stage debate, that it would be nonsense for a local authority to seek planning permission from itself.  Nobody would suggest that that is the way we should do it.  Clearly, we need another agency &mdash; and we already have the bones of it there &mdash; which could act in relation to public authorities in general in the State as the scrutinising body.  For example, we have Bord Pleanála which could quite easily have added into its remit the function of overseeing planning applications from public agencies or local authorities.  That should apply in the case of roads just as it should apply in the case of other kinds of development.</P>
    <P>In recent times we have seen the ill feeling provoked by the procedure we use now.  We have people, as Deputy Gilmore said, demonstrating outside the House about Mullaghmore.  Of course it <Col N="1425" /> can be quite properly observed that that project was brought through the consultative process with Clare County Council and that Clare County Council voted by a majority to agree to the proposal. But Clare County Council did not have any qualitative input into that, although it is the local planning authority. There is no sense in which Clare County Council was asked to give any kind of a qualitative view on whether or not there should be an interpretative centre and, if so, where and of what kind.  We are now left with people demonstrating outside this House at a mad, daft proposal from our Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to put a sculpture park on the ground already levelled in Mullaghmore. For God's sake what are we at?</P>
    <P>There is a very good case for having sculpture parks but the Minister knows as well as I do that if one sets out to put a sculpture park somewhere useful, where people could see it, one would not build it in the Burren at Mullaghmore. One might put it in Ennis, in Galway, Gort, Kilfenora or in Corofin but you would not go out into the middle of what should be an untouched wilderness below Mullaghmore to build a sculpture park. It seems that the daftness of the system we have engenders further daftness when some of our more high-minded Ministers get their hands on the process half-way through.  We have plenty of other examples of it.</P>
    <P>There is another bone of contention now being gnawed on in County Clare with a plan to build a 700-foot mast a few miles east of Loop Head, where there is a Loran C navigation system.  It would run into endless qualifications and demands for clarification from the local authority but this one is not getting that kind of treatment because the local authority does not have the authority even to raise the questions.  There will be a consultative process, but no qualitative decision will be affected from that process.</P>
    <P>The position is very much the same in relation to roads.  I spoke at some length on Second Stage about the very bad planning in relation to roads.  I do not think <Col N="1426" /> anybody on the Minister's side could argue that if we had started to plan a motorway from Newlands Cross to Portlaoise it would not take a very different route in some sections from the route we will now have with the Naas dual-carriageway, the Naas bypass, the Newbridge bypass, eventually the Kildare by pass and the Monasterevin bypass.  I am not criticising any of those designs, but because the work is being done piecemeal that road is going to snake around in a most improbable way, whereas if the whole project had been planned as one unit from the beginning we would get a much better result.  However, we would get a better result and one that the public could accept only if we had the same kind of invigilation of the whole planning process that the public rightly expects in the case of private sector developments.</P>
    <P>There are many comments that could be made in terms of the quality of decisions.</P>
    <P>The Kildare bypass, for example, will go through the middle of the biggest badger set for miles around where I live. I do not know how their habitat would rate in terms of the discussion that may take place at a public inquiry and it would be very unconvincing for the Minister to say that we will carry out an environmental impact assessment.  An environmental impact assessment may decide that the badgers must be uprooted but such an assessment is not one of quality. It is not what we intend to do when we solemnly transpose into our legislation European Community directives on those issues nor what we had the ambition to do when we passed the Environmental Protection Agency Act. We are getting bad planning because public authorities are not in the loop, they are not subject to the same invigilation as private interests and the same mistake is being perpetrated again in this Bill.  It is long past the time that we should have called a halt to this.</P>
    <P>The Minister on Committee Stage made the old argument that if the amendments being proposed here were conceded or if the concerns expressed were given way to, the local authorities would <Col N="1427" /> then be applying to themselves for planning permission for developments.  This would not be the case because it is clear that what we need is an agency who can invigilate local authorities in regard to assessing the quality and impact of their proposed developments.  It is not enough to say that they cannot be the judge and jury in their own cause.  We need a different judge and jury to judge what they are doing and it will not be achieved through the kind of mechanism proposed in this Bill, with which we are all too familiar in other areas of public agency activity.  The Minister in accepting this amendment could do far more in practical terms for the environment than will be achieved over the next five years by the Environmental Protection Agency Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. I have used the word &ldquo;accountability&rdquo; a number of times and we are back to this issue again.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes mentioned bad planning. If public bodies are not made accountable bad practice results.  We have had examples cited such as Mullaghmore, etc. As a public body any roads authority should be accountable and should go through the same process that private individuals and organisations must go through.  As members of local authorities we are very aware of this.  People ask why these public bodies are not accountable. I have been asked this question many times and I have no answer, except that I believe they should be accountable.  We should learn from the examples that have been cited already and we should ensure that these bodies are accountable.</P>
      <P>A point was made in relation to material contraventions.  Material contraventions of development plans were sewn in as a protective measure.  It is extraordinary that a public body can completely bypass that measure.  I have great pleasure in supporting this amendment.</P>

      <P>I would like to be as convinced as Deputy Dukes and others that the planning system operating throughout the country was producing <Col N="1428" /> good results.  Apart from financial constraints in relation to major local authority housing development, I am not satisfied that in the past we have taken broader concepts into consideration. Planning is just one of those considerations; others include whether we can provide homes which meet the changed social character of housing, how we can get a better mix and avoid social segregation and the single class type of estates, how roads are developed etc.</P>
      <P>I visited many local authority housing developments in Dublin and other parts of the country and I agree that they leave much to be desired but I would say much the same about ribbon development where planning permission was granted.  I would say very much the same also about decisions in relation to overall planning which has put stress on individuals, and on the transport system.  The best way to integrate that thinking, which not only takes planning into account but also the broader considerations, is to move the responsibility from the local authorities to the NRA.  This will provide a result based on a total integrated plan for the development of our roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all can give examples of what might have happened if the Naas bypass was forgotton about for years until such time as this legislation was in place.  We all are wiser after events.  We should, at times, pay tribute to people who &mdash; bearing in mind the circumstances of the time and planners etc &mdash; did the best they could, but there is not the same excuse for us. There is now much more information regarding how planning should be approached.  I have sympathy for the view that public authorities in circumstances where they look to have an advantage on planning should be accountable in the same way as private citizens and other private authorities.  I hope later this year to introduce a new planning Bill which will &mdash; I am not certain at this stage because a considerable amount of work must be done before its completion &mdash; go a long distance down the road to ensure a more coherent and transparent system with the same set of <Col N="1429" /> obligations applying to private citizens and public authorities, as far as possible.</P>
    <P>It is not fair to say that the NRA can ride roughshod and will not be accountable. The NRA will be a co-ordinating integrating authority, with the local authority in the main carrying out the works, and designing the road plans.  Ultimately the group should produce a design which takes account of the planning experience of that council.</P>
    <P>It is only in circumstances where the local authorities, for one reason or another, are unable to complete a design or work that the National Roads Authority will be more directly involved.  We should not try to impose a planning obligation on a local authority.  I note Deputy Dukes's point regarding an outside agency, but surely with the expertise in our corporations, county councils and management teams working on designs, we can expect those delivering the planning system to the public to take account of environmental considerations and other issues.  Some contributions cast doubt on the ability of local authorities to interpret the system, for example, the planning considerations for a road or housing development, how they are integrated and the environmental considerations, yet we place confidence in local authorities to make planning decisions in relation to all other matters.</P>

      <P>We are at the nub of the problem now.  The reasons for that and it happens very much in relation to housing &mdash; for which I have received much abuse &mdash; relate to refurbishment, renewal, derelict sites, and infill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In every village or town, there is a derelict area.  People do not know who owns those areas in many cases they would accommodate four or five houses or flats.  I know that Opposition Deputies are as concerned as I to achieve the right results in this regard, otherwise we will perpetuate some of the problems of the past for which I do not condemn anybody <Col N="1430" /> but for which I stand condemned.  I know from experience that is the wrong way and I am sure everybody in this House agrees on that.  There is a process we must go through which involves not having the straight line approach but one which takes account of the landscape.  Some changes have been made to the landscape, it changes over the centuries but some of its features must be protected. Sometimes we must modify systems and take account of the views of the people living in an area.  We must adopt a broader conceptual approach which not only deals with the road problem but also tries to overcome the repercussions or ill effects that might arise from such development.  When I introduce the new planning Bill we must consider how the evolution of a better overall plan could be achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>With due respect to the Minister I have rarely heard as contradictory a reply to an amendment as the contribution he has just delivered. He began by telling us that, effectively, we could not trust the planning system and cited ribbon development and so on in support of that.  He wound up by telling us that we should trust the people involved at local authority level in planning professional services and so on to do the right thing since they would, in effect, be carrying out the work on behalf of the National Roads Authority.</P>
      <P>The Minister is having a bad day on the question of local government; on a number of occasions he cast considerable doubt on its value and integrity.  It is quite inappropriate that the Minister for the Environment to whom we look to protect our system of local government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the problems in relation to planning here are more relevant to the Minister and his political party than to the professional planners charged with the responsibility of running our planning sytem.  Much of the ribbon development around the country has more to do with section 4 motions proposed and passed and local authorities around the country than with the decisions of professional planners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's word on that but he raised the question of ribbon development and I am telling him why it occurred.</P>
      <P>This is a critical amendment to the Bill.  Under the Bill the National Roads Authority may ask or direct a local authority to do work on its behalf.  If the local authority does not do it the National Roads Authority can proceed to do it anyway.  We all know that road proposals give rise to considerable controversy, public unease and worry on the part of the public.  A road going through or near anybody's area, property or dwelling is a major factor in any description of development.  As it stands the National Roads Authority will be able to proceed with a development of that type, with the design and building of a major road, perhaps even a motorway, without having to apply for planning permission &mdash; without having to subject their plans to public scrutiny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The planning system is not perfect, but it is the best we have and is much better than not having a system for subjecting what the National Roads Authority may want to do to public scrutiny.  At the very <Col N="1432" /> minimum the National Roads Authority should be subject to the requirement to apply for planning permission, put its plans on public display so that people may examine them and enable a local authority, An Bord Pleanála or another body to make a decision having heard the views of the public and various interests. If it does not have to do that, as proposed in this Bill, then it is being given <i>carte blanche</i> to make decisions without scrutiny, hindrance, approval or authority from any outside body.  Nobody else in this State is given that kind of authority, particularly in an area that will affect so many people.  This is a critically important amendment to this legislation and I hope even at this late stage that the Minister will change his mind.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the issues dealt with in the Bill by making it clear that there are limits in relation to the valuations that can be put on land acquired for the purpose of this Bill.  We have proposed that the value fixed by the Valuation Office should be the one we would use here.  Since that is <Col N="1435" /> an agency of the State already in place and widely accepted, its decisions would not be subject to any great degree of contention.  Of course I am aware, Sir, that on the Committee Stage the Minister did not see the need to specify the matter in this way, but I think he might agree that the less room there is for contention the more smoothly the procedure will work.  The Minister is aware that I have gave reservations about the whole procedure and we should make it as uncontentious as we can.</P>

I have proposed an amendment to section 19 of the Third Schedule which will ensure that the NRA will always require an independent valuation.  I explained that I did not want the valuation tied in any extreme way to valuation by the Valuation Office notwithstanding its expertise.  There could be circumstances where because something was restricted a valuation was somewhat higher, but we will now have an independent valuation for any circumstances that may arise.  That meets the general point made at the committee and the one Deputy Dukes is making now.</P>

      <P>I wish to bring to the attention of the House and to the Minister the necessity of financial assistance for a traditional industry in County Donegal.  In December of this year we had an inordinate amount of rain and <Col N="1437" /> as a consequence almost all of our seed potato industry has been lost.  For example, we have lost 1,116 hectares of certified seed potatoes worth in the region of £3.75 million and 913 hectares of ware potatoes worth approximately £2.53 million.  Overall £6.28 million worth of seed potatoes have been lost in County Donegal.  This has affected not only the growers and their families but all other agri-business associated with the potato industry in the county.  It is not only of consequence to the county but nationally also because we have the proud record of being a tremendous exporter of seed potato and as a result of this damage we will lose our edge in the export trade.  Unfortunately, other countries, especially Scotland, will be able to take over our markets.  We will also lose to our two processing industries in the county, the chip potato factory and Sam Spud.  They will be forced to import potatoes resulting in increased costs and this will have an adverse effect on our national industry.</P>
      <P>I know the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is aware of the problem, as is the Department of Finance and the Taoiseach.  However, the season for the planting of potatoes is now starting but we will not be able to start this year and the farmers are getting anxious that they are losing out in an industry which is so important to them.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry has lobbied the European Commission in relation to obtaining moneys from a disaster fund.  I am asking the Department to put their full weight into obtaining moneys under the Structural Funds and have moneys reallocated under the Community Support Framework.  It is imperative that a very strong case be made because we in County Donegal cannot wait any longer for an £18 million industry and over 500 jobs to be saved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Coughlan for sharing her time with me.  I do not intend to be repetitive.  Deputy Coughlan has stated the statistics and facts of the matter.  An extremely serious problem exists with the seed potato industry in <Col N="1438" /> Donegal.  We are highlighting this point now and, as Deputy Coughlan said, the Ministers and the Departments of Finance and Agriculture, Food and Forestry are fully aware of it.</P>
      <P>It is well known that Donegal is the heart of the seed potato industry here. There are huge demands for our seed potatoes in Cyprus, the Canary Islands, the Spanish mainland and Israel.  These exports also provide jobs, an issue which this Government has advocated for some time.  They also provide exports to various countries in Europe other than the UK.  Decision time has now arrived because farmers want to know if they can proceed and plant for next year.  For example, Donegal Potatoes, DPL, who plant approximately 300 acres in the Newtowncunningham area took a decision last night that they will not plant any potatoes in the coming year.  This decision will have to be made by other farmers.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Minister of State must impress upon the Minister for Finance that some form of finance is needed now and not in a few weeks time, because now is the time these farmers will have to make a decision.</P>
      <P>I thank the Ministers for their involvement to date in the European context but I would be critical also of some MEPs who misled farmers in Donegal as to what action they were taking.  They tended to give the impression that some form of slush fund was available either in Europe or in Ireland to meet these needs.  This money must come from the Structural Funds.  We must press upon the Minister for Finance, before the distribution of the Structural Funds, the importance of this matter and the urgent need for funding. Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Coughlan, McDaid and McGinley for bringing this important matter before the House.  As we all know, a disastrous situation exists in Donegal presently in relation to the seed potato industry.</P>
      <P>On 1 December, the Minister of State, Deputy Hyland, met representatives of Donegal potato growers who presented a report on the situation of the potato crop in the county.  Arising from this discussion the Department made a strong case to the EC Commission before Christmas.  The Department submission referred to the abnormal climatic conditions which rendered harvesting impossible for the bulk of the seed and ware potato crops.  Reference was made to the hardship suffered by producers as a result and to the possible irreparable damage, particularly to the seed production base in the county.  The strategic importance of the Donegal seed potato sector to the entire Irish potato sector was also highlighted.</P>
      <P>The Commission was urged to provide financial support as quickly as possible to alleviate hardship and to enable affected growers to continue in potato production in 1993.  The Commission reply dated 29 January was to the effect that there are only limited means available to them to help in these circumstances and that it was never the intention that Community funds should be used to compensate for loss of income due to poor weather conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reply went on to mention a possibility of Community intervention under the Community Support Framework for restoring agricultural production potential after natural disasters, though it adverted to the possibility of such intervention <Col N="1440" /> being extremely limited, especially in the present state of expenditure under the CSF for Ireland.  I am now exploring this and any other avenues of potential funding and I am fully supportive of the efforts being made to secure some assistance for growers who have suffered serious loss.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I assure Deputies that every possible effort will be made to acquire funding to assist the seed potato industry in Donegal.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is fully committed to this.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this issue which is important to those of us from Tipperary.  The EC-funded Leader programme was launched in Tipperary as a pilot project with great pomp and ceremony.  It was heralded as the mechanism for the salvation of rural Ireland and it was to provide job opportunities for the unemployed in rural parishes. Sadly, it has been a story of grief and unfulfilled promises.  In its administration of the scheme the management was incompetent, unprofessional, negligent and, in some instances, unethical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen a copy of the report prepared by the consultant and I would ask the Minister has the consultant been appointed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, and if so, what were the terms of reference given to the person appointed?  This report is a damning indictment of the company.  It raises very serious questions with grave implications for individuals and, indeed, for the stewardship of the board and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  The report highlights the lack of accountability, it exposes malpractice <Col N="1441" /> and it confirms breaches of departmental rules governing the Leader scheme.</P>
    <P>This level of mismanagement threatens the future of the Leader programme, not just in Tipperary but throughout the country.  I am convinced also that the report is too narrowly focused and selective in its conclusions.  From the information that has been available to me for a number of months, which was never sought by anybody from the Department, I fear that further revelations are pending with far-reaching consequences for a wide circle of people.  I wish to ask the Minister why these questions were not answered in the report.  How many projects were sanctioned?  Who sponsored the successful applications?  How many commitments are still not honoured? How much Leader money was spent on administering Tipperary Enterprise operations?  How much moneys did Tipperary Enterprise raise independently of the Leader programme?  Was proper procedure followed in the purchase of equipment such as a computer system?  What was the composition of the interview board for the selection of management and staff?  Was there any connection between the large fees that were paid to consultant companies and board members?  How much Leader money was invested in the Birdhill Trading Centre? Was it authorised by the board?  What is the legal status of this company and who is liable for the huge trading losses and substantial moneys outstanding to creditors? Who will pay these creditors?  I have had numerous contacts from various people throughout County Tipperary who are owed money for products and produce supplied to the company.  Is it the Minister's intention to allow Tipperary Enterprise to remain as the agent for the administration of the Leader programme in Tipperary?</P>

      <P>I wish to support my colleague, Deputy Lowry.  This matter is of concern to all parties.  Deputy Davern and Deputy Theresa Ahearn have expressed their concern about this matter.  Indeed, I have brought it to the attention of the Labour Party Cabinet <Col N="1442" /> Ministers and that of my colleague, Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, in consultation with his colleague, Minister of State, Deputy Hyland.</P>
      <P>In the event of any problem arising with this company in the future or any wrongdoing that is proven, we must ensure that the full rigours of the law will be applied.  Due to the lack of ability to operate the scheme, verbal promises which were given have caused bankruptcy and much distress to people involved in genuine projects which are promoted in this colourful leaflet.  It was indicated in the map of Ireland that Tipperary was included in the Leader programme. We must live up to the promises made to these people.  The funds withdrawn by the Department should be distributed proportionately and fairly to the people who were given these promises. This fiasco must not affect County Tipperary's future development of the Leader programme, which has support across the House.  We must ensure that justice is done, that those responsible for any wrongdoing are brought to justice and that the Minister responsible &mdash; and I thank him for applying himself to this matter &mdash; would pursue it to the bitter end because the people of Tipperary require that of him.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to update the House on the situation in relation to the operation of the Leader programme in County Tipperary by the company, Tipperary Enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the raising of this matter here in the Dáil last October, I immediately initiated an investigation into the various allegations against the company's operation of the Leader programme.  My officials had several meetings with representatives of Tipperary Enterprise and examined records at the company's offices.  I invited the board at the same time to respond to the very serious allegations which were made both in the Dáil and by concerned clients of the company. At my insistence, the company agreed to freeze its Leader bank account and a sum <Col N="1443" /> of £306,000 of Leader funds was, at my request, repaid to the Department.</P>
    <P>My inquiries into the affairs of Tipperary Enterprise resulted in the board of the company appointing a four member committee on 30 November last to examine the company's activities and structures. A consultant was engaged by the committee to carry out this examination and both the committee and the consultant have been co-operating with my Department's investigation.  A comprehensive interim report was presented by the committee to the Department on 6 January.  Various discussions and exchanges of correspondence took place during January with a view to clarifying certain matters arising from the interim report.</P>
    <P>The report and the investigation by my own officials revealed a number of very serious failings in relation to Leader operations by Tipperary Enterprise.  It is clear that all funds advanced to the company for Leader purposes were not applied in accordance with Leader principles and in keeping with the terms of the agreement entered into by Tipperary Enterprise with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  It is also evident that the Leader programme has been mismanaged by the company.</P>
    <P>From the outset of my investigations into events in relation to the operation of Leader in County Tipperary, I have been concerned to ensure that the benefits of the Leader programme are not lost to the people of the county.  For this reason I was anxious to give Tipperary Enterprise every opportunity to address the very serious matters which have been identified and to put its house in order.  I saw the board meeting on 6 February as the final opportunity for the company to tackle and resolve the serious problems associated with its operation of Leader.</P>
    <P>Both my officials and I, in the course of discussions and correspondence going back to late last year, had made it clear to Tipperary Enterprise that Leader moneys applied for non-Leader purposes had to be reimbursed to the Department and all other elements of the Leader <Col N="1444" /> agreement correctly applied.  In a letter to the company on 5 February, the Department again asked that the board of Tipperary Enterprise at its meeting the following day should address the matter of reimbursement of expenditure not certifiable as legitimate to Leader and to take the necessary decisions.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the board's meeting was conveyed to my Department late on Tuesday last, 9 February.  Having examined the report I considered it to be totally unsatisfactory and as a result I called in the board of Tipperary Enterprise to meet me at noon today.  At that meeting I again made it clear to the board members present that the company will have to reimburse the Department in respect of the Leader funds incorrectly spent.  In the meantime a letter has now issued to the company in accordance with the terms of the Leader contract requiring Tipperary Enterprise to reimburse the Department with a sum of the order of £250,000.  If the company fails to comply within 14 days, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry will be serving a notice to Tipperary Enterprise terminating the Leader contract with the company.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the House of my concern in all of this to ensure not only proper spending of public funds but also the continued availability of Leader to the people of County Tipperary.  The House should note that Leader activities are covered by insurance guarantees.  I am committed to the earliest resolution of the cases of project promoters who have been promised grant aid for legitimate Leader schemes.  This issue is being addressed immediately.  I am of course also totally committed to ensuring that the balance of the Leader funds for County Tipperary &mdash; amounting to over £2 million is secured and I am confident that this will be achieved.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to express my whole-hearted attachment to the Leader ideal of a bottom-up approach to rural development.  I would like to assure all Leader groups in the country that my resolve in this regard remains unshaken. I propose to meet all of the Leader groups <Col N="1445" /> shortly to consider all aspects in relation to the operation of Leader.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I welcome the specific commitment in the Programme for Government to allocate additional resources to primary education. This has always been the most neglected sector in education.  I say that as a former secondary teacher.  In particular, I welcome the statement in the Programme for Government that:</P>
      <P>The priorities of our policy will be: At primary level, a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio to 22.1 by September 1996.  No class should be bigger than 29 by then ...</P>
      <P>This very positive commitment is in line with the statement, also on page 29 of the programme, that the Government regards education as the key to our future prosperity and to equal opportunities for all our citizens.  I whole heartedly share that view and welcome the commitment to target resources at disadvantaged areas and groups.  Indeed, the recent budget submission from the Irish National Teachers' Organisation centred solely on the needs of schools in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that context I wish to raise with the Minister the position of the Stanhope Street Convent national school, Manor Street, which serves a largely disadvantaged area of Dublin's north inner city.  I attended a meeting in the school on Monday evening last and met members of the parents' association as well as teachers and the sisters who run the school.  They are a dedicated and committed group working in the best interests of the 585 children who attend this highly regarded and extremely popular national school.  While the number of infants enrolling in the school is increasing, the overall position is that the school is 18 pupils short of the quota of 603 required to retain its present staff level of 19 <Col N="1446" /> teachers.  The real problem is in the junior classes where on average there are 35 to 36 children per class and these are mixed classes of boys and girls.  While classes of 35 and 36 pupils are unacceptably large and must be examined, if the school loses a teacher it will directly affect the junior infant classes.  It will be a teacher of junior infants who will be put on the transfer panel.  If this happens class sizes could be as large as 47 or 48 children which would put an intolerable strain on the teachers and be extremely damaging to the education of the children. That would be the result in any school but it would have disastrous social effects in a school that caters for communities with high levels of unemployment and social disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I am confident the Minister understands fully the implications the loss of a teacher would have for this school or indeed any school in a socially disadvantaged area. Despite the Minister's short time in office I hope she might give some indication of steps to preserve at the very least, the <i>status quo</i> in schools threateneed in the way I have outlined.  This is an urgent matter because unless the Minister acts quickly a teacher will be put on the panel for transfer some time this month.  If that happens it will destabilise and undermine the work of the school.</P>
    <P>There is a strong case for increasing the number of teachers in Stanhope Street national school in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government and there is a special need for an additional remedial teacher in the school. The Minister is welcome to visit the school and see the great work carried out there and the need to maintain the present staffing level.  The schoolgoing population in the local catchment area is increasing.  The construction of a scheme of 150 new houses is about to start and a number of smaller schemes of new houses was built the past year.  I hope the Minister will instruct the Department immediately not to place a teacher from Stanhope Street school on the transfer panel.</P>
    <P>Similar difficulties are being experienced in the Central Model Infants <Col N="1447" /> School, Marlborough Street, Dublin 1, which is, approximately, 15 pupils under the quota and also threatened with the loss of a teacher.  The Minister is patron of that school.  It is located in the grounds of her Department and serves an acutely disadvantaged community, perhaps the most disadvantaged in the State.  I mention that school only in the hope the Minister will take special note of my comments and let me know if she can allay the concerns of the staff and parents of the school.  I am confident that she will do that.  I am not sure if the Minister has visited the school which is located only a few yards from her office.  If not, I hope she will do so soon.  While I have addressed my remarks to the Minister for Education, I appreciate that she cannot be here to reply and that my question will be answered by the Minister of State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister.  Unfortunately, she cannot be here but I will bring Deputy Gregory's views to her attention.  I thank Deputy Gregory for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to outline the staffing at Stanhope Street Convent national school.  The enrolment in Stanhope Street school in September 1989 was 654 pupils and by September 1991 it had fallen to 612.  This warranted a staff for the 1992-93 school year of a principal, 19 assistants, a concessionary teacher under the disadvantaged scheme and a full time remedial teacher.  The enrolment in September 1992 was 585 pupils. Based on the current staffing schedule in operation this would warrant a staff for the 1993-94 school year of a principal plus 18 assistants, a concessionary teacher under the disadvantaged scheme and a full time remedial teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An enrolment of 603 pupils was required on 30 September 1992 in order to retain the post of the 19th assistant. Staffing arrangements for 1993 and 1994 have not yet been finalised.  However, it would take a substantial improvement in the staffing schedule to retain the post of <Col N="1448" /> the 19th assistant in the 1993-94 school year.  The staffing of a national school is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year.  This is in accordance with the agreement on staffing made between the Government and the INTO under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The only exceptions that can be made from the agreed staffing arrangements are in the case of developing schools or where Department guidelines on maximum class size are being breached.  It is unlikely that Stanhope Street Convent national school would meet the criteria necessary to qualify under either of the exceptions referred to above.  Enrolments have fallen steadily in the past number of years, down by 69 in four years.  While an enrolment of 585, spread over 18 assistants gives an average class size of 32.5, this does not include the remedial teacher or the concessionary teacher under the disadvantaged scheme. The figure of 32.5 average class size is well below the maximum class size currently in operation.  It is likely the average class size will be smaller as enrolment will probably decline in September 1993 in line with the national trend.</P>
    <P>In order to qualify as a developing school in 1993-94 a projected enrolment of at least 631 pupils would be required for September 1993.  This is an increase of 46 students over the 30 September 1992 enrolment.  The Department of Education will be in contact with the board of management of the school as soon as the staffing arrangements for the 1993-94 school year and for all national schools are finalised.  At that stage, taking into account the Deputy's views, we will communicate with the board again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister every success on his return to the Social Welfare portfolio.  I have always found him very sympathetic to genuine grievances and willing to take good ideas on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of emigration and migration patterns of the forties and fifties, and <Col N="1449" /> indeed later, many old age pensioners in Sligo, Leitrim, Mayo, Donegal and the entire west have small British pensions. These are often topped up by the Department of Social Welfare here to bring their combined pensions up to the level of the non-contributory old age pension.  The amount those pensioners get from the Department is dictated by means testing and based on the size of their British pensions, but we all know what has happened in recent times to sterling.  A short time ago 90p sterling equalled IR£1, then the value of sterling fell to where £1.09 sterling equalled IR£1.</P>
    <P>This dramatic fluctuation of the currencies was not caused by the old age pensioners in the west but they are the victims.  They are suffering more real hardships from it than most of the big time speculators caught in the money markets.  Some pensioners have seen the real value of their incomes decrease by between 15 or 25 per cent.  I thought the Department would make an automatic adjustment, as it was pretty smart to do when sterling was riding high and the adjustment was downwards, but it did not.  I was told the Department makes its calculation on a three monthly average of the rates.  That is understandable, but what is not understandable is that the Department does not after the three month period make the change automatically. The pensioners have to write in to get an adjustment &mdash; request a review, is the jargon used.  The pensioners do not make the request because they do not know it is required do not understand the system, or simply because they are old and not as sharp as they used to be.</P>
    <P>Surely there should be some system in operation whereby they would receive the money they are due automatically. This is the age of technology and the Department of Social Welfare has been a leader in that regard.  I ask the Minister for Social Welfare to take immediate steps to ensure that those pensioners are paid what they are owed.  In many cases the adjustments will be very little in real terms, but a fall of £15, £10 or even £5 is a substantial lowering of income to an <Col N="1450" /> old age penisoner, especially when they could not make ends meet on the original pensions at full value.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>People in receipt of pensions from the United Kingdom can experience both gains and losses in Irish punt terms with changes in the UK-Irish exchange rate.  One of the great advantages of the ERM when Britain was in it was that we had greater stability in that regard.  Many of those in receipt of pensions from the UK have experienced for some considerable time an improvement in income, as their pensions gained in value during the period when the Irish pound remained below parity with sterling.  The deterioration in the value of sterling in recent months, however, has meant that this advantage has been eroded.  A person who was in receipt of a UK retirment pension may also be entitled, if aged over 66 years, to an old age non-contributory pension from my Department. The UK pension would count as means for this purpose, converted to Irish pounds by reference to an average exchange rate used by my Department. A UK penisoner who is already in receipt of an old-age non-contributory pension and whose means has dropped as a result is entitled to request a review of his/her means assessment.  People in receipt of UK pensions who are experiencing difficulty as a result of their income falling below the appropriate rate of supplementary welfare allowance for their family size may contact the community welfare officer at their local health centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent 10 per cent devaluation of the punt will also have the effect of significantly increasing the value of pensions payable from the United Kingdom.  The position is that for some time we had a great deal of stability during which the UK pensioners benefited because sterling was stronger than the punt.  Recently we have had a period of fluctuation and now the position is adjusted back again with the 10 per cent devaluation.  Obviously, if the value of sterling continues to fall we will have to take longer term <Col N="1451" /> measures.  At present we deal with the cases as they arise when people apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister for Social Welfare to show a certain amount of discretion and flexibility where payments of social welfare benefit are made to people who are diagnosed as suffering from incurable diseases.  Under the present system a person in insurable employment who becomes ill has to wait at least 12 months before becoming eligible for an invalidity pension.  During that period he or she has to supply weekly or monthly medical certificates to illustrate that he or she is unable to work.  The trauma suffered by people who discover they have an incurable disease is considerable. It would be charitable on the part of the Minister and the Department of Social Welfare to assist such people in every way possible.  For people on invalidity pension, there are additional benefits such as free electricity and travel pass. These fringe benefits are some compensation, but these people should be spared the trauma of having to supply medical certificates every week or every month.  I would ask the Minister to invoke a certain degree of flexibility in this regard.  His officials tell me their hands are tied because of the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I greatly appreciate the point made by Deputy Deasy.  If this were simply a question of discretion and flexibility it would be an easier matter to deal with.  Under current legislation persons can qualify for invalidity pension only if they have been incapable of work for at least a year and if the illness or disability concerned is likely to be a permanent <Col N="1452" /> one.  It is a matter of legislation in the first instance.</P>
      <P>By way of background, invalidity pension was first introduced in 1970 and was paid at the same rate as disability benefit. The main difference between the payments was that invalidity pension was paid by pension book.  Over the years invalidity pension rates were increased above those for disability benefit and invalidity pensioners also gained entitlement to the various &ldquo;free&rdquo; schemes, such as free travel.  This was in line with the general policy of providing higher payments to long term recipients.</P>
      <P>Research has shown that people who are long term dependent on social welfare payments have greater need for income support and in recent years the Government has placed particular emphasis on giving special increases to people on long term payments.  If any change were to be considered it would have to be targeted specifically to those who need the additional benefit most. The experience of my Department has been that it can be very difficult to establish whether a condition is permanent even after 12 months on disability benefit and this is understandable.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, I am always open to ideas and suggestions for improvement to the social welfare system.  I appreciate the case made by Deputy Deasy.  For example, in the case of a person suffering from incurable cancer who may have approximately five, six, eight or ten months to live, the position is medically fairly clear cut.  Yet under existing legislation it is not possible in that time to provide invalidity pension as well as the extra benefits such as free fuel, which would be very important in the winter months.  I appreciate the point made by the Deputy, it is one I have come across in my clinics.  I will have the matter examined to see if cases of incurable illness can be provided for sooner under the scheme.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 12 February 1993.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 21, 24 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>I would like first to outline the approach to the provision of access to our national parks.  The five Irish national parks are relatively large areas which exist to conserve natural plant and animal communities and scenic landscapes of national importance and where, in harmony with such protection, public access and appreciation can be facilitated.  The management policy for the parks has been endorsed by successive Governments and in the context of access it has been, and remains, Government policy to encourage Irish people and indeed people from abroad to visit heritage areas provided that such access does not damage the areas.  At national parks, nature reserves, monuments and gardens managed by the Office of Public Works, for which I have responsibility, this access and appreciation is achieved in a number of ways:</P>
      <P>(i)  the recruitment of rangers and guides to provide tours, walks and talks for visitors;</P>
      <P>(ii)  the publication of a series of books, leaflets and pamphlets;</P>
      <P>(iii)  the provision of information boards, panels, nature and historical trails;</P>
      <P>(iv)  the provision of visitor centres containing displays exhibits and audio-visual programmes.</P>
      <P>All of the 33 centres are operating effectively and are meeting the dual criteria of visitor access and conservation.  Indeed the purpose built centres at Glenveagh in County Donegal and Glendalough in County Wicklow have received prestigious international awards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current programme of visitor centres will provide fifteen centres and, given Office of Public Works' commitment to conservation, their successful track record to date and the evaluation of the <Col N="1367" /> proposals by the relevant planning authorities. I am confident that the centres will make an important contribution to the protection and appreciation of our heritage when they are in operation.</P>
    <P>Of the current programme, a few of the centres have proved controversial.  Those proposed for the Burren and Wicklow Mountains National Parks have been subject to independent assessment and the consultants who proposed the relevant EIS and the competent authorities who evaluated them concluded that no significant environmental impacts would arise from the developments.  Both projects are in progress and the contracts are due for completion later this year.</P>
    <P>Since taking over responsibility for the Office of Public Works I have given particular attention to the visitors' centres controversy.  As the Minister responsible, I am reviewing all the arguments for and against the Burren centre only and so far I have found no justifiable reason for halting the project.</P>
    <P>I have also examined the philosophy of providing access for people to the nation's heritage and have concluded that the centres are a meaningful contribution to such a philosophy.  I am also aware that the proposals are in accordance with current international practice.  As indicated by the Taoiseach yesterday in the House, future policy in heritage matters is the responsibility of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  The responsibility of putting policy into effect remains with me as Minister of State at the Department of Finance in charge of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost of the Burren National Park Visitor Centre project is £2.9 million and the EC will fund £2.2 million of this cost; £903,000 expenditure has been paid to date and additional expenses of £600,000 have been incurred. Money is drawn down by the Department of Finance as part of the global grant for Structural Fund projects.</P>
    <P>Full consideration of the alternative proposal put to me by Minister Michael D. Higgins is not yet completed but, based on the information to hand so far, the <Col N="1368" /> proposal would cost in the region of £7.3 million excluding purchase price.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Priority Question No. 5 and Questions Nos. 31 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>As regards Question No. 31, the issue raised is a purely hypothetical question to which no real answer can be given. The impact of devaluation depends crucially on the subsequent reaction of interest rates and exchange rates.  No one knows what would have happened to interest rates and exchange rates had we decided to devalue three months earlier than we did and there is no basis therefore for any quantified reply.</P>
      <P>As regards the main Exchequer budgetary effects of the devaluation, my Department has estimated the net cost at about £13 million in 1993.  Details of this estimate are being finalised, and will be subject to changes, as all elements are not yet confirmed.</P>
      <P>Full details of the Exchequer's income and expenditure will be set out in the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure, which will be published on the Saturday prior to the budget.</P>

      <P>The officer concerned was seconded from the Revenue Commissioners in November 1989, to act as special adviser to the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, at a salary equivalent to the scale for Principal Officer (Higher Scale). When the Minister left office in November 1992, the officer returned to the Revenue Commissioners on the same salary scale he had held in Industry and Commerce.  This involved a formal promotion from his former grade in Revenue, which was Assistant Principal.  I am aware that the Association of Higher Civil Servants have expressed concern about these arrangements, but I have already ensured that no serving officer would lose out by creating a temporary and supernumerary post of Principal (Higher Scale) to accommodate the officer's reabsorption into the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  This is a post that would not otherwise exist and it ensures that no other officer's promotion outlets are thereby blocked or diminished. The present Government has adopted a guideline that no serving civil servant may be promoted on joining a Private Office as special adviser or otherwise, and also that civil servants should not be promoted outside of the normal course when Ministers are vacating office.</P>

      <Quest>the proposals, if any, the Government intends to bring forward at EC, IMF and World Bank level in respect of the Third World debt problem in view of his address to the World Bank in Washington DC in September, 1992 where he said that, while structural reforms are essential for long term improvement, they sometimes impose in the shorter term undue hardship on the poorest members of society, and this should be acknowledged in the drawing up of programmes of reform and appropriate measures included to mitigate as far as possible any such hardship; and if he will give details of the particular policies he had in mind when he referred to appropriate measures.</Quest>

      <P>The burden of debt carried by many Third World countries remains an issue for the world community.  There has been progress on the implementation of the debt strategy, but it remains a huge problem for some low-income countries.  The problem needs to be tackled at global level.  The role which the Government can play is to support the efforts being made by the international financial institutions to resolve the problem.  We are doing this, in so far as we can, through our membership of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.  Within the European Community, the Government, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs, has also given our support to measures under STABEX, the Community fund set up under the Lomé Conventions, which involve the forgiveness of debts of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries who have signed the Convention.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Finance, I am Governor for Ireland of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund.  I should say that the measures which the IMF and World Bank have developed for dealing with the Third World debt crisis have, in recent years, become increasingly effective.  The activities of the Paris Club of official creditors have also helped considerably to ease the debt burden of developing countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Structural reform primarily involves measures to restore order to public finances and the balance of payments. Experience shows that such reform tends, in relative terms, to have the greatest adverse impact on the most vulnerable sections of society.  Because of this, the World Bank, in all the adjustment operations which it has assisted in recent years, has taken particular care to ensure that these vulnerable groups are protected.  With the rest of the international community, the IMF is continuing <Col N="1374" /> to find ways, commensurate with its mandate as a monetary institution, to contribute to reducing poverty in the developing world.</P>
    <P>The World Bank has formulated a two-part strategy for reducing poverty.  The first is to promote broad-based growth, make efficient use of the poor's most abundant asset which is labour.  The second is to provide the poor with access to basic social services.  The bank is vigorously pursuing this strategy by placing poverty reduction at the centre of its policy dialogue with developing countries and in its overall assistance strategies for these countries.  The detailed implementation of the strategy would include:</P>
    <P>&mdash;designing the phasing of programmes to accommodate the needs of the poor;</P>
    <P>&mdash;giving priority to relative price changes in favour of the poor early in the reform process;</P>
    <P>&mdash;securing adequate resources for the provision of basic social services aimed at the poor;</P>
    <P>&mdash;designing social safety nets into economic reform programmes.</P>
    <P>I support these ongoing measures.</P>
    <P>My representative on the executive board of the bank has played a leading role in the evolution of the bank's poverty strategy and will continue to do so in relation to its implementation and refinement in the light of experience.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Deputy is no doubt aware of the agreement reached in December last on the Tenth Replenishment of IDA, the soft-loan arm of the World Bank which lends only to the poorest countries on very concessional terms.  That replenishment will maintain the real value of IDA-9 and thus help to buttress the bank's overall strategy for combating poverty.</P>

      <P>Our experience since last September indicates that the currency markets do place a high emphasis on the interdependence of the Irish and British economies. The UK proportion of our trade has declined significantly in recent years, while there has been a significant growth in our trade with other European markets. In addition, our performance in recent years on inflation and wage movements has been better than the UK's. Some appreciation of our currency <i>vis-ávis</i> sterling has therefore been justified, and the currency markets appear to be recognising this fact given the new levels of our sterling exchange rate.</P>
      <P>The markets should continue to consider other factors, such as our ERM position, our commitment to European Monetary Union and the growing diversification of our foreign trade in looking at our sterling exchange rate.  The value of our currency in the face of such a significant fall in the value of sterling should add to the growing belief that Irish exchange rate policy is becoming less affected by volatility in the UK currency.</P>

    <P>Decisions on the currency composition of borrowing take account of market conditions at the time and the existing composition of the foreign currency portfolio.</P>
    <P>The policy up until mid-September was that foreign currency borrowing would be used primarily to refinance maturing foreign currency debt and foreign currency debt paid off ahead of schedule. The currency crisis, which commenced in mid-September 1992 led to very high domestic interest rates and as a result a decision was made to increase foreign currency borrowing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The arrangements agreed by Government for the staffing of the political offices of Ministers and Ministers of State <Col N="1379" /> provide that each member of the Government and each Minister of State may appoint the following staff: a Special Adviser; a Personal Assistant; a Personal Secretary.</P>
    <P>In all cases the salary payable is salary prior to employment in such position plus an allowance of 10 per cent subject to specific maximum amounts.  Those maxima are, in the case of a Minister, Special Adviser £40,500, Personal Assistant £21,500, and in the case of a Minister of State, Special Adviser £32,500, Personal Assistant £18,000.</P>
    <P>Where a Personal Secretary to either a Minister or Minister of State is a Secretarial Assistant existing salary is augmented by an allowance of £15.38 per week.</P>
    <P>In addition to the staff specified, each member of the Government is entitled to appoint a Partnership Programme Manager on salary terms identical to those of a special adviser.  In some instances, the terms under consideration are significantly below the maximum and in others Managers drawn from the Civil Service will perform normal departmental duties so that the total additional cost involved will fall below this figure. Ministers are currently finalising their proposals in relation to the salaries and other conditions of the persons they propose to appoint to these positions so that a definitive and comprehensive list of appointees and their salaries is not yet available to my Department.  A similar position obtains in regard to accommodation.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the economic effects of the currency crisis have been under continuing consideration during the last 5 months.  Mindful of the difficulties which the crisis had presented, the Government had established the Market Development Fund to alleviate the problems faced by exporting industry and had finalised proposals to implement exchange risk guarantee schemes to provide low cost funding to businesses and reduce the upward pressure on mortgage rates.</P>
      <P>The decision to seek a realignment of the Irish pound within the ERM was taken when it was apparent that it was not possible to achieve an acceptable level of interest rates in the face of the continued speculation against the currency and the potential harmful effects these rates could have on industry and employment. It was also taken because of the effect of the changes in the currencies on the competitiveness of our exports.  The effect of the realignment to date has been to reduce the market rate of exchange for the Irish pound against our main trading partners and to ease significantly the pressures on wholesale interest rates.  This should alleviate the pressures on business.  Indeed, some exporting industries will have a new competitive advantage in some markets as a result of the devaluation.</P>

      <P>The direct impact on the Exchequer arising from Central Bank intervention in support of the Irish pound arises from the effect of such intervention on the bank's profits and it is assumed that this is the aspect which the Deputy has in mind.  I am informed by the Central Bank that during the period September to January last the bank made additional profits as a result of the higher than normal levels of money market support and interest rates.  The higher profits for the period to end-December 1992 will be reflected in the payment of additional surplus income by the bank to the Exchequer in 1993.  The higher profits in January 1993 will be reflected in additional surplus income in 1994.</P>

      <P>The outlook for 1993, at this point, is for an average increase in the Consumer Price Index of the order of 3½ per cent compared with 1992.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that the recent devaluation of the Irish pound had been preceded by an effective, roughly equivalent, appreciation in preceding months as the value of sterling, the lira and certain other currencies declined. The effective exchange rate of the Irish pound stood at 67.71 this morning compared with an average level of 67.81 over the first half of 1992.  There should be no appreciable effect on inflation therefore, through import prices on average despite the overall evolution of currency parities in recent months, compared with what might have been expected had previous currency parities been maintained.</P>
      <P>However, developments on currency markets did have the effect of pushing domestic interest rates upwards late last year. While not a consequence of the Irish pound's devaluation &mdash; it contributed, instead, to a lowering of prevailing interest rate pressures &mdash; that increase in interest rates will affect 1993 and is incorporated in the estimate of 3½ per cent.  Exclusive of interest rate developments &mdash; the basis used to measure inflation in many countries &mdash; the prospect is closer to 3 per cent.</P>

      <P>Interest rates are primarily a matter for the Central Bank.  The bank seeks to keep interest rates as low as possible consistent with the maintenance of our exchange rate policy.  The Government was very conscious of the position of mortgage holders and other borrowers in deciding to devalue the Irish pound &mdash; since this devaluation interbank interest rates have fallen sharply.  While it is too soon to say how quickly mortgage and retail interest rates can be reduced, it is hoped that significant reductions will take place in the course of 1993.</P>

However, it would not be precluded from examining any amending draft Central Bank legislation submitted to the Oireachtas in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bank has been entrusted by statute with wide powers of independent action in relation to the currency, monetary policy and the control and supervision of the banking system.  In so far as these matters fall within the framework of general economic policy, the Oireachtas already has ample opportunity to discuss them or raise them by way of parliamentary question.  In addition, the Bank's Annual Report and Annual Accounts are presented to both Houses.  The accounts are audited by the <Col N="1387" /> Comptroller and Auditor General and the bank has no right to appoint outside auditors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Between end-August 1992 and end-December 1992, the external reserves fell by nearly £940, despite an offsetting upward valuation of £71 million, and net Exchequer foreign borrowing of about £1,070 million.  In addition, the Central Bank incurred liabilities to other Central Banks through the European Monetary Co-operation Fund, in respect of certain interventions to support the Irish pound. At end-December, these liabilities amounted to £716 million.  The Central Bank has not published data in regard to foreign exchange swaps outstanding during the period in question.  The official external reserves are assets of the Central Bank and their management and replenishment are operational matters for that organisation.  However, I am informed by the Central Bank that, since the devaluation, the level of unwinding of leading and lagging of trade-related payments and of speculative positions against the Irish pound has been substantial. This flow of funds has thus helped to reconstitute the official external reserves.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that there is any anomaly in the tax treatment of single, separated and widowed parents.  The differential in the tax treatment of individuals on the basis of their marital status arises in large measure out of the Supreme Court Ruling in the Murphy case.</P>
      <P>Single persons and separated persons being taxed independently receive a single person's allowance of £2,100. Where these are parents living alone with dependent children, they are entitled to a one-parent family allowance of £2,100 bringing their total basic allowances to the level of the married couple's allowance of £4,200.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Widowed persons receive a widowed personal allowance of £2,600 and where these are parents living alone with dependent children they are also entitled to a one parent family allowance of £1,600 again bringing their allowance up to the level of the married couples' allowance. <Col N="1389" /> In further recognition of the special position of bereaved parents, the Government introduced a special tax allowance for widowed parents with dependent children in 1991.  The allowance is £1,500 for the first tax year following bereavement, £1,000 for the second and £500 for the third.</P>
    <P>As far as mortgage interest relief is concerned, single persons and seperated persons being taxed independently receive a single person's mortgage interest relief up to a ceiling of £1,600. Widowed persons are entitled to mortgage interest relief up to a ceiling of £2,320.</P>

      <P>When first introduced in 1980, the Christmas bonus was paid to the elderly and other pensioners, including the long term sick in receipt of invalidity pension.  In 1985 it was extended to the unemployed in receipt of the long term rate of unemployment assistance.  Disability benefit is regarded as a short term social insurance payment and there are no proposals at present to extend the Christmas bonus to recipients of that benefit.</P>
      <P>A Christmas bonus of 70 per cent of normal weekly payments was paid last year at a cost of £31 million which was an increase of £3 million on 1991.  In all over one million people benefited i.e., 655,000 recipients and their 395,000 dependants.</P>

As the roads in question are non-national roads, responsibility for the provision of signals rests with Dublin County Council, in consultation with the Garda, and the cost falls to be financed from the council's own resources, supplemented by the discretionary grants paid annually for such roads.  A reply to this effect issued to the County Council on 16 October 1992.</P>

In 1991, a bathroom sub-programme was introduced under &ldquo;A Plan for Social Housing&rdquo; to <Col N="1397" /> supplement the expenditure of authorities from their own resources on the provision of sanitary facilities in their housing stock.  A total of £4 million was allocated in 1991 and 1992 under the sub-programme. This is in addition to the £80.5 million allocated to local authorities since 1985 for the remedial works scheme under which bathrooms may be provided as part of the overall refurbishment of older dwellings.  Further allocations will be made this year under the bathrooms' sub-programme and the remedial works scheme.  The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997</i> envisages an acceleration over the life of that programme of remedial works to local authority houses, including the provision of bathroom facilities where these are lacking.</P>
      <P>While there is no scheme for the provision of sanitary facilities in private houses generally, there is a number of ways in which particular categories of persons can be assisted &mdash; house improvement loans of up to £3,000 unsecured, and £10,000 secured; the new scheme whereby local authorities can have improvement works, including the installation of bathroom facilities, carried out to the existing accommodation of approved applicants for local authority housing, as an alternative to rehousing; the disabled person's grants scheme; and the Task Force on Special Housing Aid for the Elderly which provides assistance to elderly persons living alone in unfit or insanitary accommodation.</P>

      <P>The existence of a loan, whether secured or not, in respect of a house does not preclude a local authority from undertaking works <Col N="1398" /> to the house under the scheme introduced in &ldquo;A Plan for Social Housing&rdquo;. However, as local authorities are required to secure on the house the expenditure they incur in carrying out improvements, they may wish to satisfy themselves that the amount of any outstanding loan, together with the expenditure on the improvements, does not exceed the value of the house.</P>

      <P>The long term illness scheme covers 15 specified <Col N="1406" /> illnesses and there are no plans at present to extend the scheme to include any further conditions.  The long term illness scheme, however, is only one of a number of schemes in operation which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines for persons with ongoing medical conditions.</P>
      <P>Persons with conditions such as lupus erythematosus who in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable to meet their medical expenses, without undue hardship, may be granted a medical card which will entitle them to the supply of all drugs and medicines without charge. Any other person with an ongoing medical condition, such as lupus erythematosus, which imposes a requirement for continuous medication, can benefit under the terms of the drug cost subsidisation scheme.  This scheme limits the actual expenditure of authorised beneficiaries, on prescribed medicines, to £32 per month.  This scheme is being availed of by many lupus sufferers.</P>
      <P>These schemes, together with the drugs refund scheme, ensure that the treatment of all sectors of the population and of lupus sufferers in particular are being met in the most equitable way having regard to the total resources available.</P>
