It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: 1. business shall be interrupted not later than 4.45 p.m. today; 2. the Dáil shall sit tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. and adjourn not later than 4 p.m.; 3. the following arrangements shall apply in relation to the statements on No. 6, which shall take place today and tomorrow: (i) the opening statements of the Taoiseach and the main spokesperson for the Fine Gael Party, the Progressive Democrat Party and the Technical Group shall not exceed 30 minutes in each case; (ii) the statement of each other Member called on shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; and (iii) a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon not later than 3.40 p.m. on Friday to make a statement in reply not exceeding 20 minutes.</P>

      <P>Is the proposal on No. 1, that business be interrupted not later than 4.45 p.m. today, satisfactory? Agreed.  Is the proposal that the Dáil shall sit tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. and adjourn not later than 4 p.m. satisfactory? Agreed.  In respect of No. 3, are the proposals for dealing with No. 6 agreed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir, the Fine Gael Party does not agree that the National Development Plan should be dealt with by a series of statements with no conclusion by the Dáil at the end of the debate.  We believe that a matter of such importance should be substantially approved, disapproved or amended by the Dáil if it is being debated here.  The process of simply having statements denies the Dáil the opportunity of exercising any democratic decision on this issue and is contrary to the whole concept of parliamentary democracy and of subsidiarity and democratic involvement which underlies the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Bruton.  A debate such as this could be held in any debating society in the country.  It is a farce.  If we are to have parliamentary accountability, particularly in view of the fact that the Government has such a huge majority, we should have a meaningful debate here.  By having statements, there will be no reply and no change.  We are about to waste two days if we proceed by way of statements rather than by way of a motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, argue that the Dáil should have the opportunity of voting on the National Development Plan rather than simply making statements on it.  I cannot see what the Government fears by way of a vote, given the enormous majority it has.  If this House is to have any relevance as a democratic institution we should be enabled to vote on this Government proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton should not be too concerned about the approach of the EC in relation to that investment. They are following the normal procedure in having an investigation into this matter and affording the other parties the opportunity to make an input.  I see no reason Aer Lingus should be treated differently by the EC to other national airlines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope this debate will be about the National Development Plan 1994 to 1999 and not about side issues or the forthcoming budget in January next.</P>
      <P>The spending of £20 billion in this small country provides us with a singular opportunity for our economic wellbeing. It is part of the overall Programme for Government to improve our economic wellbeing, tackle the serious unemployment position and, of course, in other ways to improve Irish society.  In framing our National Development Plan the Government had three central objectives, which were: to increase and maintain employment; to reduce unemployment and, in particular, long term unemployment, and to eliminate the social exclusion of people and of the areas in which they live, caused by long term unemployment, disadvantage and poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From 1993 to 1999 total EC aid to Ireland will amount to approximately £8 billion.  That takes into account Structural Funds and the new Cohesion Fund <Col N="1120" /> coming on stream this year.  In addition, the Irish public and private sectors will invest £12 billion, bringing the total package to the highest ever in Ireland at over £20 billion.</P>
    <P>We must invest these resources wisely in order to achieve not only an impact on growth and jobs during the plan period but also lasting improvements in the economy that will deliver continuing growth and jobs into the next century.</P>
    <P>Our aim is to transform this country by the end of the decade.  The plan sets out the Government's strategy to achieve the national and European Community objective of greater economic and social cohesion.  Our last plan increased our standard of living from 63 per cent to 73 per cent of the EC average although encountering a very severe world recession.  This time we aim to close the gap still further.</P>
    <P>The basic elements of our strategy are: firstly, investment in the growth potential of the economy in industry, in tourism and services, in agriculture and natural resources; secondly, investment in the country's productive infrastructure to improve the capacity and competitiveness of the economy; thirdly, investment in the development of the skills of our people through education and training in order to increase productivity and growth capacity; and, fourthly, a special increased emphasis on harnessing local community leadership and local initiative.  This strategy will be given effect by a wide range of carefully selected development measures.  I propose to give an overview of these measures which will be described in greater detail by individual Ministers during the course of this debate.</P>
    <P>The main vehicle for direct job creation in the economy will continue to be industrial development.  The industry programme therefore is one of the most important and largest programmes put forward in the plan.  Total public &mdash; that is, national and EC &mdash; investment in industrial development will amount to almost £1.4 billion.  Private sector investment associated with this public input will <Col N="1121" /> bring the total investment in industrial development to over £3.8 billion.</P>
    <P>In the industry programme there will be increased emphasis on the development of indigenous industry, with support being directed at encouraging Irish-owned companies to build their competitive capability at firm level and at encouraging the development of capability and expansion of capacity at industry level.  There will be special initiatives in key sectors with identified job creation capacity such as wood processing, the film industry, software and electronic services, aerospace and automobile components.</P>
    <P>The attraction of inward investment is also essential to job creation.  Resources will be devoted to the attraction of new industries in the sectors and market niches where this country has the greatest competitive advantages and also to the further development and expansion of foreign-owned firms already located in Ireland.  The benefits of inward investment must be maximised by the development of linkages between Irish-owned and foreign-owned firms.</P>
    <P>There will be increased resources for company-led research and development, coupled with support for the development of research and technology services in support of industry by Eolas and the higher education sector.  Marketing development measures will support Irish companies in achieving sustainable market share, help to improve the marketing capability of Irish firms and increase the awareness of Irish firms and their products.</P>
    <P>The food industry is one of the most important sectors of Irish industry, accounting for some 22 per cent of total exports and about 20 per cent of all manufacturing jobs.  Because of its potential to create national wealth and employment, the development of a strong indigenous food industry is a key Government objective. There will be a new special sub-programme for the food industry to deliver an integrated and coherent development package, embracing capital <Col N="1122" /> investment, marketing, research and development and human resources measures.</P>
    <P>The projections for job creation in the food industry shown in the National Development Plan can take account of the fact that the Irish food industry has already entered a phase of rapid change and development, including a very substantial increase in added-value production. Already we have a food industry of growing efficiency and sophistication; we are not starting from scratch.</P>
    <P>Of course, the outcome of the GATT negotiations will be important for food sector exports, particularly in the beef, dairy and pigmeat sectors.  As was made clear in the report of the Expert Group on the Food Industry published earlier this year, the outcome of the GATT negotiations will have an influence on export and production targets especially in pigmeat and cheese.  Indeed that is one reason the Government is now doing its utmost to ensure that the final outcome of the GATT negotiations does not prevent growth in our food industry.  It may well be that some rationalisation will be needed in coming years in some primary processing sectors of the food industry if they are to remain competitive.  But I am confident that, with any reasonable GATT outcome, such job losses as may arise from rationalisation can be more than counter-balanced over the period of the National Development Plan &mdash; for instance, by growth in prepared consumer products and food ingredients. Those sectors, as well as drinks, in the main would not face the same risks under a GATT settlement as the primary sectors I have mentioned.  In fact, if competitively produced, in many cases they could stand to gain from cuts in protection by third priority countries.</P>
    <P>Agriculture and the food industry are vital elements not alone in the rural economy but also in the wider economy.  Agriculture accounts for about 9 per cent of GDP and 13.3 per cent of employment. However the sector is characterised by persistent problems of a structural nature, such as declining numbers, an ageing population and a substantial <Col N="1123" /> number of farmers with low incomes coupled with significant underemployment. It is important that agriculture be integrated into a wide rural development framework and that other rural development measures are undertaken to generate the necessary income and employment levels to enable family farms to survive and to ensure the existence of a vibrant rural community.</P>
    <P>Total expenditure, including associated private sector expenditure, in the areas of agriculture, rural development and forestry will be over £1,450 million. When investment in food, which I have already mentioned, and human resources is added, together with expected funding through Community initiatives and Common Agricultural Policy reform accompanying measures, the total package will be in the order of £3 billion, representing a similar percentage to the last National Development Plan.</P>
    <P>Key features of this investment include increased investment to help farmers meet new dairy hygiene standards and animal welfare requirements, provide for pollution control and for animal housing and fodder storage facilities; continued support for producer groups with greater attention to the promotion of quality output and improvement of marketing strategies; funding for the Scheme of Installation Aid for young farmers; support for alternative farm enterprises and the development of rural tourism; increased resources for compensatory headage payments, including beef, suckler cow premia, and human resources measures by Teagasc in support of farming, related rural enterprises and rural development.</P>
    <P>Taking all these measures together, including higher forestry and agri-environment subsidies, there will be a significant increase in income support for farmers.  This is partially reflected in the big increase in farm incomes over the last two years.  Despite having growth rates over three times the EC average, Ireland still has the lowest level of forestry in the Community.  A planting programme of 30,000 hectares a year to the year 2000 is <Col N="1124" /> planned, along with back-up measures in forestry, training, roads and research and development.  As I have said, the timber processing sector will be one of the key sectors for development under the industry programme.</P>
    <P>The fishing sector has shown growth in recent years but remains underdeveloped. It offers potential for further development as a contributor to economic development in coastal areas and to output and exports nationally.  Development measures will include fleet renewal through vessel construction and modernisation, aquaculture development involving both new installations and modernising existing areas, improved fish processing facilities, developments at fishery centres and fishery harbours and a programme of marine research.</P>
    <P>The present operational programme for tourism has been very successful in terms of increased foreign tourism revenue and of the jobs that revenue creates. The new programme will build on that success and has the aim of achieving an increase of £1 billion, or 50 per cent in real terms, in foreign tourism revenue by the end of 1999.  It will also aim at getting a much wider spread of tourist income throughout the year.  Total investment in tourism, between the State, the EC and the private sector, will be over £580 million to 1999.</P>
    <P>There will be increased investment in marketing and training, investments in product for specialist tourists such as activity holidays and language learning and a programme of investment to upgrade and improve tourist angling waters and our canals.  Ireland will be established in the top league of international conference venues with a major new conference centre planned for Dublin.  There will be accelerated investment in arts, culture and heritage projects.</P>
    <P>Investment of over £2.6 billion is planned in transport infrastructure.  The primary objectives of transport investment in the period will be to improve internal and access transport infrastructure and facilities on an integrated basis, and to <Col N="1125" /> improve the reliability of the transport system.</P>
    <P>We will continue to invest heavily in improving the national primary and secondary road network concentrating on four key corridors &mdash; north-south, southwest, east-west and the western corridor linking Sligo, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Rosslare.  There will also be an increased investment effort in regional and local roads of importance to local economic development.  Under this plan there will be an increased role for public transport.  There will be a major investment in upgrading of the mainline rail links.  The Dublin Transportation Initiative will be substantially advanced, including a light rail system, completion of the Dublin Ring Road, an efficient access route to Dublin port, quality bus corridors, upgrading existing suburban rail services and improved traffic management.</P>
    <P>Investment will also take place in the strategic ports of Dublin, Dun Laoghaire, Waterford, Cork, Rosslare and the Shannon estuary and in the State airports at Dublin, Shannon and Cork.</P>
    <P>Environmental infrastructure is important from the point of view of both contributing to the development of industry and tourism and protecting and enhancing our quality of life.  There will be substantial direct investment of £655 million in environmental services.  This will include investment in water and sanitary services, new and improved sewage treatment systems, projects designed to improve the quality of drinking water and the establishment of an adequate and integrated network of waste disposal installations, with appropriate provision for hazardous and non-hazardous waste.</P>
    <P>We intend to have a national clean up of litter and waste and a thorough and substantial improvement in our water and sewage treatment systems to preserve a green and healthy environment for our people.  Projects will include major coastal sewage treatment schemes in Cork, Dublin, Dundalk, Greystones, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Westport and major water schemes in Dublin, Limerick and Tuam.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1126" /> Total expenditure in the energy sector will be over £2.1 billion and policy will focus on tackling the factors which induce uncompetitive energy changes in the economy as well as maximising fuel consumption and energy infrastructure efficiencies.  Structural Funds aid will be directed at key strategic projects including a peat-fired generating station, an energy efficiency scheme, pilot projects in the development of cutaway bogs, rural energy networks and the extension of the natural gas supply to the Shannon area.</P>
    <P>There will be investment of over £850 million in telecommunications over the period.  The objective is to increase the penetration of the system from 70 to 82 telephones per 100 households.  The investment proposed will facilitate the completion of digitalisation, the expansion of the fibre optical network, significant improvements in international access and further developments in mobile services.</P>
    <P>Investment of £60 million in the postal services will include measures for the extension of the post office computer system in rural areas and the construction of modern mail centres located in the regions.</P>
    <P>The Government have included a major health investment project, Tallaght Hospital, in this plan.  Work on the construction of the hospital is due to commence next month and will finish within three and a halt years from the end of this year.  This new acute general teaching hospital will fill a major gap in the development needs of what is now the third largest urban centre in the State.</P>
    <P>The development of our human resources is essential to future growth and employment creation.  Almost £3.1 billion is to be invested in human resources over the period of the plan. The main objectives in this area will be to ensure the competitiveness of Irish industry and services through the supply of highly qualified and skilled personnel; to equip enterprise and workers with the skills necessary to cope with occupational, structural and technological change; to improve the attractiveness of <Col N="1127" /> Ireland as a location for new enterprise by having a highly educated, skilled, adaptable and versatile workforce; to promote equality in access to jobs and training and to help overcome disadvantage; and to maintain and enhance participation rates in education and training for the disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan places a major emphasis on local development, building on the experience already gained from the Pilot Area Programme in Integrated Rural Development 1988-1990, the current Leader programme, the area-based initiatives under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the Third EC Poverty Programme and the EC Global Grant for local development.  All indicate that there is considerable potential to be tapped at local level to tackle long term unemployment and to generate local development.  Inherent in that programme is the targeting of areas and communities characterised by long term unemployment and social exclusion.</P>
    <P>The sum of £1.143 million will be available to the local development programme over the period of the plan.  The programme will have four elements: a countrywide local enterprise sub programme to be administered through the county enterprise boards.  The boards will provide support for local enterprise initiatives and will fill a gap which has been identified in the current support services for local enterprise initiatives.  A sum of £114 million will be available, from the Exchequer alone, for this programme over the period of the plan; an area-based local development programme for areas characterised by a high concentration of long term unemployment, social exclusion and environmental deprivation.  This measure extends the pilot initiative of area partnership companies introduced under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which has yielded significant results in terms of enterprise and employment, community development and improved services for long term unemployed. A sum of £100 million will be <Col N="1128" /> available for this programme over the period of the plan; a substantially expanded community employment development programme (CEDP) which will replace the countrywide social employment scheme.  The CEDP contains a combination of training inputs and community work on employment specifically targeted in the long term unemployed areas.  The total available under this measure is £813 million; an urban renewal programme which will improve the fabric of the local environment with emphasis on architectural conservation and streetscapes.  A second part of this sub programme is the completion of a range of cultural facilities in the Temple Bar area of Dublin.  The urban renewal programme involves expenditure of £116 million over the period of the plan.</P>
    <P>The Government has, as part of a determination to further the local dimension of development, introduced an important new element for this National Development Plan in order that people throughout the country can better understand how the plan will affect their area. Statements of the integrated developments proposed in each sub-region are now being prepared and will be available shortly for that purpose.</P>
    <P>In implementing the development measures under the plan we will ensure that there is no direct or indirect discrimination on grounds of gender and will actively promote equal opportunities for both genders.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed at the lack of welcome for the plan so far by the Opposition parties.  Do they fail to understand the huge difference it will make to their areas?  Having failed to find anything to criticise in the plan, the burden of their complaint seems to be that it is not the budget, which deals with areas which were never intended for the plan.  This is an investment plan, an investment project, and should be debated on its merits. Let us have the budget debate next January when it is more appropriate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Such suggestions are totally at variance with the facts.  Under this plan there will be an industry operational programme from which funds will be provided for the 120,000 jobs that will be created in projects supported by the IDA and the new Forbairt in the years to 1999.</P>
      <P>Under this plan £600 million will be spent on tourism, which will support the creation of 30,000 jobs in the years to 1999.  The sum of £3 billion will be spent on agriculture, forestry and fisheries which will support the creation of 6,000 jobs in the period to 1999.</P>
      <P>The plan includes £2.6 billion to be spent on transport, which in improving the infrastructure will result in the creation of 14,000 jobs in the wider economy between now and 1999.</P>
      <P>A total of £1.26 billion will be spent on local development projects, which will create 21,000 jobs in the period to 1999.</P>
      <P>In addition, an annual average of 20,000 construction jobs will be created on roads, railways, ports, tourism, environmental services and urban renewal.  This is the factual position.  Jobs will be created in significant numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in his contribution to this debate will outline in detail the macroeconomic context both current and prospective.  Our performance has outpaced that of our EC partners in recent years but our needs are also greater than theirs.  Most importantly, unemployment here remains higher as a proportion of the labour force than in any other EC country except Spain.  Our natural rate of labour force increase is well above the EC average. Although there has been some catching up in recent years, income per head in <Col N="1130" /> Ireland is still well below the EC average. Reducing unemployment and narrowing this gap in living standards are two of our foremost economic challenges.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, the response to both these challenges &mdash; the need to create many more jobs and to bring living standards closer to the EC average &mdash; will have to come through efforts to accelerate the growth of market-led output.  We have learnt from experience that the scope for direct job creation by the State in our circumstances is severely limited.  In setting out growth and employment targets in the plan we recognised that policies and developments outside the ambit of the plan would have a major influence on these targets.  As I have said, this plan is not the budget.  Accordingly, the plan sets out both the relatively modest targets that we are confident can be achieved by the plan investments and the targets of much higher growth and employment that could be achieved if competitiveness improves and if developments in the world economy are more favourable.</P>
    <P>Economic commentators are saying our job targets and growth targets are too cautious and they believe we will do better.  The development measures in the plan should, across the various sectors, produce over 200,000 jobs gross.  Some of these are long term; some are short term arising from project construction. Without plan investments, we would not have these jobs.  This does not mean that the numbers of those at work will increase by 200,000 over the period of the plan.  Many of the short term jobs will replace current short term jobs and experience shows that some of the new long term jobs will be offset by job losses elsewhere.  Our best estimate is that there will be net non-agricultural job growth of between 70,000 and 100,000 over the period of the plan, depending on the level of wage competitiveness achieved and the strength of growth in the world economy.</P>
    <P>Last year, whereas employment was stable in Ireland, if fell in the EC as a whole.  This year, some increase in the total at work is expected in Ireland, but the rate of decline in employment in the <Col N="1131" /> EC is expectd to accelerate.  In 1994 employment growth in Ireland is expected to accelerate but it is expected to continue falling in the EC.  The fact that we can expect employment in Ireland to increase in an unfavourable international economic climate means that it can grow very fast indeed when the international upturn comes.  This is clear from our experience when the combination of our sound economic policies and a favourable international economy meant an increase in the total at work of 36,000 in the 12 months to April 1990. This was not a freak; given a recovery in the international economy and the additional boost to the productive capacity of the economy resulting from the National Development Plan we have every reason to look forward to strong employment growth in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>What is necessary now from all of us is a national commitment in support of the jobs that this plan can deliver.  The estimates for jobs in the plan are modest. Many say they are pessimistic.  Their achievement then is realistic.</P>
    <P>The Government will work to continue to provide the macro-economic stability essential to job creation and maintenance which we have had, especially since 1987. This involves: fiscal policy set in the framework of the Maastricht convergence criteria and disciplined management of the public finances consistent with exchange rate stability and moderate interest rates.</P>
    <P>The Government will, with all the social partners, shortly embark on the negotiations for a new national programme. The Government are satisfied that with goodwill a programme can be negotiated to underpin an improvement in Ireland's competitiveness relative to our trading partners.  This is vital for jobs.</P>
    <P>The Government are also satisfied, following on their discussions with ICTU yesterday, that all sides can, as constructively as they had in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> reach agreement on tax changes, in particular for the benefit of the lower <Col N="1132" /> paid in employment, that will contribute positively to the objectives for employment. They are satisfied that the successful negotiation of a new programme will allow the freeing of resources to enable us to continue and strengthen the process of tax reform while ensuring the high standard of public services we can all agree on.</P>
    <P>I look to constructive backing from this House.  We can then proceed to negotiate the Community support framework with the European Commission.  This is the essential next step so that European funds can flow, from next year to 1999, to support the jobs in this country that can and must come on stream in those years.  It is sheer nonsense to suggest that the spending of £20,000 million, our largest ever development project, will not result in a transformation of a country with 3.5 million people.  Change will come and come successfully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I speak on the details of this plan let me say a few words about the role of the Opposition.  The job of the Opposition is to wake the Irish people from sleepy consensus on every public issue.  We appear to be living in an era of icons rather than ideas.  People follow the icon rather than argue the ideas.  On every issue, Northern Ireland, jobs, pay, social legislation, there is a tendency to demand consensus and deprecate controversy.  The social partners and others who have bought into this process seem to forget that consensus is worth having only after it has been preceded by rigorous public controversy on the choices to be made.  The role of the Opposition in the Dáil is to ask the hard questions, argue the options and ensure we have a proper debate.  The Irish people have been offered no policy choices at all on the national plan.  The Taoiseach does not want us to have policy choices on Northern Ireland either because he refused yesterday to allow the Dáil debate Northern Ireland.  Let me remind the Taoiseach that in dealing with Northern Ireland we are not negotiating with some foreign power, some enemy from whom we must conceal our mind <Col N="1133" /> and our hand.  We are talking about the futue of our fellow Irishmen &mdash; Unionist and Nationalist &mdash; and on this matter the Taoiseach should be as willing to hear the views of Members as he is to hear whatever other views he is getting directly or indirectly from other quarters.</P>
      <P>The same suppression of direct argument has taken place on this National Development Plan.  The Government has refused to allow the Dáil to debate a motion on this subject; instead it just wants a series of anodyne statements that lead to no conclusion or decision.  Likewise, the Irish people were not allowed to have a fully informed debate on all the options for this plan until after a final decision was first taken by the Government and its close advisers.  The job of the Dáil, and of the Opposition, is to ensure that the Irish people get value for money for the huge investment Europe is now making in Ireland through this plan.  Unfortunately, the Government has not allowed the Dáil to do this job properly.</P>
      <P>Unlike the authorities in Northern Ireland, our Government did not publish a draft plan before sending anything to Brussels to allow the public and their representatives to look at the whole picture, to see how money could be reallocated from one area to another in order to get better value.  Instead the Irish people were treated like children &mdash; asked for their wish lists of pet local projects, but not allowed to see a draft plan which showed the whole financial picture and the real choices that had to be made.</P>
      <P>We would have had a much better plan, with much wider public support, if the Government had allowed the committees of the Dáil and local groups throughout the country to examine a draft plan line by line, before a submission was made to Brussels.  This was done in Northern Ireland.  Why was it not done here?  Because the plan was not debated in draft form by the people in this way, it is a misnomer to call it a &ldquo;national&rdquo; plan.  It is a Government plan, a Fianna Fáil/Labour plan, but not truly a national plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1134" /> It is also too narrowly focused to merit the description of a &ldquo;development&rdquo; plan. It is solely concerned with those aspects of development which qualify for EC subsidies. Many of the important factors affecting national development do not qualify for EC subsidies and for this reason the Government has not bothered to include them in this plan at all.  These omissions are in some respects much more important than the matters that are included.  The plan would have had a much better chance of achieving its laudably ambitious targets if it had dealt with all aspects of national development at the same time in the same document.  The good that will undoubtedly be done by some of the things included in this plan may be undone by failures in the areas that have been omitted.</P>
    <P>The following five matters have not been dealt with in any serious way in this plan.  The penal effect that the income tax and PRSI systems have in increasing the cost of employing people and the consequent reduction in the overall number of jobs on offer.  The imprisonment of people by the poverty traps caused by the maze of means tests, entitlement cut offs, and discriminatory treatment of children in the tax and social welfare codes.  The absence of any effective competition policy, backed by an adequately staffed competition authority, with power to initiate inquiries into overcharging and other cosy ripoffs in this country.  The lack of a comprehensive plan to stop children leaving school too early, and becoming long-term unemployed, by introducing early assessment, home visits, parental education and timely remedial help.  The failure to put job security at the top of the industrial relations agenda, and to give retraining, worker shareholding and work sharing a higher priority than short-term profits, short-term wage increases and tax subsidised redundancies.  These are the very issues this Government urges the EC to deal with in its submission on the EC Commission White Paper on employment, yet it is not bothered to deal with them at home in its own national plan.</P>
    <P>The Irish system of public administration <Col N="1135" /> has ordered its work priorities around whether a particular activity qualifies for EC funds rather than around whether it is worthwhile in itself.  This is self defeating.  Unless changes are made in tax, social welfare, education, competition policy and industrial relations, these EC moneys will not achieve their full potential.  This is no mere academic point.  The last plan did not achieve its full potential precisely because of this warping of priorities in Irish public administration.  The 1989-93 plan set out to create 175,000 jobs.  However, it created only 80,000, 70,000 more were lost, thus leaving a net increase of only 10,000.  Meanwhile 98,000 extra people emigrated and 63,000 extra people joined the dole queue.  Let me take a longer time frame, lest I be accused of being politically partisan.</P>

      <P>Since this State was founded one million people have emigrated and 95,000 fewer people are now at work here than in 1921.  In 1921 Ireland's population was almost half that of the Netherlands, now it is only a quarter.  In 1921 Ireland had the same population as Denmark, now we have less than three quarters their population. Yet those two countries were invaded, while we escaped the last war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To have a good long-term plan we must find out where Ireland failed, and where those countries succeeded.  Part of the answer lies in the neglect of science and technical studies in the Irish educational system.  In Ireland only 17 per cent of students do technical apprenticeships.  In Denmark the figure is 71 per cent, and in the Netherlands it is 60 per cent.  Only 17 per cent of Irish students do science in the leaving, as against 69 per cent doing languages.  Yet, our proficiency in even one continental language lags far behind the proficiency of the Danes and the Dutch in both English and German. Danish and Dutch companies spend generously on in-service training of their <Col N="1136" /> employees.  Irish companies spend as little as possible.</P>
    <P>A recent NESC study showed that in comparison with those two countries Irish companies have a poor record in developing new higher quality products. The NESC is very clear on what should be done about this.  The NESC report states that &ldquo;management development is the strategic priority in the development of education and training policies for economic development&rdquo;.  I have studied this National Development Plan.  The plan has not acted on that vital NESC recommendation in regard to what the national priority should be.  Huge sums are to be spent on grants for industry, but little or nothing is to be spent on training the top people in industry who are supposed to manage that money on our behalf and who until now have made a poor job of managing it in indigenous firms.</P>
    <P>This is not the only area where in-service training is lacking.  Ireland is paying a huge price for its failure to invest properly in in-service training of teachers.  We spend less on such training than most European countries.  Most of our teachers have not been on an in-service training course for ten or so years. It is impossible for them to keep up with changes in technology and society without ongoing training.  In-service training of teachers would be the single best investment we could now make.</P>
    <P>I do not have the time available to do a line by line analysis of the plan.  It is interesting to compare it with the last one.  There is a big change in transport priorities.  In the last plan £397 million was spent on ports.  That is now cut back to just £100 million.  In contrast, the amount spent on railways is to increase tenfold from £45 million to £475 million.</P>
    <P>This change in priority is not explained at all; indeed, the comparisons are not easy to make because of the peculiar changes that have been made in the format of the two documents.</P>
    <P>In their assessment of transport policy in the last plan the ESRI gave some advice about rail development which I fear the Government may have ignored.  The <Col N="1137" /> ESRI report stated that &ldquo;mainline rail investment should be evaluated on the same basis as road investment, with resources allocated to whichever provides the best return&rdquo;.  It warned against duplicating rail and road investment on the same routes, while leaving other parts of the country inadequately covered either by a good railway or a good road. Yet that is exactly what seems to have happened.  If one looks at the maps at the back of the plan, the big new road developments and the big new rail developments, both seem to run along the same arterial routes.  This plan is supposed to be part of an overall plan for the European economy.  Ireland's economy will only succeed if Europe's economy succeeds.</P>
    <P>Much has been written about the uncompetitiveness and slow employment growth of Europe, as against those of Japan and America.  Employment has grown in Europe by 10 per cent since 1960, as against 80 per cent growth in the United States.  I invite the Taoiseach to inquire on one of his frequent visits to the United States why that has happened.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach will find, contrary to the foolish case he made here at Question Time on Tuesday, that the level of taxes on employment in the United States is the key reason more new employment has been created in the United States than in Europe or in Ireland.</P>
      <P>On a $20,000 gross salary, an American employer will only have to deduct $6,340 in taxes and PRSI whereas an Irish employer wil have to deduct the equivalent of $11,932.  That is why US employers are willing to employ more people.  That is why young Irish people are looking for Morrison visas, rather than young American people looking for Reynolds visas.</P>

      <P>The exchange rate of all European currencies has been kept high but that is not the only reason for the failure of Ireland and Europe to create jobs, particularly in the last decade.  The exchange rate of all European currencies has been kept incompetively high for the last ten years.  This is because of the undue influence of the Bundesbank, of the fear of inflation and of a paranoid European attachment to particular values for national currencies as symbols of national prestige.</P>
      <P>European currency policies have the effective of maintaining an artificially high purchasing power &mdash; which may not be accidential &mdash; for the salaries of top policy makers who make currency policy and hold secure jobs.  Meanwhile Europe's growing army of unemployed are left as the only people who are asked to pay the price for Europe's uncompetitive economy.</P>
      <P>Currency policy is a form of income redistribution.  Artificially high currency values redistribute income from the poor to the rich.  The next time Ministers, including the Tánaiste, bishops and commentators decides to attack currency traders, they should pause to ask who are the real speculators in Europe's economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish agriculture is in current difficulty because it has engaged in short term thinking for the 30 years.  Not since the publication of &ldquo;Economic Development&rdquo; by T.K. Whitaker, has there been any real long term thinking about <Col N="1139" /> the future potential of this major Irish industry.</P>
    <P>The Government and the farming organisations should recognise that there is no long term future for Irish farming in reliance on income supports and quotas. These palliatives may serve the needs of the present generation of farmers, but they do not provide a basis for attracting young people into the industry.  Young people are needed in agriculture as in other areas of economic activity.</P>
    <P>The debate in Irish agriculture should be about the future for the young people who will enter agriculture in the next ten years.  Now is the time for Ireland to start preparing for the post-GATT round world.</P>
    <P>I call on the Government to commission a major research project to identify the areas of agriculture where Ireland is likely to have a competitive advantage in a free trading environment.  We should then campaign for changes in EC agriculture policies that will allow Ireland to develop comparative advantage.  Present policies present Ireland from exploiting its full agricultural potential and, if unchanged, will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>From the very outset of the present GATT round, the United States was harping on about agricultural subsidies. Before one gets carried away by the free trade rhetoric of the United States, it is worth recalling two facts.  First, it was the United States that originally sought, in 1959, to have agriculture excluded from normal world trade disciplines.</P>
    <P>Second the United States is not pursuing the same free trade approach in other areas of the world trade talks.  For example, the United States is seeking to exclude sea transport, telecommunications, financial and air transport services from GATT rules that would bar countries from discriminating in favour of domestic companies.  The United States is also opposing the proposed new powers of the multilateral trading organisation which will enable it to enforce new world trade rules. Enforcement is the biggest weakness in the present GATT arrangements.  The <Col N="1140" /> United States wants to retain the discretion to impose unilateral sanctions under its infamous section 301.  The United States is protectionist and the European Community has failed to point that out.  As a result the European Community and Ireland are in a corner in regard to agriculture because they have not carried the argument to the United States in the areas where the United States is weakest.  That is a serious failure of negotiation on the part of the Irish Government and the EC for which I hold the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Minister for Tourism and Trade personally responsible.</P>
    <P>Whatever the detailed outcome of the current round of negotiations it is likely that there will be a gradual liberalisation in world agricultural trade over the next ten to 15 years.</P>
    <P>As Dr. G.E. Boyle said in his recent study &ldquo;The Competitiveness of Irish Agriculture&rdquo;, &ldquo;The ultimate thrust of the GATT and CAP reform proposals in train at the present time is for an agriculture which is market led&rdquo;.  This is not necessarily bad news for Ireland, in the long run.  The study by Dr. Boyle showed that Irish agriculture is actually more competitive than agriculture in other EC countries.  We should therefore be better able to hold our own in an open world market than most other EC states.  That does not mean that the transition to free trade would be an easy one, but it does mean that we could survive, while others would go to the wall.</P>
    <P>Having reviewed the milk, cattle, cereals and lamb sectors, Dr. Boyle concluded that &ldquo;Ireland is more efficient than its competitors anywhere in the world in milk and cereal production, but less competitive in beef and sheep meat.&rdquo; The general thrust of Dr. Boyle's paper which has been completely neglected in the discussion on the National Development Plan and generally in debate has been that Ireland could gain, in the long run, from the freeing of world trade. Ireland has a natural competitive advantage. Therefore we should be looking for policies in the EC that allow Ireland <Col N="1141" /> gradually to strengthen its agriculture in those areas where it has a competitive advantage.  This will not happen unless the Government is willing to invest in identifying those areas where we have a competitive advantage.  The Government has not undertaken any recent analysis on the worldwide competitiveness of Irish agriculture.  It has no strategy for Irish agriculture.  There is no national agricultural plan.  It is simply a question of waiting for the EC to make the decisions and then trying to get as much money as possible from the EC.  The research that should have taken place to enable us on scientific evidence to identify and build on our competitive advantage in agriculture has been axed by successive Governments as a short term financial economy measure.</P>
    <P>Since 1981 State expenditure on agricultural research has been cut by 50 per cent.  The Government seems to think that unless there is an EC subsidy for something in the agricultural area, it should not be funded.  As a result, Ireland spends only one-fifth as much per acre on agricultural research as the Netherlands and only five or six people are involved in serious beef research here.  The age profile of those engaged in agricultural research is too high.  It is well known that original research tends to come from younger people and the age profile here, where the average age is about 50, is probably the highest in the world.</P>
    <P>Even if we were carrying out the necessary research on our long term comparative advantage, present EC policies stop us from redirecting our efforts towards areas where we have a long term potential for growth because we are limited by quotas which prevent efficient people from expanding.  All the major agricultural products we produce are subject to some form of quota control. Quota-based policies are anathema to the exploitation of competitive advantage. Unless we are resigned, as the Government seems to be, to the fact that our agriculture will never be competitive in the world market, then quota-based policies are not the best policies for Ireland. As Dr. Boyle pointed out, a quota system <Col N="1142" /> establishes a monopoly in production rights and, like any monopoly, it has inevitable economic costs.  He also made the point that a quota-based system reduces the incentive to engage in the research that would improve production efficiency.  He said that a quota environment engenders myopia and the incentive to conduct research and development becomes increasingly blunted. These policies must be changed because many people can gain a living from the land and from the markets.  As long as the neglect of research continues, and as long as the quota policies prevent efficient Irish farmers from increasing production, we will not be able to preserve any viable jobs in rural Ireland. We will simply turn rural Ireland into a glorified retirement home and that is not a desirable future for anybody.</P>
    <P>One of the most serious deficiencies in this plan is its failure to analyse Ireland's long term comparative agricultural advantage.  We have looked at how we can get more money from the EC, and how we can maintain incomes in agriculture but we have not looked at our future, at the fact that there is substantial potential for expansion in agriculture or at the fact that Ireland is more efficient in certain aspects of agriculture than any other country, but has been prevented from exploiting that efficiency by the imposition of quotas.</P>
    <P>The outcome of this plan might be that we will have better roads to get our people to the emigrant planes quickly and to allow imports to reach markets in most remote parts of Ireland but we might not necessarily provide permanent jobs for our people.  We will not provide permanent jobs because this is only an investment plan in physical infrastructure and in some aspects of training.  The plan does not address the blockages in the system, in our competition policy, our tax policy or in our social welfare policy that prevent any investment coming into this economy, from flowing through the economy achieving the maximum multiplier effect and the maximum job creation.</P>
    <P>Of course, this money is welcome.  We <Col N="1143" /> are entitled to it and those who negotiated are entitled to credit for getting it, but we are likely to lose the greater gain due to our obsession with our success in the smaller gain, because we have not taken the parallel steps necessary to remove the blockages in the economy so as to ensure that we get full value from this money.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael will harp on that point and we will not be deterred by those who suggest that we do not really need a debate on this.  A very unhealthy atmosphere is developing in politics here. Deputy Lenihan, for example, suggested that nobody was entitled to question Northern Ireland policy in this State, that journalists were not allowed to question it and now it seems that politicians will not be allowed to question it either, because the Taoiseach will not allow the Dáil to debate Northern Ireland.  Yet, those who are still engaged in terrorism are to be allowed to pass messages to the Taoiseach while we cannot do so.  The atmosphere which does not allow open debate, whether on the national plan or on Northern Ireland, does not give us a chance of getting the best out of our people.</P>
    <P>The Government should recognise that it would have benefited and would still benefit from allowing freely expressed criticism about a draft development plan if it had the courage to publish it in April and that we would have had a better plan now if the Government had been open about this.  The Government is simply telling the people that it will not disclose the overall picture and that it wants the people's ideas on some matters while it will make all the decisions.  The Government, by approaching the matter in this paternalistic way, has failed to achieve the full potential of the people.  Thousands of people who are not programme managers or civil servants have good ideas but they have not been taken into the Government's confidence.  Members on this side of the House who have good ideas would be willing and able to make a constructive contribution and offer constructive <Col N="1144" /> criticism of proposals but they have not been allowed do so.</P>
    <P>This plan was sent to Brussels before it was published here.  It was sent to Brussels last Friday and we did not get it until Tuesday.  Is there any greater illustration of the closed nature of Irish politics and the deadeningly complacent consensus that the Government knows best and that nobody else should have anything to say, than the fact that the Government sent its plan to Brussels before allowing the Irish people to see it, let alone debate it?  That is what is wrong with public administration here and with a Government with a majority of 38.  Only a Government with such a majority would be so smug to think it can get away with anything, that it can produce speeches and statements like those by Deputy Lenihan to wave aside anybody who wants to express a dissenting view and that nobody else is entitled to speak except the Government and its chosen friends.</P>
    <P>In the Fine Gael Party there are 45 Deputies who do not accept that cosy consensus, who will insist on their right to speak and criticise.  The Government if it has a proposal should have the courage to put it to a vote in the House and not simply ask for a series of anodyne statements without allowing Members to put an alternative proposal to the House.</P>

Yet, when we asked for a motion to be put to the House, when we might have been in a position to give the Taoiseach our backing for this plan, our request was refused.

Ministers travelled around their constituencies to pick out projects, in Santa Claus fashion, for inclusion in the plan.</P>

      <P>The Irish Commissioner, Mr. Flynn, whom I know very well, said of the 1977 Fianna Fáil manifesto that it was the greatest publication since the bible.  I think we could say of this plan that it is probably the second greatest publication since the Bible and will be much quoted but when it comes to action it will do little.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach may ask what is wrong with the plan.  It is a Santa Claus plan to spend money.  It is a bit like having a house with rising damp, where the roof is leaking and there is dry rot.  What does the Government do?  It builds on an annex and employs the most expensive interior designer to paint and decorate the building.  It will look good for a short time but before long the rot will spread and the house will collapse.  That is the problem with the economy; we have fundamental problems which have not been addressed in the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night I watched the Minister of State on television deal with some of the contradictions in the plan.  She said it was not the budget, that the question of tax reform would be dealt with in the budget. <Col N="1149" /> We have had one budget from the Government in which a 1 per cent income levy was imposed, jobs were taxed and the rate of VAT on the intensive labour sectors, such as clothing, was increased to 21 per cent.  We are already aware of the Government's attitude to taxation. Tackling job creation without addressing the question of tax reform is like filling a bucket that has no bottom with water. This makes no sense.  It is not sustainable and and will do nothing to generate employment for those coming onto the labour market, never mind those who are unemployed at present.</P>
    <P>Even if we accept the Taoiseach's figure and include 1993 &mdash; perhaps the Government thinks that the £8 billion from the European Community is free money &mdash; between now and the year 2000 we will spend £8 billion on the 300,000 people who are currently unemployed.  That is the amount we will spend at current prices even if no more are added to the unemployment figures.  As the Taoiseach is aware, economic forecasters have already said that by the end of the plan there will be 400,000 people unemployed. This is a plan to spend money in a Santa Claus fashion around the country.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report has been ignored by the Government.  We have new Departments and 26 new county enterprise boards.  What has been done in regard to Culliton's desire to have lower telecommunications costs?  The Taoiseach made great play of the fact that £850 million will be allocated for telecommunications, but would it not be much better to keep the prices down instead of increasing them?  We should provide competition for Telecom Eireann.  Why has the cost of international calls come down?  The answer is that Telecom Eireann was faced with competition from abroad and had no alternative but to bring its prices down. The local customer and the ordinary small business person will have to pay higher costs.  This flies in the face of the Culliton report.</P>
    <P>Culliton told us that we need to reduce our energy costs but I wonder if the Taoiseach's commitment to spend more <Col N="1150" /> money on peat generation will lead to a reduction in energy costs.  I would like to hear the Taoiseach's and the Government's response.  Where is the economic sense in this?</P>
    <P>Not only was the Culliton report ignored when this Government's structures were put in place &mdash; we have a new Department of Trade &mdash; it was ignored when this plan was put together.  That is disappointing.  We should not engage in rhetoric claiming to support the Culliton report unless the important proposals contained in the report will be put into effect from day one.  Time is running out for the economy.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach may be upset when I say this is not a business plan but I can do no better than quote what one business person had to say.  We have all heard of Bewleys and know of Patrick Campbell. Indeed, when the Labour Party was last in Government it was proposed that a State board &mdash;&ldquo;An Bord Bun&rdquo;&mdash; should be established to run it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>A sticky bun.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to quote what Patrick Campbell said because the interests of small businesses were not taken into account in this plan.  In an article in the business section of <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 10 October 1993 he stated:</P>
      <P>We employ nearly 2,000 in this country and will retain our roots in Ireland, but our plans for further growth must focus on economies where our enterprise can breathe freely, and where hard work and perseverence are valued and respected.  In two more years, we expect to employ 1,000 people in other countries.  In five years time we will probably employ more people abroad than we do in Ireland.</P>
      <P>He went on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Guinness did it a long time ago, Jacobs did it a short time ago.  Irish Distillers is French, Jacobs too.  Geoff Reid has even called it a day at Ballygowan. <Col N="1151" /> What's been happening to all our indigenous industry, and why?</P>
    <P>He spoke about the high levels of taxation. I could quote the whole article and it would say succinctly what I myself believe.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>The business sector and the PAYE workers bemoan their tax burdens and bicker about who is paying the lion's share.  The Government is over-managing the economy through the introduction of restrictive regulations which have undermined competitiveness and draconian measures which cause many ordinary business people to feel threatened and alarmed.</P>
    <P>That is the view not just of Patrick Campbell but of almost every business person that I know.  A small business person setting up a corner shop, perhaps providing freight and haulier business, has to pay seven different taxes to the Government before he earns a penny or employs anybody.  That is not only economic madness but bureaucratic nonsense. Until we get the fundamentals right in the economy, make it rewarding for people to employ others, reward effort and enterprise and make people who have flair and are prepared to take the risks feel important and not as if they are doing something wrong and should go somewhere else, they will leave their money in the bank and, for most of them, that would be far more financially gainful but would not be productive to the economy.  We have to export two-thirds of what we make if we are to sustain existing jobs.  There is no point in throwing money around like confetti.  We have spent billions over the years but unemployment continues to rise.  At the end of the day, unless we get the fundamentals right, we will have 400,000 people unemployed resulting in huge alienation not just from the institutions of State but from the country itself.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we have a very young population. We have the best educated English-speaking population in Europe.  It is time we recognised the talents of our own population, inspired hope in people, <Col N="1152" /> made people want to do something for Ireland and for themselves.  It is time we fostered the concept of self-reliance. Helping those who want to help themselves is my solution to our economic problems.  Most people want to help themselves.  They do not want handouts and they do not want people to do things for them.  What they want is to be allowed to get on with their own lives and take home more of what they earn.</P>
    <P>Great play is being made of the £8 billion from Europe.  The Government considers it free money.  We saw all the pomp and ceremony at Dublin Castle yesterday.  What is behind it?  If, for example, we took that £8 billion off the national debt it would save us each year a minimum of £500 million.  What could that do for employment?  If we started with low income earners, if we removed PRSI from the first £3,000 of income, that would reduce employer costs by, on average, £7 a week and give the low income earner an extra £4 per week in his pocket, far more than he would get as a result of negotiations under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> Would it not make sense to start reducing the cost of employment, thus giving people more disposable income? The average earner is not concerned about gross income.  What he is concerned about is what he takes home at the end of the week.  Many would be better off if they never went out to work.  The way we have managed and run this country over many years is a terrible indictment. We cannot have a plan like this with all the confusion about whether it is from 1993 or 1994 to 1999.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us make up our minds what the plan is for.  The other day the Minister of State said that if we could become more competitive in the context of wage costs by even 1 per cent that would increase our job numbers of 4,000 per year.  If we were to do that over the period of the plan, six or seven years, there would be an increase of, perhaps, 24,000 gross&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a net increase of 24,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>We would net between 10,000 and 16,000 extra jobs.  What could be done under this plan?  At the most 10,000 jobs per annum could be created and that is the best case scenario.  Does it not make sense to go down the road of tax reform and changing the competitive anomalies that exist in our economy rather than down the road of the big spend?  Of course there are things in the plan that will help our competitiveness.  Our road network will be improved &mdash; I welcome that because it is long overdue &mdash; and hauliers and others will have easier access to markets.</P>
      <P>Let us look at what is proposed for our ports.  Why is so much business traffic going to Larne rather than to Irish ports? It is mainly because of the frequency of sailings and lower costs.  How can we compete with Larne?  Is it wise to invest scarce resources in the development of six ports?  Could we not concentrate on two?  The plan proposes to invest a small amount of money in six ports and, at the end of the day, we will end up in exactly the same position; Larne will still be more competitive, will still have more frequent sailings, and it will still be better for Irish business wishing to gain access to international markets to go out through Larne.  It makes no sense to spread the money around like confetti.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This plan has much of the Santa Clause about it.  Every Minister at the Cabinet Table had to get something, and it looks good.  Thankfully it is long past the time when people were impressed by this kind of big spending.  There are no votes to be gained from that kind of spending any <Col N="1154" /> more and people are becoming cynical about all politicians as a result of such spending.  The Taoiseach should look again at the proposal relating to ports with a view to ensuring that goods can get to international markets quickly, efficiently and more cheaply from the Republic than they can from Larne.</P>
    <P>In regard to working arrangements in this country I accept that even with tax reform, even with some of the proposals in this plan, we will not be able to provide jobs for the numbers currently unemployed and the 25,000 people coming on to the labour market each year to the end of the decade.  What are the alternatives? I strongly believe in the concept of workfare, often labelled a right wing concept but a sensible one.  In the course of my work as a public representative I see people losing self-esteem.  They feel worthless.  They are increasingly marginalised. However, they do not want the handout of the dole.  They want to participate in the economy and make a worthwhile contribution to their community. The sooner the better we recognise that.  We are breeding generation upon generation of unemployed people who are alienated not just from politics but from society at large, resulting in extra costs in our health services, strain on family life etc.  Unfortunately the unemployed are concentrated mainly in our larger towns and cities such as Cork, Dublin and Limerick.  It is not just that the people themselves and their families feel alienated; even neighbours feel choked.  That is all down to our big spend, high taxation, borrowing mentality which festers in politics like cancer.  Unless we fundamentally change not only the way we organise our economy but the way we think about the people who make up this country, we will have even more difficulties than the one I mentioned.</P>
    <P>As the Leader of a smaller Opposition party I feel that this Dáil is being further marginalised each day by the Government, which holds the Dáil in total disrespect. What we have are set speeches, not debates.  Most of the debate about politics goes on outside the House.  We are not just marginalising the Dáil by <Col N="1155" /> allowing that to happen, we are damaging democracy.  The best debates are taking place on the airwaves and in debating societies.  Debates on the economy are organised by business organisations all around Ireland.  I regret that very much.</P>
    <P>I would say to the Taoiseach that I will offer on behalf of my party effective but constructive Opposition.  I do not believe in the politics of Opposition for the sake of opposition.  The Taoiseach will not find me wanting in giving support where I believe it is merited, particularly on Northern Ireland and many sensitive issues with which people have unfortunately played politics for too long.  I do not intend engaging in that kind of politics.  I want the Taoiseach in return to understand that he will have no blank cheques and that he cannot continue with this complacent attitude towards the Dáil.  Many of the new Members who came in here in a blaze of glory last November are already deeply disillusioned with the way we do our business in Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>What about the committee system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to be helpful. I accept that the committee system has improved matters, but there is much more room for improvement &mdash; for example, Ministers are not accountable to the committees.  This Dáil must be the place where we have real debate, where we restore confidence and respectability to politics.  That will not happen outside. But it will only happen if we show respect towards this institution.  If we do not do so we will not only marginalise the Dáil and ourselves but we will do untold damage to democracy, we will further alienate people from the democratic process and we will play into the hands of those who want to damage this country not just economically but politically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret we cannot vote on this plan or put forward any meaningful amendment to it.  I wonder what is the point of this debate.  I hope it is the last debate of this kind that takes place.  Whether we are <Col N="1156" /> negotiating in relation to Northern Ireland or with the social partners, I want the Taoiseach and the Government in general to come in here to consult with and to seek the advice, help and views of the Opposition.  That is much more important when a Government has a huge majority, as has this one, than when a Government has a majority of three or four.  It has been my experience that a Government with a small majority is always more alert and accountable.  A Government with such an unprecedented majority as has this Government is in real danger of alienating many people from politics and many people who were elected to Dáil Éireann to represent their constituents will believe it is worthless.</P>
    <P>In spite of my reservations about the plan I wish it well.  It is a fundamentally flawed plan.  It is not aimed at improving business or jobs and it is not an economic plan.  Therefore, it is a plan that will do greater damage to the economy.  The Government should reconsider some of the central features of the plan.  In particular, the Government must realise that until we reward incentive and enterprise we will not generate jobs.  Until we realise that problems are not solved by throwing money at them we will not get the fundamentals right and we will not repair the house.  The rot will spread and the whole building will eventually collapse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the two previous speakers in regretting that we are not having a real debate on this plan.  We are discussing a document that has been already submitted to the EC Commission. We cannot vote on it and we cannot change it.  We can do nothing with it: it is already a <i>fait accompli.</i> The Taoiseach expressed some surprise that Members of the Opposition are critical of this plan.  There is nothing left for the Opposition to do but critically examine this plan.  In response to some of the comments from Deputy Harney the Taoiseach asked what about the committee system in relation to Dáil reform.  What about the committee system?  Why was this plan in its draft form not put before one of the committees for detailed examination <Col N="1157" /> in the last three or four months? That would have been a much more productive use of the time of the committees than the kind of Second Stage debates that are now taking place on virtually every amendment that comes before those committees on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>It is of course no accident that that procedure has not been followed.  It was never intended by the Government that this plan be debated properly in the House.  If we go back to the conception of this partnership Government, the £8 billion was the glimmer in the Taoiseach's eye that gave rise to this partnership.  I recall very distinctly the position after the general election.  When the Taoiseach attended the Edinburgh Summit it was accepted by people in general, including those in Fianna Fáil, that Fianna Fáil was destined for a period in Opposition.  The £8 billion package emerged from the Edinburgh Summit and suddenly there was a new mood in Fianna Fáil, a mood that this was Fianna Fáil money, that there was £8 billion to spend and that Fianna Fáil would have its hand in spending it.  Before you could say &ldquo;partnership Government&rdquo; there was a document in front of the Labour Party inviting them to participate in this arrangement.  The £8 billion was the dowry that gave rise to this partnership Government.  It is regrettable that the passive partners in Government, the Labour Party, is going along with this arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we have a plan before us which is very laudable in terms of objectives and which is described in terms of operational programmes, beneath the text of the plan is the layer which really counts, that is, the individual projects.  Who is going to get the £8 billion, just as who got the £3.5 billion of the last programme?  Whose land is going to be bought for the road plans that are set out in this document? Who are already up the back stairs to this Government with their individual projects looking for funding, slipped in under the various operational programmes? What little schemes, dressed up perhaps in some cases as community schemes, are already being lined up strategically, with the involvement of <Col N="1158" /> Government people, to qualify for funding under these schemes?  It was never intended that there would be a proper debate on this plan, because beneath all the nice language in the plan is the worst, old-style kind of Fianna Fáil patronage, a form of patronage that, regrettably, now seems to have the blessing of the passive partners in the partnership Government.</P>
    <P>On 20 July last we were told that the £8 billion was finally in the bag, give or take a couple of bob.  The National Development Plan published ten weeks later can only be described as an anticlimax, a tragic comedy which learns few lessons from the past and offers little hope for the future.  The plan is perched atop the crumbling edifice of failed economic policies, a tax system in urgent need of reform, unemployment hovering around 300,000 and slavish adherence to EC monetary policies increasingly dictated by Bonn.  This plan is not located in any global context: at a time of increasing economic interdependence it fails to take accounts of the issues raised by the Rio Earth Summit or the entire North-South construction and there is merely a token nod in the direction of GATT.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan supposedly represents total investment of £20 billion, a figure which, like past exploits, grows in the telling, as private investment and Exchequer expenditure are tacked on at either end.  Whatever the real figure &mdash; we will only know that in 1999 &mdash; this level of capital investment cannot be treated as a political slush fund, a bigger and better version of the national lottery.</P>
    <P>The formulation of this plan has been governed by under-the-counter government relieved by a series of inspired leaks.  Despite repeated demands from Democratic Left, the Government refused to publish the plan until it was submitted to the Commission, thus effectively muzzling any meaningful input from the community of social partners.</P>
    <P>As we head into the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> negotiations, the formulation of the National Development Plan has been marked by <Col N="1159" /> concealment rather than consensus.  In June my party set out certain markers against which the plan should be measured.  We pointed out that during the 1989-93 round of funding approximately 14 per cent of the working population and a mere 5 per cent of the total population got over 50 per cent of all EC funding.  During the last round of funding we received the highest allocation on a <i>per capita</i> basis, yet we created fewer jobs and benefited fewer people than any of the other objective 1 regions.</P>
    <P>It is especially interesting to note that the massive funds poured into agriculture during the last funding period did nothing to halt the haemorrhage of people from the land.  This is not surprising considering that a mere 20 per cent of farmers received 80 per cent of funds.  In fact, not only were agricultural jobs lost but net value-added per person employed in agriculture actually declined during the last funding period.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan's ultimate aim, in EC terms, is to increase GDP.  Agriculture represents only 9 per cent of Irish GDP, yet when Common Agricultural Policy subsidies are added to Structural and Cohesion Funds spending in this sector will again be disproportionately funded, at the expense of local development projects and the development of indigenous industry.</P>
    <P>After hearing the proposals for the current round, I see little reason to change that analysis.  I was interested in the overall tone of the Taoiseach's speech today which seemed to be somewhat different to that used at the presentation of the plan in Dublin Castle earlier this week. The theme earlier in the week was that this plan would create 200,000 jobs; the theme of the Taoiseach's contribution today, particularly when one adds the one or two pages which were not in his original script, seemed to be that this was a plan which would be good for farmers.</P>
    <P>In June, Democratic Left also emphasised the need for a &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; concept of development, formulated and implemented at every stage in concert with local communities.  Despite the lip-service <Col N="1160" /> paid to partnership in the plan, there is little evidence of any real change. Certainly, the third sector has not been involved to any significant degree, and this is not for want of effort on their part. Numerous submissions were sent to the Government by a variety of small community groups who know the problems and want to be part of the solution.  In many cases these submissions were ignored.  Instead, all the input was channelled through the regional review subcommittees whose geographical ambit was so wide as to prohibit them from taking on board localised concerns. Those committees were established because it was found during the lifetime of the last plan that there was no adequate regional structure in place for consultation and monitoring of the plan.</P>
    <P>I submit that social, economic and structural problems are different in various areas.  For example, the problems in Dún Laoghaire are different to the problems in Tallaght or Arbour Hill and cannot simply be dealt with by a greater Dublin sub-regional review committee.  I would argue that programmes impacting on local communities must be developed by those communities if we are to see any real benefit.  Unfortunately, all we are getting from the Government is a kindergarten approach: administration by bureaucrats, through bureaucrats and for bureaucrats still seems to be the order of the day.  The democratic deficit seems to be still in place so far as this plan is concerned.</P>
    <P>The EC component of these funds is allocated in accordance with very clear and specific criteria and it will only be paid out if the EC is fully satisfied with our proposals for a National Development Plan, which is by no means certain.</P>
    <P>Partnership, of course, is not merely a local but also a national and European concept.  The EC Committee of the Regions was established under the Maastricht Treaty to ensure local input into all programmes impacting on the Community's regions.  The Committee of the Regions will have an advisory role, will comprise representatives from regional and local bodies such as local authorities <Col N="1161" /> and will have a say in the allocation and supervision of funds and projects.  The committee's influence on regional policy is potentially enormous.</P>
    <P>It is amazing that up to last week the Government had failed to nominate Ireland's nine representatives to that committee.  This could seriously impede the work of this committee, especially with regard to the Structural Funds and Community initiatives.  I fear that the delay may be due to internal bickering within the Government as to which constituencies, parties and sectional interests are to be represented on the committee. No doubt favours are being called in and favours are being granted &mdash; a certain person got the Commission job, another person got the Court of Auditor's job and now certain people are to get the positions on the Committee of the Regions.  For the first time through the Committee of the Regions the regions of Europe, especially peripheral countries such as Ireland, will have a real say in where the money goes.  It would be scandalous if this chance to partly remedy the democratic deficit was sacrificed to petty internal squabbling.</P>
    <P>We get these funds as an Objective 1 region on the grounds that our GDP is less than 75 per cent of the EC average. The funds are meant to bring us over that 75 per cent &mdash; that is the real meaning of cohesion.  Unless the National Development Plan fulfils that criterion, it is worthless in EC terms.  There is little or no evidence to show that the plan will either increase our GDP or fulfil any meaningful social objective.  It is a plan meant to create jobs but which provides only schemes.  It is a plan based on the Maastricht principles of cohesion and convergence but it does little to promote social cohesion or convergence between the haves and the have-nots in Ireland. This is a plan of notions &mdash; notional figures and notional projections; it is predicated on a constant growth rate of 3.4 per cent per annum from now until 1999; it is intended to create 200,000 jobs and it depends on substantial private investment.</P>
    <P>I would welcome a detailed analysis of <Col N="1162" /> the growth rate projections and I would like to know what, if any, variables have been taken into account.  With regard to the job projections, let us not forget that unemployment rose substantially during the lifetime of the last round of Structural Funds.  It is estimated that by the end of this plan's lifetime we may have an unemployment level of approximately 400,000.  The net employment gain is unlikely to be more than 70,000 jobs. This does not represent much of a return on an investment of £20 billion.  After all, a rehash of past policies is likely to produce past results.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, this plan has been formulated in a global vacuum; yet job creation today is influenced not just by the decisions taken in Dublin but also by those taken in Brussels, New York and Tokyo.  A clear-headed analysis of current and future international developments would have enabled us to develop a programme not merely of job creation but also of job maintenance, something which has been omitted from this plan. There has been no mention of how existing jobs can be maintained.  This is a remarkable omission from the plan given that the Government concedes that the leakage from existing employment is likely to be in the order of 130,000 jobs over the lifetime of the plan.  Yet current Government policies are working against job maintenance, thus negating much of what is positive in the plan.</P>
    <P>The Government's intransigent stance on the GATT talks, its persistent tunnelvision which focuses on farm subsidies to the exclusion of the rest of the economy could cost us jobs in the long term.  At this juncture I appeal to the Government to re-think that policy.</P>
    <P>A successful conclusion of the current GATT round, and the ensuing tariff reductions, would boost our manufacturing industry and help halt the jobs haemorrhage.  The reduction of tariffs on textiles, in particular, would give a much needed boost to an industry crippled by the Government's VAT hike.  Yet, by blindly following the French down the agricultural <i>cul-de-sac,</i> the Government is prepared to sacrifice existing jobs to a <Col N="1163" /> sector which produces just 9 per cent of our GDP.</P>
    <P>It is absurd that, either by active intervention or, as in the case of Digital, passive neglect, the Government is engaged in a programme of job reduction.  This plan is supposed to create 200,000 jobs yet it is also acknowledged that 130,000 jobs will be lost in the economy over the lifetime of that plan.  The Government has produced a plan which supposedly focuses on our infrastructure and peripherality problems yet at the same time it will decimate our national carrier.  The Cahill rescue plan was an expensive act of vandalism: the costs of this rescue plan to Aer Lingus, the Exchequer and the north side of Dublin are as yet incalculable. All of these actions were followed by passivity.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable that for the past few months British Midland and Ryanair have been virtually camped in Brussels lobbying the Commission and, in the case of British Midland, lodging an official complaint against Aer Lingus, yet it is only today that representatives of Aer Lingus as a company are preventing themselves in Brussels to argue the case for Aer Lingus.  This raises a very simple question: why was Aer Lingus as a company not in Brussels matching the cases its competitors were making?  I have been informed that there was an instruction to the management of Aer Lingus not to lobby independently the European Commission in relation to the plan.  I cannot see any other explanation why, despite all the talk about the Commission's attitude to the Aer Lingus package and despite the fact that Aer Lingus's competitors were batting for their case, nobody presented from Aer Lingus.  The first presentation was made by the company's trade unions last week.</P>
    <P>There is much emphasis in this plan on the question of industry, but a fundamental weakness of the plan is its failure to comprehend the basic importance of the innovation process in national economic success.  A recent report by the National Economic and Social Council identified the lack of a national system of <Col N="1164" /> innovation as the single most important cause of Ireland's relative lack of economic success compared to other small European economies such as Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Austria and Switzerland.</P>
    <P>Repeated surveys show Ireland coming out at the bottom of the world league table of national expenditure on research and development, an essential ingredient in the innovation process.  The most successful countries are those which spend the most on research and development such as Japan and Germany.  This is not surprising.  Only 5 per cent of Irish manufacturing companies carry out any research and development.  In fact, research and development spending by Irish firms declined by almost 10 per cent between 1988 and 1990.  Successful economies increased their research and development spending during recessionary periods in order to enhance their technological and organisational ability to both survive recession and to be in a position to better exploit the next expansionary period.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report says that technological competence is one of the main keys to competitive advantage.  There is no evidence of any understanding of this basic fact in the National Development Plan.  None of the 15 chapters is devoted to this topic.  In fact, it does not even merit a subheading.  Technological weakness is not included in the list of weaknesses of the economy which are spelled out in page 24.  What is even more unfortunate is that where the plan does mention research and development it actually provides for a reduction in spending in both absolute and relative terms over the planned period.  Thus in the chapter on industry spending on research and development is projected to decline from £61 million to £58 million between 1994 and 1997 and from 24.4 per cent of total public expenditure on industrial development in 1994 to 22.2 per cent in 1999.  This is in line with the 20 per cent reduction in the national science and technology budget in 1993 and represents an unbelievably short-sighted and narrowminded view of the role of technological <Col N="1165" /> development in the economic development process.</P>
    <P>Instead, the plan trots out the old notion that wage competitiveness is the only factor in international success.  Unit wage costs in Irish industry have dropped by almost a half <i>vis-à-vis</i> our main competitors since 1980 with little impact on job creation here.  In those industries in which wage costs are of a major significance we have no chance of competing with the low wage countries of the Third World.  The only industries where we can hope to gain competitive advantage are those where the key ingredients of success are innovation in products, processes and organisational and marketing techniques. These require a substantial amount of ongoing investment, much of which will generate no return but some of which offers the potential of high returns. However, risky investment seems to be entirely foreign to both the business and political communities in Ireland.  Ultimately, the aim of the Structural Funds, upon which the National Development Plan is based, is to tackle the structural weaknesses which are inhibiting economic development in Ireland.  This plan signally fails to address a fundamental structural weakness in the Irish economy &mdash; or lack of innovation capacity.  By failing to tackle this weakness head on, the plan is inevitably doomed to massive under achievement if not outright failure.</P>
    <P>Emphasis has been put on the whole question of what are called local community initiatives and local community development.  What we are witnessing here is a stroke of genius.  The Government is in effect getting the European Community to pay our dole bill because the community employment development programmes, which have been referred to and which have been much lauded in this plan, are really no more than a souped up version of the social employment schemes which, in turn, are nothing more than a temporary excuse to tamper with the numbers of people on the live register.  Indeed, despite the comments that have been made by the Minister of State, who claimed that Ireland does not want to be a low wage economy, <Col N="1166" /> these social employment schemes and community employment development programmes are contributing very significantly to making this a low wage economy. They are certainly no substitute for employment in the real sense.  They cannot be offered as contributing to the growth of employment or any kind of sustainable employment in the country.</P>
    <P>The local development programme refers also to the question of urban renewal for which £116 million has been set aside, of which £34 million is to be spent on the Temple Bar project alone. That leaves only £82 million for urban renewal in the vastly deprived inner city areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and many different areas around the country where there is a need for urban renewal. The Temple Bar project is a welcome one, but it will do little or nothing to combat the problems of unemployment, exclusion and urban decay for the majority of Dubliners.  Long term jobs flowing from that project are as yet unquantified and it is unlikely to attract tourism of itself, although it may well be incorporated into some tourist itineraries.</P>
    <P>We have to make a distinction between the &ldquo;yuppification&rdquo; of some areas of the inner cities and the kind of urban renewal which will give to the people who belong to those urban areas and whose communities are based there the right to keep their communities together, the right to decent housing and the right to investment in their communities.  It does not appear to me that we will get that and I very much regret that the amount of money which is made available for urban renewal projects is so little when one removes the Temple Bar project from the equation.</P>
    <P>The litmus test of this plan is whether it will create jobs.  That, of course, has yet to be seen, but it is a plan which is the product of failed economic thinking. It is a plan which has already given us 300,000 people out of work.  It is a plan which seems to be based on the same kind of presumptions on which the last plan was based.  As I said at the outset, it is essentially a Fianna Fáil plan and I <Col N="1167" /> would like to ask the Labour Party, since so many of its Members are present to hear my contribution on this topic, where is the evidence in this plan of the Labour Party's economic thinking or the contribution that it has made to it?</P>
    <P>This plan is essentially the same plan that we have been given before and it is based on the same ideas as the previous plan.  In its publicity blurb it has been presented as a plan that will create large numbers of jobs.  Yet on the Government's own acknowledgment the numbers of jobs it will create will be erode by a massive number of job losses.  Further, given that the net number of jobs does not come anywhere near the number required even to keep us standing still, this is a plan which by 1999 will leave us with a greater number of people unemployed here than we have today.  In my view, a plan, spending £20 billion, which sets out to make employment its central objective and which ends up leaving us with a greater number of people unemployed at the end rather than at the beginning is a failure.</P>

      <P>Deputy John Bruton in his contribution urged the Government to focus on early school leavers, on in-company training and on in-service training of teachers.  I am very gad to be able to inform Deputy John Bruton that these are all well provided for in the plan itself. If he has any difficulty in finding them we will show him where they are.  He reiterated the suggestion made by many people in recent days that the plan should tackle tax reform.  I would have to say that Deputy John Bruton, as a former Minister for Finance, with some experience of imposing taxes, should know that tax changes are made in the context of the budget and not halfway through the year.</P>

    <P>I can say to Deputy Gilmore that we will be able to supply him with any figures he wishes in relation to the growth rate forecasts.  Indeed, it is very important that all Members of this House be supplied with the criteria on which this plan is based.

      <P>The spending on research and development is very much highlighted in the plan, in the food area and others.  If one looks throughout the plan one will see that there is a substantial increase in research and develoment.  If we are to compete we must export our produce.  We must manufacture, we must export, we must compete on research and development.  Everybody in this House know that.  If the Deputy looks through the plan in detail he will see it.  I will be glad to supply all the figures.  There is <Col N="1169" /> nothing to be hidden in relation to what this plan is based on.</P>
      <P>There was the suggestion of more jobs. Of course, we could have sought greater job intensity initially &mdash; that could happen on a short term spend &mdash; but, quite frankly, I do not think that would solve our problems.  What we are seeking are long term, sustainable jobs in a competitive economy.</P>
      <P>The National Development Plan published on Monday was underpinned by a simple belief.  That belief is reflected in many of the themes that run through the document and in many of the changes that the plan will bring about.  That simple belief is best summed up this way. Working and co-operating with one another, there is no problem that we cannot solve.  By tapping into the spirit and dynamism that exist in abundance in this country there is no challenge we cannot confront.  By mobilising our traditional sense of community in the interests of one another, there are few heights we cannot reach.</P>
      <P>The first line of the synopsis of the plan, as published on Monday, was &ldquo;This Plan is about jobs&rdquo;.  In reality, it is about us &mdash; us as a people willing to set aside differences, willing to take on mammoth tasks and to complete them, willing to put structures and attitudes in place that will benefit ours and future generations.</P>
      <P>The National Development Plan can be seen as a list of eligible projects.  It has to be that, of course &mdash; it has to be drawn up in compliance with the rules and regulations that define the purposes to which Structural and Cohesion Funds can be put.  But it is much more than just a list of projects.  It also sends a powerful message to communities, families and individuals who have been neglected and ignored through most, if not all, of the official plans that have been published in recent years.  It is a message which says that there is no good reason for any community or family to be left at the margins of our society or of our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the National Development Plan is not a panacea for all our problems. As the Taoiseach and indeed others have pointed out, it is not a full economic and <Col N="1170" /> social plan in the strict sense of the term. I think the description of the plan as the biggest single development project we have ever seen in the history of the State is a more accurate way of describing it.</P>
    <P>I also believe very strongly that those who wish to denigrate or undersell this development project are doing no service to the imagination, drive, and inspiration of the whole Irish people.  In fact, I think that those Opposition politicians who have been so critical are really only letting themselves down.</P>
    <P>For example, Deputy O'Malley, the former leader of the Progressive Democrats, seemed to suggest that the plan was doomed to fail when he pointed out that unemployment had been at the top of the priority list of successive Governments and yet had grown relentlessly.  The sharpest accusation he could make was that we were going to address the unemployment crisis &ldquo;by throwing money at it&rdquo;.  Yet the same Deputy O'Malley, when he resigned from office shortly before the last general election, had just completed a period of 1,200 days in charge of job creation policy in Ireland. He had also been in office during most of the period of implementation of the last development plan.  When he took on that job in 1989, the number of unemployed in Ireland stood at 229,975; when he left, the number was 286.047.  That is an average of 330 jobs for every week that the Progressive Democrats leader was in charge of policy.  Perhaps we will be forgiven if we do not wish to follow that sort of track record.</P>
    <P>For my part, let me put on the record of this House that I am proud of the way the two parties in Government worked together to produce this plan.  It is balanced in terms of its regional impact; it is imaginative in terms of the many new ideas it contains, and it combines a strong sense of purpose with a strong inclusive motivation.</P>
    <P>I said a moment ago that the plan is not a panacea.  If it is to work it must be combined with action across a wide range of areas.  High among these is the need for an agreed successor to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i><Col N="1171" /> I have no doubt that the negotiations on a successor to that programme will be long and painstaking. What the whole of Ireland needs is a new programme which, as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has consistently demanded, puts jobs first.  That may well mean that those who are already in work, particularly those in secure long term employment, must be prepared to make sacrifices in the interests of ensuring that more and more people can find work to go to.  If that is the case, then I hope and trust, that such a spirit of solidarity with those who are unemployed will be a feature of the forthcoming negotiations.</P>
    <P>If the plan is to work in the long term we will need to accelerate delivery on the commitment to tax reform which is contained in the Programme for Government. That too will involve difficult choices, particularly as the requirement to reform taxation, and indeed to reduce the burden on lower-paid workers, must be balanced against the need to maintain, and in some cases develop, essential services.</P>
    <P>This year we have made a very significant start in addressing the housing crisis, in reducing hospital waiting lists and in restoring class sizes in our schools towards a reasonable level, to give but three examples.  That work too must go on.  In some ways the work that the Government already has in hand will be accelerated and enhanced by the additional funding now available.  In the areas of mental handicap, for instance, it will, I hope, be possible now to steadily increase the major efforts already being made to ensure that the rights of people with a mental handicap to training and work are fully met.  Likewise, the opportunities to address the needs and rights of people with physical disabilities have never been greater.</P>
    <P>In the <i>National Development Plan</i> as a whole, this Government is seeking to reflect the best in the Irish people.  When we talk about mobilising the spirit of the Irish people, we mean it.  When we talk about tapping into the dynamic of local communities, that is because we know it <Col N="1172" /> is there and because we know that that dynamic can make a major contribution to addressing the scourge of unemployment. In many areas the plan will contribute to that dynamic.  I would like to say a few words about one element of the plan, with which the Department of the Taoiseach and the Office of the Tánaiste are closely associated.</P>
    <P>The local development programe is a focused and dynamic approach which seeks to attack disadvantage and equality in our society.  It is aimed at re-invigorating and enabling communities that have been on the margins for a variety of reasons.  And where, as part of the vicious circle from which such communities suffer, long term unemployment and poverty are endemic features of life. Many of these communities share a number of characteristics.  Long term unemployment is rampant; in many cases second generation unemployment is now a feature.  Not only have many of the people who live in these communities little chance of securing employment in the wider economy but they have less and less chance of securing work in their own localities and almost none of setting up their own businesses.  At the same time, their localities find it increasingly difficult to attract investment.</P>
    <P>These problems are compounded in many cases by the fact that young people in marginalised communities are leaving school too early, and are being condemned in some cases to a lifetime of under achievement in economic, social and personal terms.  The final part of the vicious circle condemns the communities, and the localities in which those communities live, to becoming increasingly run-down, both demoralised and demoralising.  Anger and alienation, with increasing levels of crime, vandalism and despair, are too often the result.</P>
    <P>Yet within many such communities there is a different spirit at work too. There are many groups and individuals who are determined to ensure that self-esteem is not a casualty of poverty, and that dignity does not disappear with unemployment.  There is a growing spirit <Col N="1173" /> of enterprise in many troubled communities too &mdash; a determination to fight back against the neglect and discrimination from which too many people at the margins have suffered.</P>
    <P>The local development programme is based on a recognition that all these problems exist &mdash; and that they cannot be solved simply by handing down prescriptions from on high.  That is why the programme is based on the concept of enabling local communities &mdash; especially those who have been most disadvantaged in the past &mdash; to utilise the resources that will be put at their disposal for themselves.</P>
    <P>In the local development programme, we aim to tap into the leadership and spirit of community and enterprise that we know exists.  We aim too to draw on the successful experience of the partnership companies established under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> and on the successful area-based initiatives pioneered under a number of the European Community's own programmes.</P>
    <P>In each of the designated areas, local partnership companies will be established, consisting of social partner representatives at local level, community representatives from the voluntary sector and State agencies.  Each partnership company will be charged with drawing up an action plan for the area, based on the essential needs of the local community, and using technical expertise supplied if required by a national partnership company. When area plans have been drawn up and evaluated, I envisage that funding will be made available for: an initial contact programme, providing counselling, personal development, job placement, enterprise development, and after-care; support for community development, including support for resource centres; preventative strategies, aimed especially at helping young people who are often most vulnerable; initiatives aimed at significantly improving the physical environment and infrastructure of each area; educational initiatives, to address particular local problems; support for other community initiatives, to be identified <Col N="1174" /> locally; core costs, including management and project work at local level.</P>
    <P>In addition to availing of direct funding, we envisage that the local development programme will enable local communities to decide for themselves the kind of responses that they expect from State agencies.</P>
    <P>If we are to provide the kind of services that local communities need, we must learn how to adapt to the needs they identify, rather than expecting communities and individuals to adapt to the services we offer, as has too often been the case in the past.</P>
    <P>The area-based local development programme is only one of the responses necessary to deal with long term unemployment and poverty.  It is important to remember that there are a number of different types of community where this sort of initiative will be needed.  Major urban centres, medium-sized towns, and marginalised rural areas will be targeted.</P>
    <P>Although this approach is only one of the many that are necessary, it is a genuine and radical effort to empower people and communities to come to grips with their own circumstances, and to enable the spirit and determination that we all know is there to rise to the challenge.</P>
    <P>There will be many communities in Ireland, now struggling against the odds, that will derive great benefit from this new local programme, if it is given a chance to work.  I believe that over time it will come to be seen as one of the most refreshing and important aspects of the entire plan.</P>
    <P>I would hope that there will be many other areas of activity under the plan where partnership, at local and national level, will play a major part.  When we in the Labour Party committed ourselves to this Government, we did so in the belief that a new and vigorous sense of partnership, with old enmities and rivalries set aside, had a lot to offer Ireland.</P>
    <P>It may not always be as smooth as one would wish, but nothing worthwhile is ever achieved without struggle.  I still believe that partnership &mdash; especially the partnership necessary if we are to consolidate <Col N="1175" /> a fair and growing economic future &mdash; is the only way forward.</P>
    <P>In this context, I am particularly pleased that the plan is underpinned, in all of its elements, by the principle of co-operation with Northern Ireland.  If partnership holds out hope for us in the Republic, how much more true is that of the island as a whole.</P>
    <P>This Government is committed to seeking a new sense of partnership, not only between the communities that live on this island, not only between North and South, but also between us and our nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>It is important that I should say &mdash; to everyone who might be listening, but perhaps especially to the Unionist community of Northern Ireland &mdash; that partnership means nothing if it does not mean equality.  The future will be a hollow and an empty one if anyone has to be coerced into it.  In seeking peace and reconstruction throughout this island, we seek it for the benefit of all.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether peace is on the horizon, or how distant that horizon might be.  All I know is that this Government will seek any opportunity to bring peace about.  There should be no misunderstanding about what we mean by peace.  It means much more than the absence of violence.  A cessation of violence, fundamentally important though that would be, would do no more than provide the environment within which we can talk to one another &mdash; all of us, Republican, Nationalist, Unionist, Loyalist &mdash; without the need to hurt or hate each other to prove our loyalty to a label.</P>
    <P>Sustainable and long-lasting peace will come when we agree, not when we are coerced into agreement.  It will come through dialogue and negotiation, conducted on equal terms and on the basis of equal respect.  It will come through respecting each other's differences, and learning to accommodate them through political activity and through the principle of consent.  And with peace, I hope, will come the chance of prosperity, for all the communities on this island, through both parts of the island respecting each <Col N="1176" /> other and working together.  It is not something to be afraid of &mdash; rather is the hope of dialogue, negotiation, and agreement something worth paying a price for.</P>
    <P>There are marginalised communities in both parts of this island.  There is alienation, distrust, and violence in both parts of this island.  But there are now opportunities to overcome that marginalisation &mdash; to bring peace and prosperity, self-esteem and equal esteem, wherever it exists.</P>
    <P>We should see this plan, and the growing dialogue about peace, as linked by two things.  They are both informed by a commitment to partnership and equality. They both represent very large opportunities in our political lifetimes.  Now is the time to make the most of those opportunities.</P>

      <P>The veil of secrecy that has surrounded the consultation process in relation to what is contained and what is not contained in the National Development Plan is unacceptable.  While the Minister of State travelled around the countryside and met the sub-regional review groups and listened to what they had to say &mdash; the representatives of the local authorities, the various trade unions and business interests in the regions &mdash; this type of charade should not take place in the future because the National Development Plan has nothing more than aspirational intent and aspirational content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to understand how a Government with a large majority would have anything to fear in discussing in advance the submission to Brussels to draw down Structural Funds.  It is disgraceful that the Oireachtas has been totally ignored in carrying out any analysis of priorities in a meaningful way.  We had great difficulty in getting an analysis of the last plan, through the ESRI, discussed <Col N="1177" /> in this House.  Only after constant requests to the Government &mdash; and some embarrassing moments for the Minister &mdash; were we in a position to get some contribution made in the House about how we fared in the last plan and how we could learn from the mistakes in drawing up this plan.  There is evidence in the aspirations contained in previous planning documentations that it would be difficult to ensure that a greater number of people would be employed at the end of the plan period.</P>
    <P>The Government has described the document launched this week as a national development plan.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The plan for the Irish economy should involve much more than a list of public capital priorities to the economy during the next six years.  One would have thought that the Government would have learned from the mistakes of the last round from 1989 to 1993 and that they would realise that throwing money at a particular problem in the economy would not necessary yield a return in terms of growth and employment.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael firmly believes that the European Structural Funds should be used as a catalyst for the Irish economy. The barriers to growth and job creation should be removed by domestic policy in conjunction with this planning process. In typical Fianna Fáil-Labour fashion this plan, though aspirational about its likely impact on the economy, does not address the problem of competitiveness, reducing the overall cost structure of the economy in order to sustain permanent employment rather than just temporary training schemes.</P>
    <P>The current round of EC Structural Funds provided a unique opportunity to link people with real power by ensuring that decision making with respect to the formulation of the plans and the dispersal of the funds could be concentrated at local level.  In view of the fact that this is likely to be the last opportunity for Ireland to achieve significant transfers of finance through the Regional Fund, it is crucial that on this occasion we get it right and we learn from past mistakes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1178" /> Unfortunately, it appears that the present Government is committed to maintaining centralised control over the allocation and distribution of these funds and over the consultation process. Instead of offering real participation, the Government is proposing merely to consult with local people and voluntary organisations while leaving the final decisions to the Department of Finance. Instead of devolving real decision making power, the Government offers a confusing picture of boards, authorities and fora &mdash; none of which will be immediately accessible to local people.  An initiative which could have provided a mechanism for drawing local communities into the European process in a real and meaningful way has served only to reinforce the concept of Europe as distant, impersonal and imposing &mdash; a Europe where power resides with bureaucrats and not people.</P>
    <P>Local involvement and participation has been marginalised in favour of continued centralised control with cosmetic efforts made to consult with local people to see what their priorities are.  The role of regional authorities in assessing the various demands for European funds should be spelled out.  I feel that there should be competition generated between competing projects of a similar nature and quality in the region and between regions to avoid duplication and to ensure the viability of those projects.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous that various organisations in the regions have not received any indication of how they can become meaningfully involved in proposing and competing for financial assistance through this plan.  The greatest failure of the Irish economy over the past decade has been its failure to translate economic growth into extra jobs.  In spite of the various reports, such as Culliton and NESC, the Government has ignored radical tax reform as the prerequisite for employment.  Change in domestic policy is vital in advance of the spending of large sums of money over the next number of years through this public capital programme.</P>
    <P>The last national plan promised to <Col N="1179" /> create 175,000 new jobs, but the outcome was 80,000 jobs gross.  Unfortunately, over the same period emigration rose by 98,000 and unemployment by 63,000.  How can the public be expected to believe the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government when it projects in this latest plan that we will create an additional 200,000 new jobs?  This &ldquo;pie in the sky&rdquo; projection does nothing to enhance the credibility of our political system and the standing of politicians.  I firmly believe that we will not get any meaningful permanent increase in employment unless domestic policy is addressed in the manner that is urgently required.</P>
    <P>I wish to welcome the Government's commitment in the plan to infrastructural development.  It is essential to have access to our ports and airport if we are serious about improving the competitiveness of the Irish economy and reducing the costs of transport.  However, in deference to my colleagues present from Wexford and Waterford, I must express bewilderment at the decision of the Government not to carry out major improvements on the Dublin-Waterford route via Kilkenny.  It would appear from the plan that County Kilkenny has been virtually ignored for major capital expenditure in comparison to the scale of investment that will be carried out on the Dublin-Waterford route via Enniscorthy and on the Dublin-Cork route.  It seems rather strange that the decision to improve the roads from the midlands to Waterford should take the route through Enniscorthy rather than the direct approach through Kilkenny.  Perhaps it merely highlights the hidden political representations over the past few months from the midlands and the south east, of which I was not aware.</P>
    <P>The Government has outlined a major commitment of resources to job creation and the food sector.  This sector is seen as very important in meeting the job creation targets.  However, no account has been taken of the impact of the present GATT negotiations, which will mean a reduction of 2.6 per cent of GNP, <Col N="1180" /> if implemented in their present form. This will wipe out in a significant way the projected increase of 3.5 pr cent in annualised rates of growth over the period of the plan that are set out in the Government's objectives.</P>
    <P>This clearly signals the important contribution that agriculture makes to the Irish economy and the need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Government to be vigilant in opposing the present proposals in relation to the GATT negotiations.  This single sector alone, because of our economic dependence on agriculture, clearly indicates that the plan could go radically off the rails if the proposed downturn in agricultural output is allowed to be implemented in the context of the GATT negotiations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the emphasis on human resources in the distribution of Structural Funds in the plan, particularly objectives in respect of early intervention in the education system to deal with the problem of early school leavers who have inadequate qualifications.  However, I feel strongly that business and industry should be more involved in training and retraining programes rather than having FÁS act as an intermediary in the process. To avoid mistakes in respect of medium to long term investment there should be greater use of pilot schemes and equity participation by the State.</P>
    <P>It is essential that in respect of all projects for Structural Funding there should be a clear statement of the objectives involved and the criteria by which success will be decided should be outlined.  In the last round of Structural Funds the Government has thrown money at the problems of the Irish economy without analysing their impact.  Consistently as a nation we have allowed billions of pounds to be squandered by inadequate analysis and evaluation.  In particular there has not been any consideration given to the conflict between the allocations of funds from the European Community and the barriers of domestic policy towards meeting the desired objectives of job creation and economic growth.  It is time we learned from our past mistakes and <Col N="1181" /> accepted the message that any real national plan for employment must give a clear indication of how tax and social welfare systems should be reformed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The advantage of a ten minute speaking slot is that it cuts out the need for pleasantries and a rambling introduction.  The plan before us is well presented even though there is a number of omissions that I will mention.  The lack of numbering of the sections and subsections in each chapter is a serious drawback to cross-referencing and I would recommend it in any future publication. Sir, I am not sure that anybody is listening to me but may I point out that there is a reference on page 151 to an Appendix 5 &mdash; a map of the new regional boundaries.  Certainly in my copy I have no Appendix 5, the last one being Appendix 4.  Perhaps copies of Appendix 5 could be forwarded to Opposition Members because for some of us living in the sub-regions it might be interesting to know of any boundary changes in the regions.</P>
      <P>In discussing the National Development Plan we must recognise that development necessary for enterprise and employment must and does create environmental impacts &mdash; sites must be built on, raw materials must be sourced, waste disposed of and infrastructure provided. These are unavoidable facts.</P>
      <P>Just as extreme is the position of those who say that since you cannot have development without environmental impact, then jobs have priority over the environment.  This argument is not sustainable as everyone's job directly or indirectly depends on the environment.  If a factory pollutes the air then neighbours, farmers and business suffer, which means less money is available to be spent in the nearby towns, less revenue is available for collection in taxes, which in turn means less funds for social services and so on.  We are interdependent.  A sick environment rapidly leads to a sick economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to its role as a resource for existing and new enterprises, the quality of our environment is also an important factor for attracting overseas investors <Col N="1182" /> considering locating in Ireland.  We must recognise the need to preserve the quality of our environment, while supporting development and recognising that this results in environmental impacts.  The National Development Plan apparently does not.  In fact I contend that this plan fails to conform with Article 8.4 of the framework Regulation 2081/93, which specifies that the environmental dimension to regional development plans must include <i>inter alia</i> ...</P>
    <P>... an environmental impact assessment of the plan, taking account of the principles of sustainable development and EC Environmental Law.</P>
    <P>The environmental impact assessment provided in this plan is a travesty which fails to identify any adverse environmental impacts arising from proposals for tourism, local development, transport, energy, environmental services, in fact, from any sectoral investment.  Each concentrates only on the positive and job creation prospects.  If a developer submitted such an EIA to a planning authority it would be rejected out of hand as inadequate.  In fact, on page 109 we are in effect told that no environmental impact assessment has taken place to date by the statement.  It states that all projects which are likely to have significant environmental affects must by law be the subject of an environmental impact assessment. The plan earmarks the projects, provides the money, but who will break the news to the sub-regions and interested parties that everything proposed in the plan will depend on a favourable EIA?  How can a project be deemed likely to have a significant environmental impact in advance of an environmental impact assessment?</P>
    <P>In the same chapter we are told that transport investment proposed in this plan will have a positive environmental impact.  This is not an environmental impact assessment or statement; it is further evidence of the plan contravening the Community regulation and our own law on environmental impact assessments, a major fault throughout.</P>
    <P>I suggest that recognising the need for <Col N="1183" /> development and admitting that environmental impacts will result is the most important first step.  For too long developers, including the Government, have denied responsibility for the environment and environmentalists have denied the need for development.  Once this important hurdle is overcome, a complex process of negotiation takes place between our needs in society for development and the capacity of the environment to absorb that development.  This plan should have acknowledged that different types of environments have different capacities to absorb different types of developments.</P>
    <P>We must be realistic and honest enough to admit that Ireland is not a uniform blank page waiting to receive development which is distributed according to priorities and political patronage. For instance some rivers have a greater assimilative capacity to dissolve discharges than others, some landscapes, which are major tourism resources &mdash; such as the uplands &mdash; have a very low capacity to accept new development without adverse effects.  The grasslands of north-east Cork are some of the finest dairy resources in Europe and any development which could damage this important national resource must be carefully considered.</P>
    <P>In future we will have to grasp the nettle presented to us with the concept of sustainable development, namely, we must begin to recognise and accept natural limitations to development.  This calls for a type of planning at national level, which has always been avoided until now for obvious political reasons.  It is possible that the proposed new regional authorities could perform this role.  This type of planning will introduce a spatial component and the need recognised in the plan to develop the competitive advantages of all sub-regions and to maximise regional development opportunities. Basically we are talking about concentrating development in areas of natural advantage and identifying development priorities in certain areas &mdash; tourism for some, agriculture, service or the pharmaceutical industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1184" /> The benefits of such a policy would be many.  Environmentally fragile areas would not be assigned potentially to damaging development.  Sectors, such as tourism, agriculture and fisheries, which are dependent on the natural environment will be given priority over all other considerations in areas where these are, or have, a realistic prospect of being significant economic activities.  Areas which are targeted to receive concentrations of potentially difficult developments will receive the human, technical and financial resources necessary to ensure that meaningful standards can be imposed and monitored and that where accidents occur, they can be competently and effectively contained and their effects mitigated. Scarce financial resources can be targeted into areas where planned sectoral growth will take place.  There will be no need for costly, wasteful over-specification of every sewage plant, road or electricity supply in Ireland to accommodate development which might happen.  If we understand this basic concept of recognising and accepting national limitations as a key to the creation of priorities for development then we understand the essence of this much abused term, sustainable development.</P>
    <P>If a water body is too fragile to receive industrial discharge it should be made a priority amenity area.  If agriculture predicates heavy industry in such an area, then we should concentrate infrastructural development on compatible activities such as tourism, the service sector and fabrication.  If forestry provides a more realistic hope for economic activity in an area than massively subsidised agriculture, then let forestry have priority, providing forestry recognises that tourism, fisheries or agriculture have priorities in other areas.</P>
    <P>It can never be a question of jobs or the environment.  It is very much a case of jobs and the environment.  In Ireland, the majority of jobs stem from the environment &mdash; agriculture, tourism, fisheries, forestry and horticulture.  These industries alone account for more than 20 per cent of our employment and we should <Col N="1185" /> add to those the jobs indirectly dependent on the environment such as food processing, packaging, marketing, distribution, transportation for tourism, agriculture, forestry, fisheries and so on. Vets, accountants, solicitors and suppliers of energy, animal feed, farm equipment, construction materials and fishery equipment are all dependent on the environment.  Furthermore, not only are those the majority of our jobs, but they are the best jobs we have.  They are sustainable; they have been around for centuries and are still going strong.  They repatriate all their profits into the community in which the money was earned.</P>
    <P>The challenge to provide more jobs from new types of industries is to develop in such a way as to keep the best of what we have while embracing the best of what is new.  The environment must be integrated into every level of Government and administration, into planning, evaluation and decision-making of every Department.</P>
    <P>In the limited time available to me, I wish to point out briefly other areas of concern.  The first two chapters in this plan are, in effect, an attempt to justify <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> Mark II and, as the plan is for six years, it risks being dated by this introduction.  The section on urban renewal is weak and contains virtually no specifics.  I venture to suggest that it was merely included, to pacify the European Commission.  There is no mention of planning for investment in outer suburbs. The serious problems of those regions are recognised in justifying the Tallaght Hosptial investment, but there the interest stops.  Thousands of people living at great social disadvantage in areas of high unemployment are being offered nothing by this plan in terms of capital investment.  Urban renewal apparently equals inner city renewal which, in effect, reflects the Temple Bar development and nothing else.</P>

      <P>Transportation, including <Col N="1186" /> our roads, accounts for 12 per cent of this plan, or £2.5 billion.  Not once in the chapters dealing with this area is sustainable mobility mentioned and that could be the single greateast flaw in the plan.  Nowhere is the question asked as to how we can limit this haemorrhage of public resources on the provision of roads.  How can we reduce the need for journeys?  Similarily, the whole area of traffic management is given a low priority and is certainly secondary to the priority of this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has already outlined the key objectives and development measures incorporated in the National Development Plan.  Other Ministers will expand the measures in the sectors for which they have overall responsibility.</P>
      <P>The strategy set out in the National Development Plan does not present a radical new departure in the conduct of macroeconomic policy.  Rather the plan continues, builds on and improves those policies which have contributed most to recovery and growth in output and employment in the Irish economy in the recent past.  The expenditure programme for the EC Structural and Cohesion Funds incorporated in the plan fit into and enhance the effectiveness of the board integrated and consistent medium-term strategy which the Government is pursuing.</P>
      <P>The macroeconomic dimension of the plan must be evaluated within the context of Ireland's status and role in the development, integration and expansion of the European economy.  The EC Structural and Cohesion Funds provide opportunities to consolidate the benefits gained by the Irish economy from the completion of the Single Market, the first Community support framework and the beginnings of the process of creating an economic and monetary union.  It is essential, therefore, that we maintain our commitment to policies which will keep the Irish economy in conformity with the basic requirements for participation in building this new European economic order.  Specifically this means continuing to adhere to the nominal convergence criteria contained in the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, the fiscal policy underpinning the plan is essentially a continuation of the central features of the strategy which has transformed the outlook for the <Col N="1188" /> public finances in recent years.  Confidence in the Government's medium term budgetary strategy is grounded on the consistent achievement of budgetary objectives.  This is again true this year. The Exchequer returns for the first three quarters of the year released last week are strongly supportive of the Exchequer borrowing requirement targeted in the budget and, indeed, offer a reasonable prospect that some contribution towards any potential equity injection in Aer Lingus can be secured.  This would maintain our position among the top ranking budgetary performances across the European Community and would mean that Exchequer borrowing will remain within the range of 2 to 3 per cent of GNP that has now been maintained for five successive years.</P>
    <P>This should not, however, lead to any sense of complacency.  The overhang of national debt built up in previous years remains far too high.  We must achieve continued progress in reducing the overall level of our national debt so as to free up resources for tax reform and other spending priorities.  Even if we did not have the Maastricht budgetary convergence criteria, our national economic and social circumstances require the maintenance of firm control of the public finances so that there is a steady reduction in the national debt/GDP ratio. This is an overriding principle of the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997</i> and is of course reflected in the National Development Plan.  Strict adherence to the budgetary stance of recent years must therefore be maintained, and the Government has already commenced examination of the 1994 spending outlook with this commitment very firmly in mind.</P>
    <P>In the last few years economic progress in Ireland has continued at quite a remarkable pace, considering the scale and duration of the international downturn. From 1990 to this year GDP growth here has averaged almost 5 per cent per year.  In contrast EC annual average growth was less than 2 per cent; in the United States, it was only 0.5 per cent; and in the United Kingdom GDP actually <Col N="1189" /> declined by 0.75 per cent per annum. Perhaps it is not so well known that employment here has also held its own by international standards.  In the last two years employment here has been broadly unchanged, while it has fallen by about 0.25 per cent a year in the EC and by about 0.5 per cent per year in the United States.</P>
    <P>It is also worth noting that our above average economic growth was achieved without fuelling inflation or resorting to excessive public borrowing.  Inflation here, at around 2.75 per cent since 1991, has consistently been below the EC average. Similarly, general Government borrowing, averaging around 2.25 per cent of GDP over the last four years, has been well below the EC average.  The Irish economy has clearly shown its potential for rapid, non-inflationary, market-led, economic growth.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach indicated, the international economic background is not favourable.  A substantial and sustained international economic upswing seems to be as elusive as ever.  Once again some of the international forecasting agencies have recently been revising downwards even the rather sombre forecasts they published in the summer.  The latest indications are that among OECD countries growth this year is likely to be very modest, averaging only about 1 per cent. Many of our continental EC partners are still in recession and output in the EC as a whole is likely to fall by about 0.5 per cent this year.  Nor can we look to much improvement next year.  While there is likely to be a modest improvement in western Europe, the latest outlook for the international economy in 1994 is for another year of below average growth, with a further rise in unemployment in the OECD area.</P>
    <P>However, one bright spot in an otherwise rather sombre international landscape is that a modest recovery appears to be underway in the United Kingdom after the longest and deepest recession there since the thirties.  GDP growth in the UK may pick up to average around 2 per cent this year and 2.5 per cent next year.  This is a welcome change from the <Col N="1190" /> fall in output which the UK has been experiencing in recent years.  It will of course be good news for those Irish enterprises whose main export market is the UK and who have been having a lean time over the last few years, provided of course &mdash; and it is a very important proviso &mdash; that Irish exporters can remain competitive in the UK market.  We should not forget that UK producers have made great progress in containing cost increases in recent years.</P>
    <P>Our Budget Day forecast of 2.5 per cent GDP growth now seems likely to be at least achieved and may even be exceeded.  While growth in continental Europe will be weaker than earlier expected, this is likely to be more than offset by stronger growth in the United Kingdom and by stronger public and private consumption here at home &mdash; the latter largely because of the speed with which interest rates came down in the first half of the year.  Manufacturing output has also held up very well considering the scale of the international recession, rising by over 7 per cent year-on-year in the first half of this year.</P>
    <P>The available information suggests that employment has also been holding up well this year.  Payroll related revenue receipts for the first three quarters of the year are encouraging.  Income tax receipts, excluding DIRT receipts, are up by 8.25 per cent.  PRSI receipts are also well in line with budget expectations.  All these indicators point to a modest increase in employment this year.</P>
    <P>Inflation here also remains low by international standards.  This year underlying inflation at around 2 per cent will again be among the lowest in the EC. The latest figures up to August show a year-on-year inflation rate of 1.4 per cent, one of the lowest rates in the last 30 years.  The reduction in mortgage rates has obviously helped.  But even excluding the impact of lower mortgage rates, the underlying inflation rate is only about 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>Given the prospect of even a modest improvement in the international economy next year, the likelihood is that economic growth here will accelerate in <Col N="1191" /> 1994.  Much will depend on the response of consumers and private sector investors to lower interest rates.  If the savings rate falls even modestly next year, then growth in domestic demand could be fairly vigorous.  At any rate, I am entirely confident that economic growth here next year will again be well ahead of the European Community average.</P>
    <P>As we have seen, while we have made tremendous progress in recent years in getting the economy right, the one great problem of unemployment remains.  At the end of September almost 290,000 people &mdash; over 21 per cent of the labour force &mdash; were registered as unemployed. We must take care that the size of the problem does not lead us to reject economic solutions or, worse still, to advocate approaches which would undermine our ability to expand employment in the future.  Any such approaches would be ill-founded and would not succeed.  The only valid response to unemployment is to take the actions necessary to ensure we create what is needed &mdash; more real, sustainable jobs than we have succeeded in creating hitherto.  The critical requirement is that we display the collective determination to take the necessary steps, even though they may sometimes in the shorter term involve unpalatable choices.</P>
    <P>Although unemployment is very high, the trend has been improving for almost a year: the live register at end-September last, when adjusted for seasonal variation, was only 1,000 higher than at end-November 1992.  Because of this improvement, the budget-time live register forecast for 1993 was revised downwards by 9,000 last summer and even this revision is likely to prove to be too pessimistic.</P>
    <P>The rise in unemployment over the past three years has been due to labour force growth and not to a fall in the total at work.  Indeed, the total at work has remained stable over the past three years. This may not sound too impressive in the context of our unemployment rate but, paradoxically, it vindicates the wisdom of the economic policies which are being <Col N="1192" /> pursued by this Government.  This becomes clear if we look back to the international recession of the early 1980s and contrast what happened to employment in Ireland then to what is happening now in another &mdash; even worse &mdash; international recession.  Furthermore, trends in the employment situation in Ireland compared favourably with that in the EC.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the benefits which the Irish economy has gained from the efficient use of the first phase of the enhanced EC Structural Funds in the context of an overall development strategy are evident in our economic performance since 1989.  Looking to the medium term, the benefits of the first phase of the enhanced EC Structural Funds should continue to improve our growth prospects.  Moreover, the general outlook for the Irish economy is fairly positive.  The reductions in domestic interest rates will over time provide a significant boost to personal consumption and investment in the economy.</P>
    <P>The overall outlook for the external economy over the medium term should improve.  Assuming that the international economy picks up during 1994 and that it expands steadily over the medium term, the Irish economy would be likely to grow at an annual average rate of upwards of 3.5 per cent between 1994 and 1999 &mdash; more rapidly than the Community average.  Inflation over the plan period should remain moderate with Ireland among the better performing EC countries in that respect.</P>
    <P>Significantly stronger performance in the international economy and sustained improvement in competitiveness should lead to much higher growth.  The Taoiseach has already referred in detail to our employment targets and to the importance of improved competitiveness if we are to expand non-agricultural employment in a way that will begin to make significant inroads into unemployment.</P>
    <P>I am surprised by the comments of some commentators and Deputies who have criticised the National Development Plan for not containing detailed tax reform proposals.  The plan is designed to set out the country's development <Col N="1193" /> priorities in the areas eligible for assistance from the EC Structural Funds.  It concentrates in specific terms on expenditure and investment priorities.  The plan is not intended to deal in detail with the broader areas of economic policy, fiscal policy, tax reform and such matters, important as these are.</P>
    <P>Very significant progress has been made in recent years in the area of tax reform.  The main thrust of the policy has been to broaden the tax base as a means of alleviating marginal tax rates.  That has brought about major improvements in the income tax and corporation tax areas. Notwithstanding this general stance, the Government has been prepared to consider limited well-focused measures directed at employment.  The 1993 budget and Finance Bill included a number of specfic measures aimed at encouraging and supporting enterprise and helping employment otherwise.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to continuing the process of tax reform as an important element in overall employment strategy.  As pointed out in the plan, the Government's priorities in tax policy are set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  The strategic objectives are, firstly, to alleviate the burden of tax on the lower paid and, secondly, to raise the threshold for progression to the top rate of tax, thus reducing the marginal rate at lower and middle incomes.</P>
    <P>The phasing and implementation of the tax reform objectives will be subject to the overriding budgetary position.  As mentioned in the plan, progress in the area of taxation will necessarily require maintaining the thrust towards base-broadening as specifically recognised in the Government's response to the Culliton report.  There is no evidence, contrary to Deputy Bruton's assertion this morning, that the PRSI system in the US has caused a major difference in jobs growth.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan will form the basis for negotiations with the EC Commission which will culminate in agreement on the Community Support Framework for Ireland.  The CSF will <Col N="1194" /> represent the Community's response to the plan and will set out the agreed development priorities, the forms of assistance and the indicative financing plan.  Preliminary discussions have already taken place with the Commission. The negotiations are likely to take several months and it is expected that the CSF will be agreed around the end of this year or early in 1994.</P>
    <P>The CSF will be implemented through a series of operational programmes which will set out in greater detail the development measures to be implemented in each sector.  Draft operational programmes are being finalised and will be submitted to the Commission over the next couple of weeks.  Negotiations on the programmes will proceed in parallel with those of the CSF.  It is expected that the programmes will be approved along with or shortly after the CSF.</P>
    <P>A significant part of the expenditure is Exchequer financed and so expenditure in areas such as roads, sanitary services, industry, agriculture, training and education will be provided for in the normal Estimates process and can go ahead from the beginning of the year, even if final agreement with the Commission has not been reached.  A priority for the Irish authorities in the negotiations will be that appropriate transitional arrangements are put in place in the case of other expenditures to ensure that there is no disruption of development activity between the completion of the present CSF and programmes and the adoption of the new ones.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney queried the period covered by the plan.  The total EC aid provided for in the plan amounts to just under £8 billion at £7,988 million in 1993 prices over the period 1993 to 1999.  The structural funding package at Community level has been settled on the basis of this seven year period.  The new Cohesion Fund, which is the first element of the enhanced structural funding package, has come onstream this year.  The Cohesion Fund is being allocated on a project basis.  The Structural Funds elements for 1993 are included in the current Community Support Framework. <Col N="1195" /> The Community initiatives and the Structural Funds for 1994 to 1999 will be covered by the new Community Support Framework and the new Community initiative programmes.  The total EC aid figure also includes expected aid from the new EFTA Cohesion Fund.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to give a precise breakdown of the EC aid between the various funds as the position in relation to Community initiatives has still to be finalised.  Excluding the Community initiatives, it is estimated that approximately 39 per cent of the aid will come from the European Regional Development Fund, 28 per cent from the European Social Fund, 17 per cent from the European Agricultural Guidance Fund and the new financial instrument for fisheries guidance and 16 per cent from the Cohesion Fund.  If one looks at the Structural Funds alone, the breakdown is approximately 46.5 per cent from the European Regional Development Fund, 33.5 per cent from the ESF and 20 per cent from the agriculture and fisheries guidance funds.  This compares with approximately 43.8 per cent from the European Regional Development Fund, 38.5 per cent from the ESF and 17.7 per cent from the Agriculture Guidance Fund under the present Community Support Framework.  Of course the breakdown between the various funds and the aid rates to be applied are issues to be negotiated with the EC Commission.</P>
    <P>Under the Structural Fund regulations governing the operation of the funds, 9 per cent of the total Structural Funds will be applied to Community initiatives.  The Community Support Framework will in effect respond to the priorities identified by the member state.  On the other hand, in the case of the Community initiatives the Commission, having consulted with the member states and the European Parliament, identifies a number of priorities in respect of which the member states then put forward their proposals.</P>
    <P>The Commission issued a consultative document on Community initiatives in July and is engaged on an extensive consultation process with member states and <Col N="1196" /> a wide range of other bodies.  The Commission is proposing reducing the number of initiatives from 14 to five.  The Government broadly supports the Commission's proposals.  It is expected to be around the end of the year before the final package is settled.</P>
    <P>Ireland can expect to receive over £500 million under Community initiatives. Matching public and private sector funding should bring total expenditure under Community initiatives programmes to about £800 million.  A global allocation for this has been included in the plan.  It is not possible at this stage to allocate this to specific measures.  It is expected that Community initiative programmes in Ireland will include measures in the following broad areas.  There will be a further cross-Border programme covering Northern Ireland and the six Border counties which will extend and expand on the current INTERREG programme. The Government will be seeking a maritime border programme with Britain focusing in particular on the development of ports and access to ports and there is likely to be a further rural development programme following on from Leader.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of adjusting to industrial change there are likely to be measures related to assistance to small and medium sized enterprises to help them compete efficiently in the Single Market and initiatives in the areas of research and development.</P>
    <P>In the human resources area the Government will be seeking continued support for groups benefiting under the present HORIZON, NOW and EUROFORM programmes.  The Government will be putting particular emphasis on measures targeted on the employment needs of the handicapped in this context.</P>
    <P>Co-operation with Northern Ireland in a Structural Funds context is not limited to the Community Initiative cross-Border programme.  The importance of North/South cross-Border co-operation in tackling a range of economic and social issues is recognised not only in this National Development Plan but also in the North's Regional Development Plan. Both plans include a common agreed <Col N="1197" /> chapter setting out the extent of existing co-operation and the prospects for further such co-operation.</P>
    <P>There is already a great deal of economic co-operation between North and South and steady progress in promoting cross-Border partnership has been made over the past decade.  In the context of the last round of the Structural Funds, for example, substantial support has been given to schemes designed to upgrade transport links between the two parts of the island, such as the improvement of cross-Border roads and the commencement of work on a major upgrading of the Belfast to Dublin rail link. The joint Ireland/Northern Ireland INTERREG programme has provided a particularly valuable focus for supporting cross-Border projects in many sectors. Other EC initiatives such as STRIDE and STAR have successfully promoted scientific and technical collaboration in the academic community and industry, a specific example being the optic fibre link between Belfast and Dublin assisted under the STAR programme.</P>
    <P>In preparing the development plans for the 1994-99 period both the British and Irish Governments have paid close attention to the opportunities for expanding economic collaboration in the context of the next round of assistance from the Structural Funds.  In the implementation of both plans the closest liaison will be maintained in all relevant areas to ensure this eventuality.</P>
    <P>The Government was determined to ensure that the development strategy adopted for the plan should promote balanced regional development.  To this end the Government has taken fully into account the work of the seven sub-regional review committees which were established under the current Community Support Framework.</P>
    <P>The Government has responded to the recommendations of the sub-regional review committees to the extent to which they are consistent with the overall national objective of maximising sustainable employment and growth and having regard to the limits on EC and national resources available.  Full account <Col N="1198" /> has been taken of the recommendations of the review committees in drawing up the development strategy which underpins this plan and in allocating resources to various sectoral programmes through which the plan will be implemented.</P>
    <P>The detailed recommendations and proposals contained in the submissions from the sub-regional review committees also constitute a valuable input to the drafting of the detailed operational programmes which will be submitted to the EC Commission for approval in conjunction with the plan.</P>
    <P>As part of the arrangements for implementing the plan the Government intends to develop the sub-regional dimension of the monitoring arrangements, building on the experience gained under the current CSF.  The Government has decided that the regional authorities will have responsibility for the functions currently discharged by the sub-regional review committees.  For the purpose of discharging these functions, the committees which will assist the regional authorities in this regard will include representatives of local authorities, other public authorities, Government Departments, the social partner organisations currently represented on the sub-regional review committees, the EC Commission and the voluntary and community sector.</P>
    <P>Resources under the plan are allocated to national sectoral programmes, not on a sub-regional basis.  However, the plan includes an estimate of the likely breakdown of the expenditure by sub-region. Maintaining an appropriate regional balance was an important consideration for the Government in preparing the plan. Statements of proposed integrated developments in each sub-region are being prepared and will be made available publicly.</P>
    <P>The Government attaches particular importance to the effective monitoring and evaluation of expenditure assisted by the Structural Funds.  This is essential to ensure the best return from this commitment of Community and national resources.  A considerable amount of work has been done in relation to evaluation during the present CSF.  This will <Col N="1199" /> be developed further in consultation with the EC Commission.</P>
    <P>An increased technical assistance budget of £8 million has been included at CSF level.  This will cover, <i>inter alia,</i> operating costs of the regional authorities in respect of their functions related to the Structural Funds and costs related to monitoring and evaluation at CSF level. Additional resources will also be devoted to technical assistance at programme level.</P>
    <P>Much work is done by Government Departments and State agencies in supplying information and publicity about EC-assisted programmes and measures but there is still room for improvement. It is important that project promoters have information about sources of funding. There are also occasional incidences of grant beneficiaries not being aware of the EC contribution to this funding.  We will be discussing with the Commission ways of improving further the information and publicity arrangements.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude by acknowledging the input of all the organisations and individuals who made submissions in relation to the plan.  The preparation of this plan followed a very extensive consultation process, probably the most comprehensive consultation ever undertaken in relation to a national programme here and the final plan well reflects the considerable work involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Twenty billion pounds is a great deal of money.  Whether, however, the investment plan for the spending of this money will live up to expectations is open to serious question. It has been variously described as our last chance, among other things.  The Taoiseach was right when he asserted at the launch that this is the biggest development project in the history of the State. However, his claim that this is the formula <Col N="1200" /> which is going to transform Ireland is where the major doubt lies.  It is not clear that we have got it right on this occasion.  In the interest of accountability, in the interest of return for money and in the interest of getting it right, I hope the EC goes through this development plan line by line, objective by objective, programme by programme and does a thorough in-depth assessment in relation to whether this plan is capable of making the kind of economic breakthrough that will bridge the gap between this country and our partners in Europe. That is the purpose of the plan and unless it is genuinely seen to be purpose-built in that direction and to have a realistic chance of achieving this objective then the EC should reject it outright with strong recommendations in relation to where it falls down and where the emphasis should lie and send it back to source.</P>
      <P>The newspaper headlines say an extra 100,000 people, or an extra 14,000 per annum, will be at work by the year 2000. The small print, however, is less optimistic and more cautious, pointing to the fact that the figure may be only half that or an extra 52,000 in total, or 9,000 per annum.  All the options have been covered &mdash; we have the best and worst case scenarios.  The fact is that the Government simply does not know.  This is a blind act of faith.</P>
      <P>Based on the 1989-93 experience we have lost a substantial number of jobs. The textile industry has been and is being decimated and no protective measures are being put in place.  Thousands of farmers have been driven from the land. Despite all the rhetoric about small enterprises and the odd flickers of small enterprise success stories here and there the crush of commercial reality means that the small have been hoovered up by the large; small firms taken over by larger firms; small farms taken over by big farms; small shops gobbled up by supermarket chains while small schools are closing or merging with larger schools. Social exclusion has grown and grown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All other plans have failed.  Each failure was a tragedy in itself.  The real tragedy is the failure to examine the <Col N="1201" /> reason for the failure, to see where we went wrong and to ensure that these mistakes are not repeated.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was launched with much the same rhetoric as this plan.  Apart from its success as an instrument for obtaining a national wage agreement it failed to meet its social and economic objectives.  We lost jobs and unemployment grew.  While the previous National Development Plan, from 1989 to 1993, was launched with the same upbeat buzz words, extravagance and superlatives also failed. Again, we lost jobs and unemployment grew.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> failed miserably in relation to its much vaunted job creation proposals.  Again, despite spending billions of pounds, no systematic analysis was carried out to discover where and how these plans failed to meet their core objectives.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been one of the largest recipients of EC funds.  Such inflows are extremely welcome and have been of great help to the economy but they have also disguised the fundamental weaknesses of the economy.  What is not clear is whether large investment in public infrastructure, which this programme has gone for, improves economic performance. One study by a reputable source will show that investment in motorways and public utilities improves productivity which another generally reputable expert will seek to prove and can prove that such investment has no effect on productivity.  There is direct benefit from such investment by way of short term jobs, in construction and interim services for example, but their role in providing permanent improvements to the economy's performance, in other words closing the gap between ourselves and other members states, is very much open to question.  Does the spending of £28 million, for example, to knock five minutes off the road journey to Belfast increase productivity or produce real economic return?  Is the spending of £75 million on the Dublin to Belfast railway line, good and laudable in itself, in order to knock nine minutes off the <Col N="1202" /> train time really productive and will it provide a long term tangible economic return?</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be negative but I am extremely disappointed that we have gone down the same road or <i>cul-de-sac.</i> Ireland has devoted no effort to assessing the impact of EC funds to date.  At Central Revew Committee level the social partners are extremely happy if the commitments made to their sectors are honoured. This covers their flank but this plan is based on assumptions and educated guesses, the same educated guesses that failed us in the past.  There is no clear strategy, as Deputy Bruton said, to free up the economic arteries or to shake out our taxation and social welfare policy. There is no strategy which recognises the principle that it is far cheaper to save a job, either in industry or agriculture, than to create one and therefore no strategic thinking in relation to industry or sectors under threat and advance planning to head off the challenges and the threats to such jobs.  The plan seems to be based on the perceived needs of different agencies, Ministers and Departments.  Right through the summer we were treated to headline after headline about the competition between the different semi-State agencies, Ministers and Departments in relation to their success or otherwise in wresting from the plan their particular slice of the cake.</P>
    <P>One of the major misconceptions about the plan, and one which was been fed by the global way in which billions of pounds have been bandied about in the debate taking place outside the House, is that there is major additional finance over and above what we have received from Europe.  When examined, however, heading by heading, it is clear that what we are getting is topping up finance.</P>
    <P>I welcome the £3 billion for human resources development, £1.5 billion of which is to go to education of which the EC is putting up £1 billion.  It is extremely disappointing, however, that education does not merit a separate chapter in the plan.  This arises from the fact that the EC does not have a separate education directorate to correspond with our <Col N="1203" /> Department of Education.  When one examines the figures, however, the annual allocation will work out at £257 million over the next six years as against £220 million which we received for each of the past four years.  The annual increase, therefore, is £37 million and this can be seen in context when one considers that it would do little more than build and equip one regional technical college to cater for 3,000 students.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept the Minister for Education's contention that this programme will transform the nature and quality of Irish education; it cannot be sustained. The £220 million for vocational programmes such as Youthreach, VTOS, local community initiatives, etc. is welcome. One hopes that such selective plugging of gaps and such education rescue initiatives for those who have dropped out or who have not benefited from the existing system will be successful.</P>
    <P>We are tackling education from the wrong end.  Unless we adopt a &ldquo;bottom up&rdquo; approach, get it right initially and unless the foundation is put in place at primary level, we cannot build and benefit at either second or third level.</P>
    <P>At primary level there are huge problems. Many of our school buildings are the most sub-standard in Europe and would not survive health authority inspection.  Many schools lack equipment. Our level of investment <i>per capita</i> at primary level is one of the lowest in the OECD.  We have the largest class sizes in the European Community.  We have no school psychological service, apart from two small pilot projects.  We have a skeleton home-school liaison service comprising 40 home-school liaison officers despite the fact that we have 3,200 primary schools.  Due to overcrowding and too large classes, a lack of investment, a failure to see education as a fundamental plan of social policy and a major instrument in combating poverty, the fact that two-thirds of our schools have no remedial teachers or access to them and that the Department of Education <Col N="1204" /> runs away from problems like dyslexia by almost denying their existence, between 10 per cent and 20 per cent of the children in the country leave school with little if any literacy skills and are branded as education failures before they even get into their teens.  This was a golden opportunity to put solid comprehensive foundations in place across the entire primary system.  If this had been done we would not need the VTOS, Youthreach programmes, etc. which sap up millions of pounds in trying to rescue, down the road, those whom the primary system abandoned.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that an EC funded plan should not contain any reference in its human resource and education section to EC languages.  In terms of linguistic achievement we are at the very bottom of the European league.  As a nation we have a major psychological problem in learning languages.  Our performance in Irish proves that.  I doubt if more than a dozen Deputies could contribute to a debate as Gaeilge.  Likewise, our inability to speak continental languages is a major drawback.  Apart from the psychological barrier, there is quite obviously something seriously wrong with the methodology employed for teaching languages.  Every post-primary school, without exception, should be offering at least two continental languages.  Every child learning a continental language up to leaving certificate should have the language taught by way of concentration on oral skills so that when he or she leaves secondary school they will have reasonable fluency and basic conversational skills.  If we are to meet our economic objectives, it is vital that we give more resources to language training.  Unfortunately this is not in the plan.</P>
    <P>I was hoping for more in terms of education.  I was hoping for specifics rather than the global headings under which the money has been designated. Again I wish to express my extreme disappointment that in terms of announcing flagships &mdash; and there have been many, including a light rail system, tunnels under the Liffey, a ring road around Dublin, initiatives to eliminate unemployment <Col N="1205" /> blackspots in parts of Dublin &mdash; not one flagship initiative has been announced for the third level sector.  I refer particularly to the failure to make any provision for the long-promised regional technical colleges for Castlebar and Thurles.</P>
    <P>If this plan is adopted in its entirety it will be in clear breach of cohesion policy because in endeavouring to close the gap between the richer and poorer nations we are widening the gap between the east and west of this country.  The west has been excluded.  There is not one investment project in it.  If this plan is adopted in its present form the west will have been written off as nothing more than a national theme park.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As spokesperson for our party on tourism I wish to deal with that subject.  The national plan is short on specifics in this area.  The Taoiseach said that a gross investment figure of £580 million would be made in tourism over the period of the plan.  However, the precise amount expected from Structural Funds is not indicated.  The £580 million is further broken down between the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the Office of Public Works, the former receiving £139 million and the latter receiving £100 million.  As a result £340 million will go to tourism which, when further broken down, includes £160 million for product development, £50 million for the proposed new conference centre in Dublin and £130 million for marketing.  When the private and Exchequer contributions are taken into account, I estimate that there will be about £33 million for marketing over the six years from the Structural Funds.  This is totally inadequate and falls far short of what Bord Fáilte, ITIC and the Irish Hotels Federation sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of the challenges facing Bord Fáilte and individual operators, who have to compete with other countries for a market share in tourism, this £33 million is seen in context.  It is a derisory sum and will make little contribution to the overall marketing drive <Col N="1206" /> from this country in the next six years. Bord Fáilte, ITIC and the Irish Hotels Federation repeatedly sought in the region of £50 million to £80 million over this period for marketing.  The amount allocated for marketing under the last programme from 1989 to 1993 of £17 million had very little impact on the American market where our market share has fallen.  That puts matters in perspective.  Although the number visiting this country since 1987 has increased, our share of the world market has declined from 2 per cent in 1960 to .9 per cent now.</P>
    <P>The importance of marketing Ireland overseas cannot be overstated.  Since 1960 Ireland's share of the world market has declined from 2 per cent to approximately .9 per cent despite good performance in the last four or five years. Similarly, Ireland's share of the European mainland market declined from around 2.7 per cent in 1960 to approximately 1.4 per cent in 1992.  This increased only marginally this year. Ireland's share of the US visitors to Europe declined from 6.5 per cent in 1987 to about 5.1 per cent in 1993.  Indeed it is said &mdash; this has been accepted by the Minister responsible for tourism &mdash; that our share of the American market this year will be down by 7 or 8 per cent. In contrast, during the period 1981-90 Scotland attracted 20 per cent more North American tourists than Ireland. That demonstrates that Scotland, by spending more money on marketing in America, is gaining a bigger share of that market whereas our spend in the American market has declined considerably. To give another example, Ireland attracted 230,000 visitors from Germany in 1992 but this is only 1 per cent of the 22 million Germans who travel abroad for holidays every year.  That indicates there is huge potential for Irish tourism in the German market.  Again, we need to spend the money on marketing in Germany if we are to attract a greater share of that market.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to Britain, our main market.  Britain, which accounts for 55 per cent of visitor numbers and 40 per <Col N="1207" /> cent of revenue for Ireland's tourism industry, is a vast market of 56 million people on our doorstep.  Ireland has currently just 4 per cent of the British holiday market, equal to the share of Portugal, Italy and Cyprus.  We should be capable of attracting a greater share of the British market.  British people are changing from sun holidays to active, special interest holidays.  In this area there is a need to spend more money.</P>
    <P>I would make a plea to the Minister and the Minister of State to help the family run hotel.  Under the last programme the only hotels eligible for aid were those with more than 40 rooms.  I appeal that under this <i>tranche</i> of funding all family run hotels should be eligible for grants for the provision of leisure facilities, upgrading their premises and increasing their complement of beds.</P>
    <P>There is a debate underway at present on the question of access.  Access is the single most important obstacle to future development of tourism in Ireland because it is too expensive to get to this country.  I see no reason why Structural Funds should not be used to grant aid ferry services as is the case on the Greek islands and in regard to ferries from Scotland to the Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands.  I appeal to the Minister to consider this matter.  If we are to increase revenue by £1 billion and increase the number of jobs in the tourist industry by 35,000 the marketing budget must be increased.  There is not much point in having great products if we cannot sell them throughout America, Europe and worldwide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>In its provisions on equality the National Development Plan breaks new ground in Irish public policy. <Col N="1208" /> It signals a determination by the Government that women's interests are to be taken into account at every level of decision making.  This plan marks in a very important way the fact that the Government has taken equality in from the margins of public discourse and brought it to the centre of economic and political concern.</P>
      <P>In the &ldquo;Implementation&rdquo; chapter the plan clearly states that:</P>
      <P>In drawing up stuctural funds programmes, the relevant Departments and agencies will comply with the principle that there is to be no direct or indirect discrimination on grounds of gender and will actively promote equal opportunites for both genders.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the plan of immediate relevance to women's equality relate to two issues: gender-proofing and child-care. The House will be familiar with the Government's commitment to gender-proofing, since one of the very first acts of this Government was to approve a memorandum from the Taoiseach amending the Cabinet procedure instructions so that the impact of any proposed decision on women would be assessed in memoranda for the Government.</P>
      <P>In so far as gender proofing of the plan is concerned, this is a process which will be the responsibility of each individual Department in respect of its own programmes and initiatives.  There will also be a centralised mechanism to monitor the ongoing process of gender-proofing and ensure that the Government's policy in this regard is complied with.  Every person is entitled to equality and to equal rights before the law as well as equal opportunities for personal and economic development.  Of course, no one individual is the same as another, but everybody in this country is entitled to equal respect and equal concern from the State. Any society based on that equal concern and respect will want to pay special attention to areas in national life where women are under-represented and to ensure that their voices are listened to in the national debate on public policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years there has been a general <Col N="1209" /> recognition that policy initiatives proposed by Government need to be gender proofed.  Gender proofing is intended to overcome potential incidences of indirect discrimination and to contribute towards an integrated equal opportunities policy. In the employment field, such discrimination is of course, illegal under the Employment Equality Act, 1977.  It is my belief that without a gender proofing procedure it is possible that the orientation of various programmes to be undertaken under the National Development Plan would otherwise effectively exclude categories of persons who are among those most in need of assistance under the plan and would compound past failures to extend the benefits of economic progress equally to women.</P>
    <P>Gender proofing is also consistent with EC policy on equal opportunities between men and women.  A Council resolution of May 1991 on equal opportunities, emphasises the need for member states to integrate the objective of equal opportunities and equal treatment in the formulation and implementation of all areas of national policy.  I should add that we in Ireland must report progress on this at the end of the action programme in 1995.</P>
    <P>The second aspect of the plan which I particularly welcome is its provision on child care.  Child care is one of the most important influences on the participation of women in the labour force.  The plan states quite clearly that:</P>
    <P>Appropriate proposals on child care will be put forward for support under both CSF Programmes and Community Initiatives, and will have regard to such relevant factors as the eligibility for support of dependent care as provided for in the new ESF regulation.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan offers an appropriate context in which to draw up a framework for national child care development policy.  There is a significant loss to the economy when women are prevented from working by the non-availability of affordable child care There are also employment aspects to the issue such as the employment potential <Col N="1210" /> of child care provision as a fast growing sector.</P>
    <P>The drawing up of a national child care policy is very much in line with our domestic policy commitments.  A detailed case for child care provision was put forward most recently in the January 1993 Report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  The Programme for a Partnership Government also undertakes to create a major expansion in child care facilities.  In addition, the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> contained commitments to pursue the provision of child care services for working parents and to implement the Child Care Act, 1991, on a phased basis.  EC policy also supports the introduction of a national child care programme. The 1992 EC Recommendation on Child Care requires us to take and to encourage initiatives to enable men and women to reconcile the occupational family and upbringing responsibilities arising from the care of children.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, as elsewhere, child care comes in diverse forms: centre based child care such as nurseries, creches or day care centres and home based care where children, usually in relatively small numbers, are cared for in a private home, whether in the child's own home or in the carer's home.  National child care development policy will take into account the variety of types of child care in existence and build on these, centred all the time on the actual needs and requirements of women.</P>
    <P>I have taken action to ensure that the long-awaited report of the Working Party on Child Care Services will be completed shortly and I expect to have the recommendations of the working party on my desk within a matter of weeks.  I know that this document will serve as an extremely useful input into our future policy-making in this area.</P>
    <P>If real progress is to be made in achieving an adequate level of quality-based child care in this country it is essential that the issue be dealt with as a coherent whole rather than in a piecemeal way. Child care is an issue which involves women's equality as well as aspects of <Col N="1211" /> health, education and employment policy.  Because of the multi-faceted nature of the issue it is important that it be addressed in a co-ordinated way.  I see the challenge of establishing adequate child care facilities for all our citizens as a requisite for the achievement of true equality of opportunity in Ireland.</P>
    <P>An equal society will enrich the perspectives and experience of every member of the community.  An equal society is one where every citizen enjoys the benefits of full participation.  It is one where new and exciting possibilities for action in our public life will flourish.  The participation of every member of the community in public life is to the benefit of all.</P>
    <P>This is the first Government to bring the issues of equality and discrimination in from the margins and put them into the mainstream of Irish life.  By giving equality issues a prominent place in the Programme for a Partnership Government, and now in the National Development Plan, we are at long last giving reality to the rhetoric of equality of women and men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, dealing with issues such as poverty and the integration of tax and social welfare, I welcome this plan as a critical element in the Government's strategy to combat poverty and social exclusion. When it is successfully implemented the National Development Plan will be the basis for the empowerment of disadvantaged and marginalised communities. The plan marks an end to simple trickle-down policies which characterised much of the last plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Development Plan is a plan for employment.  Its central objective is to ensure the best long term return for the economy by increasing output, economic potential and long term jobs.  It is further designed to reintegrate the long term unemployed <Col N="1212" /> and those at high risk of becoming so into the economic mainstream.</P>
    <P>These three sentences from the introduction capture the essence of what is involved in the plan.  The first two sentences state in a relatively traditional way our intention of generating faster growth: these sentences might have come from any previous national economic plan.  At this level what is significant about the National Development Plan is its massive size and scope.  It is the biggest investment programme ever undertaken in Ireland and as such can be expected to have a major and positive impact.</P>
    <P>The truly radical and unprecedented aspect of the plan is signalled in the third sentence, which makes the task of tackling the cancer of long term unemployment a central goal of the plan. Throughout the plan, in particular in Chapter 7 which deals with local development and Chapter 8 which deals with human resources, there are measures specifically designed to address the forces which have consigned too many of our citizens to long term unemployment. There is a recognition that without a particular focus on these factors there is a danger that the growth which will undoubtedly flow from this plan will bypass many of our citizens.</P>
    <P>This marks an historic shift of emphasis in dealing with disadvantage.  Up until now most programmes dealing with community development and unemployment blackspots have been of a pilot and experimental nature.  This plan brings poverty and unemployment to centre stage, making their elimination a cornerstone of the Government's strategic policy. Moreover, this is to be achieved not by Central Government diktat but by co-opting local communities into an exciting process of local development, co-opting not just the men of Ireland but the women of Ireland, who have created, quietly and confidently, a new community framework for growth and development.</P>
    <P>This plan is not about tax and social welfare systems or their integration. Rather it is about employment and <Col N="1213" /> investment in our people and our assets. The Opposition's criticism of the plan for its failure to deal with these issues simply reveals their lack of ideas for investment. The integration of tax and social welfare is extremely important and is being dealt with by me on behalf of the Government. Today we are dealing with a different and equally important issue and I ask the Opposition parties to give us their ideas on that issue.  The Opposition parties seem to have very few ideas and they constantly sidetrack into different areas.</P>
    <P>I wish to make one important point about the programme as a whole.  As I said, this is the largest programme of investment in economic infrastructure ever undertaken in the history of the State.  This means that, as far as Irish business is concerned, many of the deficiencies which were identified by the Culliton report, and which have been the subject of complaint from employer organisations over the years, will be transformed.  I am referring to investment in our transport networks, energy supplies and postal and telecommunications links where business will be the principal and direct beneficiary. We are embarking on this programme at a time when the country's economic indicators are favourable to business.</P>
    <P>Our interest and inflation rates are historically low and we are committed to low Exchequer borrowing.  An unprecedented investment in training and education is underway which will enhance the quality of skills in the workforce.  The Government has put its weight behind the negotiation of another pay agreement which would be favourable to business. Other issues of concern to business &mdash; for example issues surrounding poverty and employment traps which can affect the supply of labour and the possible introduction of lower rates of employers' PRSI contributions for certain sectors &mdash; are under consideration.</P>
    <P>The Government is doing its part to create a benign climate in which Irish business can grow and it has a reasonable expectation that this will lead to an increase in employment.  It is vital to the success of the National Development <Col N="1214" /> Plan that employers respond and grasp the opportunity which this plan gives them.  Anyone conscious of the previous performance of Irish business, as recounted in the Culliton report or by Senator Professor Joe Lee, must have some anxiety that the required response may once again not be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was surely correct in this House on Tuesday when he stated that the excuse of PRSI being too high was no longer acceptable as an explanation for poor business performance. The publication of the National Development Plan means that several other convenient excuses &mdash; the roads, the phones, etc. &mdash; can also be buried once and for all.  The banking sector also has a role to play.  Even though it is a silent partner in much of this country's development, it is critical that our banking system supplies funds to indigenous industry and services on reasonable terms and conditions.</P>
    <P>Turning to the aspects of most direct concern to me, a radical new feature of the plan is the extent to which resources will be committed to local disadvantaged communities to empower them to play an equal part alongside statutory agencies and the social partners in the social and economic development of their areas.  I am saying to people in Ballymun, Clondalkin and Tallaght, in Westside in Galway and in Knocknaheny: this is your plan too.  You will not be left behind again while the rest of society enjoys the good life and an ever-increasing standard of living.</P>
    <P>The local development programme will build on the community development programme, which my Department introduced in 1990, the EC Poverty 3 Programme, which has been the source of much useful learning and experimentation on how best to tackle social exclusion, and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> area-based companies which brought together much of that learning and experience in a new local partnership structure to harness the energy and commitment of all the partners in our society in a concerted and targeted response to long term unemployment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1215" /> The plan is a carefully thought-out and coherent response to joblessness.  Poverty and joblessness go hand in hand. Joblessness leads to poverty and social exclusion from rewards such as status, opportunities for self-fulfilment and self-development, social contacts and networks. Job creation and protection of existing jobs must remain at the forefront of our efforts.  This is a primary objective of the plan.  We must also concern ourselves with ensuring that those on the margins of society are given a fair opportunity to benefit from mainstream economic development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 3, 12 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>The question of providing alternatives to imprisonment in cases of non-payment of fines or debts is under consideration in my Department and any proposals which may emerge will, of course, be announced in the normal way.  It is fair to say that a certain amount of confusion surrounds public discussion of this issue and it might be helpful if I were to outline briefly the current position and give a general indication of the type of proposals which I have under consideration.</P>
      <P>In the case of imprisonment for non-payment of debt &mdash; which I understand is the area which primarily gave rise to the concerns expressed by the United Nations Committee on Human Rights referred to by Deputy Harney &mdash; it is important to emphasise that no person may simply be committed to prison merely for the non-payment of a civil debt.  Committal usually takes place only after all other avenues to enforce the debt have been exhausted.  Under our law a debtor may be committed to prison only for failure to comply with a court order to make payments in discharge of a debt and such an order may be made only after examination of means designed to establish that the debtor is, in fact, financially in a position to make those payments. Accordingly, it is only those who are judged to have the capacity to make payments but who refuse to do so &mdash; rather than those who are simply financially unable to make the payments &mdash; who may be committed to prison.</P>
      <P>Equally, in the case of non-payment of fines, it is worth mentioning that there is an obligation on the courts when imposing a fine to take into account the means of the offender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The actual number of prison places occupied at any given time by people committed for non-payment of debt or fines tends to fluctuate at between 1 and <Col N="1217" /> 2 per cent of the total prison population. It would be wrong to suggest, therefore, that people in this category contribute in a major way to pressure on prison accommodation.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I recognise that if appropriate and effective alternatives to imprisonment can be devised in these circumstances it would be well worthwhile proceeding with these.  It is in that context that I should mention two proposals which I have under consideration.</P>
    <P>The first relates to the use of community service as an alternative to imprisonment for non-payment of fines. However, whatever about the merits of this approach in relation to non-payment of fines, I do not believe that it would be appropriate in the case of non-payment of debt.  In debt cases there is a third party to whom money is owed and one of the purposes of imprisonment in those cases is to attempt to bring about &mdash; as often happens &mdash; settlement of the debt.</P>
    <P>In relation to non-payment of both debts and fines I am considering the introduction of a system of attachment of earnings whereby the court could order that outstanding debts or fines be deducted from a person's earnings.  This would represent a form of instalment system for the payment of fines.  Instalment orders are already a feature in relation to debt inasmuch as the court may order payment of the amount due to the creditor by instalments.  As to the question of introducing a system of payment of fines by instalment beyond that envisaged in an attachment of earnings scheme, this matter is also under consideration in the context of the general review which I have under way in this area.  That review is in line with the Programme for a Partnership Government which contains a commitment to revise the law relating to fines and, in particular, to provide for their indexation which would allow for updating the scale of fines.  I propose to bring forward legislative proposals as quickly as possible in the light of the outcome of that review.</P>
    <P>Finally, as to the part of Deputy Mitchell's question dealing with confiscation of assets where fines would normally <Col N="1218" /> follow conviction, I intend to bring forward legislation shortly dealing with confiscation of assets which represent the proceeds of crime.  However, as part of the approach we propose to take there would not be a question of substituting confiscation for a fine.  Confiscation proceedings would be designed to deprive a criminal of the actual proceeds of crime and arise only after a person had been convicted and sentenced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are many countries around the world where gross national product in illegal drugs exceeds the whole of GNP in respect of normal products, that those countries are flooding the world with these drugs, thereby corrupting people who are making large amounts of money from crime and using that money to compete with the legitimate community?  In that regard, would the Minister tell the House why it is taking so long to bring forward the long-promised legislation to confiscate assets gained in such circumstances and in similar criminal circumstances since this promise has been before the House for some considerable time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only answer for my period as Minister for Justice and, as the Deputy is aware, I have been in that Department for only a little more than ten months.  In that period, we have seen a legislative reform programme in the criminal law area which probably was not equalled for some time prior to that.  As part of that legislative programme I will be introducing a Bill in this session to deal with confiscation of the proceeds of crime.  That Bill will be published within a month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the second part of my Question No. 1, regarding the attachment of income in court proceedings and also in relation to the other question which has been taken with it, is the Minister aware that in a previous reply to me she stated that 12 per cent of all committals to prisons are for non-payment of fines.  In fact, the <Col N="1219" /> Whitaker report puts the figure much higher but even if we are to accept the figures at face value and although 1 to 2 per cent of the prison population at any given time may be there for non-payment of fines, the whole system is being clogged up by the 12 per cent who do not pay their fines.  They are brought through the judicial system to the stage where they are sent to prison.  In those circumstances, rather than simply provide for fines in legislation here, would the Minister ensure that we provide for the collection of those fines, whether by instalments or attachment, but also, in some circumstances, by the confiscation of assets equal to the amount of the fine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In the original reply I answered on the basis that I was proposing a system of attachment of earnings and that I was considering a system of payment by instalments.  Committal takes place only after every other avenue has been exhausted and while the Deputy is correct that approximately 12 per cent of all committals are for non-payment of fines, it is important to stress that because the figure is 12 per cent, the general assumption is that 12 per cent of the prison population are in prison for non-payment of fines.  As we know, that is not true.  The figure is between 1 and 2 per cent.</P>
      <P>I accept that one of the reasons the court system is being clogged up is because of this procedure but people are entitled to go through the courts system. To deprive them of that would be wrong and I do not believe that is what Deputy Mitchell is suggesting.  All of the other avenues that he and others, as well as myself, have been suggesting are part of the overall package that I propose to bring forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the judge should make provision for collection at <Col N="1220" /> the point of sentencing rather than having this 12 per cent of committals clogging up the system.  If people do not pay the fine, they should be in default and there should be an attachment of earnings for the appropriate amount of the fine.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware the Law Reform Commission has a position paper in relation to sentencing policy.  I am looking forward to its final report because it has made many recommendations based on what Deputy Mitchell and all of us have been discussing in this House for a number of months.  It would be my intention that as soon as that report is published, whatever changes in the law are required as a result of it will be implemented immediately.  I believe the Judiciary will find the recommendations in that report helpful.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Priority Questions Nos. 2 and 5 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several Deputies in this House &mdash; Deputies Gay Mitchell and Gregory being prominent amongst them &mdash; have on many occasions, voiced their concern concerning the problem of drugs, especially in Dublin city.  I fully share their concern.  I know they are talking on the basis of what they learn and what they see in their own constituencies and that they are speaking on behalf of the vast majority of law-abiding people in those constituencies who are very deeply <Col N="1221" /> worried and often quite frightened about the problem.</P>
    <P>I am in the position, as Minister for Justice, of having to tackle the drugs problem.  I regard it as a matter deserving the very highest priority.  All we have to do is look at what is happening all over the western world to realise that one of the most serious threats to order within most societies is that posed by illegal drug use.  It is a form of criminal activity which is highly organised and sophisticated on an international level.  It is extremely difficult to control.  Billions of pounds are made annually leaving behind a trail of broken lives, human misery and death.</P>
    <P>As to the law and order response, I can assure the House that I have been devoting and will continue to devote more time to this problem as Minister for Justice than to most others.</P>
    <P>I have met the Garda authorities on numerous occasions to discuss the matter, to ensure that they have what they need to tackle the problem, to assess whether new strategies &mdash; and what new strategies &mdash; may be called for, to consider responses made in other jurisdictions and so on.  I will continue to do this and will continue to support whatever initiatives that they, in their professional judgment, deem best in order to cope with the situation.</P>
    <P>I would simply draw attention to two matters.  The first is that special units have been set up in areas of known drug activity which work closely with the Divisional Task Force and the local detective units.  Secondly, and in my view, very importantly, a special task force has been established recently to combat the serious problem of drug abuse in the north inner city.  This resulted directly from an unannounced visit by me to the area in question.</P>
    <P>I will continue to stay in constant touch with the situation and in constant contact with the Garda to ensure that the situation is kept under control.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I think I should say a word about heroin abuse in particular, because it is a subject which has been adverted to more than once by Deputy Gregory.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1222" /> On 23 March 1993 in response to a parliamentary question I stated that more up-to-date provisional figures subsequently supplied to me by the Garda authorities indicated that the 1992 figures would be higher than previously anticipated and indicated by me on 17 February 1993.  The reason for this was that the preliminary figures supplied to me in advance of my reply of 17 February did not include a substantial amount of heroin which was seized by the customs authorities in November 1992.  Final figures for 1992 are now available.  These show that there was a substantial increase in the amount of heroin seized in 1992 compared to 1991.  Even though the 1991 figure was particularly low, being the second lowest level of heroin seized in the ten-year period 1983 to 1992, and even though 77 per cent of all drug seizures in this country are cannabis seizures, the 1992 heroin seizures indicate quite clearly that heroin abuse is a problem that needs to be carefully watched.  I want to assure the House that I and the Garda authorities will be doing just that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the origin or source of all of these drugs is well established, for example, the golden crescent, places like Bolivia, Peru and Colombia, and that there are now indications that Colombia has moved from cocaine into heroin?  When countries such as those are flooding the world with drugs, it is no wonder we have had the highest seizure of heroin on the streets since 1986, if the Garda statistics for 1992 are to be accepted.  In that context will she agree there is need for a drugs enforcement agency, which would include the Garda, Customs and health authorities?  Given that the source of these drugs is known, will the Minister agree there is need for a European drugs enforcement agency to take diplomatic action against those countries that continue to flood the world with these products?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Deputy's first question about the establishment of an Irish drugs enforcement <Col N="1223" /> agency, he will be aware, as will other Members of the House, that recently I have been concerned about public reports that the level of co-operation between the two units charged with drug enforcement, the Garda and Customs, in the south-western part of the country has not been at the level it should be.  As a result, I asked a senior official of my Department to undertake an investigation and I talked to the Garda Commissioner. A number of meetings have taken place between a senior official in my Department, the Customs section of the Department of Finance and the Garda Commissioner.  Co-operation at that level is at its highest ever.  The Garda and the Customs have two different functions. Customs must seize the product; the Garda want to get at the suppliers, the people who are causing misery among young people in particular.  As a result of the preliminary investigation carried out I have been assured by the Customs authorities and by the Garda that the highest level of co-operation will continue to obtain in the enforcement area, particularly in the south-west.</P>
      <P>As part of that investigation I have examined very seriously the possibility of setting up a drugs enforcement agency. While I might have personal views, obviously I must take into account the advice given by all of the people involved. I am examining that advice and hope to be in a position to take a definite decision shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the establishment of a European drugs enforcement agency, Ministers for Justice in all of EC countries recently signed the EUROPOL Agreement. It is in recent years only that Ministers for Justice looked seriously at the threat posed by drug traffickers throughout the Community.  People now realise that threat does not respect boundaries, that it travels from one country to anothere, whether part of mainland Europe or separated by sea.  We have lodged a request with the EC, through the Department of Finance, for a substantial financial contribution by the European Community, on the basis that it is now <Col N="1224" /> a European problem.  Money should be spent to support the drug enforcement agencies in the provision of equipment and resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that there must be something seriously wrong when she was told in February last by the Garda authorities there was no evidence to suggest any significant increase in the supply of heroin while the reality is that in 1992 the highest amount of heroin was seized since 1986 and heroin and other drugs are openly on sale in this city?  Does the Minister accept that whole areas of this city are being subjected to intimidation by street gangs pushing drugs, that the drug treatment centres in those areas are being swamped by new addicts, that the problem is getting out of control?  While accepting that the Minister has said the matter will receive the highest possible priority, will she accept that to date &mdash; and I mean up to this very day &mdash; it has not been accorded the highest possible priority? Will she outline the specific measures she is taking to deal with the problem?</P>

      <P>Deputy Gregory made allegations in the House, probably on the last occasion on which we dealt with Justice questions, in relation to specific areas which he then brought to my attention personally where there was open drug dealing on the streets.  As a result of that I made an unannounced visit to the areas in question.  Having made that visit I spoke to the assistant commissioner of the Garda Síochána with responsibility for the Dublin Metropolitan Area and the superintendent in charge of that district.  I voiced the concerns expressed in this House by Deputies Gregory and Gay Mitchell.  I said I was unhappy that Members of the House, or indeed members of the public living in this area, felt that in some way the enforcement powers available to the Garda were not being used.  As a result, a special task force was set up which now operates within the north inner city, the particular problem area Deputy Gregory brought to my attention.  If <Col N="1225" /> Members know of other areas in the city where a similar attack on the problem could be brought to bear, I would appreciate it if they would bring them to my attention.  No area within my deparmental responsibility receives greater attention from me than this because it constitutes the greatest challenge and problem facing not just the Garda authorities but other agencies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister know or accept that 98 per cent of drug dealers, if not all of them, are known to the Garda and that the real problem is lack of resources &mdash; manpower resources, the technological surveillance equipment &mdash; to mount intensive operations to bring these people before the courts?  Does the Minister accept that when they go before the courts many members of the Judiciary are totally out of touch with and do not realise the seriousness of the problem?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I deny the suggestion by Deputy Gregory that the Garda do not have the necessary <Col N="1226" /> resources &mdash; either manpower resources or technical surveillance equipment &mdash; to deal with this problem.  The Garda authorities, from the Commissioner down, and most particularly the Assistant Commissioner dealing with the DMA, are aware of the highest priority that I as Minister for Justice have accorded to this. It is a matter for me to make policy in relation to the Garda Síochána and how they implement their drug enforcement powers.  I have also told them there will be no shortage of financial resources to deal with this problem because we all agree it is of the utmost priority.</P>
      <P>In relation to the courts, I cannot comment, as Deputy Gregory is well aware, on members of the Judiciary or on various decisions they may make.  This issue has received enough publicity from the media for all members of the Judiciary to be aware of the concerns expressed not only by us in this House but by all members of the public and particularly those in Dublin city.</P>

      <P>The Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990, amended and extended the Firearms Acts, 1925 to 1971, to control the availability and possession of offensive weapons, including knives and other articles. The Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990 (Offensive Weapons) Order, 1991, specifies descriptions of a large range of weapons whose manufacture, importation, sale, hire or loan is prohibited by virtue of the provisions of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the concern expressed in some quarters about the availability of hunting and other such like knives and in that regard I am considering what additional measures may be called for in relation <Col N="1227" /> to imposing further restrictions on their sale.  I would be glad to hear of any proposals Deputies may have in this respect.</P>
    <P>I think it would be useful to have a general review from time to time of the list of weapons which are proscribed by ministerial order and I propose to commence such a review immediately in conjunction with the Garda authorities.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I am grateful to you for taking this question.  Is the Minister aware that in my own constituency in just over a 12 month period two youths died, one recently, as a result of stabbing incidents? In view of the fact that there have been a number of other deaths arising from similar incidents, would the Minister agree that the supply of hunting knives across the counter to all and sundry is unacceptable and that there should be some form of control, perhaps a Garda certificate or to be accompanied by a parent, which would make it difficult for young people to buy these weapons across the counter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that we need to do something to try to ensure that young people who have no reason to have access to these knives do not have the option to purchase them across the counter.  On the other hand, it is difficult to know what type of control one can impose.  I do not want to deprive people who are genuinely in pursuit of their normal leisure activities or those who use certain types of knives in their business &mdash; for example, butchers and so on.  I do not want to deprive those people of being able to purchase those knives.  Further, I do not want to put a cumbersome identification system in place which at the end of the day would be difficult to implement and may not achieve its objectives, knowing how people can find loopholes.  I share Deputy Mitchell's concerns and I am looking at the possibility of imposing further restrictions.  As the Deputy will be aware, a comprehensive list of various implements, mostly combat weapons, are outlawed.  There was no system in place <Col N="1228" /> where that could be reviewed on a yearly basis, but I am now putting that system in place because from time to time new weapons come on the market which were not thought of when that Act came into being.</P>

      <P>Following on from my reply to the Deputy on 17 June last, I can confirm that I have completed a review of the recommendations in this detailed report and I shall be placing my proposals for further action on the report before the Government very shortly.  The implementation of the recommendations in the report involve several Government Departments, including my own Department and State agencies, as a consequence of the broadly based approach to the problem of urban crime and disorder, which was adopted by the interdepartmental group.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's reply that she intends to put proposals to the Government shortly.  Would she agree that this report resulted from disorder in the Ronanstown area as far back as November 1991, that it came out in November 1992, that it is now October 1993 and that her reply does not indicate the degree of urgency required?  I agree that it is not only the Department of Justice that is involved but also a number of other Departments, such as Education and Social Welfare.  However, the recommendations in the report concerning the Minister's own Department have not been implemented.</P>

      <P>I would not like anybody to think that because I have not brought forward a report to Government in relation to the implementation of the report in total my own Department has not been implementing the recommendations in the report for which my Department is responsible.  Deputy Currie will agree that my Department had fewer recommendations to implement than the other Departments and State agencies put together.  First, the strength of Garda resources allocated to Ronanstown has been maintained, as was requested.  There are 60 members currently attached to the station.  As was requested in the report, gardaí engaged in community policing have not been diverted to other duties.  Foot patrols and mobile units are being maintained.  Facilities have been provided at the station for a juvenile liaison officer.  A conference room facility is included in a major refurbishment programme for Ronanstown Garda Station.  That facility was requested by the local community because they wanted a facility where they could discuss with the Garda Síochána on a regular basis the difficulties in the area.  Funding which has been provided by my Department up to now, and which was provided by me this year, for the Graft project will continue.  As Deputy Currie has acknowledged, a number of Government Departments, such as Health, Social Welfare, Enterprise and Employment, the IDA, the corporation and others, have various recommendations to implement.  They have to be implemented as part of an overall capital allocation by all those Departments. I should also acknowledge the fact that the Department of the Environment, with the local authority, have given a substantial sum of money for the provision of roundabouts to try to deal with the death riding difficulties in that area.</P>

      <P>The Deputy was so eager to put his supplementary questions that he did not listen to my reply.  The only point the Deputy raised that was at variance with what I said was that Garda management told me 60 members of the force are based at Ronanstown Garda station, while Deputy Currie said the figure is 58.  I will confer with Garda management after Question Time to find out why I was given an incorrect figure, if that was the case.  On the question of a juvenile liaison officer, the Deputy did not listen to my reply because I said a juvenile liaison office had been put in place in Ronanstown and that is a prerequisite to the appointment of a juvenile liaison officer.  That was agreed many years ago with the representative associations.  On the provision of a conference room facility, I said it was part of a package of refurbishment and the construction of an extension to Ronanstown Garda station and would be included then.  I did not say that it is in place.  That should answer the Deputy's supplementary questions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 13, 23, 28, 56 and 58 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is a party to two international <Col N="1233" /> instruments on human rights, the European Convention on Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  The approach of successive Governments to both of these international instruments has been to carry out a detailed assessment of their obligations, both before ratification and in response to subsequent interpretations of the instruments, to see whether these are already provided for in Irish law or whether additional legislation is needed. The alternative approach suggested, that of direct incorporation of the European Convention into Irish law, raises a number of questions which would have to be answered before such a proposal could be given further consideration.</P>
    <P>Many of the rights contained in the Convention and the Covenant are either explicitly contained in our Constitution or have been identfied by our courts as being among those rights not expressly enumerated by the Constitution, but implicit in its provisions.  In the light of this, it would be difficult to incorporate into our laws, whether by means of a constitutional amendment or legislation, new provisions which duplicate many of those already in the Constitution.  Who would interpret those provisions, our Supreme Court, the European Court of Human Rights or the United Nations' Human Rights Committee?  What would happen if the provisions conflicted with each other?  What would happen to our constitutional jurisprudence built up over so many years?  Until there are convincing answers to these and other questions, I do not believe that the principle of direct incorporation in the Constitution can sensibly be said to be the best way forward.</P>
    <P>I raise these points by way of a realistic assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the various possibilities put forward. The important point, surely, is that the Government is fully committed, as it has shown, to full compliance with its international obligations and the House can be assured that, whatever legal means are chosen to achieve this, that principle will not change.</P>

      <P>On assuming my duties as Minister for Justice, I first examined the aliens division as there were a number of difficulties in this area. As a result of that examination, the Government established an inter-department committee, representing the Government Departments which had an interest in this area, including the Department of Enterprise and Employment, as it would have to look at it from the point of view of work permits, the Department of Foreign Affairs because our consulates and embassies abroad are dealing with this problem on day-to-day basis and the Department of Justice.  Various recommendations were made and a Bill to deal with this matter is in the course of preparation in my Department. The Deputy will be very pleased when he sees the results of the wide-ranging consultation that has taken place.  The interdepartmental committee did not work on its own, it invited all the organisations who had expressed concern in the past about the difficulties of asylum <Col N="1235" /> seekers to visit it.  The positive recommendations it made were taken on board and will be implemented into law.</P>

Will she agree that there is something objectionable about our present system when, for example, our Constitution contains three separate references to the death penalty and I understand we are about to sign a Protocol to the European Convention on Human Right outlawing the death penalty? Is it not time we brought out constitutional provisions, as this question suggests, into line with what we consider acceptable human rights' standards internationally and at home?</P>

      <P>It is always desirable to have the best possible provisions in our Constitution.  As the Deputy is aware, we are committed to <Col N="1236" /> acceptable standards of human rights.  He must accept &mdash; and I believe he does &mdash; that the advice available to me is that there are difficulties in relation to jurisprudence which have developed over the years in regard to what is contained in the Constitution.  We must ensure, whatever road we take in incorporating the Convention into domestic law, whether it is by way of legislation or amendment, that we do not do something counter to that already contained in our Constitution or superfluous to what is already provided for in our laws.</P>

      <P>In regard to the second question, I cannot give the Deputy a definite commitment in respect of a timescale.  Legislation on asylum seekers will be dealt with separately and is being drafted in my Department at present.  I had hoped to be in a position to publish it this session, but I would not like to be tied to that.  Nevertheless, the legislation is not being delayed.  I realise many Deputies and people outside this House have raised questions in regard to the treatment of asylum seekers and I am determined to clarify the matter once and for all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister must be aware that several interdepartmental committees have examined the matter of asylum seekers.  The former Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke, was involved in a full examination of the matter as one of the presidents of the European Council when Ireland held the EC Presidency. Surely there should be no further delay in implementing some of the promises the Minister made in this House when we debated the Bill introduced by Deputy Shatter.</P>

      <P>There is no delay in that regard, but I felt it was important that everybody involved in asylum should have their say in any proposals introduced by the Government. For that reason I involved people from the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Enterprise and Employment.  I also felt it important that the interdepartmental committee should not only have access to Government Departments or State agencies, but would also have the benefit of the knowledge, wisdom and recommendations of the various voluntary agencies whose representatives, like Deputy Carey, have expressed concern in regard to our asylum laws.  For that reason the committee met a wide range of groups who are interested in this matter.  As far as the officials of my Department and I are concerned, there will be no delay in introducing the legislation and the benefit of the interdepartmental group meeting and the recommendations made by the various groups will be evident then.</P>

      <P>The responsibility for maintaining law and order in public places which includes the vicinity of large scale sporting and recreational events, such as major GAA matches, soccer and rugby internationals, concerts and community festivals, is a matter for the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of 319 members of the Garda Síochána were involved in the policing of the Féile '93 concert in Thurles.  The gardaí were drawn from all over the country <Col N="1238" /> so as to minimise the effect on policing arrangements in the areas from which they came.  These areas included the following Garda divisions: Tipperary, Carlow-Kildare, Clare, Cork East and West, Kerry, Laois-Offaly, Limerick, Longford-Westmeath, Roscommon, Galway, Waterford-Kilkenny, Wexford and the five divisions in the Dublin Metropolitan area.  I should point out that many of the 319 gardaí on duty at the Féile would not have been rostered for duty in their own districts at that time and therefore there was no loss in those areas.</P>
    <P>Ten gardaí were employed on non-public duty inside Semple Stadium during the concert at a cost of £13,309 to the organisers.  The total cost of the Garda operation was almost £120,000.  This figure includes overtime, allowances and travel and subsistence payments to members of the Force.  Salary costs are not included as they would be incurred in any event.  About £40,000 of the total cost will accrue to the Exchequer through income tax deductions.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister put a figure on the number of gardaí who were involved in policing at Féile '93 who would otherwise have been rostered for duty in the normal way on that day?  Will she accept that of the 319 gardaí assigned to Thurles on that day, many were plundered from their normal Garda divisions and work, leaving those areas underpoliced on a busy bank holiday weekend? Will she indicate what arrangements were made in those divisions to substitute the gardaí assigned to Thurles?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I do not have the precise information which Deputy Gilmore requests, but I may be able to send it to him.  The information I have from Garda management is that many of the 319 gardaí assigned to Thurles would not have been rostered for duty on the day in question and that therefore there was no reduction in manpower resources in their divisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to events such as Féile '93, I am considering seriously requesting the promoters to make a substantial contribution <Col N="1239" /> towards the policing provided by gardaí at such events.  That would not only involve sporting events, but many cultural and entertainment events, community festivals and so on.  That area is difficult to quantify because it is difficult to decide what one should charge the organisers.  For example, where a large proportion of the proceeds from such events go to charity, is one entitled to charge &mdash; or how is one entitled to charge &mdash; the promoters?  This is a complex area about which I have received many representations and I am considering the matter carefully at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that if she goes down the road of charging promoters for the policing of such events, promoters will have to assess their own Garda requirements and for financial reasons will obviously employ fewer than the local superintendent believes apposite?  Bearing in mind that approximately £120,000 was the gross cost in respect of Féile '93 and that approximately £40,000 will accrue to the Exchequer through income tax deductions, which is another day's work, will the Minister agree that there was probably a large scale increase in expenditure on VAT which on an occasion such as Féile '93 would recoup a significant portion of the cost to the Exchequer?  I would caution the Minister that if she gets into the business of regulating large scale events she will create a massive bureaucracy to doubtful effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McDowell's comments are logical and those are the main areas about which I am concerned.  However, because I received a large number of representations, I should at least examine the possibility as a matter of courtesy.  I accept it is difficult to quantify and I do not want to bring about a situation where crowd control is not enforced.  The Department of Education, through its sports section, will be implementing the report of the Hamilton Committee.  As Deputy McDowell stated, we must be <Col N="1240" /> careful when introducing any system of payment by the organisers of any events to ensure that we do not create cumbersome bureaucracy.  Also, we would have to consider seriously the level of charge and the types of events to which such charges would apply.  How would the charge be made?  Would it be made by a levy on tickets, by VAT or some other way?  It is a serious issue and deserves consideration.</P>

As a mother of a young teenager who went to Féile last <Col N="1241" /> year, I must compliment the organisers.  I agree with Deputy Lowry that we must compliment the 319 gardaí and the management team who provided excellent policing for the event.  It is important that young people be entertained.  We were all young once and we want to ensure our young people have access to proper facilities.  We also want to ensure that sporting, musical or large entertainment events are spread around the country and that obstacles are not put in the way of allowing promoters organise such events. This is a matter in regard to which representations have been received in the Department and it deserves my serious consideration, but I caution Members that there are difficulties and pitfalls involved which I am sure they accept and, therefore, we must be careful.</P>

      <P>It is my understanding that Garda management have been insistent that, in so far as it is possible, gardaí rostered for policing duty, such as that in Féile '93, would be gardaí <Col N="1242" /> who would not normally be rostered for duty in their area and they try to ensure that is the case.</P>

      <P>I did not have the figures for Deputy Gilmore earlier in relation to how many of the 319 gardaí on duty might have been rostered for duty in their area, nor would I be able to quantify what the loss of those men and women might have involved for those areas.  However, I share the Deputy's concern if it is the case that members who were rostered for duty in areas of particularly high incidences of crime were rostered for duty elsewhere during a large entertainment or sporting event.  I understand Garda management policy has always been that the duty should be assigned to men and women who are not rostered for duty in their area in so far as that is possible.</P>

They spent a large amount of money at the event and this benefited the local economy.</P>

I would like to encourage promoters of events such as Féile '93, to continue to organise these events and ensure policing is provided, by members of the Garda and private security people employed by the promoters.  I do not want to dampen anybody's enthusiasm or depress young people's entertainment, regardless of the part of the island from which they come. However, I must seriously consider the various representations made in the light of the difficulties and pitfalls involved in organising such events.</P>

      <P>There have been no appointments of civilians to Garda posts so far this year pending detailed consideration of Garda Management's review of civilianisation in the Garda Síochána which was completed earlier this year.  The Garda Commissioner has also drawn up a corporate strategy policing document for the Force in line with the commitment in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997,</i> and I was pleased to note that further civilianisation during that period is one of its key recommendations.  As the House is probably aware, I am preparing a package of law and order measures which I will be putting to the Government in the near future and the employment of more civilians to release gardaí for operational duties will be one of the items addressed in this connection.</P>

They include the posts of the personnel officer, the management accountant, the press officer and the head of organisation and development. Already the fleet manager and the radio engineer are civilians and the head of the new research unit in Templemore, who is about to be appointed, is also a civilian.

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the Whitaker report of 1985 on penal reform set out precisely what needs to be done in reforming our prisons?  Would she further agree that without the implementation of the recommendations of the Whitaker report the prisons are no more than factories recycling offenders, given the fact that in the juvenile area 50 per cent to 80 per cent of all offenders are recidivists?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Whitaker report was published eight years ago and since then a subtantial change has taken place in the prison system.  Those changes should not be ignored in any prison review or in any changes that we might contemplate.  It was for that reason that I decided on a prison review which for the first time would be published by a Minister for Justice and would show the system as it is &mdash; the difficulties, the challenges <Col N="1246" /> and the problems.  I am sure Deputy Mitchell would accept that there have been changes such as an increase in HIV prisoners, in the number of sex offenders and in the demand for extra custodial places, along with competing demand for non-custodial places and sentencing.  It is important to take all those changes into account in any prison review.</P>
      <P>It would be wrong for people to assume that nothing has happened since 1985.  A number of substantial changes recommended by Whitaker have taken place. There has been an increase in alternatives to custodial sentencing and we have established a sentencing review group and appointed a director of the prison medical service.  We also established and extended the intensive supervision scheme and, in so far as it is possible, we have improved the management/staff relations at the prisons.  It is clear that a number of Whitaker recommendations have been put in place.  It is wrong to say that we should not look at the changes I have outlined.  These are serious items which must be taken into account.</P>

Would the Minister agree that some people are forming new bad habits while in prison and that the prison system is not only a failure but a costly failure?  The capital cost per cell is about £250,000 and the running cost per prisoner per year is up to £30,000.  In considering this whole area is the Minister considering the appointment of an inspector of prisons and a prisons board?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point about the prison system not being rehabilitative, I am concerned about any allegation that we in the probation and welfare services <Col N="1247" /> are not endeavouring in so far as we can to support prisoners.  We cannot force prisoners to use facilities available to them in prison, nor can we force them to attend various treatment or therapy sessions.  In relation to sex offenders, about which I have particular concerns, there was a pilot scheme in Arbour Hill which was allowed to finish and nothing happened.  However, the recommendations of the pilot scheme were evaluated and as a result I have put in place a comprehensive system of treatment for sex offenders in Arbour Hill.</P>
    <P>That is the way we must go in relation to each of the sectors in the prison system.  No prison system is ideal, but we want to ensure in so far as it is possible that prisoners do not re-offend when released.  We cannot always ensure that, but I would not accept that the system is a failure.  The cost per prisoner, as Deputy Mitchell said, is in the region of £30,000 per year.  It is a costly system no matter what way we look at it, whether we are talking about providing extra custodial places, which we will have to provide, or imposing non-custodial sentences and the level of supervision that would be required in that case.  It is very important that the review is published, warts and all, and that people have an opportunity to debate the penal system in an informed way.  We have not had that opportunity before and this review will afford us that opportunity.</P>

      <P>Arising from what the Minister has just said and harping back to the lighthearted banter between me and Deputy Mitchell last night, does it not make sense now to face up to the fact that we simply must have extra custodial places?  Is it not sensible to make a decision in prinicple not to provide those extra places on the basis that when this bulge of young offenders becomes a thing of the past and things improve, the Minister will be in a position to retire redundant prisons built 150 years ago and have a better prison service at the end of the day?  Would the Minister not consider in that context that, rather <Col N="1248" /> than wait for the review, she should put in hand the planning of extra custodial places now because it is money that will have to be spent some day and the Minister might as well get on with the job?</P>

      <P>I have indicated often enough publicly that we will need more custodial places.  Unfortunately, the Department of Finance tend to get very excited if I say that I have made a definite decision on these matters in advance of putting my proposal to Government.  The Deputy can be assured that one of the recommendations which seems to be coming as a result of the review is that we need somewhere between 150 and 200 extra custodial places.  I have already decided that within that number we need a specially constructed women's prison to take account of the different circumstances of women prisoners.  We have to treat women prisoners differently.</P>
      <P>It is important that we look at the whole prison system.  I have taken the opportunity in the last ten months to visit every one of the prison facilities we have, with the exception of St. Patrick's Institution, which I hope to visit in the next week or so.  I have learned a lot from those visits and that, as Deputy McDowell said, there are some very good examples of prisons here and some very bad ones.  That is why it is important that we debate the changes in the prison system in an informal way.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that part of the problem with the prisons is that on the one hand people are being imprisoned for perhaps non-payment of a small fine while on the other hand people are being released early although they have been imprisoned for serious crime and should be kept locked up?  In that situation would the Minister direct her mind in any overall plan towards further non-custodial punishments for minor offences?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will she bear in mind that each year there are more than 200,000 convictions for non-indictable minor offences and that in virtually all cases the penalty <Col N="1249" /> imposed is a fine?  The alternative to the payment of a fine invariably is a spell in prison.  As the prison system is clogged up would the Minister consider adopting some other approach such as the collection of fines rather than the alternative of a spell in prison?</P>

I am sure Deputy O'Keeffe is aware that I am considering various proposals, including an attachment to earnings and the making of payments by instalments.  The claims made are not true and the number of people sent to prison for the non-payment of fines account at any one time for between 1 and 2 per cent of the prison population.</P>

      <P>I was about to suggest that, perhaps, Deputy McDowell should be made responsible for minding the key of the cell in which Deputy Mitchell would be kept.  On the question of AIDS, there is no complacency.  Deputy Mitchell would find on a visit to Mountjoy Prison that the medical unit there is one of the finest medical facilities in the country.  Every facility is provided for prisoners who are HIV positive.  On the question of those who re-offend, if memory serves me correctly no statistics are available.  I have taken this matter up with the prison authorities.  A number of prisoners, having served their sentence, re-offend later but I do not have the statistics.  The Deputy said he knows a mother who wants her son to finish his sentence in a different prison because she is fearful he will pick up a drug habit.  I would be very concerned about this and I will raise the matter with the governors whom I meet regularly.</P>

      <P>Hostels, workshops and day centres under my aegis are run by voluntary committees in association with my Department's Probation and Welfare Service to provide accommodation, work-training and counselling for offenders.  These committees comprise a wide range of representatives from relevant Government <Col N="1251" /> and non-governmental agencies. Depending on the type of facility these would include representatives of my Department's Probation and Welfare Service, the voluntary body itself, members of the Judiciary and business community, the responsible health board, vocational education committee, FÁS, etc.</P>
      <P>My view is that the committees are best placed to ensure efficient and caring management of the facilities and effective co-ordination between the various Government and non-governmental agencies involved.  My Department, of course, is responsible for the policy, funding and overall direction of these facilities and adding a further layer to the current organisational structure would not, in my view, serve the offenders' best interests.</P>

They may end up on the streets and, inevitably, commit crime.  Would the Minister agree that no assessment of the needs of prisoners when they leave prison is carried out with the result that they return to the prison system which costs us a substantial sum of money?  Would the Minister consider something along the lines proposed by the Whitaker review committee which is currently considering the possibility of aftercare for offenders who have served long sentences to prevent offenders ending up in prison again at a cost to themselves and society in general?</P>

      <P>I had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Ken Whitaker, the current chairman of the sentence review group, earlier this week when he had some very interesting comments to make and recommendations to put to me.  I will give these serious consideration in the review of prison policy but it would not be right to say nothing has happened in regard to Whitaker's recommendations on hostels.  For example, a new hostel, which can accommodate 11 boys, was built in Waterford last year at a cost of £250,000.  Lyons Villa Hostel in Dublin was recently renovated while the Dún Laoghaire youth project established a training workshop in the mid-eighties to cater for 20 disadvantaged young people at risk in the area.  Side by side with this development of centres, workshops and training units much has been done in areas such as Ballyfermot in Dublin and Southill in Limerick where the Probation and Welfare Service is actively involved.  Some progress has been made on the recommendations in the Whitaker report but, as I said, no system is perfect and I am sure there is more we could do.</P>

      <P>I have received a number of representations about the appointment of a legal ombudsman, including representations from the Irish Farm Family Therapy Group.  The Minister of State met representatives of the group on 29 September.  The group's main concern is the appointment of a legal ombudsman. They have been informed that the proposed Solicitors Bill which I hope to publish this session will provide for the appointment of an independent adjudicator to investigate complaints about the Law Society's handling of complaints about solicitors by members of the public.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1988 the biggest reservation was about the lack of consultation with the regions and the local authorities in formulating the plan.  This error has been repeated on this occasion. Consultation has been minimal and much of the effort on the part of statutory and voluntary groups throughout the regions has come to nought.  The fact that this plan had gone to Brussels before it was announced shows up this discussion for the charade that it is.</P>
      <P>This plan represents the worst form of centralist planning.  Money will be distributed on the basis of political considerations rather then on general needs. We must ask ourselves if we have got it right this time.  As a nation our priority should be to reduce unemployment by creating real jobs, thereby reducing the high levels of deprivation in urban and rural areas.  The Government is adopting a blunderbuss approach by throwing money around in a wasteful way at certain projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last national plan stated that the Government's main priority for a five-year period was to address the deficiencies in our system and also create an environment conducive to increasing productive investment.  Putting a plan in place that does not address the root causes of the problems is wasteful.  In the five years since the publication of the last plan the main impediments to job creation have not been addressed.  High levels of direct and indirect taxation are still with us.  The major impediments to small businesses getting off the ground still exists; public liability, personal and employers liability insurance are still high.  Attempts to resolve these problems <Col N="1320" /> have been hindered by vested interests in our society which the Government is afraid to take on.  The Government has not addressed the inefficiencies in our court system in a serious way.  Every time real change is contemplated the vested interests win the day.</P>
    <P>Allowing those deficiencies to continue to exist means that money pumped into various projects will be largely wasted. The opportunities offered by the level of investment have been wasted.  In excess of 300,000 people are now unemployed. That is but the base figure.  It is closer to 400,000 when the numbers in part-time jobs or on training schemes are taken into account.  The deprivation that existed five years ago is even greater now.  We have a more widely divided society than we had then.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach to this new plan gives me no hope that anything will be different this time.  The Government has raised expectations throughout all communities.  In every part of this country people were encouraged to bring forward projects but there was really no consultation between these communities and the Government, no translation of local effort into Government decision making.  I do not believe that the expectations raised will be met.</P>
    <P>We have seen the announcement of large scale investment and construction projects.  These will result in the provision of jobs during the construction phase but those jobs will not be permanent. Unemployment figures will not be reduced in a meaningful way.</P>
    <P>The so-called emphasis on eliminating social deprivation has not materialised. We hear much about that matter in the lead up to the announcement of the National Development Plan, especially from Labour Party spokespersons.  When the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Burton, spoke earlier about economic factors and indicators, she spoke more like an economist than a Minister.  In parading indicators from time to time, the Government does not take into consideration the victims of Government policy in recent years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1321" /> The Government should have addressed the whole question of regional development in the context of local government reform.  Instead they set up county enterprise boards, bureaucratic bodies that will consume large portions of their funding because of their inherent deficiencies.  There will be numerous county enterprise boards duplicating work in some areas and leaving serious gaps in others.  A regional approach would have been a much better way of getting real regional development off the ground.  Instead of going down the road of real local government reform and combining the service role of local government with a new developmental role on a regional basis, the Government is taking a very fragmented approach to regional development which will not attain the desired result.  There will be an appalling waste of public funding.</P>
    <P>As Fine Gael spokesman on Social Welfare one of my jobs is to address the modern problems of urban living, which have not been considered in this plan. The widescale deprivation in large tracts of our cities and towns is not addressed. The consequence of this deprivation will be evident in the years ahead because there is a total lack of understanding of how to deal with the issues involved.  In our cities and towns there is a vicious circle of deprivation, with unemployment creating despair and a rundown in people's living conditions and in the appearance of urban areas, resulting in these areas being unattractive to industrial investment, which in turn results in further unemployment.  That vicious circle will not be broken by the thrust of this development plan.  I hope the Government realises sooner rather than later that investment in large-scale projects will not help people create opportunities for themselves.  I regret that this last opportunity we may get for some time to take positive action, may be lost.</P>
    <P>The Government has taken a blunderbuss approach to regional development. The dramatic, high powered announcements that will issue in the weeks and months ahead will create an impression that the position will improve, but very <Col N="1322" /> little will be done to deal with the social problems which this country is facing.</P>

      <P>Being one of the longest serving Members of this House it will be no surprise to Deputies that this is not the first time I have heard Fianna Fáil put forward their proposals for a better future.  As a young Deputy I vividly recall the Lemass era of 1956 when 100,000 new jobs were announced in Clery's ballroom in Dublin.  The catch cries were: &ldquo;Bring your sons and daughters back from England&rdquo; and &ldquo;Get your husbands back to work&rdquo;.  I remember the late Deputy Sean Collins, nephew of General Michael Collins, reminding the then Taoiseach, Mr. Lemass, that he did not tell people the jobs would be in Birmingham, Manchester, London, New York and Chicago.</P>
      <P>In 1959 Mr. Lemass brought in a five-year economic plan with high principled ideals, but it got nowhere.  He discovered that in the economic plan he had forgotten about the word &ldquo;social&rdquo; and in 1964 he brought in a five-year social and economic plan, with apologies to the mentally and physically handicapped, the sick and the infirm who had been forgotten about in the 1959 plan.  People were reminded that as we developed our economy more money would be available to spend on the economic needs of the country.  With little apology to the less well off in society, the word &ldquo;social&rdquo; was added to the five-year plan of 1964.</P>
      <P>During the late 60s and early 70s the troubles began in Northern Ireland and that was a new debating platform for Fianna Fáil.  They did not have to come forward with any plans or programmes to tell the country how they were going to govern.  For a while during those turbulent times the then Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, was busy trying to contain the rebels, the armchair generals on the backbenches of his party.  The next plan introduced was the Fianna Fáil election manifesto of 1977, and that is when the trouble started.</P>

      <P>Like the National Development Plan, the 1977 election manifesto was a give-away programme, scattering money around like confetti, as Deputy Harney said this morning.  The Government threw money at problems without telling people what it was planning for. Having read this national plan and the synopsis, I share the view of many economists who wonder what the Government is planning for.</P>
      <P>In 1982 the then Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, introduced <i>The Way Forward.</i> That document was placed before the House as a motion to be adopted or rejected and it was lost, resulting in a general election and loss of power for Fianna Fáil.  When Mr. Haughey was reelected as Taoiseach in 1987 he introduced the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> the implication being that the Government of 1983-87 was not a good Government and had destroyed the country.  That Government set down basic principles to control the national debt and get public spending in order.  It took action not because it was popular but because it was right, and it paid the price when it went out of power, losing 19 seats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1990 Mr. Haughey introduced the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and now we have the Ireland &mdash;<i>National Development Plan 1994-1999.</i> Listening to all the promises of Fianna Fáil speakers, one after another telling us what the future will hold, it will be no great disappointment to me if this programme does not succeed.  I wish it well and hope it will succeed, but it is too much like a Santa Claus programme, as Deputy Eamon Gilmore said this morning. I have been credited as the Deputy who put a name on the Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, when he was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and had the reputation of never saying no.  I glibly <Col N="1324" /> gave him the name &ldquo;Uncle Albert&rdquo; and I think it was a very apt description. Uncle Albert is doing us proud at present throwing money around like, as the late John Kelly would have said, a drunken sailor.  We have now reached the new &ldquo;AD era&rdquo;&mdash; the Albert and Dick era.  I agree with Deputy Gilmore that when the Taoiseach went to Edinburgh last year and discovered there was a Christmas box of £8 billion to be spent he did not want to give up Government and word was sent back to Dublin to do a deal which ensured Fianna Fáil stayed in Government.</P>
    <P>I should like this plan to have been debated more thoroughly in the House. I would have liked an assurance that the plan was debated by all members of the Fianna Fáil and Labour Parties. However, there is no evidence to suggest that this happened.</P>
    <P>To be parochial, there is nothing in the plan for north-east Donegal.  Too many senior politicians regard this money as campaign money which if used to improve facilities in their constituencies will ensure their re-election.  There is no evidence to suggest that the backbench Members of Fianna Fáil and Labour were consulted in the formulation of this plan. If they were consulted, then Deputy McDaid, my colleague in north-east Donegal, who has to carry the can for the Government in that constituency, must have been mute and was singlularly unsuccessful in his efforts.  No money is being provided for harbours in County Donegal.  The people in Greencastle, Moville, Buncrana and Rathmullan will be very disappointed at this lack of funding. I hope money will be provided to improve the main road between Buncrana and Bridgend and other roads in the area.  The road from the Border to Bridgend, which is approximately one and a half miles, is in a good condition, but the remainder of the road is in a very poor condition.  The Minister for the Environment cannot find money to improve this road.</P>
    <P>Where were Deputy McDaid and Senators Maloney and McGowan when the plan was being formulated?  They <Col N="1325" /> have been very quiet.  The sooner I get answers to these questions, the sooner I will stop talking about this issue.  These three public representatives have been indicted by what the Government call a national plan.  This is not a national plan. On the Order of Business this morning I asked the Taoiseach if this was a national plan or a Fianna Fáil-Labour plan.  It has now transpired that it is a Fianna Fáil-Labour Cabinet plan, and perhaps only a few selected members of the Cabinet are making the decisions.  County Donegal has always been referred to as the Cinderella county.  Any of the funding given to County Donegal has been directed to south-west Donegal; very little funding has been given to north-east Donegal.  I take great exception to the people in that area being treated in that fashion.</P>
    <P>The bishops of the west came together in an effort to motivate local communities into doing something to save the west. They blamed the lack of progress in the west on high levels of unemployment and emigration.  There has been no response by the Government in the plan to their plea.  I am bitterly disappointed that no money is provided in the plan for housing. There is something sick in a society which does not have the moral fibre to build houses for its homeless.  The only answer the Government can give is that money for housing will have to be found from other sources.  However, I cannot understand how no money for housing can be found in a sum of £20 billion.</P>
    <P>The £8 billion we receive from Europe has to be matched by £4 billion, which the Government proposes to raise by way of taxation on workers who are already very heavily taxed, and £8 billion from Irish industry.  Irish industries have told us that they are going through a very difficult time &mdash; they have low profits and many companies have gone bust.  The Government says it proposes to raise £4 billion in taxation and Irish industry will give £8 billion.  However, I have yet to hear Irish industry saying: &ldquo;We will give £8 billion&rdquo;.  I should like to know if the real sum is £8 billion or the projected sum of £20 billion.  I should like answers to those questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews) Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the recent publication of the National Development Plan, including the increased allocations for the marine sector.  It is good that the House has been given the opportunity to discuss the plan, one of the most fundamental plans ever produced in the history of this State, so soon after its publication.</P>
      <P>In essence, the National Development Plan is a carefully developed and integrated strategy, designed to greatly enhance our economic development over the next five-six years.  However, economic development is not an end in itself; it is important only as a means of creating greater prosperity and more jobs.  As the synopsis accompanying the plan states: &ldquo;This plan is about jobs&rdquo;.  As I said, jobs are not an end in themselves; they are important because of the access they give our people to a decent way of life, to a sense of dignity and well being and for the opportunities they open up for our children and grandchildren.  Even though the targets in the plan are challenging, they are achievable and realistic.  They are achievable if we all play our part and work together.  I would include all Members of the Dáil in that call.  The Government has an obligation to make the plan work and the Opposition parties have an opportunity to support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to deal specifically with the marine sector which is ready to play its part in two main ways &mdash; by creating jobs and increasing prosperity through the exploitation of natural resources, often in the most peripheral regions of the country, and by increasing our competitiveness as an exporting nation through more efficient and better port facilities.  I have no doubt that the combination of these measures will result in significant numbers of temporary and permanent jobs, both directly and indirectly, over the lifetime of the plan. As Minister for the Marine, I have a strong philosophical view of the need to locate jobs on the periphery of this island &mdash; in other words, in the remote rural parts which have been neglected for so <Col N="1327" /> long.  I should like to think that this plan, under my leadership and guidance in the Department of the Marine, will ensure the realisation of that philosophy.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan will provide for a basic investment programme of £270 million in the marine sector.  Additional resources available through the Community initiative framework will bring the total for the marine sector to approximately £300 million. The key goals of the Department of the Marine are to ensure adequate and competitive port and shipping capacity and services so as to facilitate the growth of industry, agriculture, fisheries and tourism and to create the maximum number of sustainable jobs in the fisheries sector and also in port related activity, shipping and other marine industry.</P>
    <P>The investment in the marine sector under the national plan will enable us to achieve all these goals.  The main areas of investment as envisaged by the plan are: a substantial investment of £100 million in commercial ports; an investment of at least £137 million in the fisheries sector including aquaculture, the fleet, processing, fishery harbours and training; an investment of £9 million in marine research; a new programme involving an investment of £19 million in tourist angling, is an extremely important sector of tourism, and, for the first time under structural Funds, a £5.5 million programme of investment in coastal protection.</P>
    <P>A major investment of £100 million is planned for ports and will focus on three main objectives: to facilitate the expansion of industry and agriculture and the expansion of tourism and to assist regional development.</P>
    <P>The expansion of industry and agriculture requires that there are ready and efficient means available to get our products quickly and efficiently to European and other markets.  The port development programme is aimed at facilitating the expansion of industry and agriculture by giving our ports a competitive advantage. This investment will take place in the strategic corridor ports of Dublin, <Col N="1328" /> Dún Laoghaire, Waterford, Cork, Rosslare and the Shannon Estuary, including Limerick and Foynes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>What about Donegal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as well as in important regional ports.  Donegal is high on my list of priorities and I want to assure the Deputy of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not doubt that Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a deep affection for that part of the country and, indeed, for all the Deputies who come from there.  They have served this Dáil, their county and their country well.</P>
      <P>Investments designed to stimulate increased competition at our ports will be a key element of the programme. Facilities to increase competition among shipping operators are essential to improve the frequency of services and to reduce costs.  The programme also provides for investment in selected projects to improve capacity which which will be required to meet targeted market requirements.  There will also be a focus on investment to improve port handling equipment.  Improved handling will provide faster, more reliable ship turnaround and will also improve efficiency with resultant potential for lower charges.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Task Force recognised access as one of the two biggest barriers to tourism development.  The second objective of the port development programme is aimed at facilitating the expansion of tourism and, by improving access, assisting in the realisation of the employment and earning potential of this sector. The port investment to facilitate tourism development will be in Dún Laoghaire, Dublin, Rosslare and Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in Donegal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Donegal will be considered very closely in the context of the development plan and anything that I can do to give advantage to that part of the <Col N="1329" /> country, in the context of what I believe to be the correct philosophical and political direction of the Department of the Marine, namely, taking account of the disadvantaged peripheral regions, will be seriously taken into account.</P>
      <P>The port development programme takes account of the national objective of achieving a balanced development between regions, which comes back to Deputy Harte's point.  In many cases regional ports are the life blood of the local community and are of key economic importance in regional development.  By assisting the maintenance of regional ports the programme will play a critical role in facilitating development in the regions.  Investment is, therefore, planned in the main regional ports.</P>
      <P>The investment programme for commercial ports is part of an overall development strategy for commercial ports.  This will involve the introduction of legislation to provide for major changes in the management structures of the main ports with the establishment of commercial semi-State bodies and continued improvement of labour relations and practices.  This will improve efficiency and enhance our ability to respond to market requirements.</P>
      <P>For far too long the ports have been seen as the final link in a chain between Irish producers and their foreign customers. Efficient low cost ports should be the first step in linking Irish business with their customers.  That is why every penny earmarked for ports in this plan will be money well spent.  Its value lies not in any direct job creation in the ports but in the tens of thousands of jobs sustained or created further back along the chain if our ports are cheaper and more efficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new development programme for the fisheries sector will be a totally integrated programme.  For the first time, all fisheries areas including the fleet, aquaculture, processing, fisheries harbours, training, marketing and marine research will be included in a single integrated programme for the sector.  This is a fundamental development.  It will allow us to take a much more integrated and long <Col N="1330" /> term view of all aspects of the industry and to develop each individual aspect as a part of the whole.  Total investment of £146 million is planned.</P>
    <P>The general objective of the fleet development programme will be to bring about a sustainable balance between available fish resources and their exploitation within the framework of the European Common Fisheries Policy, a policy that I still believe did not give Ireland a fair deal in the sea fisheries context.  The programme will include measures to improve and modernise the fleet in line with European Community fleet targets, including a new decommissioning scheme; maximise the quantity, value and quality of landings by increasing take-up of currently under-utilised quota and non-quota stocks; bring about the maximum employment in the catching sector consistent with long term viability and, most importantly, enhance operational safety.  I cannot over emphasise the importance I attach to that because I believe what is required begins and ends with the safety of the vessel.</P>
    <P>The aquaculture sector continues to grow in importance within the overall fisheries sector.  The primary objective of the aquaculture development programme is to maximise the industry's contribution to the expansion of the Irish economy and to sustain and create lasting employment, particularly in the peripheral coastal regions.  The strategy will include measures to improve efficiency and cost effectiveness, increase output, quality, competitiveness and employment, stimulate investment in new aquaculture products and new species and improve management practices for existing species.</P>
    <P>A modern and dynamic fish processing sector is vital to maximising the value added to the Irish economy from the sea fisheries and aquaculture sectors.  The fish processing programme will be directed to the improvement of conditions under which fishery and aquaculture products are processed and marketed.  Investment will cover the provision of new processing facilities and the upgrading of existing facilities.  The aim <Col N="1331" /> of the programme is to create a stronger fish processing and marketing base and so to maximise employment facilities and opportunities.</P>
    <P>Capital renewal and development of infrastructure and facilities will be undertaken at the main fishery harbours and at local fishing and aquaculture harbours. Other measures include the expansion of port facilities and the ice supply network. During the currency of my Ministry I would like to see the updating and modernisation of ice plants.  It is fundamental that all our fishery harbour centres have updated and modernised plants.  The programme will also focus on developing the small harbour &mdash; this comes back to Deputy Harte's point, which was very relevant &mdash; where the fishing and aquaculture industries have an important role in the local economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that within the overall context of the National Development Plan, as part of my strategy, I will be taking a serious look at the peripheral regions.  If those regions include Donegal the Deputy can be certain that Donegal will be uppermost in my mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that every harbour, river, pier and so on could not be specifically addressed in the plan, but the Deputy can take it that it is my heartfelt wish to give money to Donegal if at all possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major new programme of investment in marine research will be undertaken under the auspices of the Marine Institute, another new very important element within the marine sector, something I am very proud to have established. This will provide the essential research back-up to support the development of our marine resources.  The investment programme will be geared at <Col N="1332" /> key centres of expertise nationwide.  It will underpin employment and job creation throughout the marine sector. By enhancing our technological capacity to exploit all our marine resources we will achieve greater efficiency, productivity and added value.  The planned investment builds directly on the present funding initiatives under the EC-assisted STRIDE programme.  This has enabled us to substantially upgrade key marine research facilities.</P>
    <P>A main theme of the National Development Plan is the development of our economy as a high skills one.  This aspect is not overlooked in the marine sector where the objective of the training programme is to improve the level of efficiency, safety, quality and business skills in the industry.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Marine is currently working on the new operational programme for the fisheries sector.  The programme will set out indicative allocations to each subprogramme of the programme and define the detailed requisite measures to be applied.  In order to draw down the funding for the fisheries sector with the least possible delay we intend to finalise the operational programme with the utmost urgency.  In this connection I am anxious also to have as much input as possible by industry representatives into the operational programme and the final allocation of funding as well as any ideas they may have on measures or schemes to be adopted.</P>
    <P>Since entering the Department of the Marine it is fair to say that, as best as one physically can, I have put in place a consultative process with the fishing industry which I think is relatively acceptable to them.  While there remain nuts and bolts to be readjusted here and there, I should say that consultation forms part of my stock-in-trade, part of the baggage I brought with me into the Department of the Marine.  I believe in consultation, in consensus; I do not believe in confrontation. I consider confrontation to be wasteful to what we all seek to achieve which is the betterment of an industry I believe has remained in division II or <Col N="1333" /> division III in successive Government leagues over the years.</P>
    <P>Most of the existing measures in place for the fisheries sector will continue. These cover financial support for vessel construction and modernisation as well as construction and improvement in aquaculture and processing establishments. In addition, I have in mind a number of new measures including, in the aquaculture area, one to allow small projects to qualify for grant-aid with increased emphasis on quality and hygiene throughout the production chain.  In this respect input from the industry will be very important, again under the consultative process I mentioned.</P>
    <P>The fisheries sector has good potential for creating jobs.  With the sort of money we will be able to invest in this sector, many of these will become a reality. While it is difficult to say exactly how many jobs will be created, I would hope for the creation of a substantial number of jobs annually, most of them in the aquaculture and processing sectors.</P>
    <P>The fishing sector is important for our economy, not merely because it provides in excess of 15,000 jobs and contributes to the balance of payments in the form of approximately £200 million worth of exports annually but also because much of the economic activity and many of the jobs generated are in those remote areas to which I referred.  The fishing industry is an important industry generator and an important means of keeping communities together in these peripheral regions.</P>
    <P>A major initiative involving an investment programme of £19 million is planned with a view to increasing substantially tourism, angling and revenue. It is estimated that the development strategy will generate approximately 1,000 long term sustainable jobs.  Angling is one of Ireland's leading specialist tourism products. Between 1989 and 1992 the number of visiting anglers increased by 50 per cent, to 76,000.  Maintaining this rate of growth requires continued improvement on the quality and level of facilities available to anglers.  In order to maintain and develop <Col N="1334" /> the quality and level of Irish fish stocks I am proposing, under the plan, a comprehensive fishery rehabilitation programme which will concentrate on increasing stock levels, stock management and predator controls.</P>
    <P>A £5.5 million investment programme is planned to protect key coastal areas by coastal protection works.  This will be the first time a coastal protection programme will be included within the framework of the Structural Funds.  Many of the areas under the threat from coastal erosion are major tourist amenities.  Erosion, and possible loss of such amenities, would pose serious economic difficulties for local communities, who, to a large extent, depend on tourist amenities for their economic survival.  Similarly, coastal erosion can pose a social threat to isolated coastal communities by disruption of vital transport and communications links.</P>
    <P>Under the Community Initiatives Framework it is anticipated that a range of measures in the marine sector will be supported.  Funding for these projects will come from the expected marine share of the additional allocations of Structural Funds under the European Community initiatives programme.</P>
    <P>The maritime links between Ireland and England are of great strategic importance to this island.  It is envisaged that there will be a joint cross-Border programme under the Community Initiatives Framework which will focus on the development of key ports on both sides of the Irish sea and on access to those ports.  Under rural development measures there is scope for development in fisheries and aquaculture.  These will include the enhancement of salmon fisheries in rivers in Border areas and a dedicated research programme for salmon and other freshwater fish.</P>
    <P>In discussing a plan such as this it is almost inevitable that no sector will be entirely happy with the allocations proposed. Yet I have no doubt that the marine sector has been well catered for in this plan.  With my Department I fought hard to get a proper allocation for the marine sector.  We have got that allocation. <Col N="1335" /> It is not a matter for us to do the best we can for what I described as our common purpose, the betterment of the overall marine sector.  It would be folly to regard the plan and the Marine allocation as the end of a process; in fact it is a beginning.  The task now is to take this plan, finalise the detailed programmes needed to support it and get on with the job of its implementation, a task to which I look forward as Minister for the Marine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication of this document.  In the type of document it represents, which is always a difficult and complex exercise to put together, it is one I believe will form the basis of successful dialogue with the relevant authorities in the European Commission. I am familiar with the format of some of the documents submitted.  It appears that they have hit some heavy water in terms of the review that has been going on in Brussels.  This document, in its approach and substance, is likely to facilitate for this country a relatively easy production of a Community support framework which is of course the basic document on which to build this programme.  Indeed, it also anticipates some key areas which will arise under the subsequent operational programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In making that comment on the National Development Plan, in comparison to what I know to be the stand of some other countries that submitted national plans ahead of us, I must put on the record that, at a political level, I deplore the failure to engage this House, and its specialist committees, as partners in that process, not necessarily because the final product might be hugely or materially different but because it is an important part of the political life of the State.  Now that we are part of a wider European Community, Government and Opposition, both Houses of the Oireachtas and their relevant committees should be fully engaged in what is a most important strategic exercise for the nation.  Everyone in Opposition shares with Government the sense that there is a major purpose to this.  The exclusion <Col N="1336" /> of the Houses of the Oireachtas and its committees and the presumption that the process of statements is superior to a proper debate is a wrong political decision, and I say this in the light of the welcome I have already given to the document and the general substance of it.  Politically, the Government have been badly advised.  It is wrong that this House has not brought its collective wisdom to address the priorities of this plan, even if many of them tend to recommend themselves.</P>
    <P>I was interested also to hear the Taoiseach describe the employment targets as neither optimistic nor pessimistic, but realistic.  On that front one has to always commend realism over spoof.  Certainly, the modesty of the targets suggest a degree of realism which, I regret to say, borders a little on fatalism.  I should like to develop some of these points tomorrow.</P>
    <P>This plan clearly signals that there is potential for growth, which it will deliver, because the scale of spending is such it has got to inject growth into the economy. But the House has to focus its attention on how we translate more growth into more jobs.  Those translation mechanisms signalled in the subtext of the plan &mdash; possible changes in tax and so on &mdash; need to be investigated in great depth to produce a better translation of growth into employment than has been historically the case over many Governments and decades recently, and this will remain the case if one follows the realistic gross outcome in employment.  God only knows what that means in net outcome in employment.  This is an issue I would like to come back to.</P>
    <P>Also, it would have been fruitful if this House had engaged in a wider debate to include the following: the role of the exchange rate and its implications for interest rates; the role of a future wage deal in terms of wage competitiveness; the necessity to avoid any increase in the debt burden and the debt service and the necessity to facilitate productive enterprise, a point made in the body of the plan submitted.  Culliton took a very wide view of what would facilitate enterprise, especially in the area of tax reform.  This <Col N="1337" /> plan, so far as it mentions that area, takes a much narrower view.  I fail to see how you can facilitate and energize the potential for enterprise by simply taking the narrower ground chosen under the tax headings in this plan compared with the wider strategic space recommended by Culliton.  That, too, is a subject to which I should like to return tomorrow when this debate resumes.</P>
    <P>I have the impression that this is a plan of various parts.  I say that because there are two ways in which one can approach this process: one is based on a strategic analysis of the key blockages in the Irish economy, the key constraints in its development and the areas to which we should address our resources, and the other is that you build it as a sum of parts. It is a sum of parts plan and perhaps less strategic than some of its proponents have set out to suggest.  Nonetheless, it is done with a certain substance and quality which is bound to facilitate its passage relatively quickly through the fairly tough procedures it must now enter in the European institutions.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bernard Durkan gave me notice of his attention to raise the matter of the need to restore free transport facilities to a person (details supplied) in County Kildare who was attending a special school until recently.  Deputy Durkan has five minutes to present his case and the Minister of State has five minutes to reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for the opportunity to have this matter aired in the House.  It is sufficiently important to warrant consideration by the House.  It refers to a young man who up to now has attended a special school, Scoil Mochua in Clondalkin.  Because of his disability he has availed of special transport which has been provided.  However, due to changes in administration, that transport <Col N="1338" /> is no longer available.  His parents are now faced with a situation where he has to stay at home for the remainder of the school year.  I know the Minister of State opposite and the Minister would not want that to happen and certainly I would not want it to happen.  In a caring and compassionate society a person suffering from a disability should not be discommoded to the extent that he or she cannot attend the school of his or her choice, particularly when we all, rightly, place such emphasis on the need to provide facilties for such people</P>
      <P>However, the Minister has conceded to some extent by offering a grant of £500 plus to help defray the costs if the parents or the parents council could do something further.  The Eastern Health Board has very kindly offered a grant of £800 plus to assist in the matter, but the actual costs involved are in the region of £2,700, a long way short of what is required.</P>
      <P>While the Department of Education has made a welcome gesture, for which we are thankful, and the Department of Health, through the Eastern Health Board, has made its contribution for which we are equally grateful, I would ask the Minister, in view of the serious deprivation likely to be suffered by the individual concerned and given the need to ensure that all children within reason are treated equally, if he can award something more substantial towards the total cost and the parents council may then be in a position to help further.</P>

The student in question is 18 years old and suffers from cerebral palsy.  He has attended Scoil Mochua Special School in Clondalkin, County Dublin, since 1981 and has availed of the special transport service to that school.  However, he has now grown to a point where he is too heavy to be lifted on or off the bus.  Both the school authorities and Bus Éireann have confirmed this fact.</P>

      <Col N="1339" /> In line with standard procedure in such circumstances, the boy's parents were offered a grant of £520 to assist towards the cost of school transport arrangements. This is the maximum allowable within the scope of the school transport scheme.  If we were to breach that amount special permission would have to be obtained from the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>More recently, the authorities in Scoil Mochua have indicated that the £520 grant being offered is viewed as inadequate by the boy's parents and unfortunately the boy has not attended school for some time.  It is understood that the boy's parents are seeking funding for a daily taxi service to bring the boy to and from school.  The possibility of making such provision is currently being investigated by the Department in co-operation with the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the vehicles engaged on school transport are standard commercial type vehicles which are used on other work outside school transport periods.  This has ensured that the cost of school transport operations is kept at a reasonable level.  Bus Éireann accepts that problems do arise from time to time in catering for pupils with a severe physical handicap.  However, the company assures my Department that all concerned are fully aware of the needs of pupils with disabilities and every effort is made to clear for particular requirements within available resources.</P>
    <P>The matter of purpose built vehicles with hoists, clamps, harnesses, etc. has been considered in the past but has not been pursued because of the very high cost and limited usage which would be involved.  Bus Éireann have pointed out that they have been able to cope over the years with the needs of pupils with disabilities through arrangements made at local level and that this has been due in no small measure to the co-operation and goodwill of all concerned.</P>
    <P>In the current year, approximately £38 million will be spent on the provision of school transport services.  Of this amount, approximately 20 per cent will <Col N="1340" /> be spent on services for pupils with a disability.  This is a considerable commitment, given that such pupils constitute only 2 per cent approximately of the school-going population.  The issue of school transport for children with disabilities and the range of services and equipment required in that context were among the matters which were considered in detail by the Special Education Review Committee.  The Minister for Education has just received the committee's report and will give early consideration to its recommendations.</P>
    <P>Let me assure the Deputy that every effort will be made in co-operation with the health board and other bodies to find a satisfactory solution as quickly as possible to this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you, Sir, for giving me time to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  Since 5 May 1993, the people who work in the power station at Allenwood and the people who work in Bord na Móna to supply it with peat have been in limbo.  On that date, the board of the ESB recommended the closure of the power station and forwarded its report to the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.  That evening in this House, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Treacy, informed us that the Department's chief technical adviser was examining the assessment of the situation in the power station &ldquo;as a matter of priority&rdquo;.  The latest information I have been able to get &mdash; five months later &mdash; is that nothing has changed and no decision has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed the current position in the power station is that the machinery has been stripped down and a certain amount of overhaul work has been completed. The staff are anxious to complete the overhaul &mdash; a process that I understand will take 16 weeks &mdash; but they cannot go ahead because they have not had the authorisation to do so.  Meanwhile, out on the bog there are ample supplies of fuel for the power station but <Col N="1341" /> it appears that Bord na Móna management has decided that the work of covering the peat with polythene, which would normally take place this month, will not go ahead unless and until they receive a firm undertaking that the ESB will purchase the fuel for the power station.</P>
    <P>On Monday last, I read the statement the Taoiseach made at the launch of the so-called National Development Plan.  In a list of strategic investments to which the Government will direct EC aid, a new peat-fired generating station is included. I thought at last a decision had been made, so I looked for more information in the <i>National Development Plan 1994-1999.</i> On page 111 under the heading &ldquo;Peat&rdquo;, I found the following:</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to continued use of peat for electricity generation provided that the costs are not excessive and Bord na Móna is at present completing a feasibility study into a new peat-fired power station using the most up-to-date technology which will be 50 per cent more efficient, on average, than existing peat-fired stations.</P>
    <P>Whereas the Taoiseach had apparently announced a firm decision that aid was going to a new peat-fired generating station, in the National Development Plan they speak conditionally of a policy and Bord na Móna completing a feasibility study and not of a decision.  I can only conclude, Sir, that the Taoiseach's statement was deliberately intended to deceive.  It shows yet again, Sir, that this Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Taoiseach to tell me that the deception was inadvertent but there is a world of difference between &ldquo;we will direct EC aid to strategic investments, including a new peat-fired generating station&rdquo; and the wording in the National Development Plan which states &ldquo;Bord na Móna is at present completing a feasibility study&rdquo;.  The people in Allenwood will see the difference and it does not matter which term the Chair may allow me to use in the House.  The people of Allenwood will not be fooled. The difference between those two statements shows yet again that the Government is prepared to play games with people's jobs and trample on their feelings in order to get a good hype for its image.</P>
      <P>The National Development Plan contains nothing concrete for the workers in Allenwood power station or for the workers on the bogs supplying peat to it, for the families and communities in north Kildare and east Offaly.  The Government is attempting to give an impression to those people that is very different from what it is doing.  That impression is being cultivated by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, and by the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg.</P>
      <P>If I am wrong about this, will the Minister state clearly and unequivocally that the Allenwood power station will be overhauled and that it will be kept in operation unless and until a replacement power station is brought into operation in the area?  Any failure to give that kind of unambiguous commitment this evening will be read by the people of the area for what it is and what the Chair refused to allow me to say in this House.</P>

      <P>Allenwood power station was commissioned in 1952, and at that time it was expected that its useful life would be approximately 25 years.  The power station has now been in operation for 41 years, which in itself is a testament to those who built and maintained the station.  The Allenwood station was scheduled for closure in 1984-85, and again in 1990, when a further three-year extension was decided.  The operating life of the station has therefore already been extended by 15 years.</P>
      <P>In view of the age of the station, the ESB decided that a detailed examination of the plant should be carried out, to assess its capability for future operation. This necessitated closure of the station in June 1992, to allow a major technical and safety evaluation to be conducted.  In this exercise, the ESB retained external consultants to advise them on the condition of the plant.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, the ESB submitted a report to my Department, dealing with the technical evaluation, and the assessment of the costs associated with the refurbishment and continued operation of the station.  As has been previously made known to the House, this report recommends the closure of Allenwood power station.  At a time when emphasis is placed on efficiency, it should be borne in mind that the station converts only 22 per cent of the peat energy into electricity, compared with 38 per cent for the most modern peat power stations.  The cost of producing power at Allenwood is 9p per unit.  This is much higher than the ESB's average selling price of 6.3 per unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House is well aware that my objective is to provide the most cost-effective <Col N="1344" /> and reliable supply of electricity throughout the country.  Strong economic growth, identified in the National Development Plan, is needed to bring Ireland's economic performance closer to the European average.  This can only be achieved if all parts of the economy operate as efficiently as possible.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned before that the energy equation is no different in terms of supply and demand from other products. While advances are being made in demand side management by encouraging customers to use electricity efficiently, the generation side of the equation must not be neglected.  To achieve a competitive supply of electricity, production costs must be minimised.  This is achieved by choosing the correct mix of fuels, with due regard to their price, security of supply and, of course, their environmental impact.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I appreciate the need to take account of the impact of plant closures on local communities. In this context I stress the Government's continuing commitment to the efficient use of peat as an indigenous energy source, and, in this regard, I would draw the attention of the House to the inclusion in the National Development Plan of the proposed new peat-fired power station.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGahon gave me notice of his intention to raise the matter of the proposed acquisition of Cooley Distillers by the Irish Distillers Group and the implications of such proposal for the workforce in Counties Louth and Westmeath and for competition in the whiskey trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for giving me an opportunity of raising a matter which I believe to be a scandal. While the matter involves a relatively small company, it is the implications involved that prompted me to raise it on the Adjournment.  I ask the Minister to refer the matter of the proposed acquisition of Cooley Distillers Limited by the Irish Distillers Group to the Competition Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many questions relating to the case merit an answer.  A small number of people will share in a handout of £9.5 million.  A total of 200 shareholders, of which 38 per cent are directors, will be paid £9.5 million, while the unfortunate workforce of about 30 in County Louth and 20 in Kilbeggan in County Westmeath will literally be thrown on the scrap heap.  As a believer in free market enterprise and capitalism, I have to say that is the unacceptable face of capitalism. I ask the Minister, as a committed <Col N="1346" /> socialist, to examine the matter thoroughly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is committed to Fianna Fáil now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>He is a socialist and he is also my first cousin, although I have apologised to the nation for that.</P>
      <P>The disturbing aspect of this matter is that £4.5 million of taxpayers' money was used through the BES scheme to fund Cooley Distillers.  I suggest that there was definite collusion between the directors of that company and the Irish Distillers Group &mdash; now a French company &mdash; to kill off competition.  They are not just killing off competition but the livelihoods of 50 workers who have a bleak future ahead of them.  That must be unacceptable to any party in this political forum.  Again, I ask the Minister to examine the matter carefully.</P>
      <P>Some 18 months ago Deputy O'Malley prevented an independent takeover of <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> on the grounds of a monopoly and competition and this is a similar case.  Despite the fact that four other companies were interested in amalgamating with Cooley Distillers and providing distribution as well as investment to keep the plants open, the directors of the Cooley company played ball with the Irish Distillers Group to satisfy their own interests but not those of the workforce. In a period of 12 months three offers were made by Irish Distillers to stymie opposition.  I am speaking also from the point of view of consumers.  While I do not drink whiskey, a friend of mine is a connoisseur of the spirit and I am concerned about his right to have a choice. For those reasons I again query why Irish Distillers were prepared to pay £25 million &mdash; £9.5 million plus £11 million for available stocks &mdash; to purchase a company that otherwise would have gone into liquidation in six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McGahon for giving me an opportunity to join him <Col N="1347" /> in raising this matter on the Adjournment. It is not an untruth to say that there is considerable concern in north Louth and in the Cooley peninsula generally at the probable closure of the Cooley distillery.  For historians who may be interested, the distillery was originally an alcohol factory established when potato growing was at its height in the Cooley area.  In recent years, with the support of the BES scheme, people invested heavily to upgrade the premises.  It is with great sadness that we now learn it has been sold to Irish Distillers and hear from a spokesperson that &ldquo;the purchase was merely a defensive measure&rdquo; and that it is their intention to close down the premises.  This will involve serious job implications.  Those working in the distillery were looking forward to a secure employment future, but that security has evaporated before their eyes.</P>
      <P>Those familiar with the geography of that part of the country will realise that the Cooley area is surrounded by the sea on one side and by the Border on the other.  While there is a strong work ethic in the area, secure employment is not readily available.  Therefore, it is with great regret that we learn the distillery is about to close.  I am looking forward to the response from the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to this problem. Hopefully, it will be possible to find alternative use for the premises which will provide employment but, if not, I hope the Minister can provide alternative employment for the people displaced as a result of the takeover.</P>

      <P>I am informed that Irish Distillers Group has agreed to make an offer of £1.80 per share for the whole of the issued share capital of Cooley Distillery plc.  Cooley, a public company, is not listed on the Stock Exchange.  In acquiring Cooley, Irish Distillers will assume responsibility for the bank debt and creditors of Cooley.  I understand the <Col N="1348" /> BES shareholders in Cooley will be given the option of selling their shares at a later date and that Irish Distillers will honour the trading agreements between Cooley and the various BES whiskey maturing companies.</P>
      <P>Irish Distillers has already received undertakings to accept the offer from shareholders holding more than 51 per cent of the shares in Cooley.  I believe that the formal offer will be posted to shareholders on 15 October.</P>
      <P>Irish Distillers Group has notified the Competition Authority of their proposed acquisition of Cooley Distillers under the Competition Act, 1991.  Under the Act the Authority may certify that in its opinion the notified arrangements do not offend against section 4 (1) of the Act. Section 4 (1) prohibits and renders void all arrangements which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition.  If the Authority considers that the notified arrangements do offend against section 4 (1), consideration is then given to the question of whether the arrangements qualify for a licence under section 4 (2). The Act sets out strict criteria which must be satisfied in order to gain a licence of exemption.  To qualify, the arrangements must contribute to improving the production or distribution of goods or the provision of services or to promoting technical or economic progress while allowing consumers a fair share of the resulting benefit.  They must not impose on the undertakings concerned terms which are not indispensable to the attainment of those objectives or afford undertakings the possibility of eliminating competition in respect of a substantial part of the products or services in question.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that all four conditions must be satisfied in order to obtain a licence.  A licence is granted for a specific period and may be subject to such conditions as may be attached to and specified in the licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Competition Authority is independent <Col N="1349" /> in exercising its statutory duties under section 4 of the Act we must await the outcome of its deliberations in this case.</P>
    <P>The Deputy raised the referring of this proposal to the Competition Authority. In this regard I presume the Deputy is referring to my functions under the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, as amended.  This Act imposes a strict requirement on businesses considering mergers or take-overs to notify such proposals to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment in advance of putting them into effect. Under the Act, any proposal which exceeds certain financial limits must be notified.  These limits currently apply where the value of the gross assets of each of two or more of the enterprises involved in the proposal is not less than £10,000,000 or where the turnover of each of those two or more enterprises is not less than £20,000,000.  These financial limits do not apply to enterprises engaged in the printing or publishing of newspapers who are obliged to notify all proposals regardless of the level of turnover or gross assets of the parties.</P>
    <P>Parties to a merger that falls within the scope of the Act are required to notify the details of the proposal in writing to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, otherwise they face serious fines. In addition, it should be noted that title to any assets or shares does not pass until I have stated that I do not propose to prohibit it either absolutely or subject to conditions, or in the absence of such a statement, until a period of three months has elapsed from the date of notification or from the date of receipt of such further information as may be required.</P>
    <P>In all but a very few cases the proposal is allowed to proceed without referral to the Competition Authority.  In cases where the merger is seen to have potentially damaging effects I can refer it to the Competition Authority for a report. When I receive the report I have three options.  First, I can allow it to proceed as <Col N="1350" /> planned; second, I can allow it to proceed subject to amendments or conditions, or third, I can prohibit it.</P>
    <P>Regarding the case raised by the Deputy, no notification under the mergers and take-over legislation has been received by me regarding the proposed acquisition of Cooley Distillers by Irish Distillers Group.  If the proposal comes within the remit of the Act there is an obligation on the parties to make a notification.</P>
    <P>In this instance the scale of the Cooley operation may be such as to leave it outside the remit of the mergers Act.  Ultimately, however, this is a matter for the parties concerned to determine.  I can assure the Deputy that each merger or take-over proposal which falls to be examined under the mergers legislation is carefully considered on its merits before any final decision is taken by me.</P>
    <P>I have been contacted by the Irish Distillers Group on this matter.  I will note the points raised in the House and ensure the matter is given full consideration by the relevant authorities, including my Department because the Deputy and his colleague from Louth raised the matter and because he is my first cousin, notwithstanding his outrageous views on a variety of matters.  On the basis of what I read to date I share the concerns expressed by the Deputy and I am sure they are shared by many people.  I assure the House I will do all I can to ensure that the principles of competition which I espouse will be upheld.</P>

      <P>The last time I raised a matter on the Adjournment of this House was on 10 May 1989.  The reverberations of that particular debate are still with us.</P>
      <P>I say this to make it clear that I do not lightly raise matters on the Adjournment and do so only when I feel there is a serious matter at issue that requires examination and justification.</P>
      <P>For the past 12 years a surfaced yard at Shanowen Road, Santry, Dublin 9 has been occupied by Joseph Murphy Structural Engineers Ltd., as tenants of the Office of Public Works.  This big Irish owned company has carried on a substantial business in steel fabrication and erection in heavy steels, particularly for the construction industry.  It employed more than 120 people, mainly men. Among major contracts it carried out here was the steel work for Moneypoint power station.  On 17 August the company received a letter from the Office of Public Works telling it to vacate its premises by 14 September.  It was impossible for the company to do this because it has stocks of about 2,500 tonnes of heavy steel and has nowhere to store such stocks.</P>
      <P>Because of the uncertain future, as the company does not know how long it can remain there, Murphy's has been forced to let 45 people go from its employment, and if the problem is not resolved quickly there will be further job losses.  If there have to be further job losses its operations here will become uneconomic and it will have to transfer its entire production to its English facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some years Murphy's has been endeavouring to purchase this yard from the Office of Public Works.  On the basis of a valuation it is prepared to make a substantial offer, in the region of £350,000, but the Office of Public Works is not prepared to consider any offer from it, no matter how great.  If Murphy's could buy the yard it could re-employ the <Col N="1352" /> 45 people and secure the future of at least 120 workers.</P>
    <P>The reason the Office of Public Works will not deal with Murphy's is because on the personal instructions of the Minister for Finance it has apparently entered into an arrangement with a football club to let the yard to it as an additional playing field, apparently at a lower rent.  This makes no sense whatsoever as there are more suitable level grass playing fields in the immediate locality which would require much less work and expense to prepare them.</P>
    <P>By selling this yard to Murphy's, not alone would the jobs of 120 people be preserved, but a surplus State asset could be realised to the substantial benefit of the Exchequer.  By letting it to a football club the jobs concerned will all be lost, and the Exchequer will get little or nothing from the asset.</P>
    <P>On 1 September last I wrote to the Minister of State in charge of the Office of Public Works, Deputy Dempsey, protesting at this proposal but I received no reply or acknowledgment.  I understand the Minister for Finance made this decision as a result of representations made to him by a Deputy of his party on the northside of Dublin.</P>
    <P>It seems to be a thoroughly bad decision which should be immediately reversed in the interest of employment, of prudent management of the State's assets and in the interest of equity and common sense.  Not to reverse it would be scandalous.</P>
    <P>I regret the Minister for Finance who made this decision, apparently against the advice of the Office of Public Works, is not present to reply to this debate.</P>

      <P>Joseph Murphy Structural Engineers Ltd have, since October 1988, occupied a site at Shanowen Road, Santry, owned by the Commissioners of Public Works.  The company had sought a short term letting of the site to provide an extra storage <Col N="1353" /> area for raw steel prior to fabrication and was granted a letting area which could be terminated by either side on one week's notice.  The site forms part of a larger plot of ground for which the commissioners had no immediate need, but it was envisaged that it would, at some future date, be developed for public service use.  A short term letting was therefore of mutual benefit to both the company and the State.</P>
      <P>From September 1989 St. Kevin's Boys Football Club, which has a clubhouse adjoining the plot, has been seeking to acquire the entire plot for the provision of playing facilities for the club members. In 1991 it became clear that the plot would not be required for public service use and, in June of that year, approval in principle was given to the grant of a lease of the plot to the club.  The Office of Public Works entered into negotiations with the club on the terms and conditions of a lease, but it was not until August of this year that an agreement was finalised and the terms were approved by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Throughout this period, Joseph Murphy Structural Engineers Ltd. continued to occupy the site on a short term letting.  The company did, in September 1992, express an interest in purchasing the entire plot but was advised that it was not for sale and did not pursue the matter further.  Apart from this inquiry, the company never sought to obtain a secure tenure of any part of the State property at Shanowen Road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement between the Commissioners of Public Works and St. Kevin's Boys FC provides for a 99-year lease for which the club will pay a substantial sum of money.  On reaching this agreement in August 1993 the Commissioners gave the company four weeks' notice of the termination of its letting agreement, which exceeds the period of notice required.  The company stated that it considered the notice inadequate and that the termination of the agreement posed a threat to employment.  This was <Col N="1354" /> the first indication to the Office of Public Works that the company had any problem with the short term nature of the letting or the period of notice required on termination.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners did everything possible to alleviate the difficulties facing the company.  They offered an alternative site at Shanowen Road but this was rejected.  The Commissioners were approached by agents representing the company seeking an extension of the letting period and also requesting that Office of Public Works discuss possible solutions with the football club which would permit the company to remain on the site.  The period of the agreement was then extended by a further two weeks to the end of September 1993 and officials of the Commissioners and the Department of Finance held discussions with St. Kevin's Boys FC which culminated in an agreement to allow the company to continue to occupy the site for a further period of at least nine months, that is until July 1994.  The club was also asked and agreed to consider all possible options for the property, including the possibility of accommodating, on the site, the company's long term storage needs, and to negotiate with the company on the matter.  Surprisingly, however, the company decided to reject the extension of the letting period for nine months and I understand that it plans to vacate the plot within a few weeks.</P>
    <P>I regret that this decision by Joseph Murphy Structural Engineers Ltd.  may have led to some lay-offs.  Indeed, I am surprised that the company should have chosen to lay-off staff before the temination date of its letting, and that it has continued to reduce its number of employees despite the offer to extend the agreement until July 1994.  I am confident that, even at this stage, with goodwill on all sides, a satisfactory conclusion can be reached which will enable the football club to provide facilities for its members and at the same time meet the company's storage requirements, thus negating the <Col N="1355" /> need for any lay-offs.  I am disappointed to note that the company has, to date, rejected this possibility, and I hope that it will reconsider its position.</P>
    <P>Regarding what Deputy O'Malley said about not getting a reply from my office, his office was informed that the matter should be taken up with the Office of the <Col N="1356" /> Minister for Finance.  That is why a reply was not sent from my office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The law on the matter is as follows. Regulation 5 of the Garda Síochána (Admission and Appointments) Regulations, 1988, specifies that the Commissioner <Col N="1257" /> shall not admit a person as a trainee unless, <i>inter alia,</i> if a male, to be not less than 5' 9&rdquo; in height and to be built in proportion and, if a women, to be not less than 5' 5&rdquo; in height.  This height differential between the sexes is permitted by section 5 of the European Communities (Employment Equality) Regulations, 1985, which amends section 17 of the Employment Equality Act, 1977, by the insertion of section 17B (1) (A) which provides that: orders, regulations, rules, directions, instructions, arrangements or schemes to which that section applies shall not treat men and women differently except, <i>inter alia,</i> as to requirements relating to height.  Section 17B (2) (a) of the Act applies this provision to An Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>I trust the Deputy would agree that equality considerations do not require that the physical requirements for a job must be identical for men and women. They require the elimination of unjustified discrimination as between men and women.  The different height requirements for men and women in the Garda Síochána, which arise from the particular nature of the employment, are not contrary to equality law.</P>

      <P>There is probably no such thing as an administrative system which is beyond reproach or incapable of being improved.  The underlying purpose and practices followed in all systems need to be kept under review and one of the first things I did when I became Minister for Justice was to look at the operation of the Aliens Division as it is an area my Department which has constant and very extensive interface with the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall objective of the division is to implement the statutory system of <Col N="1258" /> procedures relating to non-nationals in an efficient, speedy and courteous manner.  With a view to achieving this objective, I have been reviewing the work procedures and management systems within the division.  This review has identified certain areas where improvements are called for.  I might mention, by way of example, the need to provide the public with more information on visas, naturalisations, registration requirements and so on.  I plan to have information leaflets on those matters prepared and to have them available for distribution in the near future.</P>
    <P>Apart from dissemination of information on the matters I have just mentioned, the review will also embrace such matters as staff training, computerisation and management control systems as well as examining the liaison arrangements between my Department and the Garda authorities with regard to the operation of procedures concerning admission and residence.  In a nutshell, I want this division, which is extremely busy and deals with a large number of people day-in-day-out, to be as user friendly as we can possibly make it.  I am glad to say that the staff of the division share my enthusiasm for progress.</P>
    <P>On a broader level, the Deputy will be aware that I have established an interdepartmental committee of senior officials comprising representatives from my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  The committee is examining current practice and policy in relation to non-Irish nationals and will make recommendations as are necessary for the development of a system for the treatment of non-Irish nationals which is consistent and transparent. Submissions have been sought from agencies and individuals who believe they have a contribution to make to this examination.  I am also engaged in a review of the laws in this area and will announce any plans for legislation as soon as possible in the usual way.</P>
    <P>Finally, if the Deputy requires information concerning a particular case, then, to the extent that it is possible for <Col N="1259" /> me to provide information about it, I shall be glad to do so on receipt of a letter from him.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 30 together.  This submission, which is a quite detailed document, arrived in my Department less than two weeks ago.  It requires and deserves more study than has been possible in that time &mdash; that process is now underway.  My comments at this point, therefore, are of a preliminary nature.</P>
      <P>The bottom line in the document &mdash; which is that the court service could be improved if the State committed substantial additional resources to it &mdash; will not come as a complete surprise to anybody. But, in a situation where resources are limited and the State is attempting to cope with a range of competing demands, without imposing excessive burdens on the taxpayer, we must try to identify the priority requirement in the courts area, as in other areas, and try to find the resources to met those priorities.  My Department is and has been engaged in that very process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are issues, apart from resources, which would require the most careful consideration.  One of the major recommendations in the submission, for <Col N="1260" /> example &mdash; and mentioned specifically by Deputy Rabbitte &mdash; is that a new agency should be created to manage the courts. The Judiciary have already raised serious questions about this particular proposal, and their views on the matter certainly require very careful consideration.  While on the subject of management, incidentally, I strongly reject the suggestion by the Law Society and the Bar Council that the problems in the courts can be attributed to management failings in the Department of Justice.  That suggestion is much too facile.  Departmental responsibilities for day-to-day management of the courts is and always has been handled by a small number of officials in the Courts Division of my Department who have had to operate within the budgetary provisions at their disposal.  It is not they who have been responsible for decisions concerning resource commitments over the years. On top of this they inherited, rather than created, the situation where, by law, the local authorities and not the Department of Justice had responsibility for court maintenance.</P>
    <P>Finally, I must say that a very large volume of business is conducted in the courts, and is well conducted, day-in-day-out. I do not deny that there is room for improvement.  I readily acknowledge also that there is a very substantial case for improvement not alone on the principle that access to justice should be as efficient as we can possibly make it but also on commercial and other grounds. However, it is not a case of having to create order out of total chaos but of building and improving upon the positive aspects of what we already have.</P>

The Garda station is open to the public from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. each day, except Sunday.</P>
      <P>To say that there has been a &ldquo;spate of armed robberies&rdquo; in the area recently would appear to be at variance with the facts.

      <P>The position with regard to free movement of persons within the Community as implied by the Single European Act is that discussions have been taking place at an intergovernmental level with a view to ensuring that appropriate compensatory measures are put in place.  The need to protect against the possibility of the proposed greater freedom of movement being exploited is recognised by all member states.  The Copenhagen European Council in June noted that the full implementation of free movement of persons required particular measures with regard to co-operation aimed at combating crime and drug trafficking and ensuring effective control of the external borders and, with that in mind, the <Col N="1262" /> Council invited the responsible Ministers to bring forward their work on these measures as a matter of great urgency.</P>
      <P>The precise implementation of passport controls in member states is a matter for the appropriate authorities of each State.  Certain member states, including Ireland, have been taking steps to lighten controls at international frontiers.  Ireland is to the forefront of this movement and I reduced controls on nationals of member states entering this country with effect from 1 March last. Special channels were introduced at ports and airports to facilitate EC nationals travelling from member states to Ireland. There is no systematic check on EC nationals who use the special channels but there is a requirement that they display their passports to show that they are entitled to use the channels.  Existing controls on all persons travelling to Ireland from outside the Community are maintained.  The measures are being reviewed to see if it is possible to reduce controls on community nationals even further.</P>

      <P>I am confident that the package of measures which I will be putting before the Government and the legislative changes which are currently before the House will enable the Gardai to tackle the problem of crime and vandalism in this country very effectively.</P>

      <P>With regard to immigration policy generally within the European Community, Ministers for Justice and the Interior of member states of the Community, meeting in the Hague in December 1991, agreed on a work programme for discussing, and where appropriate, harmonising policies in the areas of immigration and asylum.  That work programme was noted by the Maastricht European Council which considered that it constituted an adequate basis for measures to be taken in those areas.  In addition, the Treaty on European Union provides for co-operation between member states for the purposes of achieving the objectives of the union, including co-operation in the areas of immigration and asylum policy.</P>

      <P>The current estimated annual cost of the operation of the prison system per head of the prisoner population is approximately £37,000 on the basis of the 1993 Estimates.  This corresponds to an estimated weekly cost of £710.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These figures do not include any element in respect of capital expenditure. They are arrived at by taking the annual gross estimate for the Prisons Vote for 1993, deducting Appropriations-in-Aid and expenditure not connected with the running of the prisons (Probation and Welfare and Community Service Orders' <Col N="1265" /> Scheme) and adding relevant costs borne on other votes (Superannuation and Teachers' Salaries).</P>
    <P>I have commenced a major review of official policy in relation to the operation of prisons and the treatment of offenders generally.  A wide range of options is being considered in this context including the wider development of community-based sanctions as an alternative to prison custody.  I should add that as things stand, there are over one and a half times as many offenders on various custody alternatives as there are in custody and that some of those on alternatives are people who committed serious offences but who have specifically been taken out of custody on the basis of a judgment in each case that, with proper supervision, it is appropriate that they should be allowed to serve the balance of their sentences in the community.</P>

      <P>The Government decision of March 1990, that local authorities should be relieved of the financial burden of providing and maintaining courthouses, was a decision in principle only. The intention was to introduce arrangements whereby the State would bear the full cost of approved courthouses capital projects and recoup local authorities at least part of the running costs of the courthouses they provide.  To date, however, due to pressure on public finances only a very limited number of capital projects have been financed from State funds and it has not been possible to recoup any part of local authority expenditure on courthouse running costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Progress, therefore, has not been as rapid as I would like it to be but I am confident that over the next few years substantial improvements in the standard <Col N="1266" /> of court accommodation throughout the country will be achieved.</P>

Other measures taken by the Garda include the targeting and monitoring of the activities of suspects.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that patrols in the area have recently been increased, following consultations with local interests.</P>

      <P>Temporary release of sentenced prisoners may be granted by the Minister for Justice under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1960 and is subject in all cases to certain conditions.  In the first place, before the Minister grants temporary release, she or he will have regard to certain factors including the nature of the offence, the length of sentence, the length of time served, behaviour while in custody and, above all, the safety of the public.  Release will not be granted in any case where the Minister considers, in the light of the advice available, that it would constitute a threat to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where temporary release is granted it is always subject to conditions.  In all cases there is, not surprisingly, the condition that the person released must continue to be of good behaviour but various other conditions may also be applied in individual cases, for example, that the individual concerned would be subject to supervision by the Probation and Welfare Service, that he or she should report at regular intervals to a Garda station, reside at a particular location, etc.  Temporary release automatically ends if any of these conditions are breached and the individual concerned can be immediately <Col N="1268" /> returned to custody without warrant or without any court proceedings.</P>
    <P>These temporary release arrangements are in effect our system of parole which is a feature of prison systems worldwide and is regarded as an element of positive sentence management.</P>

      <P>Prior to 1991, salaries, wages, allowances and office operating expenses of the Probation and Welfare Service were charged to the Office of the Minister for Justice Vote as distinct from the Prisons Vote.

The position was changed in 1991 when the Probation and Welfare Subheads were transferred to the Prisons Vote.</P>

      <P>Generally, resources devoted to the Probation and Wefare Service have steadily increased in absolute terms over the past ten years and as a percentage of the total prisons and Probation and Welfare Service budgets over the past seven years: the percentage has gone up from 7.22 per cent in 1983 to 9.21 per cent in 1992.</P>

      <P>I propose to take oral Questions Nos. 46 and 64 and written Questions Nos. 97 and 98 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all I would like to say that it would be very misleading to infer that attacks on tourists is a problem peculiar to this country.  In fact, we are all aware from events during the summer that tourists are vulnerable and are subject to attack in every country of the world, indeed the risks in many other cities and countries are much greater than here. According to information I have received from the Garda authorities, for example, there are about a half a million attacks on tourists in Amsterdam each year compared with fewer than 3,000 here in 1992. The reality is that in every country in the world there are people who are able and prepared to take advantage of groups such as tourists who are often easily identifiable and, therefore, targeted by criminals who view them as easy prey. This type of crime is particularly abhorrent to a country such as this which prides itself on a tradition of hospitality and welcome to visitors from abroad.  In this respect, it is important that the problem of attacks on tourists is not overstated as the perception can easily be gained abroad that the level and extent of the problem is much greater than that which actually exists.  In other words, this country has a good reputation to protect which has been built-up abroad by hard work and excellent marketing over a considerable period of time.  I have the impression that other countries, which have far more serious problems in this <Col N="1272" /> regard than we do, are much more conscious of the risks associated with overstatement on the subject.</P>
    <P>I have drawn attention to these facts only in the interests of balance and certainly not to give the impression that crimes against tourists in Ireland are acceptable.  I can assure the House that as far as I am concerned any crime, including those against tourists is reprehensible, and every effort is being made to ensure that the criminals involved are brought to justice.</P>
    <P>I have outlined both in the Seanad and in this House on a number of occasions, and most recently on 17 June, 1993 in response to a matter raised on the Adjournment by the Deputy, the measures which are being taken by the Garda authorities to deal with the problem of attacks against tourists.  These, which I consider are worth mentioning again, include: close liaison and co-operation between the Garda authorities, Bord Fáilte and other tourist interests; deployment of additional Garda patrols, both uniformed and plainclothes to areas frequented by tourists; all Garda patrols, and in particular those operating in areas of high tourist interest are encouraged to be alert to the problem; provision and distribution of information leaflets containing practical advice on how tourists to this country can protect their property and personal belongings; the topic is covered extensively in Garda in-service training courses and gardaí are encouraged to avail themselves of language training courses to enable them to be of assistance to foreign visitors; the Garda office in O'Connell Street serves as a centre for advising tourists to Dublin on preventative measures which they can take to safeguard themselves and their belongings.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that these measures are proving effective.  However, the situation will be kept under review and any other measures which are considered necessary to deal with this problem will be implemented.</P>
    <P>The information sought by the Deputy in relation to the number of recorded <Col N="1273" /> crimes against tourists and convictions for such offences for 1991 and 1992 is set out in the tabular statement below. Figures for 1993 are not yet available.</P>

      <P>One senior Probation and Welfare Officer and five Probation and Welfare Officers are assigned to Mountjoy Prison.  Their duties include helping offenders with personal and family difficulties. Since family support is a vital element of the rehabilitative process, officers actively seek and encourage the co-operation and participation of families in the task of reintegrating offenders into the community.  Officers also confront the offender with his/her offending behaviour with a view to developing a lifestyle without resort to crime.</P>
      <P>Regarding any increase in Probation and Welfare staff, and as the Deputy is aware, I have undertaken a comprehensive review of the prison system. Any proposals in relation to the Probation and Welfare Service will be considered in the context of that review.</P>

      <Quest>the consideration, if any, she has given to the enactment of legislation to require the perpetrator of an alleged rape to provide a blood sample for testing purposes so as to enable an alleged victim to ascertain the full medical and health risks to her of an alleged rape without undue delay.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990 provides for the taking of bodily samples from persons suspected of serious offences, including rape, for forensic testing for the purpose of the investigation of crime.  In the case of a blood sample, the consent of the suspect must be obtained in writing before the sample can be taken under the 1990 Act.  While there is no obligation on a suspect to provide a blood sample, the legislation provides that inferences can be drawn from a failure to do so.</P>
      <P>To introduce legislation of the kind referred to by the Deputy &mdash; which would involve a person on the grounds of suspicion alone being compelled to provide a blood sample &mdash; could give rise to serious constitutional difficulties not least in terms of the established right to bodily integrity.  In the circumstances I have no proposals at present to introduce legislation in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that the Deputy's concern may range beyond the issue of blood tests for the purpose of establishing criminal guilt (or innocence).  There would be the additional and very considerable concern on the victim's part that the perpetrator of the alleged rape, for example, might be suffering from a communicable disease, such as Aids, and that the sexual encounter, therefore, could have serious health consequences for her.  This is a much wider issue which goes beyond the criminal <Col N="1276" /> law aspects for which my Department has responsibility.</P>

      <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government commits the Government to introduce a radical set of measures and provide the resources to fight crime, including white-collar crime, and vandalism.  One of the specific measures to be taken is the establishment of a strategic planning unit to monitor and assess the causes of crime and the strategies to be adopted to deal with them.  In my speech to the House on Tuesday I stated that I am preparing a co-ordinated plan of action which will embrace all elements in relation to the gardaí, prison service and urban crime.</P>

The head of research will be a civilian and will be appointed shortly.</P>

      <P>A very small number of such offenders are committed in any one year. It would be an even rarer event to have more than one such offender committed at any time.  Such offenders would be committed to one or other of the women's prisons at Mountjoy in Dublin or at Limerick Prison.  When such an offender is committed to either prison the authorities are obliged to house her separately from adult offenders.</P>
      <P>The physical accommodation for female offenders is extremely limited. There is no separate facility as such for housing juvenile female offenders who have been certified as unruly.  The practice, therefore, is to provide such prisoners with a single cell and to arrange, as far as this is humanly possible, for their recreating separately from the adult inmates.  In the case of the Mountjoy women's prison such offenders are assigned a special prison officer to themselves from committal who remains assigned to them until their release.</P>

From that date to 31 July 1992, the end of the last legal year for which statistics are available, there were an estimated 3,330 applications for judicial separation made, 1,022 of which were granted.  I will forward statistics for the legal year 1992-93 to the Deputy as soon as they become available.</P>
      <P>The cost of taking proceedings under the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, is dependent on the fees charged by legal representatives involved in the proceedings which of course would vary from case to case and are a matter between the legal representatives and their clients.  In the case of individuals who qualified for civil legal aid of course the cost to applicants would have been limited in accordance with the provision of the Civil Legal Aid Scheme. About 16 per cent of those involved in judicial separation litigation in the periods mentioned above were in receipt of legal aid.</P>

      <P>As I have indicated in the House and elsewhere recently, I have commenced a major review of official policy in relation to the operation of prisons and the treatment of offenders generally.  A wide range of options is being considered in this context including the wider development of community based sanctions as an alternative to prison custody and the development of more liberal parole arrangements, and so on.  We can certainly look at the possibility of offenders committed for minor offences serving their sentences at weekends in the context of the review.  However, as imprisonment is, as a rule, reserved for the more serious or persistent offenders in this jurisdiction, such a scheme would be unlikely to have very wide application.</P>

That work programme was noted by the Maastricht European Council which considered that it constituted an adequate basis for measures to be taken in those areas.  In addition, the Treaty on European Union provides for co-operation between member states for the purposes of achieving the objectives of the union, including co-operation in the areas of immigration and asylum policy.</P>
      <P>With regard to asylum policy specifically, the Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment that our policy towards refugees and asylum seekers will meet the highest international standards.  I have instructed my Department to prepare the necessary legislation and work has been proceeding in my Department on the preparation of a Bill which will be brought before Government for approval and published this session or, if not, during the next session.</P>

    <P>The most common reason for the seizure of a motor vehicle is failure to pay the appropriate taxes due on it.  Prior to 1 January 1993, the taxes on vehicles were excise duty and Value Added Tax. From 1 January 1993, these taxes were replaced by a vehicle registration tax.</P>
    <P>A special nationwide enforcement exercise to detect vehicles with the appropriate taxes not paid on them took place from 15 to 28 September, 1993.  As a result of the exercise 278 vehicles (21 per cent of the 1993 total to date) were seized.  The Commissioners inform me that they will continue to vigorously pursue vehicles on which the appropriate taxes have not been paid.</P>

      <P>I understand that the question relates to the 1 per cent income levy introduced in the 1993 budget.  The yield to the Exchequer from the income levy over the period from its introduction on 6 April last to 30 September 1993 was £43 million. The budget projection of the yield from the levy in 1993 &mdash; the period to which, I assume, the Deputy refers &mdash; is £78 million, and there is no reason to suppose that the outturn will vary significantly from this estimate.</P>
      <P>As regards the use to which the yield is being put, the levy was introduced to secure additional necessary revenue for overall budgetary purposes.  The yield from the levy is being taken to account as part of general tax revenue, and is not specifically earmarked for any particular expenditure programme.</P>

      <P>By virtue of an agreement between the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland and Joseph Murphy Structural Engineers Ltd., the company was, in 1988, granted a short term letting of a site at Shanowen Road for storage purposes.  The company was always aware that the agreement could be terminated by either side on giving one week's notice.</P>
      <P>Approval in principle had been given as far back as June 1991 to the grant of a lease, to St. Kevin's Boys Football Club, of a property of which this site forms part.  Negotiations on the terms and conditions of such lease were not finalised until August 1993, and the agreement between the Commissioners and the company was then terminated.  The terms for this lease have been agreed between the Commissioners and the club, with the approval of the Minister for Finance. While it is not the practice to divulge details of transactions with other parties, I can say that the lease will be for a period of 99 years and that the agreed terms provide for the payment of a substantial sum of money by the club.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have made every effort to alleviate any difficulties which the termination of the letting agreement may cause to Joseph Murphy Structural Engineers Ltd.  &mdash; the company was given four week's notice of termination of the agreement, and this period was subsequently extended by a further two weeks to the end of September 1993.  The company was also offered an alternative site at Shanowen Road but rejected this offer.  Officials of the Commissioners and the Department of Finance held discussions with St. Kevin's Boys F.C. which culminated in an agreement to allow Joseph Murphy Structural Engineers Ltd. to continue to occupy the site for a further period of at least nine months.  The club was also asked to consider all possible options for the property, including the possibility of accomodating the company's long term storage needs, and to negotiate with the company on the matter.  The company has also rejected this proposal and I <Col N="1285" /> understand that it plans to vacate the plot within a few weeks.  I regret that the company's decision may have led to some lay-offs.  However, the company has been offered a secure tenure of the site for a period of at least nine months and I am confident that, even at this stage, with goodwill on all sides, a satisfactory conclusion can be reached which will enable the football club to provide facilities for its members and at the same time meet the company's storage requirements thus negating the need for any lay-offs.  I am disappointed to note that the company has, to date, rejected this possibility, and I hope that it will reconsider its position. Neither the Commissioners nor the Minister have received any request for a meeting with representatives of the company, but any such request will be positively considered if it can provide a basis for a solution.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the persons concerned applied at the Vehicle Registration Office, Naas, County Kildare, on 1 September 1993 for relief from payment of vehicle registration tax on their motor car under the Vehicle Registration Tax (Permanent Reliefs) Regulations, 1993.  These regulations provide that a person transferring residence to the State may be granted relief from payment of vehicle registration tax provided he had possession and use of the vehicle for at least six months prior to taking up residence in the State.  The basis of the claim for the relief in this case was that the persons <Col N="1286" /> concerned transferred their residence to the State on 6 August, 1993, having had possession and use of the car since they acquired it in the UK on 26 January 1993.</P>
      <P>Documents have been produced in support of their claim and these are now being examined.  They have also been asked to produce additional evidence in the form of the husband's UK P45 to indicate when their residence in the UK ceased.  On receipt of the documents requested further consideration will be given to the case and the applicants will be notified of the outcome.  The Commissioners inform me that the fact that the persons concerned have been asked for further documentary evidence does not indicate that their application for relief is likely to be refused.  The Commissioners have not sought payment of vehicle registration tax at this stage.  The amount quoted was merely an estimate given to the applicants of vehicle registration tax that would be payable if they do not qualify for relief.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners are not aware of any significant increase in the numbers of subcontractors in the building industry who do not qualify for a C2 certificate.  Those who do not qualify for this certificate, unregistered sub-contractors, are obliged to have income tax deducted at the 35 per cent rate by <Col N="1289" /> their principal contractors who supply them with a C45 receipt which the subcontractor will use to make any claim for a refund that would be due to him.  All self employed persons are obliged to file a return of income and PRSI contributions are levied at the rate applicable.  The Revenue Commissioners are not aware of any abuses operating in this area.</P>
      <P>The C2/C45 system does not operate in the security and cleaning industries. However, last year the system was extended to include operators in the forestry and the meat processing industries and as a result the overall issue of C2 certificates has increased.  At the same time additional security measures have been built into the C2 certificate system by converting it into a secure plasticated card with photograph and signature of the holder.  The card must be presented personally to each principal contractor with every contract given to a subcontractor. These procedures have improved the system and should eliminate the abuses related to the misuse of the former C2 certificates e.g., duplicates used by unregistered sub-contractors to obtain gross payments (i.e. without deduction of tax from principal contractors).</P>
      <P>Since April 1988 sub-contractors, in common with other self-employed persons, are liable to pay PRSI contributions. These contributions are collected by the Revenue Commissioners. In the case of unregistered sub-contractors in the building, forestry and meat processing industries 35 per cent is deducted at source from all payments made to them by main contractors.  This money is paid over to the Revenue Commissioners and held on account against the sub-contractor's eventual liability for tax and PRSI which is assessed at the end of the year.  The extension of this system to other subcontractors is a matter which would have to be evaluated in the first instance by the Revenue Commissioners as would proposals for the further use of identification cards.</P>

In those circumstances, I do not propose to comment further in the matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 and 83 together.</P>
      <P>The allocation of Garda manpower to individual areas is a matter for the Garda authorities who make their decisions having regard to ongoing assessments of the policing arrangements of those areas. They inform me that the current strength at Clontarf station is 52, which shows an increase of 6 over the manpower figure for 1990.  The area also receives constant attention from the Divisional Task Force at Santry.  I am also informed by the Garda authorities that the crime figures for 1992 for the sub-district show a decrease of almost 15 per cent as against the previous year.  The Garda are satisfied that the current policing arrangements for Clontarf are adequate to meet the policing needs of the District.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the policing arrangements for Elm Mount Estate, the Garda inform me that a community garda from Clontarf station has responsibility for this area.  Foot patrols are carried out throughout the sub-District on a regular basis and mobile patrols are also available to deal with any specific problems which might arise in the area.</P>
      <P>All members on patrol in the Clontarf sub-District are alert to all types of crime and vandalism, including drug-related offences.  There is a Drugs Unit based in the District consisting of 2 full-time gardaí.  In addition, there are 4 gardaí at the Divisional HQ in Santry employed full-time on drug law enforcement and the gardaí at Clontarf can call on these and the Central Drug Squad who are based at Harcourt Square, when necessary. A significant quantity of heroin was located in the District earlier this year.</P>

      <P>It goes without saying that I am fully committed to taking all steps necessary to combat crime and Deputies will be aware that I made a comprehensive statement on the subject in this House last Tuesday night.  As well as providing the necessary resources to the various agencies within our criminal justice system it is clearly vital that our criminal law should be kept under continuous review and reformed where this is needed to adapt to the modern realities of crime.  In this context Deputies will be aware that, since becoming Minister for Justice, I have initiated a comprehensive programme of criminal law reform.</P>
      <P>I would mention in particular the Criminal Justice Act, 1993 and the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, 1993.  The latter should greatly improve the ability of the Garda to deal with certain forms of unacceptable behaviour which can cause such distress to ordinary law abiding citizens.  In addition, the Bill provides for an offence specifically aimed at racketeering.</P>
      <P>I hope also to introduce two further pieces of major criminal justice reform legislation later in this session.  These are a Confiscation of Proceeds of Crime Bill which will deal amongst other things with the seizure and confiscation of proceeds of crime and the creation of an offence of money laundering, and a Criminal. Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which is intended to achieve significant improvements in the operation of the criminal justice system generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, of course, other areas of criminal justice legislation which are also being given attention in my Department at present including juvenile justice, criminal insanity, fraud and dishonesty, <Col N="1298" /> abolition of the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours and consequential changes in the law relating to powers of arrest without warrant, offences against the person, extradition and indexation of fines.  I intend to bring forward legislative proposals in all of these areas as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>In a nutshell, the position is that while the question of further worthwhile reforms of the criminal law is something that needs to be kept under constant review, the current pace of reform and plans for reform adequately meet what is required for more effective law enforcement.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Deputy's question referring to the rise in serious crime, I think that it might be helpful to mention that while the recently published Garda Commissioner's report on Crime for 1992 showed a 1 per cent increase in the level of indictable crime recorded for that year the category of crime which, understandably, causes the greatest distress to members of the community &mdash; offences against the person &mdash; continues to show an overall downward trend with a decrease of 9.5 per cent.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 and 94 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dealing with crime in a rapidly changing society is not an easy task but, as the House is aware, it is a task which I, with the backing of the Government, <Col N="1299" /> am determined to tackle.  In the Dáil on Tuesday in response to a Fine Gael Motion on crime, lawlessness and vandalism I dealt comprehensively with all aspects of the crime problem including the strategies and measures taken and the resources devoted to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that both routine and specialist Garda units are always alert to the problem of crimes against property and particular attention is paid to residential areas and business premises which may be subjected to criminal activity.  However, the community itself also has an important role to play in preventing this type of crime.  To this end the Garda Síochána, and in particular the Garda Community Relations Section, continue to enlist the help of the community to protect property and advise people not to purchase property from unofficial outlets.  The Garda authorities are actively involved in the promotion of crime prevention measures and encourage the use by the public of property marking.  The benefits of property marking cannot be underestimated as marked property is much easier to trace and therefore less attractive to criminals.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Garda response to the problem of crime is proving successful. The crime situation is being kept under constant review by the Garda authorities and I will ensure that all appropriate action will be taken to ensure that the problem is effectively tackled.</P>

      <P>It has always been the policy of successive Governments and of the Garda authorities to encourage all law-abiding and responsible citizens to assist the gardaí in law enforcement.  The question of the establishment of a reserve force has been examined from time to time.  However, it is not clear that any possible advantage arising from the establishment of such a force would outweigh potential difficulties which could arise from it.  For example, one would have to be concerned with the rights of individuals faced with a new law enforcement group who would initially lack the expertise and training of full-time police. A reserve force would also cost money and, given the potential difficulties I've mentioned, and the problems of acceptability of such a force because of the resonances associated in this country with the idea of law enforcement by &ldquo;Reserves&rdquo;, I am in no doubt that the money would be better spent in providing extra capacity for the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda Commissioner and I are <Col N="1301" /> endeavouring to maximise the number of gardaí engaged on operational duties that can only be performed by members of the Garda Síochána.  One of the principal ways of achieving this economically is through a programme of civilianisation of work performed at present by attested members of the service.  This is already happening.  Almost 870 civilians, including 170 traffic wardens, are now employed in the service on work that would be performed otherwise by trained gardaí.  The Garda Commissioner has also drawn up a Corporate Stragegy Policy Document for the Force in line with the commitment in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government, 1993-1997,</i> which sets out their requirements to tackle crime in present day conditions and I was pleased to note that further civilianisation is one of its recommendations. As the House is probably aware, I am preparing a package of law and order measures which I will be putting to the Government in the near future and the employment of more civilians to release gardaí for operational duties is one of these measures.</P>
    <P>The number of gardaí assigned to community policing duties in the Dublin Metropolitan Area has been increasing steadily since the inception of this approach to policing was adopted in urban areas.  I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 116 which I answered on 12 October 1993.  The total number of community gardaí in the Dublin Metropolitan Area now stands at 170 and the Garda Commissioner and I are committed to increasing those numbers.</P>
    <P>The current strength of the service is being boosted by the recruitment of 1,000 gardaí.  The recruitment campaign is due to be completed by 1995 but, in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, I am examining the question of accelerating the process.</P>

      <P>The Social Employment Scheme and the Community Employment Development Programme provide for participation of long term unemployed persons for one year.  The objective is to give opportunities for participation to as many people as possible within the resources available.  As such, extending one person's period of participation is at the expense of another unemployed person awaiting an opportunity to participate in the scheme-programme. Accordingly participant extensions are only granted by FÁS under very limited circumstances which I have determined as follows:</P>
      <P>&mdash;Where a project would have to stop because a replacement could not be found for a &ldquo;key&rdquo; person.</P>
      <P>&mdash;Where completion of a project has been delayed for a short time for reasons outside the control of the sponsor e.g. disruption due to bad weather.</P>
      <P>&mdash;Where a suitable replacement cannot be found for a participant despite the best efforts of sponsors and FÁS.</P>

      <P>The first steps towards the possible establishment of an independent regulatory authority for the telecommunications industry have already been taken within my Department. We are currently separating those functions and issues on the one hand that sit properly with market regulation from those on the other that pertain exclusively to general policy making and as the shareholder in Telecom Éireann.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that this is an important policy initiative and it is vital that we adopt the correct formula. While I am anxious that we move forward as quickly as possible on this, I do not intend that it should be rushed, and the Deputy will understand that I am not yet in a position to give him a precise timescale.</P>
      <P>The broad function of the independent regulatory authority will be to ensure that in the liberated market for telecommunications there is fair competition between the respective players, having regard both to the dominant position of Telecom Éireann and to its universal service obligations.  It would be my intention that matters like the level of tariffs and quality of service will be considered an appropriate function of the new authority. Until such time as a regulatory authority is established, this function remains as my responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Telephone Users' Advisory Group was established to carry out independent monitoring of the operation and impact on different groups and classes of <Col N="1312" /> customers of the new Telecom Éireann tariff package, and report to me.  It will also assess future trends as they relate to tariffs taking into account the rapidly changing technology in the telecommunications industry.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health</askee>
      <Quest>the three most common diseases which men and women are likely to die from in Ireland; the known cause of disease, the preventive steps that can be taken; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>When deaths classified by broad principal causes are considererd the three commonest diseases from which people die are diseases of the circulatory system (including ischaemic heart disease), cancer and diseases of the respiratory system.  These accounted respectively for 45 per cent, 24 per cent and 13 per cent of all deaths in 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lifestyle factors play a role in the causation of heart disease, of some cancers and of some diseases of the respiratory system.  Smoking, hypertension and obesity are major risk factors for heart disease (family history also plays a role in some cases).  There were 7,687 deaths from ischaemic heart disease in Ireland in 1992.  While the number of deaths from ischaemic heart disease per 100,000 of the population aged 30-69 years decreased by 22 per cent among women and 16 per cent among men between 1980 and 1988, Ireland still remains in an unacceptably high position internationally in terms of such deaths, being fifth highest among developed countries.  The Health Promotion Unit of my Department has in place a range of information-education initiatives in relation to the lifestyle factors implicated in the causation of heart disease.  These include initiatives on smoking, diet and exercise carried out in a variety of settings &mdash; in schools, in workplaces, in the community and through the media.  The Health Promotion Unit is also supporting the Happy <Col N="1313" /> Heart initiative of the Irish Heart Foundation. Parallel to these intervention programmes we are also funding a major research project to monitor and analyse existing data on cardiovascular disease and in particular to analyse data on the intervention strategies most likely to be successful in preventing it.</P>
    <P>Lifestyle factors also play a role in the causation of some cancers.  Smoking for example is a major causative factor in about 90 per cent of the 1,500 deaths which occur each year in Ireland from lung cancer.  Alcohol is implicated in the causation of some cancers of the head and neck.  Research is ongoing at international level on the role of diet in relation to a number of types of cancer. Many skin cancers can be prevented by reducing exposure to UV radiation. Other cancers can be prevented through reducing exposure to carcinogenic substances in the workplace &mdash; an area which falls within the remit of the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will note that some of the lifestyle factors implicated in the causation of some cancers are the same as those implicated in the causation of heart disease.  Many of the interventions to which I have already referred receive support from the Europe Against Cancer Programme which aims to make a significant reduction in deaths from cancer by the year 2,000.  Ireland has been a participant in this programme since the late 1980s and a National Co-Ordinating Committee was established in 1988, to oversee the programme in Ireland.  A Europe Against Cancer Code which outlines ten steps which can be taken to reduce the incidence of, or the mortality from cancer, has been widely disseminated under the programme.</P>
    <P>In addition to changes in lifestyle habits, well organised screening programmes can also play a role in reducing mortality and morbidity from some cancers by detecting them at an early stage.</P>
    <P>Breast cancer is the commonest cause of cancer deaths among women and can be detected early by breast self examination, clinical examination and mammography. <Col N="1314" /> Diagnostic mammography services are available to women at a number of hospitals throughout the country.  It was agreed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that further developments in mammography would await the outcome of the Eccles Breast Screening Programme which is one of a network of seven pilot schemes on breast cancer screening in the European Community.  The Eccles Breast Screening Programme is due to report towards the end of 1994.  Decisions on the national policy to be followed in this matter will be influenced by the results of the pilot study.</P>
    <P>Respiratory disease of various types is the third commonest cause of death in Ireland.  The causes of respiratory conditions are quite diverse.  Over 80 per cent of the 1,780 deaths from pneumonia in 1992 were to people aged 75 years and over.  It is estimated that about 75 per cent of deaths from bronchitis and emphysema are caused by smoking. Environmental pollution, especially in urban areas, is also a factor in respiratory disease, particularly among the elderly, and measures have been taken by the Minister of the Environment in recent years to address this issue.</P>
