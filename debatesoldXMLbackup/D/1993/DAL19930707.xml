    <Title>Irish Aviation Authority Bill, 1993: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1361" /> The principal purpose of this Bill is to provide for the establishment of a new State-owned company to be called the Irish Aviation Authority.  Basically the Bill will transform the Air Navigation Services Office of our Department, ANSO as it is known, from a Civil Service agency to a commercial semi-State body.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the Air Navigation Services Office discharges the Minister's responsibility for regulating Irish aviation safety standards and for controlling Irish airspace.  The Bill is designed to ensure that the vital services which ANSO provides to aviation are enhanced by giving the Authority the capacity to meet the aviation industry's need for high quality, cost effective services. The new Authority, subject to the general constraints on semi-State bodies, will have the flexibility and autonomy in operational, staffing and investment matters to meet the needs of its many users.</P>
    <P>In a wider European context, the creation of the Irish Aviation Authority is part of an evolutionary process that aviation is currently going through at both national and international levels.  Like Ireland, many European administrations are now reassigning their air traffic control and airspace management organisations to more autonomous bodies as part of a broader strategy to resolve European air traffic congestion problems.</P>
    <P>Irish aviation is going through fairly severe turbulence at present.  We are not unique; the aviation industry throughout the world is going through very testing times.  I hope the debate on this Bill will help to inform, broaden and enlighten the present debate on the Irish aviation industry.</P>
    <P>Though it has had a relatively low public profile, ANSO is at the heart of the aviation industry in Ireland and plays a significant role in international aviation. I trust the House will bear with me therefore if I take the opportunity to briefly and broadly sketch the background <Col N="1362" /> against which this Bill has been framed.</P>
    <P>Currently ANSO employs nearly 600 staff, located mainly at the State airports, and over half of its staff are attached to stations in the Shannon area.  These are mainly air traffic controllers, electronic engineers, radio officers, flight operations and airworthiness experts, together with a small number of administrative staff.</P>
    <P>As the House will appreciate, the day to day functions of ANSO involves highly complex and technical work.  We can see the results of that work in the aircraft using our airspace.  We can also see it in the safety record of the Irish aviation industry.  In its day to day work ANSO has always operated without the need for the direct involvement of the Minister of the day.</P>
    <P>For two decades or so the general trend of Government administration has been to separate policy and executive functions. Government can thereby concentrate on its role of making and shaping policy.  The corollary is that the executive bodies can concentrate on their specific functions, which are of course conducted in accordance with policy as defined by Government.</P>
    <P>ANSO is a prime example of the type of executive organisation that would benefit from the flexibility of semi-State body status.  ANSO, by definition, must have the capacity to serve the needs of the aviation industry, which is noted for rapid changes in markets, technologies and operating procedures.  ANSO's customers &mdash; or users, as they are usually described &mdash; are mainly the world's commercial airlines, who demand and are entitled to, quality services at competitive costs.  That is what the aviation Authority, operating as a fully commercial body, is designed to give them.</P>
    <P>Over the years ANSO has performed exeptionally well.  Irish safety standards are internationally accepted as being of the highest order, as is the manner in which we manage and operate our airspace. The new aviation Authority will keep Ireland to the forefront in these vital services.  Moreover, we want to give <Col N="1363" /> the Authority the capability to engage in associated activities, such as training and consultancy work, where there are opportunities for profit, especially in the emerging markets in Asia and eastern Europe.  However, I wish to emphasise that the principal reason for setting up the new Authority is not to make profits for the Exchequer, but to improve the efficiency of services to the aviation industry in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment.</P>
    <P>Basically ANSO has two main businesses &mdash; the regulation of aviation safety standards and the operation of air navigation services.  In 1992 total ANSO turnover on a commercial basis amounted to more than £40 million, of which more than 80 per cent came from foreign airlines, many of which never touch down in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Safety and public confidence in safety standards is the bedrock on which civil aviation is based.  The Government is very conscious of public concern about safety and I would emphasise that there is no question of safety standards being in any way compromised for commercial reasons.  Irish aviation safety standards are based on the highest international and European standards, as set down by the International Civil Aviation Organsation and the European Joint Aviation Authorities.  Irish safety standards are applied to and cover the 500 aircraft on our national register, 2,000 licensed pilots, 3,000 certified aircraft maintenance personnel, a dozen aircraft operating companies and some 75 maintenance organisations.  Of the 500 aircraft on the register, more than 110 are large public transport aircraft.  Approximately half this fleet comprises GPA aircraft, most of which operate in countries spread across the globe from South America to Asia.</P>
    <P>Because of the importance which we in Government attach to safety matters, I can assure the House that we have unique provisions in this Bill which will ensure that the highest safety standards will continue to be applied in Irish aviation. In making that commitment we are <Col N="1364" /> conscious of the fact that it is necessary both for our own travelling public and for those who travel in aircraft maintained or operated by Irish companies or who travel through Irish airspace.</P>
    <P>It is clearly the responsibility of Government to ensure that aviation is properly regulated and the safety of the public protected.  It is also clear that because of the international nature of aviation, safety standards must be agreed, implemented and rigorously observed internationally.  Ireland has always played its part as a member of the international community in this respect and we have always subscribed to the relevant international agreements governing aviation standards.  No one could question that we must continue to apply the highest standards of aviation safety so that Irish aircraft and Irish licensed crews will continue to be highly regarded and accepted anywhere in the world.</P>
    <P>The biggest segment of business for ANSO, as indeed it will be for the new Authority, is the provision of air navigation and aeronautical communications services.  In 1992, both of these accounted for turnover of nearly £37 million, that is more than 90 per cent of ANSO revenues. Broadly, these services include the control of Irish airspace and the provision of communications links between aircraft in international airspace on the north Atlantic and air traffic control in Prestwick, Scotland.</P>
    <P>The north Atlantic communications service is provided from the aeronautical communications station at Ballygirreen, County Clare, where there are more than 100 staff employed, mainly radio officers. That station had revenues of over £7 million in 1992, from charges of £36 levied on each aircraft using our system.</P>
    <P>Closer to home within the boundaries of Irish airspace the basic air navigation service figures are quite simple.  Irish controlled airspace covers 100,000 square miles &mdash; three times the land surface area &mdash; and stretching out to a distance of some 200 miles around our coasts.  Irish airspace occupies an important strategic position on the air routes between Europe and North America.  Almost 80 <Col N="1365" /> per cent of the annual traffic between the US and Europe crosses Irish airspace.</P>
    <P>Shannon is the principal centre in Ireland for the control of air traffic entering or existing from the north Atlantic air routes.  The importance of the Shannon centre is internationally recognised in that under its control transatlantic flights make the transition from continental European airways systems to and from the north Atlantic oceanic track systems. Shannon is also responsible for handling much of the domestic traffic from Cork and the regional airports.  The Dublin air traffic centre control Irish air traffic to and from Britain and the Continent.</P>
    <P>Aircraft which use our airspace and air navigation facilities must pay for the costs we incur in providing the relevant services. Each of our air traffic control centres is fully equipped with the most modern radar and communications technology which enables us to handle both current and projected traffic levels.</P>
    <P>The air navigation services provided by ANSO and which will be provided by the Authority after vesting day, are provided on a cost recovery basis.  The charges for services are determined in accordance with principles set down by the International Civil Aviation Organisation. The principles require that charges be assessed on a cost recovery basis only.  They allow for the remuneration of the necessary capital but do not permit aviation authorities to set prices to make profits.</P>
    <P>In 1992 there were more than 300,000 aircraft movements through Irish controlled airspace and of these slightly more than 120,000 landed at, or took off from, Irish airports.  The importance of Irish airspace is shown by the fact that there were approximately 200,000 aircraft movements, which were en route between the US and Europe and which neither landed nor took off in Ireland.  All of these flights are charged for the use of Irish airspace facilities and in 1992 accounted for nearly £30 million of ANSO revenues, not to mention the 200 jobs which they provide in the Shannon area.</P>
    <P>Taking these figures for Shannon with <Col N="1366" /> those for Ballygirreen where there are revenues of £7 million and more than 100 jobs, we have a total of over 300 jobs in the Clare-Limerick area.  I need hardly emphasise that our airspace is a valuable national asset.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of considerable pride to us that the ANSO charges on aircraft using our en route services are the third lowest in the 16 national European route charging system that is operated by Eurocontrol, the European Air Traffic Control Agency.  The economic and cost effective rates being charged to its users by ANSO will, we hope, ensure that we will retain and hopefully expand our current traffic levels.  Certainly this is an objective that we will be setting for the Irish Aviation Authority.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House would like to know how ANSO and the proposed aviation authority fit into the context of the aviation industry in Ireland.  Quite simply, Aer Rianta operates the State airports to operational safety standards defined by ANSO.  From centres at each airport airlines, such as Aer Lingus, which operate in Irish airspace, do so under the ANSO air traffic control rules, The new Authority will take over all these functions from ANSO.</P>
    <P>Against the background of the problems of Aer Lingus and GPA, the House might feel that this is not the most auspicious time for new ventures.  I disagree. There are problems in the aviation industry and these must be tackled and resolved with considered, practical policies.</P>
    <P>From my perspective as Minister my aim is and must be to ensure that aviation is a safe, cost competitive and commercially viable industry which will grow and develop, thus contributing to our overall goals of wealth generation and job creation.  The creation of the new Irish Aviation Authority is another firm plank in the strategy of the evolutionary process in the aviation industry.</P>
    <P>To summarise, our policy in relation to the services which are currently being provided by ANSO is to ensure the safety of aviation in the public interest and in compliance with our international obligations, <Col N="1367" /> to facilitate access to Ireland by air and to maximise the financial and employment benefits to our country.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the Bill, I will outline the general approach which we have taken.  Basically we have started from the standpoint that what is required is a commercial semi-State body to which can be transferred the Minister's rights, powers and authority relevant to air navigation and safety services.  The latter functions are set out in the Air Navigation and Transport and Eurocontrol Acts.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that the Minister will continue to be responsible for overall policy in relation to safety and air navigation services.  In this respect, we will always expect the new Irish Aviation Authority to adhere to the safety standards and recommended practices promulgated by the relevant international organisations.  I must mention also that the responsibility for accident investigation will be retained by the Minister and will not be assigned to the Authority though, of course, the Minister will be able to call on the services of Authority staff should the need arise.</P>
    <P>In framing this Bill, much consideration was given to the advisability of combining both a regulatory and an operational role within the same organisation. In the operational role we see mainly the air traffic control, engineering and radio service staff who are responsible for controlling and managing the airspace.  There are strong arguments for keeping the regulatory and operational roles separate in an organisation which, like the Authority, is responsible for safety.  However, the fact is that it would be impractical to have two separate organisations.  We have, therefore, combined both the regulatory and operational functions in the same organisation.  We have done so on the basis that special arrangements have been made for technical and safety audits of the company and, as I mentioned earlier, the responsibility for accident investigation is being retained by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the new Authority, <Col N="1368" /> the commercial semi-State body model which we have used is broadly on the same lines as other bodies established in recent years.  Thus, the Irish Aviation Authority will be a limited company established under the Companies Acts and having a nine person board appointed by the Minister.  The company will operate in accordance with approved memorandum and articles of association. At this stage, though no final decision has been taken, it is expected that 1 January next will be set as the vesting day when the new Authority will officially commence operations.</P>
    <P>The directors and staff of the new company and its subsidiaries will be subject to general controls in relation to such matters as conflicts of interest and disclosure of confidential information.  The provisions in relation to disclosure of interests are in line with the code of practice for semi-State bodies issued last year by the Minister for Finance.  Under the Bill, the company will be empowered to invest in associated companies or to establish subsidiaries.</P>
    <P>As is normal practice in semi-State bodies, the Authority will be required to furnish the Minister with copies of its annual report and accounts.  The appointment of the company's auditor will be subject to the approval of the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The airline industry &mdash; which is the Authority's main customer &mdash; is extremely cost conscious and it is important that the airlines, as well as Government, should have a clear transparent picture of the cost and financing of air navigation and safety services provided by the new Authority.  In this connection, it is intended that regular and constructive consultation with the users will be a feature of the business approach to be adopted by the Irish Aviation Authority.</P>
    <P>The new Authority will start with a clean balance sheet and will operate as a going concern from vesting day.  The Authority will collect and pay sums due in respect of services provided by ANSO before vesting day and these arrangements <Col N="1369" /> are covered in the transitional provisions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The capital of the new Authority will correspond to the assets which the company takes over from ANSO and these, mainly equipment and current assets, will amount to a value of some £30 million. These assets will be funded by a mixture of debt and equity.  The proportions of share capital and debt finance are matters to be determined between the Minister and the Minister for Finance and these proportions will be settled closer to vesting day.  One thing which I should make clear is that the setting up of this new Authority will not require the investment of new equity by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that the land and buildings used by ANSO may be either transferred to, or leased to the Authority.  I expect that leasing will generally be the more appropriate arrangement.  There is no reason to fragment the ownership of State airports, for example, by transferring the air traffic control centres to the new Authority as the remainder of the airport will still be the property of the Minister.  The new Authority will be able to fund future capital acquisitions from its charges and a borrowing capacity of £100 million for long term capital purposes is being provided, subject to the usual conditions.</P>
    <P>In relation to the commercial character of the new Authority, the House will be pleased to note that the provisions in the Bill are in line with the decisions taken by Government on the reports of the Industrial Policy Review Group, more commonly known as the Culliton and Moriarty reports.</P>
    <P>ANSO has already done some good work on the development of its commercial mission statement, and clear international benchmarks are given by the rates the Authority will charge for its services.  These rates can be readily compared with the unit charges levied by other administrations for air navigation services.  The Bill, in section 45, provides that the Minister will pay the costs where he or she directs the Authority to provide services and to exempt users, such as <Col N="1370" /> search and rescue aircraft, from being charged the costs of the service.</P>
    <P>As the Authority will be a regulatory body, making orders, which have the force of law, as well as a monopoly provider of services, the Government excluded the possibility of private ownership. If, in the future, any of the core functions of the new Authority were to be carried out by the private sector the whole question would have to be brought back to the Oireachtas for debate and decision.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the transfer of ANSO staff to the new Authority. Concerns that the staff expressed in relation to security of tenure in the new employment have been taken into account in drafting and the Bill will, I believe, satisfy all sides.  Some concern was expressed by ANSO staff in relation to their security of tenure.  I will be confirming clarifications already given to them on that aspect on Committee Stage, as indeed I will also be doing in relation to their superannuation provisions.</P>
    <P>Special provision has been made in relation to the Exchequer's accumulated liabilities for staff-pensions.  The Bill provides, in section 41, that the Exchequer will pay to the Authority's superannuation fund over a seven year period an amount to discharge the Exchequer's liability.  I should add that for many years, ANSO users have been directly funding the Exchequer's liabilities to ANSO staff.</P>
    <P>The stage is now set, with the publication of this Bill, for the conclusion of the discussions with the trade unions and staff interests regarding the transfer of ANSO staff to the new aviation Authority.</P>
    <P>The Authority will be specifically excluded from the provisions of the Worker Participation Acts.  I would be especially concerned at the conflict of interests for staff members elected to the board, which could arise from the different roles of the Authority &mdash; which will at the same time regulate safety, operate services, and license members of its staff. I assure the House, however, that I will be strongly recommending to the new Authority that appropriate staff participative <Col N="1371" /> arrangements are made at subboard level.</P>
    <P>I have given a wide but brief résumé of the general corporate structure proposals in the Bill.  Before coming to some of the special provisions in the Bill, I should mention the quasi-monopoly nature of the Authority and the concurrent concern that, in the absence of competition, it might fail to adequately control its charges.</P>
    <P>I recognise such concerns and obviously they are something the new Authority will have to pay attention to. However, it would be impractical to have more than one provider of air navigation services or aviation regulatory services. Furthermore, aviation is a very international business and it will become clear very quickly if the Authority charges are out of line and if so they must then recify the situation.</P>
    <P>Coming now to some of the special provisions in the Bill, there are a number of unique and innovative provisions to which I should draw the attention of the House.  Provision is made in section 32 of the Bill for the Authority to report to the Minister on the technical and safety standards being implemented by the Authority.  Furthermore, the Minister will be empowered to appoint a suitably qualified person to carry out an examination of the company's performance in relation to technical and safety standards. These provisions will ensure that the Minister retains the necessary instruments to ensure implementation of policy in this vital area.</P>
    <P>The new Authority will be working in highly technical and complex areas whereas safety is of paramount importance. The board will have very wide and extensive powers in relation to these matters. We must recognise that in many instances board members may not always have the expertise to adequately assess very complex technical and safety issues. I have no doubt that any responsible board will listen to and be guided by the advice of its various experts.  However, public safety and public confidence in safety standards are very fragile matters. <Col N="1372" /> For that reason, we are including a provision in the Bill to cover the eventuality that there might be a disagreement between the board and its experts on safety issues.  Where such a disagreement arises the board's decision will not be implemented until the matter has been reported to and decided on by the Minister. Moreover, provision is made for the Minister to appoint outside expertise for guidance on such important matters.</P>
    <P>Under section 68 the Bill proposes to formalise current arrangements in relation to the control of the national airspace, taking into account the training, security, defence and other requirements of the Minister for Defence.  Provision is made in the Bill whereby the Authority and the Minister for Defence can jointly provide and operate air navigation services. This provision is in line with the formal situation obtaining in many European countries where civil and military air traffic control services are jointly operated.</P>
    <P>Other provisions to which I should refer are those at sections 62 and 63. Provision is made in these sections whereby the new Authority will, under certain conditions, represent Ireland in international fora concerned with air navigation services and safety matters. These provisions recognise the essentially international nature of the business in which the Authority will be involved and provide a framework within which the Authority can operate effectively.</P>
    <P>I must also refer to the power that will be given to the Authority to make orders and give directions and to have these enforced by the courts should that prove necessary.  The opportunity is being taken in this Bill to update and standardise the penalty provisions for offences committed in the regulatory and general air navigation services areas.</P>
    <P>Coming to the technical provisions in the Bill, I should reiterate that civil aviation as an international business is regulated in accordance with international standards.  Worldwide, aviation is governed by the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation which was adopted first in Chicago in December <Col N="1373" /> 1944 and implemented here in 1946.  The Chicago Convention also established the International Civil Aviation Organisation which is known as ICAO.  States who are party to the Chicago Convention adopt a uniform approach to the regulation of aviation safety and as far as practicable provide services and facilities to agreed standards.  The annexes to the Convention set the standards to which states are expected to conform and the recommended practices which they should apply so that aircraft can be operated safely throughout the world.</P>
    <P>The Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1946, as amended by the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1950, provided for the Chicago Convention and its annexes to come into operation in Ireland.  Those Acts empowered the Minister to make any orders, regulations or directions necessary to give effect to them.</P>
    <P>After the passing of this Bill, the Minister will retain responsibility for Ireland's compliance with the provisions of the Convention as a whole and for giving effect to the ICAO annexes which deal with the meteorological service for international air navigation, search and rescue, aircraft accident investigation and security.  The Minister will also be responsible for the annex governing the facilitation of travellers in relation to customs and related matters.</P>
    <P>Arising from the Bill, it will be the responsibility of the new Irish Aviation Authority to give effect to the standards and recommended practices set out in the remaining Annexes.  These deal with personnel licensing, the rules of the air, aeronautical charts, the units of measurement to be used in ground and air operations; the operation of aircraft, aircraft nationality and registration marks, the airworthiness of aircraft, aeronautical telecommunications, air traffic services, aerodromes, aeronautical information services, environmental protection and the safe transport of dangerous goods by air.  That, as I am sure the House will agree, is a very full and wide list of responsibilities.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the new Authority <Col N="1374" /> will be given the power, now vested in the Minister, to make orders and regulations and give directives giving effect to the ICAO annexes.  Any orders and regulations which the Authority makes will be treated in the same way as Ministerial orders &mdash; they will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and may be annulled by resolution of either House.</P>
    <P>The Authority will manage the national airspace and provide air traffic control services, communications and other services for air navigation in accordance with the provisions of the Chicago Convention and the annexes thereto.  It will also supply the standards for the regulation of aviation safety &mdash; for example, in licensing aviation personnel and certifying that aircraft are airworthy and in the orders and regulations governing the operation of aircraft and the safety aspect of aerodromes.  All of these functions are at present carried out by ANSO.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the general public, the transfer of these functions to the new Authority will make no immediate difference.  However I hope that for the aviation industry, the Authority, with its greater managerial autonomy, will be in a position to be more responsive to the air industry's needs, not just for services but also for accountability.  The Authority, freed from the constraints of the Civil Service, will operate in a more business like and commercial manner, to the immediate benefit of the industry and ultimately to the benefit of the travelling public.</P>
    <P>Apart from the Chicago Convention, the authority will also be responsible for giving effect to other international agreements to which Ireland is a party in so far as they relate to matters which are within its competence.  The principal agreements relevant here are the requirements of the Joint Aviation Authorities of Europe and the Eurocontrol Convention.</P>
    <P>The Joint Aviation Authorities of Europe, known as the JAA, basically is a body formed by the various European authorities responsible for the safety and <Col N="1375" /> regulatory aspects of aviation.  The JAA has been developing for a number of years and has gradually widened its remit from being concerned purely with airworthiness matters to the area of aircraft operations.  It is also currently defining specific technical standards to give effect to EC Directives in the personnel licensing and other areas.  We welcome the development of a joint European approach and standards and, like ANSO, the new Irish Aviation Authority will participate fully in the work of the JAA.</P>
    <P>The Eurocontrol Convention, which originated in 1960, is designed to assist member states to co-ordinate air traffic services and facilities and the management of the flow of air traffic so as to ensure the most effective utilisation of their airspace.  There are currently 15 Eurocontrol member states, including most states in the European Community. By the end of this decade it is expected that there will be up to 20 member states in Eurocontrol, including some from Eastern Europe, like Hungary, which is already a member.</P>
    <P>We welcome the expansion of Eurocontrol membership.  It symbolises Europe's determination to deal with its air traffic problems.  As the House is aware, air traffic congestion in European airspace has become an all too common and inconvenient problem in recent years.  It is an extremely complex problem involving issues such as national sovereignty, equipment, operating systems and procedures.</P>
    <P>In 1988 European Ministers of Transport took an initiative by defining a strategy to resolve European air traffic congestion problems.  Eurocontrol was designated as the organisation with responsibility for implementing the strategy and has now developed a comprehensive plan to upgrade the air traffic system through the European Air Traffic Control Harmonisation and Integration Programme &mdash; a project known by the acronym &ldquo;EATCHIP&rdquo;.  The EATCHIP project is a radical plan aimed at creating a seamless air traffic control system covering European airspace through harmonising <Col N="1376" /> the many disparate systems and eventually integrating them.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that ANSO, by investment in staff and equipment over the past five years, has ensured that Irish air traffic control systems and procedures are fully compatible with the requirements of the EATCHIP programme.  As the House will be aware from my earlier remarks Irish controlled air space is a valuable national asset.  It is vital that Ireland maintains its air traffic control systems and procedures at the forefront of European developments.  Our airspace is a small but a vital one, being at the interface between the North Atlantic and European systems.  The House should be under no illusion.  Should we fail to provide the services required, or should the cost of those services be excessive, then international civil aviation will bypass us, either by re-routing or by reducing the airspace delegated to our control.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would emphasise my conviction that the passing of this Bill and the establishment of the Irish Aviation Authority will facilitate access by air to Ireland and promote the safety of navigation in Irish airspace.  This will benefit our aviation industry and ultimately the entire country.  I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to the various contributions on this very important and strategic Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank the Minister for a very full account of what his Department intends to do with the Air Navigation Services Office now directly controlled by the Department and for setting out proposals to organise this service under the auspices of the semi-State organisation and to remove it from the direct control of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent weeks we have had quite a number of decisions which in one way or another impact on aviation policy.  By way of background, I would say that it is very difficult for Opposition Deputies to see the pattern of policy which is emerging from a multiplicty of decisions.  About five weeks ago there was a decision that SFADCo, which under statute is responsible <Col N="1377" /> for the promotion of Shannon Airport, has now, under the influence of the Tánaiste, been designated to promote Kerry County Airport at Farranfore.  We have the setting up of a task force under the chairmanship of Miss Gillian Bowler to promote Shannon Airport which already has a statutory authority for promoting the airport.  Now we will have an <i>ad hoc</i> task force with a budget of £500,000 this year and next year to promote it.  There is a commitment in the Minister's speech last night to set up a similar task force for the promotion of traffic in Dublin Airport.  We have the series of decisions which affect Aer Lingus, in particular the announcment last night by the Minister about major changes in the status of Shannon in the context of a reorganisation of the internal workings of Aer Lingus, which will now be in four sections, one of which will be called Aer Lingus Shannon.  Today another set of decisions is being announced by the Minister.  It is very difficult for Opposition Deputies to identify a pattern of policy running through the decisions.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister, the Minister of State and some of the senior officials have been upset when we argued that in effect the Department has no aviation policy, but it still seems that there is no aviation policy.  There is no overall statement on how Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus, air traffic control services, international carriers plying our routes or the regional airports are integrated in any kind of a pattern to give the best possible service to Ireland.  All decisions have to be set in the context of a national aviation policy with a set of objectives which ultimately lead to a more economically viable service and a more economically viable company.  A series of piecemeal decisions operating to some secret formula in the Department does not really satisfy this House in terms of an aviation policy.</P>
    <P>It is a sad enough occasion that we have to debate this Bill against the background of Aer Lingus on the fringe of bankruptcy.  If it was a US air carrier it would be in Chapter 11 already, as many <Col N="1378" /> US carriers are, and if it was a private company the liquidator would have been called in already.  I note that the Minister in his speech last night claimed that the policy operated by him and his predecessors in recent years has been given a payback in excess of £500 million in terms of extra activity in air transport and tourism.  It is a coincidence, I suppose, that the overall debts of Aer Lingus are in excess of that at £540 million.  It is not much of an air policy when the total economic benefit being claimed by the Minister is £40 million less than the total debt of the air carrier.</P>
    <P>Again today we have another announcement, another Bill put before us.  I suppose, as with all recent announcements on aviation, we will have to cope with it as a stand-alone announcement, because it certainly does not integrate into what we have heard already. Taking it at that level, what is being proposed is simple enough.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister of State, the Air Navigation Services Office, which has served the country well under the auspices of his Department for many years, is to be abolished and a new organisation called the Irish Aviation Authority is to be set up.  The justification for this is contained in the Minister of State's speech:</P>
    <P>The Authority, freed from the constraints of the Civil Service, will operate in a more business like and commercial manner to the immediate benefit of the industry and ultimately to the benefit of the travelling public.</P>
    <P>That is the assertion and the reason the changes are being proposed.  No other justification is offered by the Minister of State, apart from this throw-away paragraph in his speech.</P>
    <P>I had not realised that in recent years the Air Navigation Services Office was under constraints imposed by the Department. I had not noticed any diminution in safety standards or in the effectiveness of the service it provides because people were designated as civil servants rather than as public servants employed by a commercial State agency.  When the <Col N="1379" /> Minister of State proposes to make a major change such as this he owes it to the House to argue the case at greater length rather than state in a throw-away paragraph that suddenly they have found, when they struck the rock, that civil servants are a crowd of fuddy duddies and have no commercial sense, that with one bound they will be free, that they are going to set up a semi-State organisation and everything will be grand in the future.  I do not think life is as simple as that and whatever the reasons for setting up this new Authority the Minister of State has an obligation to outline them.</P>
    <P>There will be difficulties in separating the services provided by the Department. Like ANSO, the Irish Aviation Authority will be responsible for implementing the safety regulations for the airline industry and also for air traffic control. When both functions were carried out under the auspices of a Government Department with direct responsibility to the Minister there was no conflict; the Minister was accountable to this House and as the political head of his Department he could adjudicate with the help of his senior civil servants when a conflict arose as between the two roles carried out by ANSO.  The position will now be different and the Minister of State's justification is weak.  A commercial semi-State organisation is being set up and it will have two primary roles: first, the formulation and implementation of safety regulations for the airline industry and, second, air traffic control.</P>
    <P>Efficient air traffic control is one of the main elements of safety regulations.  If something goes wrong it is not reasonable that the people who formulate and implement safety regulations are also responsible for air traffic control.  I am aware that the Authority will carry out other safety functions such as the licensing of aircraft, the inspection of hangars and a list of other functions mentioned in section 60 and subsequent sections, but there is a conflict in having one Authority which will be responsible, on the one hand, for air traffic control and, on the <Col N="1380" /> other, for formulating and implementing safety guidelines for the airline industry. The Minister of State admitted as much when he pointed out that this is not the norm in Europe, that the policy in Europe has been to separate the regulatory function from the air traffic control function so that one can monitor the other.  The Minister of State is so aware of this that if an accident was to occur the inquiry into the accident would be the responsibility not of the new Irish Aviation Authority but of the Minister.  That is an open admission that the Minister of State is unhappy with the new arrangement and there is a difficulty which he has identified.  The Minister of State has gone further &mdash; when there is a conflict between the Irish Aviation Authority in respect of a safety matter and other experts there will be an adjudication system&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I think I am being fair.  It is a peculiar admission in the text of the Bill when a mechanism is included which predicts conflict between the new Irish Aviation Authority in respect of safety matters and the board. An adjudication mechanism is proposed to make sure that this is resolved.  The point I am making is that because the Minister of State is retaining the power to investigate accidents and foresees conflict in respect of the safety regulations it seems he is aware that he is going against the grain in relation to what is happening internationally.  Aviation authorities do not have responsibility for air traffic control and, simultaneously, for the formulation and implementation of air safety regulations.  The only justification given <Col N="1381" /> is that this activity is worth £40 million, that it is very small and that it would be ludicrous to set up two State authorities. The Minister of State has decided that instead of two we will have one even though there is a conflict within the one.</P>
      <P>The matter was dealt with in an acceptable way internationally up to now. ANSO was a section within the Department and it was directly responsible to the Minister and his senior officials.  It might have been fuddy duddy and subject to the constraints of the Civil Service and when we free ourselves from the shackles it may operate in a more business like and commercial manner, but the solution does not resolve the fundamental difficulty which every aviation authority in Europe and most in North America have faced, that the regulatory authority and the air traffic control authority should not be in the same organisation, that they should be separate, and that they carry out distinct compatible functions.  Part of the role of the safety authority is to ensure that air traffic control is in keeping with best international practice.  One of the oldest rules in law is that no one can be a judge in his own case but in this instance the Irish Aviation Authority, in respect of air traffic control, is going to be the judge in its own case as it will also be responsible for formulating safety standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State said that the new organisation which will be freed from the constraints of the Civil Service and will operate in a more businesslike and commercial manner will have no interest in making a profit.  It is another peculiarity in the manner in which the Bill is presented that the Authority, which will be freed from the constraints of the Civil Service and will operate in a more businesslike and commercial manner, will not be interested in making a profit. It will be a monopoly which will have the power to set its own charges and the only constraint will be international competition. I wonder to what degree the Minister of State can assure us that the service will be as efficient, effective and as safe as it has been in the past and that the new Authority will not find itself <Col N="1382" /> confronted with the same difficulty that confronted air traffic control services in the United States when Mr. Reagan was President and the difficulty that confronts air traffic control in Europe, particularly in France every August weekend when people have to fly around it and not over it.  There is no mechanism whereby the Minister can have oversight of the charges.  I know that the range of charges now being applied is low by international standards; on a league table we are not a heavy hitter in terms of charges.  This has worked well under the Civil Service, and quite a large flow of revenue has come into the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>How will the Minister control the charges and ensure that the new commercial organisation, which is not designed to make a profit, will operate in such a way that it handles the same amount of traffic?  It should be remembered that as technology changes, the options for the great international carriers increase, it would not be difficult to reroute from Ireland if the service was not up to scratch &mdash; although it always has been &mdash; or if charges were too high. I do not think the international organisations which control this area would allow us to control the same amount of air space if the charges got out of line.</P>
    <P>There are 580 people employed in ANSO at present, 300 of whom are in the Clare-Limerick area.  This is a very important region in terms of air traffic control.  As a result of the historic development of Shannon as the first landfall as one crossed the Atlantic, air traffic control on the north-Atlantic was switched to the European systems at Shannon.  That interface is still in the area.  Planes which fly from the United States to Europe cross from north Atlantic control to Irish control on behalf of the European air services at Shannon.  It is important that the public and Deputies realise that we are not talking simply about flights which land in Shannon, Dublin or Cork; we are talking also about flights which pass through Irish airspace. I understand that last year the air traffic control service in Shannon handled 200,000 flights which did not land in <Col N="1383" /> Ireland and for which a fee will be charged.</P>
    <P>Since the development of the jet engine there has been no necessity to land in Shannon since the early 1960s for reasons of first landfall or having no fuel to travel further.  The status of Shannon was debated last night and will be debated again tonight.  It was a matter of Government policy rather than technological necessity which kept the Shannon stopover in place for the past number of years.  It is also a matter of economic inertia and the status of Shannon being maintained that 300 of the 580 air traffic controllers are located in the Shannon-Limerick area.  Having regard to the changes in the transatlantic fleet and the decision to allow direct flights to Dublin, there is no reason the interchange between north Atlantic and European control could not take place in Dublin, Liverpool, Heathrow or Manchester &mdash; it is merely a question of arranging it.  Will the Minister guarantee that the decisions announced last night, which will be so injurious to my region, do not mean that there will be a major transfer of staff from the Limerick-Shannon region when the new aviation Authority is set up?</P>
    <P>The staff in the region are renowned for their competence &mdash; they make a major contribution to the aviation industry. The staff in Shannon and Dublin have carried out very good work over the years.  We have all been proud of our national airline, but we have also been proud of the very high safety standards set and implemented by ANSO.  Regardless of whether they were constrained by the Civil Service, we owe a debt of gratitude to all the staff and management of ANSO who operated so effectively over the years and have one of the best international safety records of any aviation Authority.  Whatever reasons are being advocated for the change from ANSO to the Irish Aviation Authority, improvement in the safety record has nothing to do with it because the safety record of ANSO has been above and beyond what could be expected from any <Col N="1384" /> Authority &mdash; it must be at the top of the league of similar organisations throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>The staff who have given this service are not being treated very well under this Bill.  It is most peculiar for a Minister to say in this House that as the Bill has been published and brought before the House talks about the future of the staff can take place with the trade union movement. The talks about the future of the staff, their security of tenure, their pension schemes and where they will be located should have taken place and been finalised in a normal industrial relations context before the Bill was brought before the House.  The staff is being told, in effect, that the Bill will be rammed through the Dáil during the last few days before the summer recess, it will be shoved into a committee but because all the Deputies are going on their holidays it will be finalised by Tuesday evening and the consultations will take place with them when the Bill is law; in other words, the consultations will take place when the Government has not one but two big sticks in its hand.  It is a despicable way to treat people who have given good service over the years.</P>
    <P>There is a major suspicion about the intentions of the Minister, the Minister of State and the Government on this issue. This House is not unfamiliar with the setting up of semi-State organisations to carry out activities which were previously carried out by units of the Civil Service. We know the arrangements which were made in respect of An Post, Telecom Éireann and Coillte.  In all those cases, security of tenure, pensions and worker participation on the boards of the companies were included in the terms of the Act.  I do not understand why people who have given good service at such a high level of technology and skill are now to be treated as a group which are not to be trusted to the degree that they will have no representation on the nine member board which will be appointed by the Minister.  People in the timber industry who cut down trees or buy land to set coniferous forests have a relationship with and representation on the board of <Col N="1385" /> their company.  The workers in Telecom and An Post also have representation on the boards of their companies.</P>
    <P>If people who install telephones, people who deal with the payment of bills, postmen, bus conductors and bus drivers are represented on the boards of semi-State organisations, why can traffic controllers, electronic engineers and radio operators, whose skills were lauded by the Minister in his speech, not be represented on the board of their company? Does the Minister think that this representation would add to the conflict between the regulatory functions of the new Authority and the air traffic control functions?  Does he think that if there was worker participation on the board it would take the issue of a person being the judge in their own case to such a ridiculous level that he could not wear it? If that is the reason, he should spell it out in this House.</P>
    <P>The relevant section of the Bill says that everyone employed by ANSO at present shall on the day of the commencement of the Act, which the Minister envisages as 1 January next year, automatically become employees of the new Authority.  This means that all civil servants in ANSO will get a free transfer to the Irish Aviation Authority from 1 January next year.  However, the Bill does not say that when the staff are transferred to the new Authority they will maintain their security of tenure.  They will be secure on 1 January, but how secure will they be on 2 January in this new commercial body which will be separated from the constraints of the Civil Service?  What guarantee will the staff have that 100 of them will not be offered redundancy in a shake-up at Easter?  It is not good enough to say that when the Bill has been passed by the Dáil and Seanad and signed by the President the discussions will take place with the trade unions and staff representatives.  The staff of 580 have given good service, according to the Minister, and in my view their service has been excellent; yet they are being denied the protection afforded to staff in An Post, Telecom Éireann and <Col N="1386" /> forestry when those organisations were brought into the semi-State sector.</P>
    <P>The provisions for the maintenance of pension rights are dubious.  At present the staff has the full benefit of the Civil Service pension scheme, but it is proposed to make a new arrangement whereby the board, once it is set up, will be charged with the task of setting up a pension fund for its employees.  The Minister will be compelled by sections of this Bill to contribute to the fund, but there is nothing in the Bill that guarantees employees with 40 years service that they will receive a pension of 40/80ths of their salary together with a lump sum payment. The sections that deal with the pension arrangements are not at all transparent. Will employees be entitled to a pension of 50 per cent of their salary? Will the pension fund be guaranteed by the State?  Will employees be guaranteed a minimum benefit from the fund?  These may be very mundane questions in the high flying world of international aviation but they are very important for the 580 staff who are at present employed by ANSO and who will have to explain the new arrangements to their wives and children. The husband or wife, as the case may be, will ask how the family will be fixed if anything happens.  The response that the Minister is charging the board to set up the pension fund and over a period of seven years he will pay into it is not good enough.  The Minister will have to give explicit guarantees to the staff.</P>
    <P>I beseech the Minister to give the staff assurances of security of tenure, remuneration, promotional opportunities and pension rights because at present they are worried.  In the heel of the hunt after the process of negotiations he will have to give the guarantees in any event.  Why not do so in a forthright fashion?  It is better to bring people along with you instead of wielding the big stick to them.  The dedicated staff has given the State good service in the past and I have no doubt they will continue to give good service in whatever guise their jobs are organised in future.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Minister has <Col N="1387" /> taken the opportunity to clarify the international obligations of the new organisation, whether in terms of participation in Eurocontrol or compliance with the Chicago Convention and its annexes.  The difficulty with the measures in the Bill complying with the Chicago Convention and its annexes is that they point to the Minister's own unease in having the same group regulate safety and organise air traffic control.  That needs to be teased out very thoroughly on Committee Stage. The Minister is retaining in his own hands some of the powers in the Chicago Convention and its annexes while others are being transferred to the Authority.  Will the Minister justify the breakdown of responsibilities?  Does he have a basic belief that there should be two separate authorities but has been advised that one would be better?  Because of the internal conflict between the Authority's safety and air traffic roles, does he have to be involved again to ensure there is not a conflict of interests?  No doubt this will be teased out on Committee Stage and I look forward to hearing the Minister's justifications for his proposed arrangements under the Chicago Convention.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister develop at some length how he envisages the EATCHIP arrangements, to provide a seamless air traffic control system across Europe developing and to what degree we are ready to participate in it?</P>
    <P>Having said my piece, this is more a Committee Stage Bill and I hope we have a good and fruitful Committee Stage debate on Tuesday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the concluding comments of my colleague that this is more a Committee Stage rather than a Second Stage Bill.  We are certainly facing turbulent times &mdash; no pun intended &mdash; in the airline industry.  It is unfortunate that this Bill is being introduced at a time when there are a great many questions being asked in the airline industry.  It is a bit much to put further impositions on people who have been asked already to make enormous changes.  There are many good aspects to the Bill, but it <Col N="1388" /> strikes me that the Minister is not as surefooted as he would have liked to be &mdash; it seems to be two steps forward and one step backwards.  I will develop that point later.</P>
      <P>At present a great many changes have to be made.  The obvious example is Shannon and questions are being asked about what will happen and how Dublin Airport will develop in the future.  Just under 600 jobs in ANSO will be transferred to the Irish Aviation Authority; 300 of them are in the Shannon region, 200 in Shannon itself and 100 in Clare. This begs other questions.  It is an important step to re-position ANSO as a more commercial operation in the semi-State sector.  I welcome this.  However, on the one hand the Minister wants the sector to be more commercial, but yet there is the proviso that the Authority cannot make any profits.  I am at a loss to know what message the Minister is trying to convey in the first instance to the House and then to the industry.  There are clear contradictions in his speech which display the absence of sure-footedness in what he is trying to achieve.</P>
      <P>Anything that affords the Irish aviation industry more opportunities, while ensuring that standards are maintained and improved, has to be welcomed. Industry cannot stand still.  New developments are occurring all the time and it is important that those involved directly in the regulation, control and planning of our industry have the ability, scope and capacity to seek out new opportunities for themselves.  A developmental approach has benefits not only for our industry but for aspects of the industry worldwide.  There is no reason that the Irish Aviation Authority should not be a world leader in developing technology and innovation.  In my view there is nothing that restricts us in Ireland &mdash; not even size.  I hate the argument that because we are a small country with a small population we do not have the capacity to compete with the big boys. That is nonsense.</P>

      <P>I did not say specifically that the Minister said it.  I was making a general point.  We have the capacity; but it is a question whether the operating companies particularly those in the semi-State commercial sector, have the freedom to make autonomous decisions, not having to look over their shoulders for the political nod and a wink, and to get out into the marketplace and forge ahead.</P>
      <P>ANSO has provided services of the highest quality and its staff has been equal to the task required of them.  Those involved in the general area of traffic control are recognised internationally as people of high standing with a great capacity for business and for dealing with all the situations that arise.  The safety record stands as a testament to the people who have been involved in ANSO to date and speaks for itself.  I hope this record will be guarded with pride and maintained and enhanced in the new organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the companies that will use the services of the Irish Aviation Authority are commercial operations, many of them private operations, and cost effectiveness, from their point of view, is the first part of any equation in terms of those with whom they do business.  It is clear, therefore, that the service and the Irish Aviation Authority must be cost effective and innovative to the point that we would be able to charge less in some instances, than we would charge in other countries for the provision of services here.  These are commercial operations dealing in an airline industry worldwide which is going though the most traumatic time in its history &mdash; and which is likely to continue for a number of years &mdash; because of deregulation and liberalisation worldwide which will cause more turbulence and difficulties for airlines.  The services provided must be cost effective, of the highest quality, provide what is required and have the added value of an organisation clearly recognised as maintaining the highest standards in the delivery of <Col N="1390" /> those services.  Therefore, if the service is to be cost effective it must not be to the detriment of maintaining high standards but on the basis that the high standards required are fostered, improved and maintained at all times.  This is something which ANSO has achieved to date and the new Authority will have to ensure it maintains the standard in the future and that its services are innovative, of the highest quality and cost effective.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the position of the staff.  In reading the Bill and having listened to the Minister this morning it is clear that fewer than 600 of the staff involved are moving from the secure position of having been civil servants. The Minister has not provided in the Bill or stated in his contribution this morning the precise status of the staff.  Notwithstanding other arguments of companies closing down and staff being made redundant, the position of the staff after 1 January 1994 in terms of pension rights, security of tenure, wage structures and so on is not clear.  It is obvious that whatever discussions the Minister or his officials have had with the existing staff they have not reached a conclusion.  The attitude appears to be that we will publish the Bill first and see where we go from there.  I am concerned about the attitude in the Bill regarding the staff and I hope that between the conclusion of Second Stage and Committee Stage the Minister and his Department will have all the necessary details completed or, at least, more information.</P>
    <P>Given the advance in technology and the facilities between Dublin and Shannon &mdash; I include Clare in that &mdash; it is clear there is a distinct possibility of centralisation of all the services into one area.  If no change was announced in the Shannon stopover policy one would automatically think that the importance of the Shannon Air Traffic Control Centre would be maintained but, with the change to Dublin, a further question mark is placed over a large number of jobs.  By any stretch of the imagination 300 jobs is a lot.  If 100 to 150 jobs were provided in a manufacturing industry Ministers would be dancing on the streets <Col N="1391" /> with glee.  Three hundred jobs and the effect this has on families is indeed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister will have to make his intentions clear in this whole area.  It is not acceptable to me &mdash; and I am sure it is not acceptable to most Members in the House &mdash; that these changes are taking place and that their consequential effects are not being spelt out to the staff involved.  Given the other changes, which I will not detail, it begs very serious questions in the context of this Bill which must be dealt with.  My instinct tells me that Shannon must remain an extremely important part of Irish and international aviation.  If changes are deemed necessary for reasons of efficiency or technology it would be logical that Shannon because of its worldwide renown and recognition, should be the area of concentration of these facilities and resources.  I say this because this matter has not been dealt with in the Bill. It has been alluded to but the Minister has said nothing beyond that, which is regrettable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1392" /> This morning the Minister said he wanted to see commercial opportunities in the area of associated services for profit which he described as training and consultancy work taken on board by this new authority.  I welcome that.  Yet he said the Government is responsible for shaping much of the policy.  If the Authority is to have the autonomy and be adventurous in terms of seeking commercial opportunities worldwide I hope they do not have to wait for the nod from the Department.</P>
    <P>There is some conflict between the retention of policy decisions by the Minister and the conflict within the new Authority on the regulatory, air traffic control and policy sides.  It is all very unclear. Given the shrinking because of technology and the advancement worldwide it is unlikely, because of the relationship in Europe, that we will have national air traffic control centres.  It is likely that there will be slimmer and more centred organisations throughout the world.  The delivery of those services need not be as widespread as is the case at present.</P>
    <P>The new Authority should have the capacity to be recognised worldwide as a provider of such services in its own right. It should not see its role as confined to Irish aerospace.  If that means it must form a separate company to deal with consultancy or delivery services, then it should do so.  The Irish Aviation Authority should be able to manage air traffic control services either in one country or in a group of countries.  There is enormous scope in that area for profit and a major commercial operation which would have a significant impact on job creation, not just here but for Irish people operating such services throughout the world.  The Minister alluded to that in his speech but did not elaborate on it.  The scope and scale of opportunity should be made clear to the members of the Authority.  If Aer Rianta can develop and run duty-free airports in various parts of the world it is equally open to the Irish Aviation Authority to deliver, operate and seek payment for services because it has the expertise and the people to carry <Col N="1393" /> out those services.  That would be more appropriate than training people in other countries for such positions.  Those opportunities should be made clear in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am not sure the Minister has gone the whole way in moving from ANSO to a semi-State commercial organisation.  He gave no reason why the Authority should not be a private commercial organisation to which certain constraints would apply in regard to its operations, although he indicated that this might happen in the not too distant future.  We appear to be taking this development in stages.  If that is so the commercial opportunities might be lost, because the transition period is not flexible enough and a commercial semi-State operation might not have the same flexibility and capacity to enter the marketplace as a private company.</P>
    <P>The Minister lacked conviction in regard to the regulatory function being separate from the air traffic control function. He adopted the poacher turned gamekeeper mentality in that respect, but that will not work.  He stated it would be impractical to have two separate organisations but made no arguments to support that view.  Was it a case of somebody whispering to him that we do not require two bodies?  There is an obvious need for two separate bodies, particularly having regard to the points I made about the commercial opportunities which exist.  One must read between the lines of the Minister's speech because his intentions are unclear.  If the Minister wants to take on board the commercial opportunities to which I referred &mdash; he alluded to this in his speech &mdash; he is making a fundamental error by having the two functions under the one Authority. It will not work, it is unfair to the Authority and I do not believe the Minister is convinced that it is good practice. It certainly is not taking into account what is happening in other countries and it will place a question mark over the Authority from an international perspective. The poacher turned gamekeeper mentality should not be inflicted on anybody and that is clearly the case from the way the Minister has designed <Col N="1394" /> the Authority.  That is unacceptable in this House and it will also be unacceptable internationally.</P>
    <P>That is not the way to do business and the Minister has made a fundamental error in his approach to setting up the Authority.  There are many good aspects to setting up the Authority, but the Minister is undermining its responsibilities by not separating those two functions. Having the same people responsible for both functions will not lead to good judgment, direction and decision making.  The Bill is flawed in that respect and it will restrict the good work of the Authority.  The Minister will have to reconsider this aspect of the Bill. Although it would fundamentally change the direction in which the Minister wants to go, this should be altered on Committee Stage.  The Minister's attitude lacks clarity.  He is trying to ride too many horses at one time and he is not sure in which direction they are running or whether he wants to run on the flat or in a steeplechase.  He must make decisions in regard to what he wants to achieve before finalising the Bill.</P>
    <P>What volume of military aircraft entering our airspace is included in the figure of 200,000 or 300,000 aircraft which never land here?  Do they pay a greater charge or a similar charge to that of commercial airlines?  Will the Minister communicate with me in that regard?</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that responsibility for a major air disaster remains within his remit.  Where does the chain of command lie or what line will the decision making process take?  We have had some serious air disasters in our coastal waters in the past where too much time was lost before decisions were made and an emergency plan put into operation.  It took too long for somebody to take ultimate responsibility and make quick decisions.  What role will the Authority and the Minister's Department have in the event of a major air disaster?  How is it proposed that those two bodies will work together in an efficient and speedy manner in the event of an air disaster within our airspace?</P>
    <P>A nine member board will be <Col N="1395" /> appointed to the Authority and it is extraordinary that no senior staff or experts in the industry will be appointed to that board.  Obviously there is some reason for it but it is a mistake and should not be specifically excluded by the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In the last few years vast sums of money, mainly from Structural Funds, have been put into the development of the regions and of the regional airports, but they are now forgotten because of the dominance of the greater questions of Aer Lingus at Shannon and Dublin. However, they are still a very important asset and an integral part of the Irish aviation industry.  Therefore, I suggest that in constituting the board the Minister make some attempt to achieve a regional spread because I would hate to see the board totally weighted towards one area. That would be a mistake.  I do not believe in appointing people simply for the sake of appointing them; only people with something to contribute should be appointed to the board.  I certainly hope the Minister will not appoint political cronies to a board of such importance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

      <P>I hope the appointments will be made on the basis of ability to make a substantial contribution to the organisation and running of this Authority. However, I think it is reasonable that the regions be recognised in making such appointments.  That is important to their potential development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 81 sections in this Bill, many of a technical nature.  I would ask that the points raised here this morning receive sufficient time to be debated on Committee Stage.  The fundamental questions are the conflict within the Authority between the regulatory function and the air traffic control function coupled with the potential commercial possibilities, which are far greater than the Minister seems to think.  The structure of this Authority does not give it a clear mandate <Col N="1396" /> and I think a change in the direction of this Bill is called for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection whatever to the establishment of ANSO as a semi-State company.  The Minister gave us a very interesting and comprehensive address this morning dealing with the functions of ANSO.  However, I am surprised that he has presented no <i>rationale</i> for the transfer of these functions to a semi-State body.  It is still not clear why a semi-State organisation is being set up to take over the functions of ANSO.  I am doubly concerned at some of the omissions from and provisions in this Bill.  As Deputy Noonan says, the transfer of Civil Service functions to semi-State organisations is nothing new. Most of the legislation dealing with that kind of transfer is now standard.  What concerns me is the number of significant departures from the standard legislation that deals with the establishment of semi-State companies and the transfer of functions from the Civil Service.  Most of those departures have to do with the conditions of service, security of tenure and rights of the employees of the organisation. We need to know why those normally standard provisions have not been set down in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of sections which deal with employment conditions need to be addressed.  For example, section 40 deals with the transfer of staff to the aviation Authority and provides, as is standard in this type of legislation, for the protection of conditions of employment.  What it does not deal with is the security of tenure of the employees.  The question of security of tenure has been dealt with and has been specifically written into the legislation establishing other semi-State organisations.  Similarly, on the question of superannuation schemes, section 41 sets out the way in which the Irish Aviation Authority may establish and run a superannuation scheme and get approval from the Minister for it.  What it does not do is guarantee the employees of ANSO who will be transferring to the Irish Aviation Authority a superannuation regime <Col N="1397" /> which will not be less favourable than the regime they currently enjoy.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why standard provisions included in other legislation setting up semi-State companies have not been included in this legislation.  Why is it that in those two areas standard provisions in, for example, the legislation setting up Coillte, An Post and other semi-State organisations have not been included in this legislation?  I know that discussions have taken place between the trade unions representing staff in ANSO and the Minister's Department.  Last week we were presented with the white copy of the Bill.  The printed copy arrived only some days ago.  I am surprised that once that omission had been drawn to the attention of the Minister by the unions representing the staff the opportunity was not taken to rectify it and include it in the Bill that was circulated to us.  I am also surprised by the rather nebulous reference to it by the Minister.  He acknowledges that concern exists among the ANSO staff.  He acknowledges that discussions have taken place with his Department about it and he tells us that he will tell us something about it on Committee Stage.  What he has not stated &mdash; and perhaps he will do so when replying &mdash; is that he has a firm intention to introduce an amendment or amendments on Committee Stage to provide for the security of tenure of the employees who will be transferring from ANSO and also provide that the terms of their superannuation scheme will not be less favourable than those they currently enjoy.  The Minister should put that on the record when replying to this debate.</P>
    <P>The most remarkable omission relates to sections 17 and 71.  Section 17 provides that a member of the staff of the company shall not be a director of the company and section 71 bluntly states that the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts, 1977-91, shall not apply to the company. I find that extraordinary.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions which is meeting in conference in Galway this week and which will no doubt be considering the prospects of entering into discussions with the Government for a new programme <Col N="1398" /> for economic and social progress, might well reflect on the fact that this Government has specifically excluded the employees of the proposed Irish Aviation Authority from the worker participation legislation.</P>
    <P>The exclusion of the Worker Participation Act and the provision in the legislation that no employee of the company can be a director is a direct breach of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> negotiated with the social partners. The first section of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> deals with the key objectives of its strategy. The development of worker participation, women's and consumers' rights is stated to be among the five key objectives of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  A whole section of that document is devoted to worker participation, stating that employee participation is of benefit to both the enterprise and the employees.  It also states that the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act will be kept under review and that discussions will take place between the social partners and Government about its operation. One section of that document deals with extending the principle of worker participation to the private sector.</P>
    <P>This legislation before us provides for the establishment of a new semi-State company.  Yet, despite the provisions in the Programme for Government and the commitments entered into in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the provisions of the worker participation legislation are being denied to the employees of the Irish Aviation Authority.  There is a specific statement that, even though the employees do not have a right under the Worker Participation Act to elect one of their number to the board, if some Minister in the future discovered an employee such as an air traffic controller or some other employee who might be suitable for membership of the board, the Minister would be prevented by this legislation from appointing that person to the board. It is specifically provided that an employee of the Irish Aviation Authority <Col N="1399" /> cannot be a member of the board of that Authority.  In other words, a person directly involved in working for the Authority cannot be involved in running the Authority.</P>
    <P>The rationale the Minister has given for that exclusion is that there might be some conflict of interest, that you could not have an employee of the IAA as a member of the board deciding on regulatory matters.  If the conflict of interest is so great as to deny to the employees of the IAA the right to participate in membership of the board, then the Minister's argument that there is no conflict of interest in the Authority being the regulatory body and also responsible for the operational side of the business falls on its face.  The Minister cannot have it both ways.  He cannot say there is no conflict between the Authority being the regulatory body and also responsible for the operational side and also state that because it is the regulatory body there will be a conflict of interest involving the staff.  That is a direct contradiction.  If there is such conflict of interest as to deny the employees the right to participation on the board, the Minister should consider whether it is possible to have these activities encompassed in one body or if there should be more than one body.</P>
    <P>I must question why significant exclusions relating to staff employment conditions and worker participation are specified in the Bill.  It is important to consider what the Minister stated about the possible future privatisation of this activity.  The Minister stated that, as the Authority will be the regulatory body, the Government excluded the possibility of private ownership.  He also stated that if in future any of the core functions of the new Authority were to be carried out by the private sector, that matter would have to be brought back to the Oireachtas for debate and decision.  It is interesting that the paragraph, which may be interpreted by the Committee of 22 as meaning there will be no privatisation, is interpreted by Deputy Cullen, who favours privatisation, as indicating there will be privatisation.  Deputy Cullen interprets <Col N="1400" /> that section of the Minister's speech as meaning that a semi-State organisation is now being set up and that at some stage in the future that organisation should and will be privatised.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cullen's interpretation of the Minister's intention is probably correct. I cannot see any other reason for the diminution of the rights of the employees, such as exclusion from board membership, provided in this legislation other than to facilitate at some future stage the preparation of this company for privatisation.</P>
    <P>Our history of privatisation has been that profitable and successful State organisations are fair game for the private sector.  Aviation is a profitable activity and this proposed semi-State organisation will have a viable commercial future and great potential in competing for the various activities for which it will be responsible.  This legislation is providing for the transfer of aviation activity to a semi-State body to prepare it structurally for privatisation at some future stage.  The Minister's reference to having to bring this matter before the Oireachtas and so on is simply taking the latch off the door.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not imagination. Because of arrangements entered into we may not see privatisation of this activity during the lifetime of this Government but this legislation is providing the preparatory work for such privatisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the profitable nature of this activity, much of it generated by overflights.  Deputy Cullen asked a question, which I also wish to pursue, regarding the number of military overflights.  Some figures have been given as to the number of overflights and we have been told that some proportion of the activity of ANSO relates to overflights. We have not been given the breakdown of overflights as between military and civil activity.  We need to know that information because a great deal of concern has been expressed about <Col N="1401" /> the extent to which Irish airspace is being traversed by military aircraft, particularly aircraft carrying nuclear weapons.  Much concern has been expressed about that in the past and we now need to know the full extent of that activity.</P>
    <P>This legislation is essentially concerned with air safety and safety from air disaster. We have had a very good record in that area.  I agree with the complimentary remarks made in respect of ANSO and its staff, who have been involved in the control of aircraft and air safety.  We are all aware that air accidents happen, and any air accident is a great tragedy.  The prospect of an air accident involving aircraft carrying nuclear weapons is frightening and puts in perspective concerns which all Members have regarding the possibility of nuclear accidents at places such as Sellafield.  The prospect of any aircraft carrying nuclear weapons having an accident while travelling through Irish airspace is frightening.  There should be a prohibition on aircraft carrying nuclear weapons through our air space and we should take the opportunity to deal with that in the context of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Other speakers referred to the fact that this debate is taking place at a time when there is a great deal of discussion about aviation policy generally.  The Minister came in here last night to assure us that the Government has an aviation policy. I do not believe that it has.  I have never seen an aviation policy document and in practice there is little evidence of an aviation policy.  The Minister stated, &ldquo;We have an aviation policy and I have clearly articulated what it is&rdquo;.  He went on to tell us that, &ldquo;I do not intend to repeat the full details of our plan and policies for Irish aviation.  These are already on the record of the House&rdquo;.  He sounds like the type of old fashioned politician who would stand up outside a chapel gate, say a few words in Irish and then for those who did not understand the native tongue, carry on in English.  It is the oldest excuse in the book.  If one does not have a policy simply say that it is so complex and so detailed there is no time to repeat it.</P>
    <P>The only time I recall the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications <Col N="1402" /> coming into this House and discussing aviation policy was in response to the Private Members' motion on Aer Limgus which I tabled just before the Easter recess.  On that occasion what the Minister passed off for aviation policy was no more than a series of aspirational statements. There is no aviation policy of which I am aware and all of the <i>ad hoc</i>&mdash; in some cases eleventh hour &mdash; belated decisions that are being taken are not a substitute for aviation policy.  If we take, for example, the question of liberalisation, it would appear from the passing references to liberalisation made by the Minister that we are in some way in favour of it because there is little we can do about it.  We have never heard the Government's position in relation to liberalisation.  It seeks to be unfashionable to question it.  We certainly know that liberalisation has not conferred any benefits on people who have been working in the aviation industry.  Whether it confers benefits on the consumer is questionable because it is debatable whether with the &ldquo;hub and spoke&rdquo; approach to aviation, consumers are better off having to fly to an intermediate hub airport in order to get to their destination.</P>
    <P>We do not know the Government's position in this regard and, specifically we do not know what has been the Government's position in relation to liberalisation policy in the EC.  This is not a new issue.  The question of liberalisation has been on the agenda for many years now and the question of liberalisation in the EC context has been on the agenda since 1987.  It was obvious that EC liberalisation of air policy would have serious implications for Aer Lingus, that it would either wipe out Aer Lingus or at best reduce it to the status of a provincial or regional small airline.  That issue has never been teased out.  The relationship between what Ministers for Transport have been saying and doing at EC Council of Ministers meetings on the question of liberalisation and its implications for Aer Lingus has never been spelled out and I would like to know what it is. Whatever we may say about the world aviation industry and our lack of control <Col N="1403" /> over it, in the context of the Council of Ministers it would seem that the Government must have had some influence or input into the development of liberalisation policy in the European Community. It seems to me there has been an absence of a policy and in its place we seem to have a kind of Irish version of it. It was reasonable, on the one hand, to allow a so-called form of competition in the domestic market while, at the same time, saddling Aer Lingus with various kinds of restrictions and regulations which have been debated in this House on a number of occasions.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that while we have been debating, both in this House and in the country generally, whether the limited number of transatlantic flights that have their destination here should stop in Shannon or Dublin or both, we have, as was pointed out, such a degree of air traffic flying over our airspace.  Clearly, much of that traffic would never land here anyway but when one considers, for example, that approximately 50 per cent of the air passengers coming to this country are now coming through UK airports, there is a very serious question about what the Government has been doing over the past number of years and its failure to develop any hub airport here.</P>
    <P>We are told by the Minister that Irish airspace occupies a vital position between the North Atlantic and Europe, and so it does.  If it occupies such a vital position why were greater efforts not made over the past number of years, particularly with all that we know about liberalisation, to develop a hub airport here which would attract some of that traffic through this country?  That was not done because there has been no aviation policy of any kind.  We are now left in the pathetic position where we have this ongoing provincial argument between Shannon and Dublin.  It is interesting to note that the Minister mentioned Shannon ten times in the course of his contribution. I would have to acknowledge that Shannon is very much on the Minister's mind these days but it seems that what we are being prepared for, in the <Col N="1404" /> context of the Aviation Bill, is a grand announcement.  When this Bill goes through the Houses of the Oireachtas it will be announced some months from now &mdash; another sweetener for Shannon &mdash; that the headquarters of the Irish Aviation Authority will be located in Shannon.</P>

      <P>At the outset I wish to congratulate the Minister for his initiative in introducing the Irish Aviation Authority Bill to the House.  Given the current difficulties being experienced by the airline industry many might suggest that the establishment of a semi-State company to provide air navigation services is untimely.</P>
      <P>However, in times of difficulty enlightened vision helps to promote recovery. The Minister in the Bill is preparing the ground for a navigation service that is more efficient and responsive to the ever-changing demands of user airlines.  This is being achieved without undermining the high standard of safety currently followed by the Air Navigation Services Office.</P>
      <P>Today Irish aviation is a large, diverse industrial sector which makes a major contribution to the Irish economy in terms of GNP activity and employment. It comprises world class companies and small niche aircraft and airfield operators. There is enormous employment potential in the aviation industry.  Last year at the air show in England I witnessed the potential for the aviation industry in servicing and so on.  There was a belief at that time within the industry that the number of jobs here could be doubled over a number of years if the correct approach was adopted.  The Minister also referred to training.  There is huge potential for training in Third World countries such as Africa and the Far East.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fundamental to the success and continued development of Irish aviation are high safety and operating standards. Confidence in our safety and operating systems is the cornerstone on which the success of the aviation industry depends. As the industry expands, so too must our capacity to safely and efficiently manage <Col N="1406" /> and exploit our airspace.  The purpose of this Bill is to set up an organisational structure which will continue to provide for the safe management of our airspace and exploit opportunities to improve efficiency.</P>
    <P>The Air Navigation Services Office is well prepared to assume the responsibilities of a semi-State body providing essential services for the Irish aviation sector.  In recent years it has been developing its managerial and technical skills to a point where its operation is as good as that of any of our European neighbours.  On the technical side, following a five-year national £30 million reequipment programme, ANSO has state-of-the-art equipment and systems. However, this does not mean that investment can cease.  Most of the deficiencies in the air traffic system in the mid-eighties were a consequence of low investment policies over previous years.  This must not happen again.  Removing ANSO from the restrictions of Exchequer funding will ensure that investment to maintain and expand the capacity of our ATC system can and will be made at the most appropriate time.  I compliment the Minister on the fact that, despite the congestion problems being experienced in Europe, delay resulting from deficiencies in Irish airspace is now a thing of the past.  Ireland has set a high standard for other states to follow.</P>
    <P>There are many other interesting facts about ANSO which augur well for its conversion into a semi-State body.  It has a turnover of £40 million, more than 80 per cent of which comes from foreign airlines.  While this is significant by any standards it strikes me that the prospects for growth in this area are extremely good.  Given the talent and experience of the highly specialised ANSO personnel, expansion into consultancy services presents an opportunity on which the new semi-State IAA can readily capitalise. ANSO already employs 600 people and development in consultancy activity will assist in the creation of new jobs in the IAA.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the emphasis he is placing on safety.  It is <Col N="1407" /> extremely important that with improved efficiency in air navigation services the safety aspect is not undermined in any way.</P>
    <P>Section 32 obliges the new company to report to the Minister on the technical and safety standards that it applies and also provides for a technical and safety audit of the company every three years. This will ensure a safety priority in the new organisation.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech rightly described our airspace as a national asset. Irish airspace covers 100,000 square miles and stretches to a distance of 200 miles around some parts of our coasts.  More than 300,000 aircraft use our airspace every year.  Care will have to be taken in the future to protect this asset and policies and plans should now be adopted and implemented to ensure that in the event of a rationalisation of European airspace Ireland is in a strong position to play an active role in any such reorganisation.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that ANSO has the capacity to become the textbook example of a relevant and successful semi-State body.  I consider that the time is right for such a development and I am equally convinced that this new body will be efficient, considerate to the demands and views of user airlines and will, above all, preserve the safety record of the Air Navigation Services Office.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his commitment to safety, which is the bedrock of the aviation industry.  Criticism has been made of the changes proposed in the Bill.  What we are doing is setting up a commercial body which will make commercial decisions.  As the aviation industry is constantly changing it is becoming much more competitive, and the new body will be able to quickly and efficiently make relevant changes which will be to the benefit of the industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore spoke about privatisation. I cannot understand why there is such opposition to privatisation.  I agree with the Deputy in regard to the number of military aircraft using our airspace.  I too would like to know how many flights <Col N="1408" /> of a military nature use our airspace. During the Gulf War there was great concern about the use of our airspace. With the introduction of the so-called new world order it is even more important that we know who is using our airspace. Safety is a high priority but it is also important to ensure that our airspace is not used as a means by which military strikes are made on other countries.</P>
    <P>Ireland is strategically located to develop the aviation industry.  One of the criticisms made is that we do not have an aviation policy.  However, any time a Minister talks about aviation policy he is immediately criticised by the Opposition. A typical example was the debate on the Shannon stop-over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is opposition to matters other than the Shannon stop-over.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all guilty of parish pump politics.  Progressive Democrats, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil members try to get the best deal for their areas.  Manchester has been developed as a hub airport and all English newspapers carry advertisements highlighting the great benefits of flying into Manchester. However, all politicians here have avoided the question of the Shannon stop-over for years and it is not a matter of which we can be proud.  One of the reasons we do not have a clear aviation policy is that everybody has been afraid to deal with the Shannon issue.</P>
      <P>As a Dublin Deputy I am glad a decision has been made in this regard. Dublin Airport shall be developed as a hub airport.  That does not necessarily mean the end of Shannon.  Shannon can and will develop in new ways.  There is great potential there as was said on the radio this morning by a spokesperson for Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know why anyone can criticise liberalisation of the airline industry. Since liberalisation there has been a huge increase in the number of people flying in and out of Ireland.  Probably the only reason for the success of Aer Rianta is the huge increase in the number of people using the airport.  Aer Rianta is a fantastic <Col N="1409" /> success story not only here but in the Soviet Union and in other places where it is engaged in consultancy work.  Liberalisation is the reason the company is making so much money and I do not understand how anybody could object to that.  Although Ryanair has had problems it is successful for a small airline and Aer Lingus has improved its service considerably because of the competition. The company is in trouble now but that does not necessarily have anything to do with liberalisation.  It relates more to the lack of investment in the company for many years.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  We will see a commercial body making good decisions to develop our aviation industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Carey.  A number of issues have caused me concern, particularly the security of tenure of staff.  I am not fully satisfied that the Bill ensures the security of tenure of staff who have worked for a long time in the public service. It has been the tradition in other Bills to provide security in semi-State companies with regard to activities that were formerly carried out in the public service.  That is as it should be.</P>
      <P>I am concerned too about the implicit decision in this Bill to combine in one agency the regulatory activities and the implementation of air traffic control. Where we have combined activities which give rise to a potential conflict of interest we have invariably got ourselves into difficulties.  Under the forestry Bill we foolishly provided that grant-giving to the private sector would be conducted through the State timber company and a conflict of interest naturally arose from that.  We should not make the same mistake here.</P>

      <P>It is not the norm in other European countries to combine in one State authority the two functions of regulation and execution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed Cahill plan is creating enormous concern in my constituency on <Col N="1410" /> the north side of Dublin.  The Government has accepted the plan hook line and sinker.  It is very disturbing that this plan has been adopted in the absence of a national aviation plan.  The Government has always emphasised the notion of partnership being at the base of its approach to resolving difficult issues.  The Aer Lingus workers had a right to expect that the Government would sit down with them as equal partners and would be willing to put its cards on the table. Instead, the workers of Aer Lingus have been kept in the dark.  Last Friday we saw the dismissal of hundreds of workers in TEAM within days of a joint Government Irish Congress of Trade Unions statement that there would be a commitment to preserve maximum employment, which most people read as a willingness on the part of Government to prevent compulsory redundancies.  More than 300 workers were handed their P45s and have left.  There was no consultation or discussion.  It was a abrupt as that. That is to renege on the commitment given.</P>
    <P>I recall the motion we debated in the House on 27 October 1992 about Aer Lingus in which Deputy Spring, the Leader of the Labour Party, now Tánaiste, gave a clear commitment and called on the Government, a Government of which he is now a member in column 888 of the Official Report to:</P>
    <P>... prepare immediately a detailed national aviation policy to secure the future survival and development of the company as our national airline; to give an undertaking to provide the necessary equity capital to ensure that the equity base of the company is strong enough to enable Aer Lingus to compete effectively in the context of deregulation; to publish the detailed policy by November 30th; and to undertake that no decision affecting employment in the company will be taken pending the publication of such a detailed and comprehensive policy.</P>
    <P>We have not had a national aviation plan from the Government of which the Labour Party is now a member.  Only a <Col N="1411" /> national aviation plan can seriously address the issues.  We have clearly &ldquo;sold the pass&rdquo; on getting EC aid for mobile assets and that is critical.  Portugal, Britain, Spain and France have obtained EC aid for mobile assets and we have not even addressed the issue from a policy sense.  We have just said that it cannot be done.  We have not addressed the critical issue of how a short haul aviation company can survive in a deregulated market stripped of its ancillaries, which is what we will have in two or three years time. We need to know that there is some confidence underpinning the strategy in which 1,500 people are to lose their jobs. I do not have confidence in the plan. Like Deputy Noonan I have not seen any convincing evidence to show that we can suddenly beat the competition on the Atlantic as seems to be suggested.  There has not been a dramatic transformation. The likely competitors we will face will be much more cost effective.  They have been through deregulation and they have cut costs drastically.  This is not a strategy that offers much hope.</P>
    <P>On the European side it looks as if we are determined to adopt a cheap fare policy with which we have not succeeded in the past.  What is the basis for that?  If we want to preserve a national airline, and if we are committed to it, we must develop a national aviation strategy in which the national airline will have a place.  Let us have that commitment.  Let us see the Government's attitude to partnerships with other companies because we need the long haul link-up if our national airline is to thrive.  The plan is notably silent on that.  This was what we were led to believe would be at the heart of this survival strategy.  We have suffered years of neglect, particularly from Fianna Fáil Ministers who held responsibility for this airline over many years. The £40 million losses did not arise today or yesterday.  We have had three successive years of £40 million losses before this year's £64 million.</P>

      <P>It is naive for Government Ministers to wring their hands and say these problems are greater than those in Irish Shipping and other companies put together.  We saw the figures and many parties chose to close their eyes to them and to do nothing while others chose to make rash promises and to indicate in constituencies such as mine, that the number of job losses would be kept to the minimum at a time when 1,000 were under threat.  Now 1,500 are under threat.</P>
      <P>In its manifesto the Labour Party said it would put equity into Aer Lingus to strengthen its balance sheet and free its potential for producing substantial new employment through profitable investment. Those words now ring hollow given that one third of the staff of Aer Lingus are to be &ldquo;set aside,&rdquo; to use the words which became fashionable in recent times when dealing with another policy.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party also said in its manifesto it was determined to ensure that the job potential of the company would be fully protected, it called on the Government to prepare a detailed national aviation policy and to give an undertaking that no decision would be taken pending the publication of such a policy.  These were hollow promises.  The Labour Party, in expecting a new air of realism to dawn, and knowing we are competing in a deregulated market, did not refer to the way in which it deceived the people for so long.  This is a sad tale of neglect and deception and many people will not forgive the Labour Party.</P>

The Minister of State in his lengthy speech indicated that a substantial <Col N="1413" /> number of the people employed in this sector work at Shannon in my constituency.  Indeed, I was glad to note that he mentioned Shannon about ten times.  This is one area where people are experiencing anguish at present.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister of State also mentioned another location &mdash; Prestwick &mdash; which is no longer included in the Fianna Fáil dogma, which was abandoned by the British authorities in much the same way as the Fianna Fáil Party will abandon Shannon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's ringing words but his party will be judged by its deeds.  I am aware that while those who work in air traffic control welcome this development they are not satisfied with the work of the Minister of State. Indeed, only a few weeks ago the trade union IMPACT passed a resolution which read:</P>
      <P>This Union deplores the attempt by the Department of Finance and the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications to diminish the legislative guarantee to civil servants who transfer to the new Aviation Authority. Accordingly, if the forthcoming Bill does not contain the same guarantee of security of tenure as that applied to Telecom, An Post and Coillte employees we resolve to take industrial action up to and including strike action.</P>
      <P>Recently I tabled a parliamentary question in the hope that I would receive a positive reply for the Minister.  The Minister of State informed the staff that he would amend section 40 of the Bill to give them the guarantee of security of tenure that they required but he has not done this.  He expressed pious platitudes about Shannon because he feels we are crying and will be forever grateful to Fianna Fáil for rescuing us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who work in air traffic control have been providing a good service for a <Col N="1414" /> long time.  In particular those who work in Shannon have suffered severely because of the embargo.  Despite this, the Minister of State did not pay tribute to the people concerned for the quality of their work in trying conditions for a long number of years.  Neither did he say anything about the mess created by the Department.  The facility at Ballygireen could have been used.  Eurocontrol is operated from Brussels by the European Community.  The Government made a lame attempt to have this service located at Shannon but instead its headquarters has located in Brussels.  I wonder if the Minister of State will do the right thing and establish the new headquarters of the Irish Aviation Authority at Shannon. I read his speech very quickly to see if it contained any reference to this matter.  The reply to my parliamentary question stated that it would be a matter for the members of the new Authority to decide where its headquarters should be located.</P>
    <P>The experience of Shannon in this area has been sad.  The Doherty committee was established to examine air-sea rescue services.  By subterfuge the Department decided to relocate the people concerned from Shannon to Dublin where its headquarters is now located because complaints had been received from people on Valentia Island and other sectors of the maritime industry that no proper facility had been provided.  This was done at the stroke of a pen and was not above board. Therefore, I do not think that IMPACT will accept all the remarks of the Minister of State unless he outlines his intentions in writing in relation to the guarantee of security of tenure.</P>
    <P>The staff are rightly concerned about their conditions of employment.  As the Minister of State is aware this is a stressful occupation which can cause illness.  When the staff were employed as civil servants they knew they would be looked after. However, it seems no provision has been made for a scheme.  Therefore, will the Minister of State tell us which section deals with their conditions of employment? I presume that the Labour Party <Col N="1415" /> originally objected to the idea of privatisation but has now withdrawn any objections it may have had.</P>
    <P>What does the Minister of State propose to do to recruit controllers?  Will they be recruited abroad?  Apparently, young people from the other states have been trained to do this work.  Will the Minister of State insist that the new Authority should adopt a recruitment policy and place emphasis on the need to recruit highly educated Irish people?  The Minister of State must be aware that in the west those trained at the regional technical college in Galway and at the radio school in Moylish are highly skilled but have to emigrate to find employment. Will the Minister of State issue instructions to his representative on the Authority to ask the management to pursue such matters?</P>
    <P>I did not intend to be flippant about Shannon as it is a serious issue.  As I said the other day, the necessary capital and human resources are available; the greater number of personnel employed by air traffic control are located at Shannon.  It would be a fillip to those people if the Minister indicated either during Second Stage or on Committee Stage that he will look at this issue favourably.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister explain how the level of charges will be decided?  Will the fees currently charged by Aer Rianta be used in future to fund the activities of the new Authority?  Will this lead to a further increase in landing fees over and above the 6 per cent already proposed by Aer Rianta?  Has this matter been considered by the Minister's Department?  This issue is of critical importance to Aer Lingus which has released extensive documents on our excessive airport charges &mdash; the landing fees for Dublin Airport are among the highest in the world.  Will the setting-up of this Authority lead to a further increase in these charges?</P>
    <P>I am still shocked at the decision taken by the Government to abandon Shannon. The setting up of this Authority and the implementation of the recommendations in the Shannon Airport rescue plan may <Col N="1416" /> work against Shannon in the future unless some serious answers are given. SFADCo, which has traditionally had the role of promoting Shannon Airport, has now been given the new role of promoting Farranfore Airport.  It has told people in the tourism industry in that region that any new business which can be generated in Germany, France, etc., will go to Farranfore Airport and business in Shannon Airport will be maintained at its present level.  That is the directive from the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications to the company.  Is it intended that activity in Shannon will be maintained at its present level or is it intended to give some bit of life to that airport?  Does the Minister envisage that there will be life in Shannon after the implementation of Mr. Cahill's plan?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave a very clear outline of the role of ANSO. He also clearly outlined that the Government has an aviation policy and that it is committed to the continuation of public sector involvement in that industry.  This is a complex Bill which will set up a clear framework within which Irish aviation safety standards will be maintained and within which Irish airspace can be controlled, properly managed and successfully operated.  The new Authority will complete the public sector structure in the aviation industry.  We already have Aer Lingus and we have Aer Rianta, which operates our airports and the many fine regional airports, and the new Authority which will have responsibility for safety and our airspace, will complete that public sector infrastructure.  It is important that the basic essentials in any endeavour are correct.  Nothing could be more important to the aviation industry than safety and airspace.  The comprehensive nature of this Bill will ensure that the Authority will not only have the capacity but also the ability to discharge its functions which are essential to the long term future of the Irish aviation industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I very much welcome the proposed three year safety audit.  This innovative <Col N="1417" /> proposal will ensure that the Minister and the Government can monitor the safety standards implemented by the Authority. I suggest to the Minister that it would be helpful if these reports were published. This would add to public confidence in both the Authority and the Irish aviation industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister has correctly proposed combining the regulatory and operational functions, such as air traffic control, under the new Authority.  I sympathise with the concerns expressed, but I believe the approach outlined by the Minister is the correct one.  The Authority will have a very strong safety ethos and I am sure it will be able to combine both functions.  With regard to the decision to combine the regulatory and operational functions, I wish to emphasise that the most important consideration is that the Authority does not investigate itself.  Responsibility for the investigation of accidents will remain the responsibility of the Minister and his Department and that is as it should be.  I am not impugning the Authority in any way but it is important that an organisation with such powers and responsibilities should be subject to independent investigation, especially in the event of an accident in which it might be either directly or indirectly involved.</P>
    <P>It is equally important that safety standards are not compromised by commercial considerations.  It is extremely important that the new Authority is a commercial body.  The public sector principle is admirable, but as we have seen the term &ldquo;public service&rdquo; has been used to fudge certain issues and subsidies have had to be provided for certain organisations. I fully support the Minister's decision to allow the Authority to act on a commercial basis.  The provision of services by the Authority to international airlines must be done on a fully commercial basis with competitive charges.  I understand that the ANSO charges are the lowest in Europe.  It is to be congratulated on this.  I am confident that the Authority will continue to provide a high quality service at keenly competitive prices.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1418" /> The basic building blocks of today's economy are capital, labour, technology and the state of the market, all of which are highly mobile.  This is nowhere more evident than in the aviation industry.  This mobility presents us with both threats and opportunities and it is up to the new Authority to focus in on the opportunities presented to it.  We are fortunate to have a young, highly skilled and educated workforce.  A combination of that work-force, seed capital and a commitment to top quality work with competitive pricing will enable us to lay the basis for fundamental and sound industries such as Shannon Aerospace, TEAM Aer Lingus and Shannon Turbine Technologies.</P>
    <P>The authority will have a role to play in ensuring that it focuses on the marketplace and achieves an equitable share of the market.  It is significant that more than 80 per cent of the revenue, which comes to £36 million, generated in the business comes from foreign airlines, and I understand that Aer Lingus and Ryanair account for less than 10 per cent of the overall revenue.</P>
    <P>New markets are emerging in Asia and Eastern Europe for specialised aviation consultancy.  There is no reason Ireland should not be a world leader in this potentially lucrative area of business.  I have no doubt that the new authority will be able to focus on ways of increasing its existing business.  We compliment the Air Navigation Service, whose dedicated team of specialist staff is committed to providing users with a high quality, cost effective service.  As this ability is recognised abroad it augurs well for a major expansion of consultancy sevices in the near future.</P>
    <P>It is important that as a Cork Deputy I draw attention to Cork airport.  In the ongoing discussion about Shannon and Dublin airports, Cork airport seems to have been forgotten.  Cork airport is an extremely successful and profitable enterprise.  It has to raise capital to fund its own physical development.  It also provides money from its own resources to market the airport and more importantly, it is run as a competitive and successful business.  The Government, quite rightly, <Col N="1419" /> in seeking ways to encourage regional development, is examining the development of airports in Farranfore and Waterford.  However, therein lies the dilemma for those working in Cork airport. If regional development means that some of the loss making traffic in and out of those airports is subvented it is quite reasonable for us to indicate that it will create major difficulties for Cork airport. It will be difficult for Cork airport to compete with a subsidised air service on its doorstep.  I understand the Government indicated that Cork airport will not be eligible for subvention for regional airports.  Will the Minister rethink that policy because of the difficulties it will create in Cork?</P>
    <P>On the question of winning greater market share, Cork has been the front runner in establishing markets from Holland and in more recent years from France.  Earlier I indicated the sums of money SFADCo has given to Shannon to increase passenger numbers through the airport.  That is laudable but we are not all playing on a level pitch because no such subsidies are available to Cork Airport.  As part of the process of increasing market share, Shannon has, in a predatory fashion, taken markets which Cork airport developed over the years with the result that tour operators who previously brought their business to Cork airport are now taking it to Shannon. When questioned, the tour operators specifically pointed out that Cork airport could no longer compete with the prices offered elsewhere.  Surely it makes bad economic sense that traffic already coming into the country should be earmarked for another airport, which is subvented to the tune of £15 million.  Instead of creating new markets they are taking our existing business.</P>
    <P>While SFADCo, Bord Fáilte, Aer Lingus and others were marketing Ireland this difficulty will arise.  Perhaps the time is right to focus on the establishment of one marketing authority for the aviation industry.</P>
    <P>Our approach to industrial development may not always have been as co-ordinated <Col N="1420" /> as it should have been.  Similarly, in selling ourselves abroad and bringing traffic into the country, I am not certain that co-ordinated structures are in place and that the available resources are processed in the most efficient manner.  As we are now looking at aviation policy and putting in place a new structure for Aer Lingus it is time to go the whole hog and look at this sector.</P>
    <P>This excellent Bill is very welcome. It shows a great deal of foresight and completes the process we are trying to bring about in aviation.  I wish the new authority every success in what it is trying to achieve.</P>

      <P>I have already had a meeting with the new Director General of GATT, Mr. Peter Sutherland.  In the course of that meeting, which was held on Wednesday last, 30 June, I outlined Ireland's well-established position on the current GATT round, in line with the statement agreed by all party leaders on 6 November 1992.  In particular I indicated our wish to see an early conclusion to the negotiations in view of their potential for boosting world trade and growth, while at the same time emphasising the need to address our concerns on agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should add that I took the opportunity of our meeting to congratulate Peter Sutherland on his appointment and to wish him well in what I am sure we can agree is a very difficult task in seeking <Col N="1421" /> to facilitate agreement by all the parties, including Ireland, involved in these highly complex negotiations.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think everybody is clearly aware of the possible consequences for Ireland of a 21 per cent reduction in volume in Irish exports that benefit from export refunds.

      <P>The question of a veto does not arise in relation to the GATT agreement itself, and the Deputy should be aware of that, but I will not speculate on the future direction of the talks.  We are all interested in seeing a GATT agreement put together and agreed on by all parties as soon as possible.  It is only right and proper to point out an aspect that could have serious consequences for Ireland.  Consequently, we would be failing in our duty if we did not point out something in the agricultural area that could have a disproportionate effect on the Irish economy.</P>

      <P>Regarding the statement of last November signed by all parties, does the Taoiseach recall that it also indicated the dire effect which no GATT agreement would have on developing countries?  I sought to have that included in that statement.  Will he indicate to the House what concerns he has raised with the French and others regarding the appalling prospect of there being no GATT agreement for countries like Ireland and the developed world and, more particularly, for the millions who are living in poverty in the underdeveloped world?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my hope, and the hope of all political leaders in this country, that we reach a GATT agreement, first, to assist the developing countries, as the Deputy rightly said, and, second, to give a boost to world trade and growth, because the Irish economy depends on world trade and growth.  We have to sell 70 per cent of what we produce abroad. Clearly, it is in our interest to have a GATT agreement.  At the same time it is only right and proper to point out an aspect of the agricultural side which could have serious consequences for Ireland; it could have a disproportionate effect. That matter may well be resolved within the EC and does not give rise to an Irish veto in relation to the GATT agreement.</P>

      <P>I have previously indicated to the House that my main concern has been the damage to community relationships that the controversies in relation to the siting of these interpretative centres have created and that all my efforts to date have been, and remain, the achievement of consensus and reconciliation.  In the light of the Supreme Court decision of 26 May 1993, the Government on 2 June 1993, instructed the Office of the Public Works to engage in the widest possible consultations with all interested parties before submission of any planning applications were made in respect of the proposed centres at Mullaghmore, Luggala and the Boyne Valley.  Any submissions received by me are forwarded to the Minister of State in charge of the Office of Public Works as part of the consultation process.</P>

      <P>At this stage it would be difficult to put on exact figure on the number of submissions received, but a great number have been received and the consultation process is ongoing.  I doubt if a day passes when submissions are not received from individuals and groups. Submissions sent directly to me are transferred to become part of the consultation process.</P>
      <P>My views in regard to the interpretative centres have been made known to the Government and my colleagues in Government are fully aware of them. Obviously, at the end of the consultation process I will have another opportunity of making my views known.</P>

      <P>I stated with sincerity that all my actions and observations to date have been aimed at the building of consensus and reconciliation.  My commitment to a wide consultation process in advance of the submission of planning permission was entirely geared towards that.  It would be wrong of me to interfere in the consultation process by vetting submissions and it would be equally wrong of me to prejudge the work of the consultation process.

      <P>I have no difficulty answering the Deputy's first supplementary question relating to the possibility of an overlap between the functions of the National Heritage Council and those of the special unit in my Department. I have indicated to the House that it is my intention to establish the National Heritage Council on a statutory basis. I have responsibility for other councils which were established on a statutory basis, such as the Arts Council, and it could not be argued that the existence of the Arts Council is threatened by the existence of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  I am responsible for going to Government and making a case for current and capital expenditure on the Arts in regard to Structural Funds. In other words, I define a general cultural policy, seek current and capital provision for it and those bodies operating under my autonomy but within the general framework of policy which I have stated is desirable.</P>
      <P>It is up to the National Heritage Council to comment on the controversies in this area and make a submission to the consultation process if it so wishes.  It has made its views known to me and it would be surprising if it did not forward its views and make them part of the consultation process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final part of the Deputy's question dealt with the transfer of staff from the Office of Public Works to the policy unit in my Department.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that questions of staffing in the public service are more appropriate to <Col N="1428" /> the Minister for Finance, but I am happy that with those valuable people &mdash; although not enough &mdash; I will be able to make a start on the valuable policy work which is necessary.</P>

      <P>My Department is, <Col N="1430" /> at present, finalising codes of broadcast advertising which I hope to introduce very shortly under the provisions of section 4 of the Broadcasting Act, 1990. The codes will, <i>inter alia,</i> give effect to advertising standards which are contained in Article 16 of the Council Directive 89/552 on transfrontier broadcasting activities.  The article provides that television advertising shall not cause moral or physical detriment to minors and prohibits directly exhorting minors to buy a product or service by exploiting their inexperience or credulity; encouraging minors to persuade their parents or others to purchase the goods or services being advertised; exploiting the special trust minors place in parents, teachers or other persons, and unreasonably showing minors in dangerous situations.</P>
      <P>I should also add that RTE's existing code of practice gives extensive guidelines on advertising and children which already take on board the provisions of the Directive.  The core element of the RTE guidelines is that no method of advertising may be employed which takes advantage of the natural credulity and sense of loyalty of children.</P>
      <P>The content of such advertising is a matter for the broadcasters to decide in the context of the codes mentined above. In my view these measures, particularly with the statutory backing of the codes which, as I said, I hope to introduce shortly, is sufficient to protect the vulnerability of viewers and to ensure a satisfactory degree of responsibility on the part of advertisers and broadcasters.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister conscious of the concern throughout Europe, the United States and Canada about TV advertising during children's viewing periods and the impact it can have from the point of view of diet and spending by getting at the soft end of the market and encouraging children to ask their parents to embark on spending sprees which, very often, they cannot afford?  In view of the reviews taking place worldwide does the Minister think it would now be advisable to look at the whole issue?</P>

      <P>I understand perfectly the import of the Deputy's question.  It is with these considerations in mind that I am now looking at the code in relation to standards.  The Deputy will appreciate that one of the consequences of the policies of those who argue uncritically and with disastrous effects for total deregulation in broadcasting is that citizens, including minors, are placed massively at risk in an area where it is important that we have forms of regulation which will enable the quality of broadcasting to be assured.  Broadcasting is not just another commodity.  I know the Deputy will see merit in the legislation I am preparing which does not accept that broadcasting is something that can be left to the free flow of market forces.  I see citizens as citizens in a communicative order rather than as target populations for commercial exploitation.</P>

Equally, I will have available to me a review of such complaints as have been made in relation to what are perceived by parents and other interested groups as abuses, and I certainly will bear that in mind.  I emphasise that, in the end, what I can do is bring forward the best codes possible but there is a responsibility of which I cannot divest broadcasters and advertisers.  They too have their responsibilities but I will certainly draw on the vast evidence available in bringing forward revised codes.</P>

      <P>I am not certain what <Col N="1436" /> the Deputy has in mind in this question but I would regard An Chomhairle Ealaíon as a <i>de facto</i> performing arts authority in that it allocates Government funds for the performing arts including drama, opera, dance and music.  An Chomhairle Ealaíon enjoys statutory independence in the exercise of its functions, and its decisions on support are based on the extent to which the qualities of excellence, access, innovation and participation inform the work of the individual or group.</P>

      <P>The performing arts sector is not deliberately neglected by the Arts Council; it is neglected because of its wide range of responsibilities. A performing arts authority or council would specifically address the areas to which the Minister referred.  Will the Minister consider establishing an authority or council which would have a particular relationship with the educational area and the development of performing arts in our schools?</P>

      <P>Discussions are ongoing with my colleague, the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, in relation to arts and education, particularly in the context of the preparation of the White Paper on Education.  It still remains my view that artistic activities must be moved from the periphery into the centrality of the school curriculum.</P>
      <P>Regarding Deputy McManus' query as to whether a separate authority should be established for the performing arts, one must question how wise it would be to remove the responsibility for the performing arts from the Arts Council. The best way to address the issue of the performing arts is through the school curriculum and policy to accommodate that can be considered.  The work of the Arts Council may also be considered.  I will be considering its work when I constitute the new Arts Council and the requirements of the performing arts will influence my decision in making what I hope will be the best appointments possible.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to be <Col N="1437" /> dogmatic in regard to how the Minister might seek to develop this area, but some means must be found to address the development, access to and funding for the performing arts as a specific area of concern and link it to the education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his deep interest in this area.  In making provision for the arts one must have regard not just for institutions but for the activity that comprises the arts, particularly the performing arts.  This point was made previously.  There are many places, including my city, in which there has been a burgeoning of artistic activity in recent years without institutional provision. One must question why provision was not made in the past for this activity.  We do not have to make that choice but, in preparing my submissions, for example, for the use of Structural Funds in the period 1994 to 1998, I have had regard to the considerations he mentions and with which I agree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>My final question relates to how funding is allocated in relation to the performing arts, particularly to the provision, for instance, of theatres in our smaller towns.  Many of these towns provide small theatres from their own resources but others are not in a position to do that.  This specific area must be addressed if we are serious about maintaining populations, particularly young people, in our towns.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not interfere with the allocations of the Arts Council as I respect their statutory independence from me.  I must fight for funding on their behalf in a capital and current way and provide them with an overall cultural policy.  I intend to ensure that in the use of Structural Funds there will be an adequate share for cultural activities.  In the course of examining that I will consider where there is a shortfall in facilities. I agree that if access is to be meaningful it is unacceptable that large areas of the country are underfunded.  I have certainly borne that in mind in the plans to which I referred.</P>

      <P>I am aware of those who travelled from Cork and their representations have already been brought to my attention by many Deputies.  I am very interested in their case.  However, I make a distinction I have already made between matters of broadcasting and matters of transmission.  If one uses the words &ldquo;community broadcasting&rdquo;, the word &ldquo;community&rdquo; is very important.  So far I have tried, through Teilifís na Gaeilge, for example, to address the issue of television community broadcasting.  In promoting small companies who make and sell independent television productions to the national system I have recognised what can take place in this area.  There is a distinction between the total product of such people, however, and a broadcast being retransmitted.  I am well aware of the sensitivities of the <Col N="1440" /> people of Cork but I stress that I will concentrate on community broadcasting in its best sense and I will certainly bear in mind their feelings in this regard.  If we are to have community television let us have it in its real sense.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not accept that in Cork last February, five months ago, he gave a commitment in relation to this controversy that he would conduct an extensive and thorough review of community television policy? In that context, does he not accept that five months later no such review has taken place, that in fact those involved in community television are having their television transmission disconnected or, alternatively, threatened with legal proceedings? As my colleague, Deputy Bradford, already stated they are now being forced to parade outside the gates of this institution in an attempt to have their voice heard.  What is the Minister's response to that outrageous situation and what seems to be a blatant Pontius Pilate act on his part in that he has done nothing to comply with the commitment given by him in Cork last February?</P>

      <P>I am disappointed Deputy O'Keeffe &mdash; with his experience &mdash; should resort to language of this kind. I suspect also that he knows very well the situation in this regard.  Does the Deputy want me to interfere in the legal process? With his legal background I am sure he would not suggest such a thing but populism and taking advantage of it is something people cannot resist.  The people of west Cork have a genuine grievance in that they want to make a case for community television.  There is a distinction between transmission and the legal code that goes with it.  People in this House should be able to draw the distinction between reviewing the needs of community broadcasting and television and honourably providing a genuine community television regime to communities. There is a distinction between that and requiring someone to rush like a bull in a china shop into something that is quite complicated, as the Deputy seems to suggest, <Col N="1441" /> but who perhaps has experience in such a strategy.</P>

To enable this service to go <Col N="1442" /> back on the air it would be necessary to address the legal issues of transmission, which are a matter for my colleague in Government.  I am discussing these matters with the Minister concerned, but I think the Deputy will appreciate that it is not a matter of the Minister with responsibility for broadcasting making a statement and ignoring the legal requirements of transmission.  I know what is required by those seeking community television.  I hope the structures that will be put in place in the broadcasting legislation will enable genuine community television to emerge.  We have the capacity to provide community television that is of the community and from the community, not a service that is retransmitted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received proposals from the trustees of the Chester Beatty Library for the resiting of the library's collections at the Clock Tower Building, Dublin Castle.  These proposals are under consideration at present in the context of the complex legal relationship between the trustees of the Library and the State that currently exists under the terms of the <Col N="1443" /> will of the late Sir Alfred Chester Beatty bequeathing his collection and library buildings in trust for the benefit of the public.  It would be premature at this stage to offer any indication of the outcome of such deliberations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Complexities arise not just on questions of cost but also in terms of the structure of the bequest and its management in the will of Sir Alfred Chester Beatty.  A working party established last year to examine the position and put forward recommendations, chaired by Dr. T. P. Hardiman and consisting of representatives of the Department of the Taoiseach and of the Office of Public Works among others, considered a number of possible locations and concluded that the best option of housing the collection was in the Clock Tower, Dublin Castle.  There are a number of advantages in such a site.  It would provide for the greatest possible accessibility of the collection and it would also fit in with the locality.  If the building was refurbished this would be very appropriate usage for it.  There are many merits in locating the library in this building and talks are taking place on the matter.  I received a recent request for a meeting with the chairman of the trustees, Mr. justice Brian Walsh, and I hope to proceed on the basis of the working group's report.  However, there are difficulties to be ironed out.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister indicate the nature of the legal obstacles that exist and if those obstacles would exist were any of the other options identified by the working group selected?  In relation to the Minister's reference to cost as being a possible obstacle, is a bottom line figure being sought by the <Col N="1444" /> Government from the trustees in relation to supporting relocation in the Castle or elsewhere?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We should use the opportunity to find an appropriate and good home for the collection where it would be accessible to the largest number of people.  The talks should be used to iron out any difficulties that may arise &mdash;&ldquo;difficulties&rdquo; is the wrong word to use, rather they are complexities.  The bequest is complex in terms of the collection and the building.  I do not believe the complexities are insuperable, but they need respect.  The working party made a very convincing case for a good location.  We have not reached a cut-off point at which we would cease discussing the desirability of this location.  I hope to take advantage of the talks to make further progress in this matter.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the development and operation of the public library service rests in the first instance with the relevant local authorities.  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, deals with public library matters at central level.  As I said when discussing my Department's Estimates for the current year with the Select Committee on Social Affairs on 21 May, I feel that public libraries are of great importance and I am considering what steps could be taken to increase my Department's involvement with this important sector of our cultural life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister acknowledge that the public library service has been starved of funds, particularly in the last ten years, and that it is now evident that library development is no longer a priority for the Department of the Environment and local authorities? In those circumstances would the Minister not consider taking the bold step of bringing the public library service under the ambit of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, which is the appropriate Department to deal with this matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Quill for her usual generosity and her high esteem of my Department.  However, such bold steps of extending that for which I am responsible would have to be negotiated with Cabinet.  I am not happy with present library funding.  I am particularly unhappy that stocks of children's books have fallen.  I am having discussions in regard to my involvement in this matter.  It may not be necessary to seek changes which would transfer functions from one Department to the other. Maybe I will be able to make some progress through the Library Council.  I share the Deputy's concern about the importance of libraries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that local authorities, Kildare for instance, have not given as much as one brown penny to the book fund in the past three years and that in a number of local authority areas it has been run into the ground?  As the Minister rightly acknowledges, in many cases, the children's book fund has been particularly neglected.  In the light of that, will he consider bringing forward a Green Paper or a discussion document on the library services to open up the debate so that we can see how best the whole matter may be addressed in the light of emerging circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The preparation of a Green Paper is not my function as responsibility for the library service rests with another Department.  However, I am pleased to tell the Deputy that during the Danish Presidency, the Danish Ministry of Culture launched a European campaign in Copenhagen on 23 April 1993 in relation to books and reading, which will go on until September 1994.  It is planned to launch the Irish section of this campaign in the autumn and the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has already met a number of organisations concerned.  Perhaps when we launch the campaign in favour of books and reading this autumn it will be an opportunity for making the case for the value of reading, and the importance of books and public libraries.  I hope the <Col N="1447" /> publicity that will attach to this campaign on which my Department has already approached many different organisations such as the Irish Writers' Union, publishers, the National Library and so on will be an opportunity to draw public attention to and impress on public representatives the importance of ensuring that in the preparation of Estimates there is special provision this year for libraries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly raise with the Minister for the Environment the issue of reviewing the present position in relation to libraries and I have had preliminary discussions with the Minister for Education because libraries in schools are also very important.  In the campaign for which I will have responsibility in the autumn, I will invite all those with responsibility for libraries to use that opportunity.  The campaign goes on in Europe until 1994 so although television is not in competition with book reading, in a televisual age it is appropriate to look at the value of books and reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that libraries not only have a relationship with the Department of the Environment but that there is a distinct role for them in the educational sphere? Rather than taking the libraries from local authorities, with which I disagree, some structure should be found for ensuring that the multifaceted aspects of libraries &mdash; educational and literacy areas and the need for study areas in urban areas and so on &mdash; are catered for.  We need a structure to deal with all these facets of libraries rather than simply taking it under one Ministry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is merit to this. What is involved is how we envisage the library service.  The history of the library <Col N="1448" /> movement is closely associated with the development of democracy.  The library movement in Britain in the last century and earlier was associated with the extension of the right to read, the right to participate and the right to vote.  It is one of the most powerful butresses of popular participation.  That is its history.  It is now in a new phase and obviously it must be clear that people of all ages should have access to a good library service.  The location of libraries and branches of libraries in communities should be seen as part of the cultural infrastructure.  It really is a matter of trying to make adequate provision for them, of making them accessible and flexible so that they can deal with the new situation.  That is perhaps more important than where they are located.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure the Minister is aware that despite the fact the book fund might be starved in Kildare, the libraries in Kildare were well and truly established long ago as cultural and artistic centres by virtue of the activities of a number of librarians.  In view of this, will the Minister have due regard to the need to allow the libraries to compete adequately with modern technology in terms of television, computers, videos and so on?  Will the Minister contact his ministerial colleagues with a view to ensuring that the library service is allowed to compete?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that the House has such confidence in my influence over my colleagues.  I will certainly make that case.  One of the ways of ensuring there is no conflict between new forms of technology is to enable tapes &mdash; as well as books and videos &mdash; to be available.  In that way the aural, visual and so on will not be in competition. As to the comments on Kildare's provision, all I can say is that Deputy Durkan should remember that like the Skibbereen eagle, Deputy Quill has her eye on him and will no doubt be watching Kildare's provision at the end of the year.</P>

Caithfidh mé glacadh leis go bhfuil go leor ceantar sna limistéir oifigiúla Ghaeltachta gur beag Gaeilge atá á labhairt iontu.  Ní féidir na dreamanna nó na teaghlaigh atá ag labhairt Gaeilge a chur go taobh amháin de cheantar ar bith agus na daoine nach bhfuil Gaeilge acu a chur go dtí taobh eile.  Má tá Gaeilge ag furmhór na ndaoine tá ceart acu bheith taobh istigh den Ghaeltacht.  Ach b'fhéidir gur chóir athbhreithniú ginearálta a dhéanamh ar na limistéir Ghaeltachta.  Fiú amháin cuireadh Rath Cairn agus Baile Ghib i gContae na Mí isteach sa Ghaeltacht sa bhliain 1967 agus in a dhiaidh sin limistéir bhreise i gContae Chorcaí agus i gContae Phortlairge i 1974 agus sa bhliain 1982 cuireadh limistéir eile i gContae Chorcaí agus i gContae na Mí isteach inti.  Is cinnte go bhfuil eolas i bhfad níos fearr ag an Teachta Molloy ar chathair na Gaillimhe agus an gceantar sin ná mar atá agamsa.  Beidh mé ag plé na ceiste seo leis an Aire agus le oifigigh na Roinne. Beimid sásta na ceisteanna faoi na ceantair sin nach bhfuil Gaeilge ag furmhór na ndaoine iontu, a phlé go luath amach anseo.</P>

Níl mé ag labhairt faoi chathair na Gaillimhe anois.  Tá mé ag labhairt faoi na ceantair Ghaeltachta ar fud na tíre ar fad.

Chuir an imirce agus an dífhostaíocht, ar ndóigh, isteach ar an nGaeltacht agus ar phobail na nGaeltachtaí tríd an tír go léir.

      <P>Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna 14, 30 agus 119 le chéile.</P>
      <P>The question of loaning State artefacts from the national collections is primarily one for the national cultural institutions. Before any such loan can be made the host institution must satisfy the highest standards of security, curation and environmental controls.  In the case of the National Museum of Ireland, a further stipulation is that a museum be established as a county or city museum and operated by a local authority.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that institutions such as the National Museum and the National Gallery do make exhibits available to suitable institutions from time to time but such loans are made strictly in accordance with the criteria I have outlined.  I fully support this policy of prudent management which is designed to ensure the widest possible access to our heritage consistent with the integrity and safety of the national collections.</P>
      <P>The concerns raised by Deputy Sargent will be addressed by me in the process of policy formulation which I am undertaking at present in this area.  As I announced earlier, I am proceeding with my review of museums policy.</P>

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos, ceapaim gur féidir cás a dhéanamh i bhfábhar na n-institiúidí éagsúla as a n-inniúlacht. Fiú amháin má fhágtar nithe conspóideacha as an áireamh, tá cás le déanamh ar son caiteachas a chur isteach chun riarachán agus eagar ceart agus eagrais chuí a chur ar fáil do na hiarsmalanna, na gailearaithe náisiúnta agus na hinstitiúidí eile.  Glacaim leis, mura mbeadh an cheist eile san áireamh, agus dá mba rud é go raibh airgead ar fáil d'fhéadfaí an cheist a phlé cén chaoi ab fhearr é a chaitheamh.</P>
      <P>Mar a luaigh mé sa fhreagra &mdash; agus fáiltím roimh an cheist &mdash; tá iarsmaí ar iasacht do na contaetha éagsúla: mar shampla, tá artefacts ar iasacht faoi láthair ag Fear Manach, Ciarraí, Tiobraid Árann theas, Leitir Ceanainn i nDún na nGall, Corcaigh, Muineachán, Loch Garman agus Luimneach.  Is féidir liom samplaí a thabhairt maidir leis an Ghailearrí Náisiúnta.  Tá 359 bpictiúr ar iasacht ag gailearaithe agus áiteanna eile ina gcomhlíontar na coinníollacha a luaigh mé.  Déanfaidh mé mo dhícheall an cinneadh is fearr a dhéanamh ó thaobh an todhchaí de maidir le struchtúir na n-institiúidí éagsúla agus, i leith aon airgid bhreise, bheinn ag súil le cás a dhéanamh chun cúrsaí ealaíne, cultúir agus Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn.</P>

      <P>Despite what he has said will the Minister acknowledge that there is a large number of works of art hidden behind closed doors in attics and so on? This should not be allowed to continue. It is not just a question of providing more money; a change of attitude is required <Col N="1456" /> in some cases where works of art could be exhibited in public buildings such as libraries, etc. in provincial towns and other cities.</P>

I favour going in the direction suggested by the Deputy in a flexible way. This is why we need policies.  We cannot scatter the national collection all over the country all of the time but we should certainly share it &mdash; it is part of our heritage. We must do this in a safe way.</P>
      <P>The Deputy correctly asked why more works of art were not displayed in public buildings.  I would ask an equally good question: how can so much money be spent on public institutions of all kinds, for example, hospitals, without any provision for works of art?  The Deputy will agree that there is great importance attached to the 1 per cent scheme.  I would like to think that people who are not bound by the 1 per cent scheme would look seriously at public buildings to see if they could meet the criteria and seek loans to develop them or, more important, encourage local artists to take advantage of the opportunities which exist. This would also give us an indication that the local authorities are taking seriously the commitment which is very real in my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The object of this Bill can be simply stated.  It is to give spouses equal rights in the ownership of the matrimonial home.</P>
      <P>The Bill is one of the measures included in the major programme of family law reform to which the Government is committed and which will culminate in the referendum on divorce to be held next year.  However, the fact that it is one of the milestones on the way to the attainment of that objective does not mean it is not fully justified on its own merits.  It is high time for such a measure to be on the Statute Book and for the equal status of women in marriage to be explicitly recognised by the law.</P>
      <P>While the objective of the Bill can be simply stated, the achievement of that objective has proved far from simple. Indeed several Governments have concerned themselves with it over the years in the course of which various proposals were put forward and abandoned, for one good reason or another.  Consideration of the proposals involved consultation from time to time with conveyancing counsel, the conveyancing committee of the Law Society, the Land Registry and the Attorney General to ensure that joint ownership could be satisfactorily secured without damaging the marketability of house property.  An additional factor was the need to await the outcome of litigation before the High Court and Supreme Court to determine whether a wife's contribution through her work in the home entitled her to a share in its ownership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mention this background to the Bill to make the point that the creation of joint ownership in family homes has been the concern of successive Governments over a long period and that, therefore, I have no doubt that the principle of the <Col N="1553" /> present Bill will enjoy support from all sides of the House.  I wish to pay tribute to the very considerable work done on this measure in the past by quite a number of Ministers for Justice, many officials of the Department of Justice and of the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>As the law stands, where the matrimonial home is in the legal ownership of one spouse, the other spouse may acquire an equitable share in its ownership through direct monetary contributions made towards its purchase.  Where the contributions have been indirect &mdash; such as contributions to the general expenditure of the family &mdash; the contributing spouse will generally acquire a share in the ownership of the home in the absence of agreement to the contrary.  No share in the ownership is earned by non-pecuniary contributions, such as looking after the house and family.  This position was confirmed by the Supreme Court in the case of L v. L (1992) <i>Irish Law Reports Monthly</i> page 115.</P>
    <P>Since the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, came into force &mdash; it did not apply in the L v. L case &mdash; the courts have wide powers to make orders in respect of property on the granting of a decree of judicial separation. They can take into account the contributions of a spouse in looking after the home and family by granting the spouse an interest in the ownership of the home. The earlier Family Home Protection Act, 1976, ensured that one spouse cannot sell a family home without the written consent of the other but it gives ownership rights only in very exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>The key provision of the Bill is section 4, which confers a joint interest in a matrimonial home on both spouses. Before I come to that section it is useful to refer to what constitutes a matrimonial home for the purposes of the Bill.  I say that because it is necessary to distinguish it from a &ldquo;family home&rdquo; under the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, and because the definition is of significance where the home is part of a larger entity operated for commercial purposes, such as a farm or business premises.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1554" /> To constitute a matrimonial home, the dwelling concerned must be one in which a married couple is ordinarily resident when the Act comes into force &mdash; that is, six months after the Bill is enacted &mdash; or at any time afterwards.  Couples who are living apart at present will not be affected by the Bill.  Property adjustments between couples following judicial separation will remain governed by the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, and will not be affected by the Bill.  Moreover, when a matrimonial home has come into existence it remains a matrimonial home, even after the couple have gone to live elsewhere, and the equal entitlement of the spouses to its ownership is preserved until it has been sold or otherwise disposed of.  In this respect it differs from the &ldquo;family home&rdquo; of the 1976 Act, which normally exists only during the continued residence of both spouses.</P>
    <P>The definition of matrimonial home is of particular significance where the home is part of a commercial entity, say where it is a farmhouse or a flat over a shop. For these situations the scope of the definition has been widened to include any rights attached to the home and exercisable over other land and premises, such as a right of access to water, a right of way, a right to use a common stairway and so on.  Any further rights of this kind that may be necessary when joint ownership is created are provided for in section 4 (5).  Mobile homes are excluded from the definition of matrimonial home. This is because the technical provisions relating to ownership interests in land are not appropriate to structures not permanently attached to land such as mobile homes, vehicles, houseboats and so on. Separate provision for equal ownership of these homes is made in section 11.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is the key provision of the Bill.  It confers on both spouses a joint tenancy in the matrimonial home, whether they are living in it when the Act enters into force or whether the home comes into existence subsequently.  This statutory joint tenancy will apply to all interests in matrimonial homes, except interests held by people in their capacity <Col N="1555" /> as trustees and by those who are mere licensees, as well as interests under temporary convenience lettings and lettings made for the duration of a person's employment.  The reason for these exclusions are clear.  The section applies whether the interests are legal or equitable, or freehold or leasehold.  In particular, interests under a tenancy agreement, such as a lease for a fixed term or a weekly or monthly tenancy, are included.  A matrimonial home in a dwelling held from a local authority under a weekly tenancy is as much a matrimonial home as one held in fee simple and is as much entitled to be treated as such in this legislation.  I mentioned that one of the earlier proposals in this context was to convey the legal interest in a matrimonial home to both spouses.  This proposal was not proceeded with on the basis of advice received as to the difficulties which could arise for a potential bona fide purchaser for value without notice and the difficulties it could cause for conveyancers. The interest to be vested in both spouses by the Bill is, therefore, an equitable interest, that is, the real, beneficial interest in the matrimonial home concerned.</P>
    <P>If a spouse is the legal owner of the matrimonial home and named as such in the title deeds, the effect of section 4 will be to vest an equitable joint tenancy of the home in both spouses and leave only a bare legal estate vested in what I may call the owner spouse.  That nominal interest will continue until such time as he or she takes steps to have both spouses registered as full co-owners under section 8 or until his or her executor or administrator conveys it to the surviving spouse under section 9 (5) or 10 (6).  Of course, in very many cases &mdash; for example, where homes are subject to a mortgage &mdash; the legal owner of the home is the mortgagee, not the spouse, whose interest is an equitable interest until the mortgage is paid.</P>
    <P>The example I have given is typical of the urban residential situation where the matrimonial home comprises a house and garden.  There is immediate access to the <Col N="1556" /> public road and no question of, or need for, rights over other land or premises. It is a different story where the couple live on a farm or in a flat over a shop.  In the case of a farm, the Bill will apply only to the farmhouse and to any garden and other land that is subsidiary or ancilliary to it, together with any existing rights that are attached to the farmhouse and exercisable over other land.  When the statutory joint tenancy is created by this section it may be necessary to give additional rights over the farm if those further rights are needed for the beneficial use, occupation and enjoyment of the home.  The situation I have in mind is where a farm is owned by one of the spouses before the Act comes into operation, either as sole owner or jointly or in common with another person.  That spouse, as owner, has of course rights of access to the whole of the farm, but those rights are vested in the spouse personally and are not attached to the farmhouse itself.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, then, to ensure that when the joint tenancy vests in both spouses under the section, the spouse who benefits from the operation of section 4 will not only continue to enjoy whatever rights and easements over other land may already be attached to the farmhouse, but also any other such rights over the farm as the spouse who was the owner had and which are essential for the beneficial use and enjoyment of the matrimonial home.  This probably would not matter a great deal while the farm itself remains in the ownership, or shared ownership, of one of the spouses; but it could be of the greatest significance if the ownership of the farm were to change hands.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it is also necessary to preserve any existing rights that may be exercisable over the farmhouse portion in favour of other land.  For example, the water supply for the farm may be located on land close to the farmhouse and which is part of the matrimonial home.  Section 4 (6) makes provision for preserving these existing rights and conferring any additional rights needed for the use and enjoyment of the other land. <Col N="1557" /> What I have said about farms applies also to any premises which are used partly for business and partly for residential purposes.  In these cases the matrimonial home will be the residential portion of the premises, together with any garden or other land usually occupied with it. Any existing rights of access to, say, a common stairway or entrance are being preserved under the section and any additional such rights over the premises as may be necessary for the use and enjoyment of the dwelling are being provided.</P>
    <P>If any question should arise as to what land is or was comprised in a matrimonial home, or any question about the existence or extent of any rights or easements over other land, it will be determined by the court under section 18.  I do not consider that the need for a court determination will arise frequently.  It is most likely to arise either where the farm or business portion is being sold or where the spouse who originally owned the farm or business has died and the surviving spouse is succeeding only to the matrimonial home portion of the farm or business premises.  The case where the farm proper, and not the farmhouse, is being sold seems to me to be more likely to occur where separation proceedings are in progress and property adjustment orders have been made by the court concerned. That case is already fully catered for under the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act.</P>
    <P>Where the question of segregating the matrimonial home from the farm arises on the death of a spouse, recourse to the court will be necessary only where agreement cannot be reached on delimiting the area of the home and the rights attached to it or exercisable over it.  There should be no difficulty in pinpointing any existing rights.  So far as any additional rights are concerned, the formula employed in section 4 (5) for establishing those rights gives clear enough guidance to the parties concerned.  It defines the additional rights as those that &ldquo;are necessary for the reasonable, beneficial use, occupation and enjoyment of the home&rdquo; provided that, where the farm was owned <Col N="1558" /> by the deceased spouse and another person, those rights do not materially prejudice the use, development or amenity of the farm.</P>
    <P>I should now like to mention the exclusions from the application of the joint ownership conferred by section 4. These are contained in sections 5, 6 and 7. I think the House will agree that spouses should be free to decide between themselves what the nature of the ownership of the matrimonial home should be.  For example, the home may already be owned by them as joint tenants or as tenants in common in equal shares.  There would be no point in applying a statutory joint tenancy to an existing joint tenancy and very little point in imposing it on a tenancy in common in equal shares.  It is true that in the case of a tenancy in common the surviving spouse does not obtain full ownership on the death of the other spouse automatically whereas in the case of a joint tenancy the surviving spouse does.  But it is nevertheless equal ownership and section 5 excludes both it and any existing joint tenancy from the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is a further recognition of the principle that spouses should be free to regulate the ownership of the family home as they see fit.  It enables them to contract out of the statutory joint tenancy at any time.  For instance, spouses may contract our during the six months between the passing of the Act and its coming into operation, so that section 4 never applies to the home; or they may do so after the statutory joint tenancy ownership has come into being.  Couples intending to marry may also contract out. The section also allows spouses to annul the contracting out agreement, in which case section 4 will apply and the home will vest or revest, as the case may be, in both spouses.  The section requires that any contracting out agreement must be in writing.  In addition, I shall specify in regulations the form of such an agreement and require that it must be in that form or in a form to the like effect.</P>
    <P>The two categories of exclusions I have mentioned concern spouses who have agreed on the ownership of their matrimonial <Col N="1559" /> home.  Section 6 is aimed at a sitution where joint ownership has been established by virtue of section 4 but where a court is satisfied that it would be unjust for the spouse who has benefited from the statutory joint tenancy to continue to do so.  The section can only be invoked in the particular circumstances of the spouses concerned, with special reference to any unreasonable conduct of the spouse benefiting from the joint tenancy or to any unreasonable failure on that spouse's part to contribute to expenditure on the home or to any unjust enrichment of that spouse resulting from acquisition of the joint tenancy.  An application to exclude the joint tenancy may be made by a spouse during the lifetime of both spouses or, where one of the spouses has died, by his or her legal personal representative or by or on behalf of one of the children.</P>
    <P>I believe that it is necessary to have a provision of this kind to avoid any cases where, by reason of the conduct or relative financial situation of the spouse who benefits from the acquisition of the statutory joint tenancy, it would be manifestly unjust to the other spouse or, as the case may be, to the children of a deceased spouse, to allow the statutory joint tenancy to stand.  An application to exclude section 4 cannot be granted lightly.  The court is specifically precluded from granting it unless it has had regard to the circumstances of both spouses, but an overriding consideration is that the court must be satisfied that it would be unjust not to grant it.  I do not believe that there will be many applications under this section but it is necessary to provide for those hopefully rare situations where it would be unjust to the other spouse and the rest of the family to allow the statutory joint tenancy to prevail.</P>
    <P>Section 8 is the last of the sections relating to the vesting of the equal ownership in the matrimonial home.  That vesting takes place by virtue of section 4 and no further action is necessary on the part of either spouse.  The existence of the joint tenancy in a particular case can be evidenced by the fact that the couple concerned <Col N="1560" /> are living in the home and that they did not agree to contract out of the Act, but obviously there is everything to be said for formalising the joint ownership. Section 8 provides a procedure for enabling this to be done.  If the home is registered in the Land Registry, both spouses can apply to be registered as owners.  If it is not registered there, the spouse whose name is on the title deeds can make a declaration that the interest has vested in both spouses and have a certified copy registered in the Registry of Deeds.  When registration has taken place in the Land Registry or the declaration has been made, any legal interest of that spouse &mdash; this would be a nominal interest &mdash; will also vest in both spouses jointly.  Hopefully, most spouses will take steps to have the joint tenancy formally registered and I urge them to do so.  By virtue of section 14 of the Family Home Protection Act no stamp duty, land registration fee or Registry of Deeds fee is payable on registration.  If a spouse, on request, fails or refuses to proceed with registration of the joint tenancy, the other spouse can get a court order requiring him or her to comply with that request.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the provisions dealing with the vesting of the joint ownership of what I may call conventional matrimonial homes, I should mention section 11, which provides for a similar vesting in relation to homes not permanently attached to the ground, such as mobile homes, caravans, houseboats, and so on. These home require somewhat different treatment as the legal principles relevant to interests in land are not applicable to them.</P>
    <P>I now turn to a matter that has received most detailed consideration during the preparation of the Bill.  I refer to the need to achieve a balance between, on the one hand, safeguarding the interest of a spouse who has acquired joint ownership in the matrimonial home under this Bill and, on the other, keeping any additional conveyancing requirements and expenses to a minimum and safeguarding bona fide purchasers for full value who are without notice of the existence of a matrimonial <Col N="1561" /> home.  That necessary balance is sought to be achieved &mdash; and I believe has been achieved &mdash; by sections 9, 10 and 12. Section 9 spells out the circumstances in which a purchaser can get a good title to the joint tenancy interest in a matrimonial home in which both spouses are residing, that is, a title freed of the interest of the spouse in whose favour section 4 has operated.  The purchaser can do so where the interest is conveyed by both spouses.  Clearly in that case the interest of the benefiting spouse is fully protected.  A good title will also be passed where the purchase is from only one of the spouses but in that situation the purchase has to be bona fide for full value and the purchaser has to be without notice of the fact that the home is a matrimonial home.  In other words, that fact must not have emerged even after such inquiries and inspections as might reasonably have been made.  There is one other situation where a purchaser will get a good title.  That is where the original purchaser's title is defective &mdash; say because the purchase was not from both spouses or, perhaps, because full value was not given when buying from one of the spouses &mdash; but where a subsequent purchase is for full value and the subsequent purchaser, or his or her agent, does not have actual knowledge that the home is a matrimonial home.</P>
    <P>The effect of these provisions is to oblige purchasers to be vigilant to ensure that the interests of the spouse in whose favour section 4 has operated are protected. Where one of the spouses has sold the home, the other spouse's rights against the purchase money are protected, even where the purchaser, or a subsequent purchaser, may have a good title.  The relevant provisions are contained in subsection (4) of section 9 and in section 19.  If the purchaser does not get a good title, the property in his or her hands will be subject to 50 per cent of the beneficial ownership attributable to the share of the spouse who has benefited under the Act.  Of course purchasers will need to obtain the consent of the spouse who is not recorded as owner in the title deeds because the home is also a family <Col N="1562" /> home for the purposes of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976.  Otherwise the transaction is void.  Under the 1976 Act that spouse may also register in the Land Registry or Registry of Deeds a notice that he or she is married to the registered owner of the matrimonial home so that purchasers will have official notice of the existence of the marriage.  In fact, the effect of the various provisions is that purchasers will have every incentive to insist on both spouses joining in the conveyance of the matrimonial home. That is as it should be.</P>
    <P>Section 10 makes special provision for the disposal of a matrimonial home in which the couple have ceased to reside and where the joint ownership has not been formally registered in the Land Registry or the Registry of Deeds.  The couple may be anxious to complete the sale quickly to finance the purchase of the new home or it may be that some years have passed since the couple have lived in the home and the fact that it was a matrimonial home may not be apparent to intending purchasers.  To facilitate conveyancing, the section constitutes the &ldquo;legal&rdquo; owner as a trustee for sale of the home.  By virtue of this provision, which is expressed in very technical language, the purchaser will have a title freed of the interest of the other spouse.  The trustee spouse is of course accountable to the other spouse for that spouse's share of the proceeds of sale of the home.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions relating to the conveyancing aspects of the Bill are contained in section 12.  That section confers a degree of certainty on the title of a purchaser of a matrimonial home from one of the spouses when six years have elapsed from the date of the conveyance, provided that the spouse in whose favour section 4 is not then in occupation.  Even after the time limit has expired, that spouse retains his or her right of recourse against the purchase money.  A somewhat analogous limitation period for the purposes of the Family Home Protection Act is provided in section 24.</P>
    <P>A great deal of effort has gone into achieving a reasonable balance between safeguarding the interests of the spouses <Col N="1563" /> who benefit under the Bill and protecting the marketability of property.  I believe that we have been successful but I have invited the conveyancing committee of the Law Society for its views on this aspect and I will give careful consideration to those views between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>These are the main provisions of the Bill.  I do not think it necessary to comment on the remainder except to say that under section 15 joint ownership will extend to household chattels as well as to matrimonial homes and also to draw attention to the jurisdiction given by section 22 to the District Court in proceedings under this Bill.  It is essential that the costs of any court actions under this Bill should not deprive spouses benefiting from access to the courts to protect their rights.  The District Court is already dealing with difficult questions of family law, including child custody.  As far as questions of title to property are concerned, district judges, who for the most part are solicitors, have spent their lives as practitioners dealing with such matters and should be fully competent to adjudicate on them.</P>
    <P>This Bill is based on the view that marriage is a partnership which each spouse has an equal role and interest in promoting, enhancing and safeguarding. It gives statutory recognition to the contribution that each partner to a marriage can and does make towards the maintenance of the family unit.  It is in accordance with the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of Women. While I know that the Bill is acceptable in principle, I am conscious it is breaking new ground and that, therefore, it will need detailed consideration on Committee Stage.  I assure Deputies that I will be open to any suggestions they may make for its improvement either during the present debate or by way of amendment later.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Fine Gael I warmly welcome the Bill.  We support it and we will be tabling amendments, as <Col N="1564" /> the Minister expected.  We welcome and support this Bill because, at least, it will give the long promised, long awaited equal rights of ownership in the matrimonial home and effects to both spouses. It also allows for the opting out from these entitlements, following legal advice.  It is a welcome measure for women in particular who make up the great majority of dependent spouses but will also be welcomed by the small but increasing number of house husbands.  It builds on the limited protection previously afforded to dependent spouses by the Family Home Protection Act.</P>
      <P>The Bill claims not to affect the existing power of the court to divide matrimonial property when granting a decree of judicial separation.  This is an important issue and one on which I ask the Minister to reassure us when replying to Second Stage.  The Minister must clarify whether it would have been desirable to put a clear statement in the Bill indicating that the powers now available to the courts, under that legislation, in the context of decisions on property at the time of the break up will not be radically altered by this provision.</P>
      <P>The legislation is long overdue.  One of the earliest written recommendations I can find is in the First Commission on the Status of Women in 1970.  In 1983 the then Government announced its decision in principle to implement reforms along these lines.  Regrettably, 20 years later the Second Commission on the Status of Women had to declare that the legislation was still on a waiting list and, therefore, I compliment the Minister for finally bringing it before the House.  It is interesting to note that the Second Commission sees this as a first step in providing a suitable regime of marital property in order to eliminate inequality in the traditional marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals in this Bill are a major step towards altering the present system of separate properties which is the basis of most of our marital property law.  The report on the Second Commission on the Status of Women referred to Paul O'Connor's <i>Key Issues in Family Law.</i> He stated that, &ldquo;such change would be <Col N="1565" /> in no way inimical to marriage founded on the true equality of the spouses&rdquo;.  He points to a rather sad irony which occurs in the writings of many commentators on this issue and states that, &ldquo;As it is, there is already compulsory sharing at death&rdquo; but it is unfortunate that until now women had to wait for death before receiving a clear statement of their rights. I am sure we all agree that death should not be the only terminating issue that triggers the sharing of property and, thankfully, this legislation will improve that position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Even death did not mean equal sharing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>At least it provided a right of some sort.</P>
      <P>Laws on property and succession rights involve a blend of individual family and social values.  Those are complex issues with which, the Minister correctly stated, we should deal in detail.  I am glad the Minister indicated his willingness not to rush this Bill through the House because it deals with an important matter.  I take it this Bill will be dealt with in Committee next week.  There is talk of the Dáil meeting later this month to finalise Bills that have gone through Committee, but perhaps we could wait until the autumn to take Report Stage of this Bill so that all matters are teased out properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From time to time wide differences in policy have been recorded in society and the changes proposed today are part of that ever-changing social reality.  Until the last century a woman's property, and indeed all marital property, was deemed to belong to her husband.  Over the decades this gradually developed to allow for a regime of separate property, which was at the time a move towards a recognition of women's rights.  It is now time for a new phase in that development which will allow women an automatic share in some matrimonial property. Some of us might regret that the Bill does not go further, but at least it is a step in the right direction,.  The Second Commission on the Status of Women sought a full regime of community property in <Col N="1566" /> marriage and I am sure that matter will remain on the agenda.</P>
    <P>In doing what we are doing today we, as legislators, are acting to remove some of the low self-esteem often felt by the wife and mother at home and the lack of appreciation for all she does.  The report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women states that the wife working in the home is entitled to a share in the family home and the family income instead of being maintained as a dependant and as somebody whose esteem depends on the goodwill of the other spouse.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael seeks assurances from the Minister that this Bill is fully constitutional, an issue which has been raised outside this House.  While the fears raised may be groundless it is important that the Minister refers to that matter, because people are asking if the Minister considered adequately whether a constitutional amendment may be necessary arising from conflict in regard to the rights to private property afforded by our Constitution.  Equally, very strong rights are conferred on families in our Constitution; and I presume that for once those rights, which have rarely given much sustenance to women, may on this occasion act to support families and balance rights in that regard.  It is important that the Minister should refer to those concerns and, if they are valid, he should deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>We need assurances that this Bill will not affect proceedings under the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Bill to allow for flexibility for the courts to make orders regarding property, given the serious failure in securing maintenance payments which is a constant feature of existing family law of which in his other capacity the Minister will be well aware.  The fact that payment of maintenance is non-existent in most cases was the subject of a Combat Poverty Agency report.  Therefore, the complex issues which arise on the breakdown of a marriage would probably not be met by a simple division of family assets.  Similar views were expressed by the Second Commission on the Status of Women and <Col N="1567" /> the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.</P>
    <P>The 1985 report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown devoted considerable time to that issue. It stated that &ldquo;a woman working in the home does not become entitled to any interest in the family home simply by reason of the work which she carried out therein as a wife looking after the home and the family&rdquo;.  It further stated that &ldquo;while the 1976 Act has introduced some element of protection, that protection is by no means complete.&rdquo;  The report concluded &ldquo;that the present system of dealing with matrimonial property is extremely unsatisfactory and effectively discriminates against women since in most marriages the wife is obliged to give up work outside the home&rdquo;.  The Bill deals with one of the problems highlighted not just by the report of that committee but by all who studied this area, that the issue of contribution to property only becomes an issue in times of conflict.  When both spouses are happy and all is going well they do not keep a record of who buys what.  The Married Women's Status Act &mdash; the mechanism available to most women at present to prove their entitlements to any claims on property &mdash; provides that women must prove a financial contribution.  That puts unrealistic pressures on people, leads to a most confused law and increasing bad feeling between spouses as they argue about who owns what.  The clarity provided in this legislation in that regard is welcome.  The report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown stated:</P>
    <P>The present system of dealing with matrimonial property is extremely unsatisfactory.  It decides spouses' interests in property on the basis of chance decisions made by them over the years, such as whether a House is put in the sole name of one partner or in joint names.</P>
    <P>Those were crucial decisions which were not made with that in mind.  The report continued:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1568" /> At the time the parties may have placed no significance on these decisions and sometimes many years later the courts imply a conscious element of intention which simply did not exist at the time.</P>
    <P>Friends of mine told me recently that, for the purposes of avoiding certain liabilities under the residential property tax, they decided to revert to single ownership status and have one home as a holiday home.  In the absence of this legislation that could have serious consequences for them in the future.  The joint committee report states also that in many cases the court is obliged to attempt to review many years of married life and try to imply what was or was not in the parties' minds many years before the court hearing. That involves the court comparing spouses' incomes over 20 years and reading their minds on occasions, which frequently leads to conflict and unsatisfactory outcomes.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise that the joint committee noted that a number of High Court decisions decided that the Family Home Protection Act had no relevance in certain circumstances, but this Bill clarifies the rights of women.  However, I would like the Minister to consider this in more detail.  Does the Bill deal adequately with the rights of mortgage holders or financial institutions?  Does it state how those rights will operate in practice and protect a dependent spouse from actions which would cause such concern?</P>
    <P>The type of problems which existed for women were referred to in Deputy Shatter's latest edition of <i>Family Law in the Republic of Ireland</i> which underlines the problems arising from the means of assessing many of those issues.  That publication stated that the law of ownership applied in the same manner to a married couple as to single people and that there was no special acceptance in law of the married position.  Ownership is the main determinant by reference to the spouse who contributed the finance used to acquire property.</P>
    <P>This emphasis on the origin of the financial <Col N="1569" /> contribution has meant that although a wife is legally as free as her husband to acquire property, the great majority of wives have no real economic independence by virtue of the fact that the majority still give up work for a period, some permanently, to run the home, to have children and to rear them. This Bill goes some way towards acknowledging the role of women in the home and giving them some automatic rights arising out of that.</P>
    <P>When I first read section 21 I thought it pushed out the boundaries a little further. Section 21 treats a spouse who has made a substantial financial contribution to the improvement of real or personal property belonging to either or both as having acquired a share, or an enlarged share as the case may be, in that property to whatever extent may be agreed between them or may be determined by the court. Having discussed this with some experienced lawyers I have to ask does this mean a repeal of section 12 of the Married Women's Status Act, 1957, while not replacing it entirely?  Section 12 of the Married Women's Status Act, 1957, does not simply refer to the improvement of real and personal property but also to any contribution to the acquisition of such property.  If section 21 of this Bill replaces the other and is a narrower definition then rather than being an improvement it is a regression.  I presume that was not the intention and that the Minister will look to amending that because it would be entirely unacceptable if one of the sections of a Bill that purports to strengthen the position of women were to be regressive.</P>
    <P>There is extensive case law under the Married Women's Status Act which has acknowledged the great contribution made by women by virtue of their work in the home and in businesses.  It is important to frame this very carefully. The Minister might have used this first opportunity to acknowledge the economic value of the work done in caring for children and minding the home to the spouse who goes out to work.  All of the women in the Dáil know just how much it costs financially and every other way to <Col N="1570" /> replace ourselves at home, particularly if we have young children.  This section might have been used to push the boat out a little further and give due recognition to the value of women's work in the home.  The Bill must ensure the reforms which will give legal recognition of their contribution to the many women who have combined home with farm or other family business.  This Bill addresses many of the issues that concern us and has our support.  It forms one or two more steps on the road to valuing the position of women and men in the home.</P>
    <P>Having made my general remarks there are a few points I want to make on individual sections.  Although this Bill is important in its own right, the Minister has validly presented it as part of a package on the road to divorce legislation. However, the perception of many women has been that this perhaps is not the most crucial factor in the process towards divorce legislation because many women believed they were much more protected by the Family Home Protection Act than they actually were.  It was not until they found themselves in court that they discovered how little protection it afforded them.</P>
    <P>Another issue the Minister must resolve relates to how he intends to maintain and develop the debate in relation to issues that may not require legislation. I refer to the issue of pensions and other such issues that will require clarification. Does the Minister intend to publish a discussion document, have a report drawn up that would come before one of the committees, or issue a press release? How exactly does he intend to move on from this legislative stage and indicate his plans for other areas?  When the last referendum was held this element was not as big an issue because people felt they had greater protection than they actually had and many felt that divorce would threaten that protection which they did not have but which this Bill will finally give them.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the importance of ensuring the marketability of property.  This touches on conveyancing as well as matrimonial property.  I note <Col N="1571" /> that there is a substantial easing of the requirement on purchasers to ensure that the terms of the Family Home Protection Act are complied with.  This is a section that needs to be watched carefully to ensure that we do not in any way weaken the protections that are there for dependent spouses.  Section 9 provides for conveyancing by one of the spouses to be bona fide where the purchaser is without notice of the fact that the home is a matrimonial home after reasonable inquiries.  Those changes should not be made without very careful consideration to ensure that we do not undermine the existing Family Home Protection Act.</P>
    <P>Let me come to the thorny question of legal aid.  All of this valuable legislation will be seriously undermined by the gross under-provision of legal aid.  Each additional piece of legislation puts an additional burden on the legal aid service. I will not dwell on that because we pursued it at Question Time.  However, if this Bill is to be of the best possible value to women they must be supported in pursuing their rights under it and have reasonably speedy access to legal aid. Reforms are awaited in that area and I know the Minister is giving it attention. It needs urgent attention and adequate resources.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has covered all kinds of property, including house boats, tenancies and a variety of interests.  Sadly, mobile homes are a very common form of accommodation at the moment.  The definition of goods and chattels is also welcome.  It is very clear and seems to cover all areas.</P>
    <P>I referred to the Commission on the Status of Women.  They would go a great deal further than this Bill.  It is worth putting on record just how much further they would go.  The commission's report emphasised the importance of the role of women in the home and the need to value it and improve recognition of it.  Our Constitution claims to do so but the economic and social reality is very different. The reality is that there is a lack of esteem, of economic recognition, of social recognition.  Women do a good job <Col N="1572" /> today.  Sometimes people try to pit the women who are at work, the women who are engaged in a profession, against the women in the home.  Unfairly, the report of this commission was used in that way.</P>
    <P>It is important that the first legislation arising out of implementing the recommendations of the second commission relate to women in the home and strengthens their position.  This legislation is for all of us because those of us who have had to replace ourselves in the home have, perhaps, a greater awareness of the pure economic values, not to mention the great difficulty in achieving the other values in any other way than by being there oneself.  It is important to make that point and celebrate that fact.  The commission recommended the immediate introduction of a regime of community property in marriage and that there should be a regime of joint ownership of the family home.  It also recommended joint entitlement to all income; a legal right share of one-half of the estate where the other spouse dies testate; no change where the other spouses dies intestate; a legal prohibition against alienation or charging of any lands etc; a legal right to information about income and assets; control and management of property to be based on title; no responsibility for pre-marital debts of the other spouse; a right to opt out, which is now provided for and no change to the existing law on division of property on marital breakdown.  That is an indication of the future agenda and the Minister is being put on notice that the second tranche of the commission's recommendations shall be added.</P>
    <P>The commission's study on women in the home considered the changing roles of women and men, the supports for women as a carer; a strategy to ensure independent status for women in the home to acknowledge their status as homemaker and address their perceived low status.  The commission made a clear recommendation that all income from whatever source should be jointly owned by spouses and that the legal right share on testacy established under the Succession Act, 1965, should be increased <Col N="1573" /> from one-third to one-half.  It is important to note that while this is a step forward many would like us to go a great deal further on the road.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a number of other points but they are detailed ones relating to definitions.  Section 6 raises the possibility of children making an application and it is questionable whether it is wise to allow children become directly involved in the matrimonial affairs of their parents.  This development should be analysed further.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in principle and I look forward to having time to speak on it on Committee Stage.  I hope the Minister will respond to some of the issues I raised and that he will assure Members that the Bill will not return to this House for Report and Final Stages before the end of the month.  I hope it will be debated at length in Committee &mdash; to allow other bodies, who will be charged with implementing its provisions, to study it and to allow the Bill to be comprehensively studied by those who will benefit from it.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I warmly welcome this Bill.  As a woman, a feminist and a lawyer &mdash; though not a practitioner &mdash; I welcome this legislation which gives each spouse equal rights of ownership in the matrimonial home.  It is an integral part, the softening up process and the preparation for the forthcoming referendum to remove the constitutional ban on divorce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are various issues by which one can measure the progress of womens' rights in Ireland.  Any assessment of that progression throws up one major characteristic &mdash; that of slowness.  History will show a pathetically genteel pace of change for Irish women in the long march to equality.  As the Minister realises nothing happens by chance in this field <Col N="1574" /> and he has a whole swathe of legislation which needs to be introduced in the area of equality for women.  This is evident in another field, that of public policy surrounding women's reproductive freedom. This was one of the original obstacles to female equality, it is possibly the final frontier in regard to equality and there is much unfinished business in that field.</P>
    <P>The capacity of a woman, particularly a married woman, to own property is a fundamental chapter in the whole story of women.  In the 19th century the common law position was that a married woman was regarded as subservient to her husband and he had proprietary rights over her.  A married woman did not have any independent contractual capacity.  The effects of this were numerous and comprehensive in so far as her property was concerned.  The position included a wife's personal property which was owned by her husband apart from frippery and jewellery.</P>
    <P>The first legislative change in this area was the introduction of the Married Woman's Property Act, 1882.  The invidious doctrine of restraint upon anticipation remained and it imposed a restriction on the right of a married woman to deal or dispose of her property as she saw fit.  This was not abolished until the enactment of the Married Women's Status Act, 1957.  Under this Act a married woman was considered in law a full and legal person in her own right for the first time.  The case law thereafter centred on the slow development of the concept of a trust implied by the law.  The husband was held to be a trustee for the wife of a share in the house roughly corresponding with the proportion of the purchase money represented by the wife's total contibution to the purchase price or the mortgage repayments.  The case law gradually evolved to infer a trust to include indirect contributions.</P>
    <P>Recent controversial cases on the matter showed a reluctance and unwillingness on the part of the Judiciary to develop this concept further on the basis of a constitutional argument based on Article 41.  The Judiciary firmly put it up <Col N="1575" /> to the Oireachtas to legislate clearly on the matter of giving the wife an interest in the family home during her husband's life.  Mr. Justice Lardiner, in the case of J.F. v. B.F., identified this issue as one of political and social policy.  Conflicting judicial decisions on the matter have created confusion and for that reason the Dáil is today exercising its proper function as the sole and exclusive body charged with making laws for the State in this area.</P>
    <P>The Family Home Protection Act, 1976, protects the members of a family of a vindictive spouse from having their home sold by him or her over their heads. It was hastily enacted in July 1976 and because of this there might have been some slippage in the drafting.  From a practitioner's point of view, having regard to how the law has evolved since, that Act left much to be desired.  The case law has progressively complicated matters with problems centering around the burden of proving the consent of both spouses to the sale of the family home.</P>
    <P>I welcome the tidying up which this Bill affords to the practical conveyancing difficulties.  The Minister has accepted that a balance must be found between the overall rights we are seeking to espouse here as to equality and the marketability of that property.  We may need a longer period to enter consultations with the Law Society to tease out these matters before this law is cast in stone.</P>
    <P>I suspect when the 1976 Act was enacted many traditional conveyancers were thrown into a tailspin by the horror of the extra workload which the Act presented to them in their daily conveyancing work.  However, that is reality and law is about adapting to changed public policies and, in this case, integrating property and conveyancing law with the changing structures of family life and social policy.</P>
    <P>Section 7 allows a married couple or a couple contemplating marriage to opt out or exclude the application of section 4 to their matrimonial home or intended matrimonial home.  This would seem <Col N="1576" /> reasonable but it may harbour some potential dangers.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister may require such agreements to be in a specified form and this is a very important point.  Any such waiver should be accompanied by a requirement for independent legal advice to both partners in relation to such an agreement, so as to guard against a potential for undue influence of one partner or the other.  This raises the desirability generally that people contemplating marriage should visit their solicitor as well as their local parish priest.</P>
    <P>I note also in section 10 that the Act makes provision for the situation where one or other of the spouses is or becomes a bankrupt, and this is to be welcomed in so far as it goes.  I wish to raise a point with the Minister today in relation to a problem which arises when banks or lending institutions convert a judgment for a debt into a judgment mortgage on the family home.  The banks can then move to sell the property and the wife, though entitled to a joint share, will still be placed in the perilous position of having her home sold from under her and her children by the banks, causing major distruption to her children and herself.</P>
    <P>This terrible situation arises as a result of a husband using the family home as a business asset and offering it by way of collateral on a loan.  If the public policy principle we are discussing today, and which we are enshrining into law, is to be strong and unambiguous, it is now time for banks and lending institutions generally to fundamentally review their lending practices to take account of the principle inherent in this law.  Banks should not be so eager to accept the family home as collateral on a loan for the business interests of one partner by way of personal guarantee.  This is especially so if, as is often the case, the wife may not be consulted or be aware of the real risks to her legal share in the family home, which would arise in a situation where a husband offers the family house as collateral for a loan in relation to his business interests.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1577" /> A recent decision of Mrs. Justice Denham, as she then was before she was elevated to the Supreme Court, indicated a judicial discomfort with the injustice in this type of situation.  In that case she ordered a long stay on the order for sale in the bank's favour so as to help alleviate the terrible disruption to the lives of the children in particular.  It seems to me that the day should be fast approaching when it will be inappropriate on public policy grounds, and certainly politically incorect, for banks to accept the family home as collateral for the risky business ventures of one spouse.</P>
    <P>The principle enshrined in this Act is a core principle of equality in marriage and it is to be warmly welcomed.  The principle we are discussing today should further promote the concept of the community of assets within marriage and the community of property, as has already been outlined by Deputy Flaherty.</P>
    <P>Economic dependence is a major contributor to inequality within marriage and has been identified generally as an obstacle to women achieving a sense of self-esteem and personal worth.  As spokesperson for Health in the Progressive Democrats, I have had cause to examine some research in relation to depression among women, particularly married women.  There is a high incidence of depression among married women.  A strong tendency for depression, with all its related impact on women's health and on the proper functioning of families, is undeniably linked with economic dependency and a feeling of powerlessness among many married women.</P>
    <P>The principle being cast into law today is of vital importance not only to women but to Irish society.  As long ago as 1972 the first report of the Commission on the Status of Women stated:</P>
    <P>The present law fails to take into account that marriage is a form of partnership in which the parties play interdependent roles and to which the different contributions of each are of equal importance to the family welfare.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1578" /> Twenty one years later this House is implementing the spirit of that recommendation. If there was to be a patron saint of women, her name would be Patience.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank Deputy O'Donnell for sharing her time with me. As she said, the Progressive Democrats warmly support this legislation and will not oppose it on Second Stage.  However, this legislation is extremely difficult and complicated to follow, even with the guidance of some legal friends who equally found it difficult legislation on which to advise.  Therefore, I want to suggest to the Minister, as has been suggested already by Deputy Flaherty, that we should take time in processing this legislation through the Oireachtas.  It is particularly important, given that this Bill is due to go to a committee of this House next week, that there would be a reasonable gap between next week's committee meeting and a subsequent meeting of that committee.  Even practitioners in this field are finding it difficult to understand fully the implications of this legislation and to come forward with suggested amendments.  As Deputy O'Donnell said, the 1976 Family Home Protection Act was a rushed Bill introduced in July 1976 coming up to the summer recess.  I have read some of the debates on this Bill and there was a number of very good and enlightened contributions.  I was impressed by some of the contributions because it was prior to my coming to this House.  As Deputy O'Donnell said, there have been enormous difficulties since then with the operation of the Family Home Protection Act.  That Act is restrictive and the courts have adopted a very rigid approach to its interpretation and to case law in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to say at the outset that it is regrettable that there are a number of different definitions between the two Acts.  I realise the Minister made some effort to explain the reason for that, but we now have the family home, the matrimonial home and the former matrimonial home.  That not only leads to confusion, but this legislation will lead also to an <Col N="1579" /> increased volume of litigation and will become a minefield for lawyers who will be required to go through an enormous number of procedures when involved in conveyancing matters.  It will lead also to many disputes and much expense.  I am not saying there is a way to introduce this legislation without it becoming a legal minefield, but the failure to clarify some of the terms and to have synonymous definitions rather then three separate definitions, futher complicates what is already a complicated area.</P>
    <P>Deputies O'Donnell and Flaherty dealt very well with the history of women's rights in this country in so far as property is concerned.  I personally believe that our Constitution is an insult to women.  The provisions in our Constitution represent very much the ethos, the thinking and the role of women in the thirties.  Fortunately, that role has long since changed in everything but the law and the Constitution.  I look forward to the day when we can have a Constitution of which the women of Ireland can feel proud and which women will feel gives them a role other than that of housewives or mothers.  Women are not referred to in the Constitution other than in the context of a woman's life within the home and in the context of the pro-life amendment regarding the rights of the unborn child.  Those are the only two cases in which there is any recognition that women exist as persons in this country. Since the Constitution is the fundamental document upon which all our laws and rights are based, it is important that that Constitution, in so far as it relates to women, is amended as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise also a query with the Minister in relation to the Interpretation Act.  I raised this matter during Question Time in the House yesterday.  At the time I had not examined the Bill before us to see whether it also was sexist.  It is sexist. There are many references to &ldquo;his&rdquo; throughout this Bill and I regret that coming from a Minister who I hope will bring in much reform, particularly as far as women are concerned, and family law <Col N="1580" /> reform generally.  It is particularly important that we use language in our legislation that is gender neutral.  That is a recommendation not just of the Commission on the Status of Women, but many people also feel it is most regrettable that our legislation is sexist in the way it refers to people and particularly in the way it refers to Ministers.  It is always assumed that the Minister is a male.  I must say in this Bill that is not the case in relation to the Minister.  It simply says &ldquo;The Minister may&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Minister may not&rdquo;.  It does not refer to the Minister as &ldquo;he&rdquo; and I welcome that. However, I would prefer to delete the references to &ldquo;his&rdquo; that appear in this legislation and I will be putting forward amendments in this regard on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise a number of matters with the Minister brought to my attention by lawyers experienced in conveyancing. It is regrettable that legislation such as this was not enacted prior to the holding of the constitutional referendum in 1986. The lack of such legislation was one of the reasons for its defeat.  There is a view &mdash; which I do not share &mdash; that the next referendum on divorce will be automatically passed.  I will campaign to ensure the referendum is passed because I am committed to the principle of divorce based on irretrievable breakdown of marriage.  In any civilised democratic society, to deny people the right to a second chance of marriage and to legally dissolve a marriage that has ended is inhumane and wrong.</P>
    <P>I have strong reservations about the success of the forthcoming referendum. Therefore, it is important not only that this legislation is passed before the referendum but that there is a reasonable time period between its passing and the holding of the referendum.  It is also important that the referendum is not held in conjunction with another electoral contest.  For example, if the referendum is held in conjunction with European elections or elections to sub-county structures such as urban district councils and so on, politicians will concentrate on those elections because that is where <Col N="1581" /> their interests lie.  The attention and resources of political parties would go almost exclusively to these elections, as happened in November last year when the abortion issue received very little attention from the media or political parties by way of commentary or resources. I was very happy with the outcome of that referendum.  If the divorce referendum is to succeed a very thorough campaign will be required on the part of all parties committed to it.  I would like to see cross-party consensus on holding a referendum and allowing for divorce, with a single campaign by Government and Opposition.</P>
    <P>To ensure a successful outcome to the divorce referendum we must not only pass this legislation, we must also provide for issues such as protection orders and division of property and income.  There should also be a proper information and awareness campaign by parties.  Nobody should seek to play politics with this matter because it is much too important. We should concentrate exclusively on the divorce issue even if it means deferring it until the autumn of next year.  It is very important that the referendum is carried whether it be held in June, October or November.  If the referendum fails it will be perhaps eight or ten years before another such referendum is held.  Although the opinion polls are favourable, as was the case on the last occasion, when it comes to dealing with issues such as these, with all the repercussions for property and families as well as the uncertainties and fears, we cannot be sure the referendum will be passed.  This will be the last chance for those who campaigned against such issues as homosexuality and condoms and they will put every effort into their campaign for no change.  I know they are already well organised and prepared for it.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise a number of queries on the Bill.  I welcome the concept of joint ownership of the family home.  It is appropriate that both spouses should equally own the home.  Since the 1976 Act was passed many women believed that such a law was in existence &mdash; I was surprised at the number of intelligent <Col N="1582" /> women who thought this was so.  There is confusion about the protection under the 1976 Act and the right to ownership of the property, and I welcome the provisions in the Bill in this regard.  When introducing laws there are always areas of unfairness and injustice.  For example, in a marriage that lasts for only six or eight months, despite the contract out option, it could be argued that it is unfair to the partner who may have owned the property in advance of the marriage to have it divided when the marriage breaks up.  There may be hard cases, but hard cases do not make the law and we cannot legislate on that basis.  However, I would welcome a provision whereby in certain circumstances such as I mentioned the court would have discretion.</P>
    <P>I welcome the contract out provisions in section 7.  I agree with Deputy O'Donnell that those provisions should apply only when legal advice has been taken. Most people getting married are happy and full of enthusiasm.  They do not comtemplate problems arising.  They would not even consider a contract out option because they believe the marriage will last forever.  Contract out provisions need to be carefully explored and should only be availed of on the advice of a lawyer. Otherwise a clever person may advise a spouse that because business complications may arise they should avail of the contract out option and the person readily agrees without considering the matter.  I know the Minister may make regulations in this regard, but regulations should require that legal advice is taken. There is an inconsistency in that contract out provisions are included in this legislation but not in the Family Home Protection Act.</P>
    <P>Section 18 does not give the court sufficient power to use its discretion in defining a family home.  As I understand from lawyers who practise in this area; once the family home, always the family home.  We are talking about disputes, and courts should be given discretion to make decisions in these matters.  Many problems will arise in relation to farms. There is a reference in the Bill to the farm and the garden but there is no mention of <Col N="1583" /> a courtyard which may be part of a house but could be used for farming activities. Will the vegetable garden be part of the farm or the house?  Lawyers will have a field day with this provision.  I understand that under the landlord and tenant legislation one acre is referred to &mdash; I am not sure whether that is a requirement or a custom.  Depending on the size of the farm, one acre may be liberal or conservative. One acre of a 20 acre farm is a lot of land but in a farm of over 100 acres it is very little.  We need to be very careful when dealing with provisions relating to farms because a farm is not just a place where one resides, it is also a business.  If a farmer dies, his wife automatically becomes the owner of the house and his son inherits the land, how will the deceased's representative, when registering the land under the name of the son, decide what is part of the house and what is part of the farm?  In regard to capital acquisitions tax what guidelines will apply?  There are many difficulties in this area that must be teased out.</P>
    <P>Section 21 appears to give the spouse an enlarged share of property where she contributes to improvement of the property. However, if she contributes to the purchase of the property she has no rights.  If that is the case, it is obviously a mistake.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 6 are the contents of the explanatory memorandum and what it purports to represent similar to the provisions of the Bill?  In circumstances where a husband and wife are divorced, the husband remarries and has a second family, on his death the children of the first marriage would have no property rights and any rights to the property will be conferred on the children of the second marriage.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify that.</P>
    <P>A number of constituents have experienced difficulties in relation to consent, and getting consent.  A constituent whose marriage broke up in the seventies and whose family home had been repossessed because of debts became a local authority tenant when her husband went to the US. She saw him only once since.  Her mother <Col N="1584" /> died and left her a sum of money with which she bought the local authority house.  She now wishes to sell it but despite the fact that her husband has never been in the house she has to go to court to get his consent to sell it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill will not apply to that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill should have amended the Family Home Protection Act that requires consent before the property can be disposed of.  This loophole is a huge mistake where a person has never resided in the property and it was never the matrimonial home.  If a court makes an order in a marriage dispute under any legislation giving the house to one spouse, for instance a wife, if she wishes to sell it she must still get the consent of her spouse under the Family Home Protection Act.  Even where there is an agreement between spouses she must still get his consent.  These loopholes should be closed and we should use this Bill to do so.  These provisions are a nightmare for lawyers and they lead to expense and confusion.  When my constituent heard that she must get her husband's consent she was furious.  She had been left penniless and now had to ask her husband's consent to go to the court to have his consent dispensed with. Section 24 gives an amnesty of sorts. After six years the conveyance cannot be declared void, if the consent is not given. We need to do more than that and perhaps six years is too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a number of other queries which I will probably pass on to the Minister's advisers because it will make it easier for me to formulate amendments if my queries are clarified.  These inquiries have not originated from any great ingenuity on my part but rather from a number of lawyers with whom I spoke this morning. I understand that yesterday the Minister's advisers met a group from the Incorporated Law Society who put many of these points to him.  I know the Minister is a reasonable person and is prepared to take amendments on board.  It is very important to have fair legislation <Col N="1585" /> giving women, wives in particular, just treatment.  Farm wives particularly will benefit from this legislation.  Many women in rural communities do not have any protection and this will give them some protection.  I am delighted that they will get some property rights to which they are entitled.  If the legislation is to be effective we should go through it slowly and get an outside view from law practitioners who often see things that the rest of us do not see on the basis of their many years of experience.</P>

      <P>This is the first time in my life that I regret not being a solicitor. I found this Bill hard to take in but I, too, hope we will have the time to tease out all aspects of it.  I know the essential features of the Bill but there is a great deal of technical material which is hard to grasp.  The question of language should be sorted out fairly quickly.  It would be most inappropriate if this Bill showed a gender bias.  We in Democratic Left welcome the Bill which deals with an aspect of inequality which is very offensive and which has damaged women.  Marriage is often presented as a romantic occasion with orange blossom and white lace, but essentially it is about property. This Bill is addressing the inequality inherent in the marriage contract.  Marriage is essentially an institution that ensures that property is kept within families and passed on from one generation to the next.</P>
      <P>In the past women have been discriminated against consistently in our marriage laws.  The legacy of that discrimination is still very evident where a woman wants to separate from her husband. The first question is, &ldquo;Will I lose the children?&rdquo; and the second is, &ldquo;Will I lose the house?&rdquo;.  Other Deputies have said that many women believed they already had this right but my experience is that many women do not believe that they have any right and they are terrified to put this to the test.  We must ensure that women are aware that this Bill has given them an essential right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  Women have been able to get some share in the family home through the courts, but it has not been established as a fundamental right.  This Bill is catching up with changing attitudes.  We must establish full equality of ownership of the matrimonial home and its chattels.</P>
      <P>The Second Commission on the Status of Women makes much more sweeping recommendations than this.  It recommends joint ownership of the family home, joint entitlement to all income, a legal right to share one-half of the estate where the other spouse dies testate and no change where the other spouse dies intestate, a legal prohibition against alienation or charging of any lands, premises, business enterprises, assets, savings or investments without the consent of the other spouse above a given discretionary limit.  They recommend that there should be a provision for the court to dispense with this consent, and make recommendations with regard to a legal right to information about income and assets, control and management of property to be based on title, and no responsibility for pre-marital debt.</P>
      <P>It is a much larger brief than simply dealing with the matrimonial home.  It would be more direct and fairer to say that if one gets married one shares the property in common and if one is no longer married the property should be dealt with in a fair way.  If the Minister is to live up to the commission report, and the Taoiseach has quite clearly stated that the Government supports the commission report, there will be a lot more in the pipeline.  It will be interesting to see how far the legislation can go in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It all comes back to a very simple question. If a spouse is entitled to half the matrimonial home, what are his or her entitlements to the rest of the property held by the other spouse?  If a man can only go out to work because his wife stays at home and looks after the house and children, what rights does she have over <Col N="1587" /> part of his income?  That is not tackled here and I do not expect it to be, but it is a good question because if we have rights to the matrimonial home as wives, surely we must look at our rights to all the property of the marriage.  The work done in the home is acknowledged in the Constitution where the social function of women is stated as follows:</P>
    <P>...by her life within the home, women gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved.</P>
    <P>2.  The State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.</P>
    <P>In terms of putting a monetary value on all that wonderful work the Constitution has totally failed to protect women.  The second commission recommends that Article 41.2.2º should be deleted.  I would like to see that coupled with the divorce referendum.  It is ironic that the Constitution has not given women the rights implicit in that Article.  Not only does the Article fail to protect women in the home but it has been taken to mean that the home is where women should stay.</P>
    <P>The Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act enabled the courts to divide any family property between spouses and children but there was not an automatic share of the matrimonial home as in this Bill.  That is surely its most significant feature.  It is the principle, the idea of equality and an equal share between husband and wife which is important.</P>
    <P>The first document ever produced by the women's liberation movement in the seventies makes interesting reading. People feel that we move at a snail's pace but it should be remembered &mdash; I remember the period well &mdash; that in the early seventies women were subjected to inequities.  It is incredible, but a wife was considered to be the chattel of her husband and, regardless of where she resided, her domicile was considered to be that of her husband.  We were remarkably <Col N="1588" /> bigoted in terms of the rules that were applied.  A wife had to get the permission of her husband before she could pledge credit or make any private financial arrangements.  Indeed, a man could desert his wife for as long as he liked, come back and walk into the house.  However, if a wife left the family home she forfeited rights.</P>
    <P>Property means power as well as security. It has given men power over the centuries and we are still living with the consequences, even if it is now waning and diminishing.  It has inculcated a culture which has led to the marriage contract being distorted.  In the past &mdash; I hope not so much now &mdash; one came across many cases where if the man treated people in the way he treated his wife, he would have been put in jail; but somehow or other this was tolerated in the case of his wife because that was what men did to women.  A good example is the Kilkenny case, as it shows just how horrific the position can become for women and children, but it is not the only one.</P>
    <P>I have advised women who wish to escape violent partners.  Usually, they are not sure what their rights are and are afraid to go to court to put them to the test.  When this Bill is passed I will be able to say that they will own half the house.  This can be used to end the subterranean war which took place and is still being waged in some homes today.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been slow in coming. People have had to be patient and plod through the quagmire of legal test cases. Indeed, legislation was first promised ten years ago.  In the meantime life has changed.  The minority are now living in the traditional family unit of the two parents and a couple of children.  The family unit today is different to the traditional model.  While spouses will be given certain rights, the complexities of modern family life have not been grappled with in the Bill.  I am not underestimating the difficulties that will be encountered in cases where there is no legal contract.  For example, if divorce is introduced an unmarried couple may choose not to marry.  If they have a longstanding commitment to each other, <Col N="1589" /> surely each deserves a certain amount of protection and the fact that they are unmarried should not undermine their right to equal ownership.  We have all come across cases where a person nurses or cares for an elderly relative and lived with them for 25 years, but the house was then left to somebody else.  I am raising these examples to show that there is a fundamental principle that should be applied as widely as possible.</P>
    <P>There is one point that should be made, and I intend to table an amendment on Committee Stage to cover it.  If an elderly parent is a tenant or tenant purchaser of a local authority house and a son or daughter moves in, normally they take out joint tenancy.  When the parent dies the son takes out joint tenancy with his wife.  However, if the mother is the joint tenant her share is frozen and she has the right to pass this on to whoever she likes.  I do not expect an answer from the Minister now, but I suspect that in cases where a mother and son take out joint tenancy in a local authority house the son could run into difficulties on the death of his mother in that her share is not automatically transferred to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important point.  Even where a person has the right, this does not necessarily mean that it has been formalised.  In the case I have mentioned the widow in question would not be able to take out a loan.  For instance, if she is living in a ramshackle house which has no bath she will not be able to take out a loan to do it up unless she has taken out probate on her husband's will.  Technically, women can transact this business themselves, but most people are terrified to do so.  I agree with the Minister when he says that the procedure should be simplified; it should <Col N="1591" /> be possible to introduce legal procedures whereby people will not need to employ a solicitor.  If that is the case, this needs to be spelt out; we have to inform and educate people.  If people do not sort this matter out they could find themselves in a mess later.</P>
      <P>Why are holiday homes excluded?  I am aware that mobile homes and house boats are mentioned, but I take this to mean the primary matrimonial home. Nowadays a large number of people own a holiday home and a house in town.</P>
      <P>Are they regarded as two matrimonial homes?  I suspect that is not the case.  If this is the way people live today we should recognise it and include a relevant provision in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am somewhat concerned about this matter.  I know that the courts have the overriding power at the end of the day to overrule a joint vesting arrangement. The Bill provides that an application for such an order may be refused if it would be injurious to grant that application.  I should like to know the circumstances which would render it just to exclude a spouse from ownership.  There is a danger of value judgments being made.  The Minister has great confidence in the capabilities of district justices but it is not unknown for them to make bizarre decisions.  I came across an extraordinary case some time ago where a woman who sought a barring order in court had the barring order issued against her.  She appealed the decision and won, but it had taken her six months to gain access to her home.  This was outrageous as the woman in that case was barred from her home on a flimsy excuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What will happen in a case which involves cruelty, desertion or adultery? There are many reasons this right could be waived.  I know I am being facetious but another reason could be over-spending on a credit card.  What are the determinants and criteria under which this right could be waived?  The Minister should set down specific guidelines covering this matter because the decision to waive this right could end by reflecting prejudices which exist in the system and <Col N="1592" /> which are part of our lives.  We should not pretend we can change the way people think simply by changing the law.</P>
    <P>The opt-out provision in section 7 has caused a certain amount of unease. Under this section the Minister may make regulations as to the form of agreement. If it is accepted that the opt-out clause remains then the Minister must make regulations at the same time as the passing of the Act and the form and content must be clear.  We need to know how valid the agreement will be if independent legal advice is not obtained. Many people never get legal advice about documents they sign.  What will happen in circumstances in which a spouse makes financial contributions to the property and the couple decide to separate years later?  This may be covered in the Bill but I cannot find any reference to it.  If a woman has made either direct or indirect contributions and then decides to opt out, will she be deemed to have made a gift to her husband?  After all, there will be an agreement in writing.  Does she have a beneficial interest in the property based on her contributions?</P>
    <P>It is hard to understand why there should be an opt-out clause given that pressure can be exerted on a woman, particularly during the early days of a courtship, to make a contribution to the property.  We have all heard about farmers who give their wives a right to residence for life on the family farm.  If a woman decides to opt out, what real protection will she have so that she will not be left in a very vulnerable position?  The only circumstances in which this clause will be advantageous is where a person is self-employed, for example, the husband may put the matrimonial home in his wife's name to ensure that it cannot be seized by creditors.  It must be agreed that there is no reason self-employed people should be treated differently from anyone else.  If a person who is not self-employed loses his job his creditors can register a judgment mortgage against the family home and/or the building society can repossess it.  It may well be that a statute without an opt-out clause could run into difficulties on a constitutional <Col N="1593" /> basis.  If that is the reason for this clause, the Minister should say so.</P>
    <P>I am unclear about the provisions in section 5 which simply state that the household chattels belong to both spouses.  The explanatory memorandum describes the word &ldquo;chattels&rdquo; in some detail, for example, furniture, bedding, linen, etc.  There is a scene in every Hollywood film involving divorce where the couple gather in the house and start sharing out the household belongings.  It is right that these belongings should be included in the Bill.  However, I am worried about the definition of the word &ldquo;chattels&rdquo; which I do not believe is adequate to cover the multifarious products available in our consumer-based society.  What about modern technology? For example, the husband may have bought a computer worth £5,000 which he used once a week to add up the business accounts.  During the rest of the week the wife may have used the computer to write a novel.  She may only have sold 2,000 copies of the novel, which did not even cover her costs&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>That happens only in the McManus household.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I sold more than 2,000 copies.  The children may have used this computer for three hours every night to do their homework projects.  Who owns that computer?  Is it a chattel?</P>
      <P>Will a car be regarded as a chattel?  In all pop cultures a car is regarded as a natural extension of the home.  If the wife contributed towards the purchase of the family car but is not the owner for whatever reason &mdash; she may only be a named driver &mdash; does she not have a 50 per cent share in that car?  Some years ago I visited a woman who lives on her own and whose house was being inspected by the Department for a home improvement grant.  Her house was valued at £11,000 and she was concerned about whether she would get a grant.  The inspector told her that his car was worth more than her house and that she need not worry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not underestimate the value of property related to the household but <Col N="1594" /> not necessarily included in the Bill.  I do not know &mdash; this is where I show my ignorance &mdash; if the explanatory memorandum is part of the Bill.  I presume it is not&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is not, how will these items be defined in the Bill?  We can deal with these issues in greater detail on Committee Stage.  It would be fairer and simpler to legislate that all property should be shared in common ownership when a couple marry, rather than picking our way through the bits and pieces of a shattered marriage, the way they do in Hollywood.</P>
      <P>This is a good Bill.  It deals with one aspect of the marriage relationship.  It is of particular significance to relationships which break down.  It will right a wrong which has been done to generations of Irish women.  This wrong maintained that a woman's place was in the home but the home was not a woman's place &mdash; it belonged to her husband, not to her. Legislation and changes in legal practices have chipped away at that injustice and this Bill will eliminate it once and for all. For that reason I welcome the Bill.  Many other reforms need to be put in place to ensure that people will eventually be able to live as married people on an equal basis and, if they choose, be able to extricate themselves from that marriage in a dignified way and with a modicum of humanity.</P>
      <P>At the end of the day the courts still hold the power to alter the provisions of this Bill in particular circumstances.  I hope this will not mean that test case after test case will be brought before the courts which will undermine the essential principle of the Bill.  The day when a woman was regarded as a chattel is well and truly over; the woman's ownership of chattels is now the subject of debate. However, this Bill is also about much more.  It is about the waning power of one sex over another and the emergence of an equality which is only catching up with the modern world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe we learned lessons from the <Col N="1595" /> last divorce referendum.  Fears about property were one of the main reasons for the defeat of the referendum.  We must deal with that aspect of marriage, that it is about property and procreation. It is but it has also to do with the protection of rights and partnership.  While I certainly support this Bill I will be tabling amendments to it on Committee Stage. Essentially this Bill deals with the rights of the two spouses.  In a marriage where only the two spouses are involved, I think divorce should be very easy.  If there are no children it should be very simple to deal with the legal contract, the property should be divided and everyone should go his or her own way.  However, in marriages where there are children I believe there should be some legal contract between the children and their parents. I do not know how that could be done, if it is done elsewhere, but it certainly makes sense to me to have a formalised arrangement whereby children have certain rights, regardless of how the spouses relate to one another.  The rights of children in relation to their parents should be enshrined in law.  I know that is a question for another day and it certainly has implications for property.  I welcome this Bill.  It is one step, probably one of the less contentious steps in the many we will take.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill and I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on it.  Because I knew this Bill would be debated I have been reading the discussions in the newspapers in the run-up to it.  Indeed, the speech of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, brought to mind, as matters like this always do, the past.  In 1972 the then Commissioner for the Status of Women recommended that this proposal <Col N="1596" /> should be introduced in their proposals on homes.  I was elected to the local authority in 1974 and the first motion I had on the agenda was that the council should give joint tenancies to their council tenants. In fact, I checked the minute book of the proceedings to confirm that it was my first motion.  At that time there was absolute consternation about my proposal and the follwing Sunday a clergyman spoke from the altar in Athlone and said that no longer would there be peaceful lives in Athlone&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that there had come on the council a harridan who was proposing joint tenancies.  I do not jest, I am telling the truth.  How far we have come in 19 years.  The modest proposal of joint tenancy was given effect to later.  Deputy Taylor clearly says that the ongoing measures will clearly have a cumulative effect.  Again we are debating another modest proposal &mdash; I agree with the previous Deputy's comments in that regard &mdash; but a very important one for the rights of women.  I do not consider it to be a prelude to something else &mdash; I note the Minister was careful to make this point but when one reads about it it is presented as a prelude to something else.  I believe this Bill gives expression to what is a woman's due in recognition for her work in the partnership.  Marriage is a partnership and not a hierarchical structure but unfortunately the latter regime has obtained in many homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a modest proposal but I wonder if, in fact, the Minister has gone far enough.  We all know the difficulties attaching to property and the passions and emotions it arouses in households. Let us say a man and a woman are involved in running a business.  Often if the man is the upfront person in the business he is only able to do so because of the work the woman has done in the home and with the family and minding that end of the partnership.  I wonder if the Minister will be bolder as the debate goes on and look at that issue.  I know the legal aspects have been very well <Col N="1597" /> addressed by the previous speakers so I will address the issues of women's confidence in themselves as people and as full partners in a relationship.</P>
    <P>When people get married they start off with stars in their eyes and high hopes in their hearts.  Indeed, there would not be a marriage if there was not that sense of idealism and many marriages would not survive if people were not starry eyed at times and retained a sense of idealism about marriage.  I now strongly believe that the marriage age at present is too low.  The commission recommended strongly that the marriage age be raised to 18 years.  I did not think so at one time but the more experience I have of life the more I am in agreement that the legal age of marriage should be set at 18 years. Young people are rushing into marriage with starry eyes, high hopes and good intentions but with no factual idea of the contract they are entering.  They have no idea of the realities of life; they have very little interest in parenting, in budgeting, communications, in sexual relationships and how to deal with one another when conflict arises.  One is a child at 16 and 18 is still very young and I strongly urge that the Oireachtas look carefully at the marriage age.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the system of education. I speak with some knowledge in this area and I feel entitled to put forward my views on it.  Throughout our time at school there is not enough emphasis on the matters of which I speak: making up your own mind about matters, communications between people, proper appreciation of sexuality and what the contract of marriage entails.  These issues are not on any school curriculum.  There is still a huge rumpus when one talks about sexual education and education for relationships. Indeed, there is still opposition to the stay safe sex programme for primary schools which I introduced.  There will always be opposition to what I consider to be normal everyday topics that young people in schools should have discussed. Our young people should have the opportunity to talk through&mdash;matters with responsible people in order to complement the information they get in their <Col N="1598" /> homes on these matters.  Sometimes through no fault of the parents this is not able to be done at home.  These issues should be addressed in a programme of confidence-building in women, of which this Bill forms a very important part. Women will feel recognised for the role they play in their home.  For that reason alone I welcome this Bill.  I do not want to see it coupled with another matter, with which I am in agreement, as this Bill stands on its own merits and is not just a prelude to another Bill on which the people will have a say.</P>

      <P>I welcome this legislation very much.  When introducing it the Minister said it was high time it came on stream.  In my legal practice I have always encouraged couples at every opportunity to put property into joint names if they can, and this Bill in these enlightened times puts on a formal basis the encouragement people have had down the years.  In my legal practice also I encouraged separated wives to continue <Col N="1599" /> to make mortgage repayments when the husband had flown the nest to ensure they would have some equity in the dwelling house that perhaps was not in their name but in the name of the defaulting spouse.</P>
      <P>When I was going through college the one legal hero, much maligned in these days, was Lord Denning. He was light years ahead of his time in that he was the first person to introduce the concept of constructive trust which basically gave people, mainly females, the right to have an equity in a dwelling house or property on the basis of the contribution, not necessarily financial, they had made in the partnership.  As I said Lord Denning was light years ahead of his time and it is only now that we are on a statutory basis catching up with that concept.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>He was.  I agree with the Minister.  Even our Supreme Court in their wisdom had an overly conservative view of the involvement of mainly wives in the home and the contribution, not even financial, they had made towards the building up of that home.  Most right thinking people acknowledge the fact &mdash; I do not want to overstate it &mdash; that spouses, mainly female spouses, down the years have not been given enough recognition for the work they have put into building the home.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the divorce referendum, and I would like to echo the views expressed by my colleague beside me, Deputy O'Rourke.  Some people see the divorce referendum as being the panacea for all ills.  I wonder whether it will not be the female of the union who will suffer more if divorce is introduced here.  I just pose that question.  It is another day's work, but particularly females caught up in a divorce situation should think about it, because the responsibility will most likely fall mainly upon them in relation to children and perhaps they would not win in a divorce situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To return to the Bill, other speakers <Col N="1600" /> mentioned the Family Home Protection Act.  That was good legislation in the way it was framed, but it was in effect a stop gap, a first effort at giving a spouse some interest in a house.  In effect it gave spouses no interest at all, but at least it gave them the right to object to the mortgaging or sale of the house.  It was badly drafted legislation and I agree with some speakers here who have said we should take our time on this.</P>
    <P>To refer again to Lord Denning, the difficulty is that while previous Governments wanted to bring this legislation forward earlier, because of our Constitution and the Articles in relation to private property the drafters were reluctant to put it forward.  I still fear there may well be some constitutional difficulties inherent in it when it is passed. I pose a question to the Minister and when replying he can correct me if I am wrong.  I think this is the first time in the history of legislation in our State that we are giving the District Court the right to meddle in what are called property rights. Maybe that is a good thing in that it will to some extent reduce the costs of any disputes that arise.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I will surprise some of my friends in here.  I wonder if this legislation is going far enough in defining the family or matrimonial home.  I have heard most of the speakers so far, but I do not know if any one of them adverted to the fact that there are numerous common law relationships which will not be covered in this Bill.  We have previous examples of legislation put through this House which unfortunately have not taken into account the fact &mdash; and it is a fact of life &mdash; that there are people living as man and wife with children.  The barring order legislation is very pertinent here.  A barring order cannot be imposed in the case of a common law union.  Similarly the Family Home Protection Act does not apply in that case either and neither will the measure we are debating.  I accept that it could have very significant implications for our social legislation, but as a compassionate race we should look at it. We have to accept that there are many <Col N="1601" /> unions which do not get the protection of legislation put through this House.</P>
    <P>The other general point I would like to make is that the measure is restricted only to the house and the garden around the house.  Most couples, and mainly wives, have put in years of effort and coming together in a marriage and they find they are getting the right only to the dwelling house and nothing else.  Wives who have put in endless hours of work in the family and in their home are not getting any right under this legislation to any other property that may be owned by the husband or the unit.  Perhaps that will lead to injustice.  There are injustices already where the matrimonial home is already in the joint names, but other property owned mainly by the husband is not.  Many wives whom I have dealt with do not even know what property the husband owns.  If there was a break up it would be impossible to find out what property the husband had because of the various intricacies of legislation and the way in which property can be put into different peoples' names.  That could be examined.  I am not saying the wife should be given an absolute entitlement to the extra land &mdash; when I say &ldquo;wife&rdquo; I mean the other spouse &mdash; as in the home she is given an absolute entitlement.  But there should be some facility whereby that wife would be in some way entitled to an equitable interest, as it is called, in the balance of the land.  I pose the question as to whether it would be possible to give perhaps a limited interest to the wife in that situation.  Perhaps the wife could be given a life interest in the balance of the land; whereas she would be given an absolute interest in the dwelling house, she would be given a life interest in the estate.</P>
    <P>I listened through Question Time and tried to get in on another issue yesterday when the Minister was here.  When Deputy Harney was questioning the Minister I heard the phrase &ldquo;gender proofing&rdquo;. I was amazed at it and wondered what it was.  Somebody asked the Minister whether the National Development Plan was gender proofed.  I have looked at the explanatory memorandum and the <Col N="1602" /> phrase has no legal meaning.  But for the interest of our female participants here on page 2 there is a phrase &ldquo;implications for women&rdquo; of the legislation.  There is no mention of the men there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to bring a basic layman's perception to this debate.  Like previous speakers I should like to give a wholehearted welcome to the Bill.  It is not before its time and it will have the full and generous support of the House because the principle behind it is good. Most of the newspaper comments following the publication of the Bill described it as clearing a major obstacle for a proposed divorce referendum next year.  As the Minister, and other speakers said, this Bill is much more important than simply being a prelude to a divorce referendum.  It is important in that it gives recognition to hundreds of thousands of people here.  The Minister said that 700,000 people who have absolutely no statutory property rights or entitlements will have an advantage following the enactment of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the possibility of a divorce referendum and its success or otherwise I support the views of Deputy Harney.  There is a common perception that the Government, in this and other planned legislation, is moving smoothly towards holding a divorce referendum and that the public will pass it.  I do not <Col N="1603" /> agree with that assessment.  As the referendum day approaches the fears, worries and concerns will increase and there will be many of the same type of scare stories which were circulating in 1986.</P>
    <P>A difficult campaign lies ahead for those &mdash; myself included &mdash; who advocate such legislation.  In that regard I noted a comment made by the Minister at his press conference last week that the extension of statutory joint ownership to farms and property would be looked at in the fullness of time but would not be in place before the divorce referendum in June 1994.  If the Minister is expecting to &ldquo;look at joint ownership of farms and property in the fullness of time&rdquo; he would need to indicate clearly, before the divorce referendum, what the likely result would be.  We do not need any seeds of doubt to be sown during a divorce referendum campaign and certainly the &ldquo;F&rdquo; word, the question of the farm, is one on which we need clarification.  We need to hear more than &ldquo;the matter will be looked at in the fullness of time&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill and I hope, as a result of this and Committee Stage debate which I expect will be lengthy and detailed, we will produce good workable legislation.  We all hope this legislation will not cause confusion, legal chaos or end up in the courts.  The fact that section 4 applies to matrimonial homes in existence six months following the passing of the Bill will cause some people to consider a legal challenge.  We cannot argue with the concept of the legislation.  There will be an opt out clause and everybody should be covered by it but there could be difficulties justifying the inclusion of existing dwellings.</P>
    <P>I am informed by some legal friends that the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, the Family Law Act, 1981, and the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, could in some cases offer sufficient protection to the cases which existed prior to the enactment of this legislation.  It is because of that that there are genuine grounds for fearing that a case could be made that the application of this Bill to existing dwellings would be <Col N="1604" /> tipping the balance against the individual property rights guaranteed by the Constitution. In that regard it would be preferable if the matter was referred by the President to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality.  We do not want challenges to the legislation in three, four or five years.  That could cause legal chaos. We must try to avoid what happened in regard to the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, which was before the courts for further debate and discussion up to 1979.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill will significantly increase the cost of property conveyancing.  Title investigations will need to be more detailed and new statutory declarations will be required.  Legal advice for both spouses and intending spouses will be required.  There will be a need to ensure that both parties have detailed and separate legal advice, all of which will cost money.  It will be essential to have an improved or expanded scheme of civil legal aid.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there will be further litigation between spouses in some cases and that may concern the principle asset, namely the property of the couple.  Both sides will need full legal representation. In many instances, due to economic circumstances couples may not be able to afford private legal representation and will have to seek access to civil legal aid. The present scheme does not offer that protection and will need to be expanded.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that the application of the Act can be excluded where, having regard to the circumstances of the spouses, it would be unjust not to do so. In regard to the general opt out clause in section 7 I agree with much of what Deputy McManus said but I should like some clarification on the whole concept of the opt out clause.  Due to its open-ended state many problems will arise and there will be much confusion.  Why did the Minister consider it necessary to include that clause?  How frequently does he expect it to come into play?  What difficulties will it cause?</P>
    <P>Under section 6 the court is given power to exclude an application where it feels it would be unjust not to do so.  This <Col N="1605" /> power will be at the discretion of the Judiciary &mdash; in most cases the District Court &mdash; and will be at the whim of individual judges.  Is the Minister confident that there will be consistency and common application in these instances? Obviously the Minister sees the need for this section.  Will the Minister set out the precise circumstances when these provisions would be needed?  The Dáil should be leading rather than following the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>The Minister made it clear that in most cases the District Court would become the focal point of this legislation.  He stated through the media that the fact that most cases would be dealt with in the District Court was advantageous because it was cheap and accessible, but I would question that entire concept.  The District Court will deal with all matrimonial property cases with a valuation not exceeding £25, which will include the majority of dwellings costing £50,000, £60,000 or £70,000.  Yet at present District Court jurisdiction is limited to cases not exceeding £5,000.  Since the foundation of the State District Courts have had no jurisdiction in regard to property matters and now all matrimonial property cases will come before those courts for judgment.  I would question whether we should be taking such a major step. The District Courts will now have a greatly increased workload and I would ask the Minister to comment on that matter.</P>
    <P>The majority of appeals from District Court cases are limited in scope and nature.  People owning houses with a valuation of less than £25 &mdash; the majority of people in this country &mdash; will have their cases heard in the District Court with little possibility of appeal to the higher courts if that is necessary.  The size and value of one's house will determine one's final court of appeal on matters relating to this legislation.  We must also examine the structure of our District Courts.  Staffing levels at present cannot be described as adequate to deal with the increased workload following the enactment of this legislation.  We must examine the matter of backup staff, court facilities, the <Col N="1606" /> number of judges and so on if the entire legal system is not to become blocked up with such cases.</P>
    <P>I welcome wholeheartedly the concept of this legislation.  The fact we are having a debate on this matter in such a mature fashion illustrates how far this country has moved forward from the era when such legislation would probably have brought people out on the streets in protest and, as the Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, stated earlier, prompted preaching from the pulpit.  The Ireland of the nineties is a relatively modern one requiring modern legislation and this is a move in the right direction.  The Minister indicated his willingness to examine areas where problems may arise.  I hope I have pointed out a few of the difficulties which may arise, in particular the one relating to the constitutionality of the legislation. The Minister should address that in the immediate future so that we will not have a problem in that regard in five or six years' time involving many legal difficulties.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's reply and commend him on this important legislation.  He can be assured that he will have the full and constructive support of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome wholeheartedly the legislation before us.  This Bill, when enacted, will give spouses equal rights in the ownership of the family home.  It is an important Bill and stands on its merits.  It is another step along the way to the recognition of the equal status of women in marriage and in society in general.  It is regrettable that it has taken so long to have such a fundamental principle of equality recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this juncture we should reflect on the traditional perception of the common law that prevailed as late as the 19th century in relation to a woman's role as perceived by the society of that era.  The married women was regarded as subservient to her husband and the husband had proprietary rights over her.  A woman did not have contractual capacity and property owned by a woman at the <Col N="1607" /> time of her marriage automatically became that of her husband.  The harshness of those common law rules was ameliorated somewhat by the development of equitable principles by the Courts of Equity.  Deputy Ahern reflected on Lord Denning's contribution in relation to the development of the equitable principles which served as the basis for advancement.  In that regard I would reflect on cases such as <i>Gissing v. Gissing</i> and <i>Pettit v. Pettit</i> which served as the benchmark for advancement in relation to equitable principles.</P>
    <P>Even in death, the law leaned heavily in favour of husbands and the rules of succession to property reflected the prevailing ethos of the day.  In the latter half of the 19th century we had the first significant signs of a change in that chauvinistic view by society of women's role therein.</P>
    <P>The Married Women's Property Act, 1882, altered the common law position to allow married women acquire, hold and dispose of property by will or otherwise. That provision covered any real or personal property as her separate property as if she was a <i>femme sole</i>.  Section 17 of that Act provided that either party could have property disputes resolved by application to the court which would then make the appropriate order.  Other changes in the law took place in relation to the legal position of spouses regarding their property, culminating in the passing of the Married Women's Status Act, 1957.  The jurisprudence of trust was thus developed by the Judiciary and utilised extensively in the resolution of disputes arising under section 12 of the 1957 Act. I note that section 3 of this Bill states that section 12 of the 1957 Act will be replaced and I will refer to that on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Women play a crucial and pivotal role in sustaining the fabric of family life and it is important that is reflected in the laws of the land.  There have been other notable advances in the law concerning the security of the family home.  The basic purpose of section 3 of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, was to protect the <Col N="1608" /> family home by giving a right of avoidance to the spouse who was not a party to the transaction.  It ensured this protection by requiring for the validity of the contract that the non-disposing spouse should have given a prior consent in writing.</P>
    <P>As a practising lawyer I discovered that people, particularly women, frequently believe that section automatically gives them the right now being given in this legislation, but that is a misconception. It was nothing more than a negative right in that it prevented the unilateral disposition of property.  Many people thought that gave them a share in the property.  It is amazing how many people I have met, even in the last six months, who thought they already had the right this Bill is giving them.  Section 3 was a major advance for the non-owning spouse but it was nothing more than a negative right.  Section 4 of the Act provided a procedure for dispensing with the consent of a spouse where that consent was unreasonably withheld and subject to certain conditions as judicially extrapolated.</P>
    <P>A 1988 High Court judgment held that the wife was not, on the basis of established authority, entitled to a beneficial interest in the family home unless she had made a direct or indirect contribution in money or money's worth towards the acquisition of the property.</P>
    <P>However, the court concluded that having regard to Article 41.2 of the Constitution, a woman such as the respondent in that case, who elected to adopt the full-time role of a wife and mother in the home, should have her work as home maker and caring for her family in the family home taken into account in calculating her contribution towards the purchase of the family home.</P>
    <P>This was overturned by a Supreme Court decision in December 1991 which ruled that to allow the courts to extend the circumstances in which a wife may claim a beneficial interest in the family home to a situation where she has made no direct or indirect financial contribution to the acquisition of the property or to a family fund but has performed <Col N="1609" /> the constitutionally preferred role of wife and mother in the home would not be to develop any principle known to the common law but rather to create an entirely new right.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court further stated that unless the foregoing result was clearly and unambiguously warranted by the Constitution or were necessary for the protection of a specified or unspecified right provided by the Constitution, such a course of action would constitute legislation, would be a usurpation by the courts of the function of the Oireachtas, and would represent an invasion by the Judiciary into the legislative domain.</P>
    <P>The Judiciary decided that, under the separation of powers, it could not embark upon that process.  They certainly gave a clear indication to the Oireachtas that it could legislate for the result of that High Court decision.  Many people have waited patiently for the past 18 months for this legislative void to be filled.  Thankfully, my colleague, Deputy Taylor, Minister for Equality and Law Reform, has brought forward this important legislation within six months of taking office.</P>
    <P>Article 41 of the Constitution contains the following relevant constitutional provisions: Article 41.1.1º &mdash;&ldquo;The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.&rdquo;; Article 41.1.2º &mdash;&ldquo;The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the Family in its Constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State&rdquo;; Article 41.2.1º was particularly relevant to the case I mentioned and is as follows: &ldquo;In particular, the State recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the State support without which the common good cannot be achieved&rdquo;; Article 41.2.2º &mdash;&ldquo;The State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.&rdquo;  These may sound aspirational, but they are in the <Col N="1610" /> Constitution.  Therefore, a woman who leaves the home and carries out remunerated work and contributes to the repayment of a mortgage directly, or indirectly by contributing to the family pool, would derive a share in the family home proportionate to the contribution made.  This would lead to the anomalous position where the wife who followed the preferred and endorsed constitutional activity of staying at home and looking after the family would be in a less advantageous position with regard to ownership of or an interest in the family home. This Bill, which encourages a full sharing of ownership in the family home, will contribute to the stability of marriage, the institution of a family, and the common good.</P>
    <P>The doctrine of constructive or resulting trusts, which has been elaborated upon in numerous judicial decisions, had as its basic requirement a contribution of money towards the acquisition of the family home: this could arise either by direct contribution to the purchase price or from indirect contributions by provision through earnings of moneys into the family pool.  The Oireachtas has already, by the Act of 1989, made statutory provision for property adjustment orders on the granting of a decree of judicial separation or at anytime thereafter.</P>
    <P>Section 20 (2) (f) of that Act obliged the court when making a property adjustment order on the granting of a decree of judicial separation to have regard <i>inter alia</i> to &ldquo;the contribution which each of the spouses has made or is likely in the foreseeable future to make to the welfare of the family, including the contributions made by each spouse to the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of the other and any contribution by looking after the home or caring for the family&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I note from the provisions of the Bill that the definition of a matrimonial home differs somewhat from the definition of the family home as set out in the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, in that the definition of a family home in this Bill is more expansive as once a matrimonial <Col N="1611" /> home comes into existence it remains a matrimonial home even after the couple have gone to live elsewhere, and the equal entitlement of the spouses to its ownership remains intact until the home is disposed of.  That is an important provision. I welcome the fact that the definition of a matrimonial home has been extended to include a house obtained from the local authority and subject to a weekly tenancy.  This Bill will facilitate the smooth transfer of such houses to the tenant who remains in the House should the other spouse opt to leave.</P>
    <P>The Bill, and section 4 thereof, provides that statutory joint ownership will apply to all existing and future matrimonial homes unless they are already in joint ownership or unless both spouses or intending spouses decide otherwise. This will be a significant boost to many of the 700,000 women who currently work full-time in the home.  This measure overcomes the difficulty whereby a spouse who worked full-time in the family home did not heretofore acquire any share in the ownership of the family home by virtue of her work.  From a legal point of view, the fact of vesting existing and future matrimonial homes and household chattels in both spouses as joint owners will facilitate the surviving spouse in becoming owner of the joint interests upon the death of the other spouse.</P>
    <P>From a legal point of view vesting future and existing matrimonial homes and household chattels in both spouses as joint owners will facilitate the surviving spouse becoming owner of the joint interest upon the death of the other spouse.</P>
    <P>I note the Bill does not apply to the farm proper but only to the farmhouse and any land in the vicinity that is subsidiary and ancillary to it is required for its amenity or convenience and is not used or developed commercially.</P>
    <P>This Bill stands on its merits.  Other Deputies have referred to the proposed divorce referendum in June 1994 and matters relating to it should be attended to.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1612" /> I would like to draw attention to section 4 (8) which states:</P>
    <P>(a)  Where, immediately before the application of subsection (2) or (3) to a matrimonial home, an interest in the home or dwelling concerned was or is held (whether alone or with other land) by a person (&ldquo;the spouse&rdquo;) who was or who, upon such application, becomes one of the spouses concerned and one or more other persons as joint tenants, then, upon such application&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the joint tenancy shall become and be severed,</P>
    <P>(ii)  the spouse and the other person or persons shall hold the interest aforesaid as tenants in common in equal shares,</P>
    <P>(iii)  the share of the spouse in the tenancy in common shall, by virtue of such application, be held by him and the other spouse as joint tenants, and</P>
    <P>(iv)  in case any land other than the home or dwelling was held on the joint tenancy existing immediately before such application, that land shall continue to be held by the spouse concerned and the other person or persons as joint tenants.</P>
    <P>(b)  Paragraph (a) applies to the case where the interest referred to therein was held by the persons who were or who, upon the application aforesaid, became the spouses concerned as it applies to the case specified in that paragraph, with any necessary modifications.</P>
    <P>That is a technical provision.  It is often the position in rural Ireland that one spouse may be a joint tenant and hold an interest in the family home with one or more persons, for example a brother. This section deals with that position.  It is a praiseworthy Bill which provides a neat technical adjustment for dealing with this problem.  Joint tenancy will be severed and become a tenancy in common, with each of the original owners, including the spouse holding it in equal shares.  Under <Col N="1613" /> a tenancy in common where the tenants hold equal shares each tenant may dispose of his or her share by will, whereas under a joint tenancy each tenant's share passes on death to the surviving joint tenant or tenants.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (8) provides that the spouses' share of the tenancy in common will become vested in both spouses as joint tenants.  This section is concerned only with the subsisting joint tenancy of the matrimonial home.  Thus if property was held under the joint tenancy that property will continue to be held by the spouse and the other person or persons concerned as joint tenants.  This is an important provision.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to a number of exclusions provided in relation to the application of section 4.  Spouses are allowed to decide between themselves as to the nature of the ownership of the matrimonial home.  Deputy Harney and other Deputies referred to section 7 and I would have some reservations in that regard.  That section allows spouses to contract out of the application of the Bill and its statutory joint tenancy therein created.  It is incumbent on the Minister to prepare an agreement and regulations on the contracting out provision as this is an area where undue influence might be applied.  Somebody in a vulnerable position might readily waive his or her right. Any contracting out in this fashion should be accompanied by legal advice.</P>
    <P>I look forward to this Bill being examined in detail on Committee Stage and I compliment the Minister on introducing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the introduction of what has been referred to as an automatic regime of community property for married couples.  There is great inequality in the traditional marriage, particularly in regard to the division of property and in the recognition of the contribution made by the spouse, more often the woman who stays at home.  This was not always the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 7th and early 8th century women were granted extensive rights, particularly in regard to marriage, divorce and <Col N="1614" /> property.  This was the position in secular law.  Under the early Irish church law, while separation or divorce was possible in the case of adultery, one could take on another spouse during the lifetime of the first spouse.  O'Corrain stated:</P>
    <P>The evidence, secular and ecclesiastical alike, would tend to indicate that the older customs remained the norm.  Despite the intense activity of the twelfth century reformers, secular marriage with its tolerant attitude to divorce continued in Ireland until the close of the middle ages.</P>
    <P>The wide-ranging and flexible grounds for divorce available to women under the Brehon laws &ldquo;served as a guarantee of extensive women's rights and protected women in a way which was remarkably different from the customs of other European countries.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Depending on one's outlook the possibility of an easy dissolution of marriage will be evaluated differently, but the care which was evident for the individual personality of the woman in Irish marriage law at that time contrasts favourably with the unrespected position of women in earlier times in other societies and latterly in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Historians view the Norman invasion of 1169 which was followed by the imposition of English law in the early 17th century as having a curtailing effect on the development of these Gaelic customs. It has been said that modern Ireland enjoys no continuity with its Gaelic past in its attitude to women and their place in society.  I agree with that view.</P>
    <P>Following the Norman invasion when we were partly conquered and apparently colonised, the Gaels and the Anglo-Normans lived side by side for more than 400 years in two different communities, each with their own legal system.  Gaels continued to live under the Brehon law although it was modified somewhat in the latter period.  Anglo-Normans lived under the English common law system. The English common law system reflected the standard legal practice in most of western Europe at the time and <Col N="1615" /> it was much less egalitarian than the Brehon laws in the rights it accorded to women.</P>
    <P>The position of Irish women did not deteriorate until the conquest and plantations of the 16th and 17th centuries by the English.  From that time until the famine according to O'Tuathaigh &ldquo;women were totally without formal political rights;...  Their property and inheritance rights both within and outside of marriage were now governed by English Common Law, and...their's was a subjective and subsidiary role to the male, and it was performed for the most part within the domestic context&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The great famine in the mid-19th century further weakened the position of women in Irish society.  Before the famine women had an important role in the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors. One of the main effects of the famine was to wipe out the spinning industry which was a major source of womens' independent income.  Womens' role in agriculture became more diminished as agriculture became more focused on livestock and less on tillage and thus became less labour intensive. It followed that the deterioration in the economic status of women affected their marriage prospects and made them vulnerable to male dominance.  This helped to explain the growing importance of the dowry after the famine.  Daughters became more dependent on their fathers and less independent in choosing their spouse.  Professor J. Lee is particularly interesting in analysing the position from this point forward.  His view of the position of women in Irish society following the famine deserves to be quoted.  He stated:</P>
    <P>Farmers would not normally dower two daughters.  That would dissipate their savings, and drag the family down in the social scale.  Marriage might be a sacrament, but for the farmer the marriage contract was essentially a commercial transaction, and it devalued the family currency to put two daughters on the marriage market.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1616" /> Deputy McManus stated earlier that this issue was mainly to do with property. Apparently, some things never change. Professor Lee continued:</P>
    <P>A society dominated by strong farmers and providing little female employment, inevitably denied most of its children the chance of rearing a family in the country.  It was, therefore, crucial to maintain the economic dominance of the new order, that all thoughts of marriage in Ireland should be banished from the minds of the majority of Irish youth.  Temptation must not be placed in their way.  Sex, therefore, must be denounced as a satanic snare, in even what had been its most innocent pre-famine manifestations. Sex posed a far more subversive threat than the landlord to the security and status of the family.  Boys and girls must be kept apart at all costs. Economic circumstances, therefore, conspired to make Ireland an increasingly male dominated society after the famine.</P>
    <P>Lee goes on to say that the rise of the strong farmer coincided with the growth in clerical power and a new public obsession with sexual morality generally, easily understandable in this context.</P>
    <P>Events did not change significantly until 1882, with the introduction of the Married Woman's Property Act, which altered the common law provision at the time.  We have struggled on slowly since then.  In 1957 the Married Woman's Status Act was introduced, followed by the Family Home Protection Act in 1976 and the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act of 1989.  That brings us to the Bill before us today, the Matrimonial Home Bill, 1993.  I welcome the introduction of this Bill because it brings us back to our Gaelic past and the Brehon laws, which unfortunately, were lost for several centuries, in our treatment of women, particularly women within marriage.</P>
    <P>I commend the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women in relation to issues in this area.  Many of my colleagues quoted extensively from <Col N="1617" /> this report earlier today.  The Minister does not appear to go as far as some of the recommendations in that report and perhaps when concluding Second Stage he might indicate his willingness to progress a little further in this area.  Perhaps he has been advised by the Attorney General that this is as far as he can safely go at this point.  I understand that there may be some constitutional queries about the Bill before us even in its present form. There is a fine balance in our Constitution in terms of property rights and, indeed, the protection of the family generally.</P>
    <P>I would be pleased to hear the Minister's views when responding to Second Stage as to the recourse to advice that he has in this area and I hope that he can say with some conviction that no constitutional queries should arise concerning this Bill when it is passed.  This may perhaps be the first item of legislation that President Robinson will refer to the Supreme Court for constitutional consideration.  I hope that is not the case because I would not like to see this legislation delayed unnecessarily.  However, if there is to be a constitutional query it is better to have it resolved at an early stage.</P>
    <P>Why does this Bill not apply to couples living apart until six months after it has been enacted?  The Minister stated earlier:</P>
    <P>To constitute a matrimonial home the dwelling concerned must be one in which a married couple are ordinarily resident when the Act comes into force &mdash; that is, six months after the Bill is enacted &mdash; or at any time afterwards. Couples who are living apart at present will not be affected by the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am a little concerned about this aspect of the Bill because there are many couples at the moment living apart who have made no final decision as to what to do with the family home.  Usually one spouse has moved out and perhaps they are presently in negotiation with solicitors. They have not proceeded under any of the legislation presently on the Statute Book, namely, the Family Home Protection Act or the Judicial Separation and <Col N="1618" /> Family Law Reform Act.  Many of these couples have been waiting for the past few years to see what legislative response would be forthcoming from the Supreme Court case of December 1991.  They were waiting to see how the Minister would respond in the hope that it would resolve their particular dilemma.  If because of tensions and other difficulties one spouse has left the family home but has not proceeded to tidy up his or her affairs in the eyes of the law, and if such people are to be excluded from the terms of this Bill, we are doing an enormous injustice to them.  Perhaps the Minister might elaborate on the reason for this provision in the Bill.  Would the Minister reconsider it?  I can understand if a case has already been taken under the Family Home Protection Act or the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act by couples who have already separated.  I realise it might be difficult in those cases to begin applying various items of legislation in that situation.  One cannot reopen cases that have been dealt with satisfactorily as far as the law goes at present.  However, couples who have not proceeded to tidy up their affairs legally should be allowed the benefit of the provisions of this Act, even if they are required to wait six months.  Why is it necessary to exclude those who may not be living together at present?  I find that hard to understand and enormous injustice may be done to many couples in relation to that.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be doing a great service, particularly to many women, if he insisted that the opt out clause in section 7 was only made use of following legal advice being taken.  In fact, I would like to see it being compulsory that a spouse coming into the property could only opt out if they obtained sound legal advice and produced evidence of that advice.  None of us entering into a marriage believes that anything can go wrong.  No one would get married if they thought that separation or divorce would be the outcome.  No one enters a marriage contract with that in mind.  Therefore, it would be easy to accept an opt-out clause unless the matter was explained carefully by an independent solicitor to <Col N="1619" /> the spouse marrying into the property, which is usually the woman.  This area should be tidied up so that those entering a marriage who do not believe anything will go wrong in the future, will not be gulled into signing a contract without realising the full implications of what they are doing.  They must have some sort of protection before signing any opt out clause.</P>
    <P>The position regarding the liability for any pre-marital debts or any charges on the house that subsequently would become the matrimonial home requires clarification.  This usually involves the woman, who would be protected under this Bill before us today.  Is it absolutely clear that these women will not be taking on additional debts and charges that were incurred prior to the marriage if the marriage breaks down following a number of years?  I would like clarification in this area because joint ownership of the family home is of tremendous benefit as long as one is not including joint ownership of a large bank debt or a charge of some other financial institution.  It must be made clear that this is a benefit we are conferring on the spouse that will be staying at home, usually the woman, rather than a financial noose being put around their necks.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  It represents the first step along the road in this area. There is no doubt that the last referendum on divorce was lost mainly due to fears in relation to property considerations, fears that could not be answered satisfactorily by many of the politicians who were trying to sell the case that was being made by the Government at the time. This Bill will allay the majority of those fears.  For some, it does not go far enough in dividing up property but for the average Irish family it will allay the fears and allow at least for reasoned consideration of divorce rather than dealing with it from a property perspective.  People will be able to make up their minds on the real issues involved rather than living in terror of being put on the road, as was the case in the mid-eighties when the last <Col N="1620" /> referendum was held.  Fine Gael will be supporting the Bill and I hope on Committee Stage the members of the committee will have an opportunity to tease out matters of concern.</P>

      <P>The effect of the Government decision on Aer Lingus will be the write-off of 1,500 jobs and the sell-out of Shannon airport and the mid-west region.  The decision runs totally contrary to Fianna Fáil and Labour policy on regionalisation and decentralisation and represents a total reversal of commitments made in this House on 27 and 28 October last by speakers from both parties and during the subsequent election campaign.  The Tánaiste, Deputy Dick Spring &mdash; I am glad he is present this evening &mdash; when commenting on the decision by Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, the then Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, not to change the Shannon status, said here on 27 October 1992, at columns 891-92 of the Official Report:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I never believed that a Government decision to desert Shannon would help Aer Lingus and I have always argued that the Shannon issue should be treated as an issue of regional rather than aviation policy, but I condemn the dithering in which the Minister has indulged on this issue.  She has allowed <Col N="1622" /> and encouraged fear of the future, and uncertainty about the prospects of economic survival, to prevail throughout the mid-west for far longer than was necessary and she has set one region of the country against another in a way that has been most unhelpful for the economic development of both regions.</P>
    <P>I wonder how the people in the mid-west feel now.  The Tánaiste has made a complete U-turn on his commitment to maintain the Shannon status.  On the same occasion you referred to the response by the Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, to the Aer Lingus crisis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste said at column 894 of the Official Report of the same day:</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's response to the crisis of Aer Lingus was sadly another unfortunate example of his glib, unthinking and cavalier approach to any issue of major importance.  This Taoiseach, it appears, does not know the difference between partnership and privatisation, between strategic alliances and asset-stripping, or perhaps he just does not care at this stage. He is at his most revealing when saying the first thing that comes into his head and what he has revealed about his grasp of Ireland's national interest in this area does not bode well for the future of Aer Lingus and this country.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste's words on that occasion were prophetic.  Obviously his attitude towards the Taoiseach has since changed.</P>

      <P>The abandoning of the Shannon status will have a devastating <Col N="1623" /> effect on the mid-west, including Kerry and throughout the west.  It will lead to loss of confidence and a resulting loss of investment in the region.  It is well known that considerably more US tourists who disembark in Shannon make their way to Kerry and remain longer than those who disembark in Dublin.  Hotels, guest-houses, car hire firms and all other sectors of the tourist industry will suffer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I finish briefly? The most serious aspect of the sell-out on the Shannon status by the Government is the damage it will do to democratic politics in Ireland.  Only weeks before the last general election both Fianna Fáil and Labour gave cast iron guarantees that the Shannon stopover would be retained in its current structure and would not be interfered with.  The people of the west, south-west and north County Dublin have been grossly misled and conned by senior politicians and current Ministers. Democracy and truth are the casualties of the Government decision, as are some of the commercial and tourist interests in the mid-west, including those in County Kerry and throughout the west.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the Cabinet sub-committee on aviation, I have examined with my colleagues the strategy put forward by the executive chairman of Aer Lingus and the painful implications for all concerned.  We have consulted widely with ICTU, Aer Rianta, Shannon Status, Signal and a host of other groups and organisations on these issues.  I have examined the proposals bearing in mind the specific commitment that we gave in the Programme for a Partnership <Col N="1624" /> Government that we would ensure the commercial future of our national airline as part of our overall air transport policy. The action we have taken is a fulfilment of that commitment.</P>
      <P>There is an overwhelming need for an injection of equity into Aer Lingus to deal with the accumulating £1 million per week loss in the company.  I believe there is no choice but to capitalise on the non-core business assets, such as the hotel chain, and to alter the present status of the Shannon stopover.  Payroll costs have also to be addressed.</P>
      <P>The Government commitment is completely predicated on the basis of management and unions negotiating a viable operational plan for the company to bring it back into profit over the next two to three years.  I am confident that the trade unions and management of Aer Lingus will agree because their future is at stake and both sides are committed to the survival of the national airline.</P>
      <P>In the process of negotiation with the trade unions and management the Government is not saying &ldquo;you have no choice but to accept what is on offer&rdquo;. There are options within a framework. For our part, we have simply put in place a number of supports and protections for the company.  Taken together with the series of cost reductions and approval for the package from the European Commission, the Government will make, on behalf of the taxpayer, what is a truly massive sum of money available over the next three years to restore Aer Lingus to profit and viability.  It is a much better option than the privatisation that was promised by the Progressive Democrats and Fine Gael.</P>

      <P>The Shannon stop is not being scrapped; it is simply being changed.  Last October undertakings were given in good faith but nobody realised the deeply precarious state of the finances and the scale and extent of losses in Aer Lingus.  We have now arrived at the juncture where we are dealing with the survival of this national asset, and we intend to maintain it as a national asset. I, with my colleagues, intend to ensure the future of this company in public ownership.  The future progress of both Aer Lingus and Shannon are inextricably linked.  Success for Aer Lingus means that Shannon will be the location for the headquarters of a significant new company in the Aer Lingus family.  No reduction in flights in or out of Shannon will take place.  My Department is monitoring the industrial and economic infrastructure of the mid-west region to ensure that any impact from the change in status of Shannon will be minimised.  The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications will negotiate changes to the present bilateral agreement with the United States.  I have every confidence that Shannon Airport and its associated entities will continue to make a significant contribution to the mid-west region.  I have much faith in Shannon and in SFADCo.</P>
      <P>The bargain that is essentially being struck here is that the Government, on behalf of the taxpayer, is giving £175 million in equity on the understanding that negotiations will result in the much needed reduction in overhead costs in the company.  I know all sides are committed to achieving as far as possible the reduction in numbers required in Aer Lingus through a voluntary scheme.  The question of participation by Aer Lingus employees in the future success of the company should be dealt with as a tangible form of recognition, with an additional contribution being asked of the workforce during the present crisis.</P>
      <P>I expect management will be sensitive to the whole question of redundancies, bearing in mind the essential need to preserve the skills-base of the company and to maintain all services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1626" /> I remind the House that we are not entirely sovereign in these issues.  The European Community has a vital say in the field of aviation in the Single Market. The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications will be seeking, as a matter of urgency, the formal approval of the EC Commission for the Government's strategy and in particular its sanction for the proposed investment of equity in the company &mdash; probably a never to be repeated opportunity under current Community law.  I am conscious that the credit lines to the company expire at the end of August.  I believe that all parties will work to have an agreement in place by then.  Aer Lingus is a symbol of our national pride and it is simply tragic that through a series of mistakes and errors it has got itself into its present situation.</P>
    <P>The Government will do all in its power to secure the future of the national airline, but it cannot work on its own.  I pledge that my Department will assist in the process of negotiation in every way. I understand that the Chief Executive of the Labour Relations Commission is in touch with both sides about the overall situation in Aer Lingus.  I am particularly conscious that the commission is available at all times to TEAM to assist both parties to resolve the difficulties they currently have.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out earlier, under European competition law our ability to help is effectively a one-shot operation.  That is why we must get it right this time. There have been huge changes in the world in the last few years and this Government is committed to monitoring that change to ensure as few negative consequences as possible for the Irish economy.  I recognise, however, that change has to happen and that change must be effective.  We intend to have the political courage to recognise that and to manage that change.</P>

I could not possibly vote for the Government amendment were it not for the alternative.  The alternative to getting to grips with the Aer Lingus problems would be a catastrophe in about a year.  It is difficult for me to vote for the Government amendment tonight, but it would be virtually impossible for me to support a political party whose only approach to Aer Lingus in the past has been to cut deeper and to propose privatising the company.</P>

      <P>Aer Lingus is not the only airline to have been affected by the worldwide downturn in the aviation business. The airline business is changing rapidly. Everyone knows that air transport is undergoing a revolution.  Neither the Government nor the Labour Party can change that reality.  We can and must act now to try to equip Aer Lingus to face the future with confidence.  A first step is to provide equity.  The injection of equity that has been decided by the Government can only be seen as a first step.  If more is ultimately needed we should not allow our hands to be tied and our vital national interest threatened by bureaucratic European rules.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that the French or German Governments would allow themselves to be told that they cannot do what any normal prudent shareholder would do if there was a need for equity in any of their assets.</P>
      <P>In addition the emphasis in the negotiations that will now begin must be on the need to reach agreement.  I do not want to be told in one month's time that the management of the company is only going through the motions which is what it did in relation to the consultation process undertaken earlier.  Neither do I want to be told that it is essential, to secure the airline's future, that management be given <i>carte blanche</i> to decide who they want to fire.  For this reason it is essential that a proper negotiating structure is established to monitor all discussions and to ensure that the agenda is not tilted in favour of one side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESB Industrial Council could be used as a model given as it is geared to act as a problem solving body.  It would facilitate the adoption of an even-handed and open approach to serious issues, none of which will be more serious than those which will have to be dealt with in Aer Lingus in the coming months.  If agreement is to be reached much more than goodwill will be required, honesty and openness will also be required, two <Col N="1631" /> characteristics which have not been hallmarks of Aer Lingus management in recent years.</P>
    <P>We should recognise that the solution to the problems of Aer Lingus is not in redundancies.  As I understand it, the company is seeking to reduce its payroll costs by £34 million annually across the group.  The union members to whom I have spoken fully recognise that there is a need for large scale cost reductions and many have said that they are prepared to put forward imaginative ideas to reduce costs and increase the competitiveness of the company's support services without the need for job losses.  Indeed, they should only be considered as a last resort.</P>
    <P>That is not a naive or simplistic proposition. Every Member of this House knows that job losses are inevitable but the number does not have to be as great as the media headlines would have us believe if all sides approach the issue determined to minimise the number.  If there must be redundancies I share the determination of my colleagues that they will be voluntary.  The package put together and approved by the Government should help to ease the hardship involved.  The Enterprise Development Unit, which can capitalise on the skills and talents right across the company in seeking new opportunities, must be properly resourced.  We do not want any cosmetic exercise.</P>
    <P>It is my sincere hope that the plan for Aer Lingus will work.  We have little choice but to accept that the plan put together is being presented in good faith. However, there must be no hidden agendas.  The late Frank Cluskey once said that there were two reasons to prune a tree, first to encourage further growth and the other vandalism.  If there is a hidden agenda to prepare Aer Lingus for privatisation that would amount to vandalism of one of our greatest national assets.  We are voting to try to secure the future of the company; we will never vote for vandalism.</P>

      <P>When I came into the House tonight I was not seeking concessions <Col N="1632" /> or quarter from anybody; I always speak my mind.  Tonight I am speaking on my own behalf and on behalf of my Oireachtas colleagues in the mid-west. I will not pretend I am voting on behalf of somebody else; I know what I am voting for and I will not resign from the party on this question.  I do not believe in histrionics as they achieve little.  One can make pyrrhic gestures to gain headlines in the newspapers but that is all they are good for.</P>
      <P>I understand that two of my parliamentary colleagues in the Clare constituency have resigned the party Whip but that is a matter for them.  It is important to understand that Clare is a volatile constituency, almost as volatile as the constituency of Limerick East where there have been many casualties during the past ten to 12 years.  Indeed, I have seen a few off myself during that period. Two Senators are waiting in the wings in the Clare constituency.  There was an example of people breaking ranks in Limerick but some time later the people concerned returned to the fold.  As far as I am concerned, that is not the source of deep divisions.  If, however, somebody leaves the party and remains outside for between ten and 20 years that would be a source of division and an important issue but there is no point resigning and letting others do the work.  I will stand my ground on this issue and speak my mind in this House and elsewhere.  It would be easy for me to resign and gain headlines on the issue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The plan before the Government, whatever its shortcomings, is the only one that has been presented.  I have neither <Col N="1633" /> seen nor heard about any other plan produced by a party in this House.  Time is not on our side and Aer Lingus will go to the wall in a matter of weeks if some plan is not implemented.  The aviation sector is volatile and Aer Lingus will have a desperate struggle to survive.</P>
    <P>The change in the status of Shannon has been signalled for some time by leaks to the press and other means.  I fear that industry and tourists will drift towards the eastern seaboard.  We must fight and guard against this but there will still be no guarantee that Aer Lingus will survive; indeed, only time will tell if Shannon will survive.</P>
    <P>This morning it was heartening to hear Dr. Brendan O'Regan, a founding father of Shannon, speak about this issue in a calm objective and measured way.  He is no longer young but he was full of hope and optimism which I share.  Despite his own difficulties in GPA, Dr. Tony Ryan recently, in speaking about the sterile debate on the Shannon versus Dublin issue, said that we should not get bogged down on this question and should look beyond it.  While I do not see eye to eye on this issue with Dr. Ed Walsh, director of the University of Limerick, it is important to remember that those three people are working on the issue.</P>
    <P>There will be a transition period while the bilateral agreement is renegotiated and this presents us with an opportunity to do something.  I call on the Government to give Shannon Development an enhanced role in the future and to link it with the Plassey Technological Park at the University of Limerick to support the infrastructure which has been provided in the mid-west.  There is no point in crying over spilt milk.  While one can shed crocodile tears and wring one's hands this will achieve nothing for the people I represent; I intend to assist the mid-west region in a postitive way and not to whinge or cry.  As I mentioned, only time will tell what the future holds for this region, there is nothing to be gained from living in the past although we should learn from it.</P>
    <P>It is important to find a way forward not only in the field of aviation but in <Col N="1634" /> other fields.  We will not find a solution if we run away from reality.  We have to face it and do the best we can to meet the challenge in the mid-west.  I will do my best to face up to it and will not indulge in hypocrisy in this House, as if people on all sides of the House were whiter than white or born again economists. We should do our best for the people.</P>
    <P>The Government is doing its best in the national interest which has been interpreted to mean many things in the past but as Connolly said: &ldquo;Ireland as distinct from her people means nothing to me&rdquo;; the people must come first.</P>

      <P>Aer Lingus is in a critical position.  It is vitally important from the point of view of the Irish travelling public, the employees in the Aer Lingus group of companies and the Irish taxpayer that remedial measures be taken.  It is even more important that the correct measures are taken.  It is by this yardstick that the proposals put forward by Mr. Cahill and the Aer Lingus management must be judged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we have before us is a book-keeping <Col N="1635" /> exercise which takes no account of the long term needs of the Irish consumer and asks the employees and taxpayers to carry the burden without any clear vision as to the future of the national airline.  This sterile book-keeping exercise is the third such effort since last October from the same author.  These efforts have been accompanied by dire warnings and broad media briefings that if immediate action is not taken the liquidator will move in.  I reject the simplistic nature of the cure proposed &mdash; that one third of the staff of the core business should be made redundant, the subsidiaries should be sold, services such as catering, cleaning, etc., should be privatised and an injection of equity should be secured from the Government.  The books might be in order, but what will be left?</P>
    <P>Let us examine for a moment the much publicised losses of the group in 1992-93. While the situation is undoubtedly bad, it has not, as has been widely suggested, been brought about by overpaying staff and unacceptable work practices.  The reality is that the group's shareholding in GPA was written off and this had an impact of approximately £45 million on the profit and loss account.  To make the situation look even worse, the balance sheet has been hit in one year with the full £50 million restructuring costs.  The one area which shows a profit is the subsidiaries, excluding hotels, and they should show an estimated profit of £20 million.  The irony is that this latter achievement, which was the basis of the establishment of the subsidiaries, that is, to assist the air transport operation in difficult times, is going to be rewarded by the sale of the subsidiaries.  Decisions in relation to the Aer Lingus group must be taken against the background of recent results, not one year's results.  During the period 1983-92 the company made a profit of £108.4 million after tax, interest and extraordinary items in the group.</P>
    <P>Lest I fall into the trap of merely giving figures, I wish to refer to the human tragedy of this situation.  Many thousands of families are facing an uncertain future <Col N="1636" /> in a company to which at least one member of the family has given loyal and dedicated service.  How are they being rewarded for this service?  They hear on a daily basis from management and other sources that they are a drain on their fellow taxpayers.  They are unsure whether they will have a job in the future and whether they will be able to meet their mortgage, education and other family commitments.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the TEAM workers and their experience.  On Friday, 11 June these workers were given protective notice and the following day they were told they would have to work overtime. After discussions with the union the notices were put on hold.  Last Friday 300 of these employees were fired and they were given their P45s on Monday, despite the fact that these are not necessary for social welfare claims.  These 300 staff are permanent employees of the company and 60 of them transferred from the parent company to TEAM on its establishment in 1990.  At the time of the transfer they received a letter which stated:</P>
    <P>The purpose of this letter is to advise you on a personal basis that while you will be required to work within TEAM you will however remain a member of Aer Lingus staff and will retire as a member of Aer Lingus staff, retaining full Aer Lingus retirement conditions. Your rights, privileges and seniority, etc., will be protected.</P>
    <P>The letter finished by stating, &ldquo;This letter is a personal guarantee to you from Aer Lingus&rdquo;.  The letter was signed by John O'Neill, general manager of personnel. While these 300 employees are laid off their colleagues are told they must work overtime.</P>
    <P>It is appalling that in 1993 people can be treated in a manner which can only be termed a throw back to the worst abuses of the old casual labour system on the docks &mdash; if a ship came in which needed unloading, workers were called in.  It is the same in TEAM &mdash; if a plane comes in which needs maintenance the men will be called back, but if there is no plane they will not be required until October. <Col N="1637" /> This is outrageous carry on by a company which has great potential and which has recorded a profit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to the impact of this crisis on the staff in Aer Lingus, the way in which they have been and are still being misled, and the way in which one message is being put out by the Government for public consumption while something quite different is happening in practice on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bottom line in the Cahill plan for Aer Lingus is that the airline's loyal, hard-working staff are being asked to endure the pain.  The equity which is to be put into the company, £175 million, is <Col N="1638" /> much less than needed and less than half the £400 million which Bernie Cahill said was needed only four months ago.  Moreover, it is phased over three years and at best will reduce the debt.  It is a payment to the banks to keep them off the company. It is too little and it is too prolonged.</P>
    <P>The change in the Shannon stop is no doubt painful for that region but at least the Government is recognising that Shannon must be compensated for the loss of the stop.  Already there has been a parade of company chairmen and executives, the Taoiseach and Ministers to Shannon to smooth the troubled waters.</P>
    <P>What is being offered to the staff?  We are told that £5 million per annum must be achieved through cost cutting and that 80 per cent of that must come from the payroll.  Ultimately, that will mean that the staff of Aer Lingus will be forced to shed jobs and to endure worse working conditions.  All the fine Government aspirations over the past few weeks that there will be no compulsory redundancies is nothing more than a continuation of the misleading of the staff which has gone on since the beginning of this crisis.</P>
    <P>The staff of Aer Lingus have been misled by the Government since the beginning of this crisis and the Government is continuing a dishonest double speak to the company's employees.  The staff were politically misled last November by the Tánaiste and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  They were misled by the Taoiseach at the launch of the Fianna Fáil manifesto when he said &ldquo;We cannot and will not allow Aer Lingus to flounder&rdquo;. They have been floundering ever since.  They were misled by the Government over Bernie Cahill's appointment and over the way in which the rescue plan was to be evolved.  &ldquo;Partnership&rdquo; is the buzz work of this Government and when the Minister announced the appointment of Mr. Cahill last March he told us that the plan would be evolved in a spirit of partnership, through discussion with management and unions.</P>
    <P>Responding to my Private Members' Motion on Aer Lingus on 6 April last the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1639" /> Since the House last discussed the matter fora have been established, consultations are taking place and there is a management commitment to consult the unions and the representatives of the workforce at all stages before the formulation of major policy proposals, so that everybody has a say in the future of the company and those who have a stake in the company have their say.  That is something that I, as a former Minister for Labour, would insist upon, quite apart from the fact that it is an obligation under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  That obligation will be honoured.</P>
    <P>Of course, we now know that the unions were not consulted, that the staff had no input into the Cahill plan and that they got more information about the future of their company from well-placed journalists around this city than they did from Mr. Cahill and the management.</P>
    <P>From the time the plan was presented there was an attempt by the Government to stand back, to pretend it had made no decision on it and to let the unions and management at it.  This pretence has now been exposed; it is inconceivable that Mr. Cahill appeared out of the dark to the Minister with the plan and that there was not ongoing contact between the Minister, his Department and Mr. Cahill before the plan was submitted.  Indeed, the Government's ultimate decision announced last night that the plan has been accepted in full has confirmed that the Minister had given his effective approval long ago.</P>
    <P>The meetings with the Congress of Trade Unions and the assurances apparently given that there would be no compulsory redundancies cannot be reconciled with the Minister's statement last night when he told us that £50 million in cuts would have to be acheived, no equity would be put in until the unions had agreed to the £50 million in cost cuts and, further, there would have to be proof that these cuts were being implemented.  Like every Member of this <Col N="1640" /> House, he knows that there will not be anything remotely approaching 1,500 voluntary redundancies in Aer Lingus and that if he insists on £50 million being achieved in cuts the only way it can be done is by force.</P>
    <P>There is no point in Deputy Seán Ryan coming in here and saying he is not voting for compulsory redundancies.  He will never be asked to vote on a motion seeking compulsory redundancies, but the fact is that when he votes for the Government amendment endorsing the Government's policy which endorses the Cahill plan, he is voting ultimately for enforced redundancies at Aer Lingus.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no point in Deputy Shortall saying that she is not voting for the Cahill plan.  Voting for an amendment that endorses the Government's approach and the Government having stated it endorses the Cahill plan means that one is voting for the Cahill plan.  The laying off of 300 TEAM Aer Lingus workers last Monday is the beginning of the blood letting at Aer Lingus. TEAM Aer Lingus and its staff has been the subject of a whispering campaign since the beginning of the Aer Lingus controversy and it is seen now apparently as the softest target for job shedding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Minister is delivering his cherubic aspirations to ICTU and to this House that he hopes there will be no compulsory job losses, the management at TEAM Aer Lingus are wielding a big knife and laying off employees in the hope of putting the frighteners on the Aer Lingus staff so that if they have not reached agreement by the end of the summer season they too will get the same treatment.  What is happening this week at TEAM Aer Lingus is a dress rehearsal for the way the Aer Lingus saga will be acted out.  Telling the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the public that the hope is that there will be no compulsory redundancies is meaningless when you know every well that the only way you can achieve cost cuts of £50 million is by compulsory redundancies and by forcing <Col N="1641" /> the staff to accept measures that they will not volunteer for.</P>
    <P>Of course what we are not being told in all the exaggerations about TEAM Aer Lingus is that it is owed £32 million and in fact it has been turning away work.  In the past few weeks alone, I am told, it has turned away work from Ryanair and Teamlift.  Neither are we told that TEAM Aer Lingus does not have the servicing of some of Aer Lingus's own fleet.  What is happening at TEAM is the softening up process for ultimate compulsory shedding of jobs in Aer Lingus.  This exercise is a drip approach by Government.  First we are told there is a huge problem, then we are told it has not accepted the Cahill plan, then the Cahill plan is accepted. Congress are told there will be no compulsory redundancies, then we are told it is hoped there will be no compulsory redundancies, when it is very well known that at the end of the day there will have to be.</P>
    <P>The Cahill plan will destroy Aer Lingus.  Aer Lingus will not survive the loss of 1,500 jobs, whether achieved voluntarily or compulsorily.  There seems to be an opinion in the Labour Party that job losses are OK if they are voluntary. Job losses in Aer Lingus are not OK and 1,500 job losses, however they are achieved, are not OK.  The effect of the job losses will destroy the company as it will not be able to continue to deliver the kind of service expected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Next Monday week will mark the anniversary of the first manned flight in Ireland.  It happened in a hot air balloon outside the door of this House on Leinster Lawn.  The successful pilot, Mr. Richard Crosby, took part in this famous event in 1783, almost 210 years ago.  Much has happened in Irish history between then and Mr. Cahill's plan for Aer Lingus.  However, I am afraid that the element of hot air is still a very large factor in discussing the future of Irish aviation and of Aer Lingus in particular. It has been said, and I have seen it written, that Aer Lingus must be assessed from a commercial and not a political viewpoint. If ever there was a gross oversimplification <Col N="1642" /> of a crisis, that is it.  If commercial viability is our only yardstick I expect it will not be too long before Iarnród Éireann will be on the agenda, not to mention Bus Átha Cliatha and Bus Éireann.  Let us not confuse providing a service with wasting money.  Whatever about political merit, it is certainly not polite or politic to run off and announce redundancies before negotiations are finished.  Neither is there any excuse to let go 300 workers from TEAM Aer Lingus before negotiations has even begun and before the plan was even announced. These reckless actions indicate not a political or commercial reaction but sheer panic.</P>
      <P>I believe the management has certainly a responsibility for this, but so too has the Government, which shortsightedly used the company down through the years as a source of revenue and, in the eighties, as a placement option to artificially take more people off the dole in an attempt to hide the real failure of succesive Governments to solve unemployment. Will the Government be brave enough to admit that their previous policies were both shortsighted and foolish?</P>
      <P>The banks have also panicked and this has panicked the Government and the management.  I am still awaiting a response to my suggestion that the Aer Lingus debt should be managed by the professional experts in the National Debt Management Agency.  At present British, Irish and Japanese banks are dictating terms to Aer Lingus.  Whatever about Irish banks, I do not see the British and Japanese banks doing Aer Lingus any favours in regard to interest rates. This is why I suggest again that those who manage our national debt and can secure the most favourable rates are the best people to take over the Aer Lingus debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aer Lingus, with its huge debt, will have great difficulty in entering into partnerships with a larger group of airlines. We all have to take responsibility for that debt because we all benefited from it in the good times.  The Aer Lingus dividend was spent by Government on our behalf and it is now time that the Government paid it back on our behalf.  I am not only <Col N="1643" /> speaking from a political point of view but from the commercial stance, because if we do not clear the debt, more people will be made redundant in the future and these well trained people will be going to competitors.  This will put Aer Lingus at a disadvantage.  In fact the rescue plan will cause immense hardship through forced redundancies not only to the workers but to the taxpayers as well who will be paying the social welfare bill.  It will bring hardship to mortgage holders. A man from TEAM Aer Lingus came to me on Sunday evening.  After selling his house he now finds that he cannot get a mortgage for another house.  Shopkeepers and all other ancillary activities in the Fingal area will suffer and many more will be made redundant.  This plan is not only cruel, it lacks imagination and a wider vision.  The potential of work sharing and a guaranteed basic income has not been developed.  I share Depty Brian Fitzgerald's view, which is reported in this evening's <i>Evening Herald</i> that 500,000 jobs can be created in this way. It is positive, radical but it has not been communicated to the Government.</P>
    <P>Apart from having no imagination, this plan lacks vision.  Aer Lingus is an Irish airline and that is its best selling point.  It enjoys the reputation of a first class safety record.  It is renowned for the friendliness of its staff and it continues the age old tradition of Irish people travelling, which goes back to St. Brendan and St. Killian. If everybody realised that this plan is wounding the goose that lays the golden egg by crippling the workers and the whole area of Dublin North perhaps we could start afresh and consult everybody in drawing up a holistic plan for the airline and Irish aviation.  Aer Rianta needs to be involved, as their turnaround charges are nearly the highest in Europe. The Government needs to act as a responsible shareholder this time and ensure that Aer Lingus is cleared of its debt and that the workers are not punished for problems that are not of their making.</P>

      <P>I will be voting for the <Col N="1644" /> motion before the House calling on the Government to reject the Cahill plan and demanding a fully costed alternative plan to put Aer Lingus on a sound footing.  I wish to support also the Democratic Left amendment which acknowledges the importance of seeking to maintain every Aer Lingus job while it (a) ensures that no member of Aer Lingus staff is made compulsorily redundant; (b) increases the amount of equity promised to Aer Lingus over the next two years and (c) uses EC Structural Funds to ensure that Aer Lingus is able to provide air access to Ireland and to our main European markets.  I understand that some members of the Labour Party have several reservations about the Cahill plan. Let me say to them as members of that party they should have 1,500 reasons for honouring their pre-election promises and voting against the Cahill plan.  In this context I respect the very honourable stand taken by Deputies Tony Killeen and de Valera in resigning the party Whip.  In doing so, they are honouring their commitments to the people who voted for them to represent their views and their interests in this House.</P>
      <P>There are six Labour Party TDs representing the north side of Dublin who should be following Deputy de Valera's and Deputy Killeen's example, not, of course, on the issue of the Shannon stopover but on their commitments to protect the jobs of Aer Lingus workers and to provide the national airline with sufficient equity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday I received a telephone call from a worker in TEAM Aer Lingus, or I should say a former worker, who was one of 300 employees TEAM let go in the last few days.  The worker who spoke to me had given up a good job in order to join TEAM.  He has a young family and a mortgage but now he has no job. He is one of those who believed the promises of the Labour Party candidates in the last election.  What message have the Labour Party for that worker and for the many others like him?  Labour TDs stated that they would oppose compulsory redundancies, yet their first test on this is a vote tonight and it seems they <Col N="1645" /> will fail that test and hide behind the Government amendment.  Let us be clear, a vote for the Government amendment is a vote for massive redundancies, a vote for insufficient equity and a vote inevitably for privatisation.  The Cahill plan demands the loss of approximately 1,500 jobs.  It is estimated that something close to 1,000 of those would be compulsory redundancies, perhaps more than 1,000.  When non-core subsidiaries are sold off, how many more will lose their jobs?</P>
    <P>The Labour Party leader, Deputy Spring, repeatedly promised that there would be no privatisation.  The cynical response now is to change the terminology and refer only to disposal of assets, as long as they are non-core assets of course.  The real question facing Aer Lingus workers is, when this process has been completed, will there be anything left?  The £175 million equity is clearly inadequate, at £75 million in the first year and an estimated £47 million to be spent in redundancy payments, yet Aer Lingus paid a total of £224 million to the Exchequer in PAYE and PRSI contributions between 1983 and 1991.  Surely Aer Lingus deserve an amount of equity at least equal to the amount they put into the economy over the last ten years.</P>
    <P>On the issue of direct flights to Dublin, I believe it is a logical and necessary move and one that should have been done several years ago.  In the past I had accepted the necessity of positive discrimination in favour of the disadvantaged area of the west, but the fact is that Dublin has now become the most disadvantaged area in the State.  While I do not claim to be an aviation expert, it seems to me direct flights to Dublin have become a necessity for very pragmatic reasons.</P>
    <P>Within the region of 300,000 people out of work, it is a scandal to plan for the loss of another 1,500 jobs.  A national emergency was declared, quite rightly, when 800 jobs were threatened and eventually lost in Digital.  One of the Ministers travelled to the US to save those jobs.  Surely if the political will is here now that could be done, and perhaps use of EC Structural Funds would be one <Col N="1646" /> way to do it, instead of this obsessive pursuit of mass redundancies which will have a devastating effect not just on the workers and their families and on the national airline but on our whole society.</P>

      <P>In the economic climate which has prevailed for the last 18 months I can understand readily how the workforce in Aer Lingus would look around at an upcoming general election and wonder which party or combination of parties presented them with the best prospects for their future.  I suppose they came to the conclusion, with some justification given what was said previously, that Labour and Fianna Fáil presented the best options for them and their future and they accepted that in good faith. What did they get?  One massive let down, the biggest in the history of the State.  It would not have been so bad if the pedigree of both parties has not been stitched so firmly into the public record in their commitment to Aer Lingus, the national airline, the national corporation that could provide international transport, and then they let them down.  What about the two parties who were so firmly committed to Shannon?  What will the people of the mid-west think tonight of the parties who committed themselves again and again to the principle of the Shannon stopover?  Where have their commitments gone?  What have the parties said and done to justify their turnabout in the last couple of days?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a great deal about the number of resignations; there have been some already and some are pending.  The only honourable thing to do for each Government party or the combined Government parties is to resign en bloc because that is the only way they can justify their existence after the turnabout they have wrought upon the people in <Col N="1647" /> Aer Lingus.  As they walk up those stairs tonight let them think before they vote against the Fine Gael motion.  Let them think seriously about the people of Aer Lingus who will not know tomorrow night or the night after how they are going to pay their mortgages or educate their children or how in the future they will handle commitments they have entered into.</P>
    <P>Remember, not only has there been a full turnabout, but Aer Lingus has missed privatisation only by virtue of the fact that they were not in a healthy enough state to be privatised at present, otherwise they were gone.  I submit that the preparations now being put in place are nothing more than the preliminaries towards privatisation.  Within two years, far from the Cahill plan being a solution which is a Government solution as well, we are going to have another solution, somebody's else's solution.  It will be gradual closure and Aer Lingus will eventually be restricted to the extent that they will not be able to operate as a national or international airline.  They will become a third world type operation. That is a sad reflection on the kind of promises made by the people on Government benches over there.</P>
    <P>The last and sickest joke of all was when the Government tried to divest themselves of their responsibilities by pointing over at the Opposition and calling it opportunism.  This is a political forum.  The duty of the Opposition is to point out the inadequacies of Government, and that is what the Opposition are doing tonight.  It is the duty of Governments to govern, to live up to their commitments whether they are made in Government or in Opposition, and in fact the parties opposite have made them in both places.  It is a sad reflection on the Government with the biggest majority in the history of the State that the best they can do by way of commitment to the national economy is to let go 1,500 workers in one of the biggest companies in the State.  If this is the best this Government can do I hope they do not do much more.  It can honestly be <Col N="1648" /> said of them that never in the history of political endurance was so much promised by so few to so many with such disastrous and disappointing consequences for those to whom the promises were made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>This House should reject the Cahill plan because, as my colleague argued last night, it will not ensure the viability of Aer Lingus and I say, being from the North Dublin area, because of the devastating job losses it imposes which will affect North Dublin especially.  With matters as they stand with 300 jobs being transferred to Shannon it will mean job losses in the Dublin region on the scale of 1,500 to 2,000 when subsidiaries and downstream employment are taken into account.  When I drafted my few words here tonight I had not a single political comment to make. I listened to my constituency colleague, and the other Labour Deputies from North Dublin who tried to cover the nakedness of their position by a blatant political attack on Fine Gael which was exaggerated and ill-founded, and I could not let their statements go without comment. I canvassed in the election and I know Fine Gael stood for a commitment to support for Aer Lingus in equity.  Our party did not suggest that there could be an open-ended cheque book as the Labour Party said.  We insisted there would have to be a viability plan and we did not pretend that could be done without some redundancies.  Similarly, we did not suggest that all the assets of Aer Lingus would remain untouched while the Labour Party assured them they would.  Every one of the promises of the Labour Party has been dishonoured. Tonight they add to that the suggestion that they are not voting for redundancies and are not voting for the Cahill plan.</P>

      <P>Did they listen to the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, last night when he said that the equity will <Col N="1649" /> only be put into Aer Lingus when the job losses have been delivered and no sooner?  The Labour Party Members are voting for 1,500 redundancies at a minimum. We have seen a few tears shed for north Dublin and it was only tonight we heard what is happening there.  What a contrast, and one of my colleagues from north Dublin referred to this, with the Government's visit to the US to save 800 jobs in private industry.  We are now talking about a semi-State company who should expect more.  It was reputed that £40 million was available to keep jobs but now £45 million is available only on condition that 1,500 jobs are shed.  Surely there is a tragic incoherence in that for Dublin and Shannon.  In the face of that I congratulate the workers, largely based in Dublin, who have never sought to make the Dublin case over Shannon and who have argued that the workers must stand together to try to protect as many jobs as possible wherever they are based.</P>
      <P>Last night I heard the Minister say that in the dispersal of £8 billion Cohesion Funds special attention would be given to Shannon.  That is right and proper and I welcome it but I heard no assurance that any special attention would be given to the Dublin or north Dublin region. Dublin is suffering not just in the air transport area but its port is blocked by lack of access.  No development is taking place in the north side of the city because of inadequate infrastructure in roads, sewerage and drainage.  No development can take place until those issues are addressed.</P>
      <P>I hope that the last Government speakers will give some reassurance that Dublin will be looked at in the same way as the Shannon region for some compensation for the huge losses proposed there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the details of the Cowen-Cahill-Owen plan sink in a number of important points arise.  The fact that the equity is being phased in over three years reduces its current value to £100 million; that is a far cry from the expected sum of £175 million.  The bulk of that equity in the first year will go towards redundancies and, therefore, only a pitiful amount of <Col N="1650" /> £19 million approximately will be available as equity this year.  The burden of debt will hang over the company into the next 18 months.  Given the radical surgery proposed by Cowen, Cahill and Owen &mdash; I apologise I should have given the Minister his proper title&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I share the view of Deputy Ray Burke when he said this plan is entirely about cost-cutting.  There is nothing about new business possibilities and it took the union to put that on the table.  At that point the unions have absolutely no information about where the 1,500 job losses are proposed to come from or from what sectors or what areas and they do not know when they will have that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned, too, about the position in TEAM Aer Lingus.  Many colleagues referred to the 300 workers who got their notices last Friday.  There are very serious questions to be asked.  They include the level of confidence existing in the management of TEAM Aer Lingus. Any effective plan must adequately answer those questions.  The plan, as drafted, does not do that, does not ensure the viability of Aer Lingus and involves <Col N="1651" /> the loss of 1,500 jobs, an intolerable proposal.</P>

      <P>First, I would like to comment on the second element in the original motion before this House.  This reiterates the calumny, that the Government has no aviation policy, despite the fact that the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, has articulated in this House, exactly what the Government's aviation policy is on numerous occasions.</P>
      <P>It is the prerogative of anyone to disagree with elements of this policy. Indeed, some Members have done so, in a very constructive manner, and we respect their criticisms.  However, I believe that, in fairness, it should also be acknowledged that both this and the previous Government's policy, has been unreservedly endorsed by both the Culliton and Moriarty committees.</P>
      <P>I would remind the House that the membership of these committees included representatives of a wide variety of national interests, including distinguished representatives of the banking and business communities, as well as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
      <P>I am not here to score cheap political points on this topic, because I fully agree with the point made last evening by Deputy Harney that the onus is on us all not to play party politics with this very important national issue.  I readily acknowledge that the aviation policy, which the Government is pursuing, is not a totally new one which this Government alone has devised.  Rather, it is a building on the foundations of policy laid down by successive Irish Governments, during the 1980s, including Governments in which the main Opposition parties participated.</P>

This figure is based on detailed financial projections and market analysis, for the four divisions of the airline which are being set up.  Deputy Noonan also claimed that the figure for redundancies of 1,530 was inaccurate and that the real figure was nearer to 2,500.  I can assure the House that there is absolutely no foundation for this claim.  The figure of 1,530 is the absolute maximum number of job losses according to Aer Lingus.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to the interventions of both Deputies Cullen and Harney last night.  While I do not have time to go into detail, I endorse some of the points they made.  There are two specific issues on which I should like to comment.  The first relates to the question of the bankers to Aer Lingus' &ldquo;sharing the pain&rdquo;, as both Deputies put it. Aer Lingus is a commercial company which must first put its own house in order and demonstrate its viability and ability to meet its ongoing commitments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, as shareholder, decided to accept this necessary Aer Lingus strategy and financially to support our national airline.  We expect that the banks will be prepared to offer normal facilities to the company on fair and reasonable commercial terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The factual position is that Aer Lingus needs to achieve a net reduction of £50 <Col N="1656" /> million in its annual operating costs.  How precisely this is to be achieved is a matter for negotiation between the management and the unions within the company; a bottom line of £50 million in cost reductions must be achieved if the company is to return to viability.  The Government has approved a voluntary retirement severance package to help achieve this.</P>

      <P>We expect those negotiations to be vigorous and forceful on both sides.  Nobody could expect the unions representing workers in Aer Lingus to favour the company's strategic plan or the Government's decisions or to regard the plan as something they could automatically endorse.</P>
      <P>I want again to put on the record of the House that the people employed in Aer Lingus have contributed enormously to building up the airline and have a reputation second to none for their commitment to a competitive quality product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

      <P>The Government is fully conscious that we are asking for sacrifice now.  As a tangible form of recognition for the additional contribution being asked of the workforce, the Government has accepted that Aer Lingus employees should have a stake in the future success of the company.  I hope the Government's commitment to this initiative will give meaning and significance to the negotiations, which must be successfully concluded for the sake of the long term future of the airline and the jobs therein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reiterate the assurance given yesterday by the Minister, Deputy Cowen, and given last October by his predecessor, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, <Col N="1657" /> that the Government's commitment to regional development and to the mid-west and western regions, in particular, is firm and resolute.</P>

      <P>Those of us on this side of the House have done our best to be constructive and positive in our contributions to this debate because we have borne in mind at all times that we are discussing the future of one of our greatest national assets, Aer Lingus.  The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, has turned this debate into a farce.  There is an old saying that, &ldquo;those whom the gods wish to destroy, they first make mad&rdquo;.  As I listened to the Minister's contribution I recalled that old saying once again.  He did not give a responsible reply to the reasonable and forward looking points made in this debate by Fine Gael Members and others.  It was an insult to this House to reply to the debate in such manner.  A number of major issues are involved.  Will this plan work?  We believe it will not.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>In one or two years' time we will be back in this House discussing the survival of Aer Lingus in circumstances <Col N="1658" /> where our options will have run out and the European Community will have told us we have availed of our last chance.  The Minister has admitted that.  Our last chance will be gone if we do not take it here tonight.  We have listened to the argument about whether there will be forced or voluntary redundancies in the airline, but it is accepted that there will be redundancies with all the pain and hardship that will cause.  If members of the Labour Party believe there will only be voluntary redundancies they ought to have their heads examined. It is obvious there will be enforced redundancies. Some of those currently employed in Aer Lingus will be forced to take redundancy against their will.</P>
      <P>Another matter of concern to the Labour Party was that of privatisation. Will Aer Lingus or any of its subsidiaries be privatised?  I have copious quotations here of commitments given prior to the election, during the election campaign and since the election that no part of Aer Lingus will be privatised, yet we have already seen evidence of creeping privatisation. Those who want to salve their consciences should not do so by stating that there will be no privatisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At one time the Tánaiste spoke about £400 million in equity and stated it was essential that such equity would include refurbishment and renewal of the fleet in Aer Lingus.  My colleagues and I had a briefing with members of the unions prior to this debate and they told us that the £175 million equity effectively means £82 million spread over a period of three years when one takes account of interest payments and the redundancy payments to those forced to leave Aer Lingus. Those are some of the matters to which the Minister should have referred.  He should have given reassurances to the people involved rather than giving assurances in the privacy of his party's rooms that Deputy Ryan and others are prepared to accept.  Nothing the Minister, the Tánaiste or any member of the Government said will leave those people with any credibility if they vote against this motion this evening.  If they do so, they will go against their commitments <Col N="1659" /> and party policies which were pledged in order to win seats in the last election.</P>
    <P>Deputy Killeen nailed his colours to the mast.  He stated he cannot continue with any credibility to support this Government and has relinquished the whip.  What about Deputy Bhamjee? Where is he this evening?  He certainly secured his seat on the Shannon issue.</P>

No Deputy can escape responsibility for his or her decision this evening; they cannot say it is not their responsibility.  This is the responsibility of the Government and the Ministers they support and it is the responsibility of their predecessors.  They were the people who appointed the board of management and took the decisions. The buck stops here and we must not forget that.  If Members' consciences let them down, hopefully members of the public will deal with them in the future.</P>

      <P>Because of the very restricted time available to me I have to confine my remarks to only one of the issues of great concern flowing from the Government decision, namely, the proposed alteration of the Shannon stop policy and the profound concerns that this has legitimately raised in the Shannon and wider mid-west and western regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1660" /> I am also very conscious of the deep fears and anxiety of over 1,500 Aer Lingus workers who face the loss of their livelihoods.  I am keenly aware of the sense of trauma and trepidation now gripping many people in the regions faced with this fundamental policy change. They are furious at the way they were misled by the Government statement of 27 October last.  Those who issued and dishonoured that statement have deservedly lost any remaining credibility.  Those who support them have equally lost their credibility and honour.  Deputy &ldquo;Mighty Mouse&rdquo; Kemmy and his friend, Deputy &ldquo;Church Mouse&rdquo; O'Dea, were fulsome in their assurances to the electorate last November that Shannon would be interfered with over their dead bodies.  Will they now act like Deputies Killeen and de Valera, or will the trappings of power be too big a temptation for them?  In February of last year Deputy Killeen called for my resignation from the Government because he claimed I was not doing enough to save Shannon.  How he wishes he had me back now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to Mr. Brendan O'Regan talk about the people of the mid-west who are as united as they were in 1959 to overcome this adversity. It does not follow, however, that they will do so as easily, for the simple reason that in 1959 the people had the Government fully behind them.  Mr. O'Regan should remember the help he got from Seán Lemass and others and contrast it with the present time when the Government is using the undoubtedly huge problems of Aer Lingus, even though they know in their heart of hearts that these problems are not caused by Shannon.  To pick up the pieces and to try to minimise the damage, the people of the western half of Ireland will have to insist that no further assurances or promises from either the Government or Aer Lingus will be accepted or believed.  They will have to insist that no change of any kind be made until after a new bilateral agreement <Col N="1661" /> has been negotiated with the United States, signed and sealed.  This renegotiation will have to provide for a strict total limit on the number of direct flights from Dublin each week on all airlines who will share in that limit and who will be bound to provide a specified number of flights to and from Shannon as a condition of availing of Dublin.  This will have to be directly enforceable by the Irish Government and must be legally binding before it is introduced.  This is as much in Aer Lingus' interest as in Shannon's because Aer Lingus at present is not strong enough to survive a free for all on the Atlantic.</P>

Tell that to the people from TEAM Aer Lingus at the gate, 300 of whom got their P45s on Monday, and another 150 of whom are under threat, while the Labour Party and the Fianna Fáil Party here in the House believe that the total number of redundancies in TEAM will be confined to 250.</P>
      <P>When Cara is sold off, as it will be under the Cahill plan, can the Government Deputies in this House guarantee that the jobs will be protected by the private company that buys them?

He said it was consistently following the aviation policy as set down by its predecessors. What aviation policy led to the loss of £17 million in the Aer Lingus holiday company, whether through incompetence or fraud?  Why has nobody yet been brought to book?  What aviation policy supported the decision to fly a Los Angeles route, lease two 767s and mothball them in Dublin Airport and <Col N="1663" /> continue to pay $.75 million a month in leasing fees?

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> What aviation policy underpins that?  What aviation policy underpins the situation whereby Aer Lingus and the Minister's Department continued to sell every seat on every plane leaving Dublin for Heathrow at a loss until they had accumulated annual losses of £23 million?  What aviation policy underpinned that decision?</P>
      <P>Last night the Minister made extravagant claims about the benefits to the economy of the well worked out aviation policy which this Government pursues. Again he trotted out the same tourist statistics, which confuses emigrants going to and from the United Kingdom looking for jobs and returning for welfare.  Subdenly they become tourists.  He said the contribution of aviation policy and of the aviation industry to our economy in the last three years was in excess of £500 million.  Is it a coincidence or merely an ambiguity that the total debt of Aer Lingus is £40 million more than that?  Yet we are told we have an aviation policy.</P>
      <P>We are rejecting the Cahill plan because it is not set in the context of an aviation policy.  Decisions are being taken piecemeal about airports, regional and national, about Aer Lingus, about fares, about the Shannon status position. There is no pattern whatsoever.

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Matrimonial Home Bill, 1993: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which I hope will succeed in dealing with the number of problems pointed out by my colleagues on this side of the House and the Government side.  The Family Home Protection Act did not live up to the spirit of its intentions and the equal share in the family home aspiration did not carry the same weight it will carry in this Bill. I remember the welcome extended to the Family Home Protection Act which was innovative at the time and focused attention on a serious problem.  This Bill goes further and stipulates without equivocation the need to recognise the half share in the family home notwithstanding the financial contribution made by one or other partner because, after ten or 12 years, depending on the wage earner, it was suggested in some quarters that one partner had contributed more than the other.  The partner who administers the household finances and who looks after the children also contributed to the well-being of the household in a substantial fashion but it has taken almost 20 years to finally recognise the commitments and efforts of the partner who stayed at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although public representatives generally are not members of the legal profession we have all dealt with marriage breakdown cases.  In some cases the family home was sold.  I hope that when this legislation is passed it will ensure that the system cannot be abused and that a wife, for instance, cannot be inveigled <Col N="1671" /> into signing documents on foot of bank loans or mortgages which will force her to dispose of her share &mdash; or part of it &mdash; in the family home.  A number of cases come to mind in which people were forced to sell their shares to honour debts.  Some of the cases went to court but others, unfortunately, because of the financial plight of the woman of the household, did not get that far and the wife who had signed a guarantee to a financial institution in regard perhaps to a business or a second mortgage found that the financial institution did not show any great concern for the well-being of the family or of the children when they moved in to get their part of the bargain.</P>
    <P>This legislation will guarantee a recognisable share in the family home for both partners and a wife will not find herself out on the roadside.  The law is peculiar and in future even this legislation may be found inadequate.  When the law is tested a number of times in the courts we usually get a clear indication as to how it will affect the people for whom it was intended.  If, after testing this legislation in the courts, inadequacies are found I hope we will not wait 15 or 20 years to remedy them.  We cannot be certain of what will happen in future and when a case goes to court the outcome depends on the ability of opposing counsel to make their cases.  If this Bill is found inadequate in achieving its objectives, the Minister of the day should ensure that the inadequacies are quickly corrected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill in fairly good time.  The Minister has worked hard behind the scenes with his advisers and civil servants over the last five months preparing this measure.  That shows what a Government can do without ballyhoo, hype and publicity.  The Government is judged not on what it says it will do but on what it achieves in terms of legislation. The Labour Party is keen to ensure that its partnership agreement with the Fianna Fáil Party is put into operation. It is important to achieve what we set out <Col N="1672" /> to do in this House.  It is also important to have responsible opposition to legislation, not gamesmanship or brinkmanship and to have the support of the Opposition in improving legislation where necessary.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to welcome this Bill and I congratulate the Minister on his hard work.  I hope we will have similar legislation in the future.  I have had a long interest and track record in this area and spoke to the Minister privately about this matter.  It is a fact that marriages break down although I wish it did not happen. Sometimes our opponents almost accuse us of wanting or encouraging marriages to break down.</P>
      <P>As I said in the House previously, in the absence of divorce marriages still break down and if we were to ban funerals this would not mean that people would stop dying.  Therefore, by banning divorce we will not stop marriages breaking down.  That simple truism is often ignored.</P>
      <P>A combination of factors cause marriage breakdown in society.  These include economic factors, something not understood by those who are well off. Marriage breakdown can often follow when people become bitter and there are recriminations.  This can lead to disputes between the couple as to how the home or property should be divided.</P>
      <P>During the last referendum campaign I was disappointed at some mean and petty arguments used.  People who did not own much property were worried about succession rights and they were misled and fooled into thinking by the propaganda and the untruths that their rights would be taken away.  It is our aim as a party to enhance their rights and further democracy in this society.  I would not lose a drop of sweat, not to mention blood, if I thought some people's rights would be whittled away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned to the Minister, I have one reservation about the Bill and the legislative package that he has presented to the House tonight.  As a local representative, I have been assiduous in seeking to have people put on the housing list of Limerick City Council, particularly <Col N="1673" /> those living in bad housing conditions. In this regard, during the years I have encountered an obstacle in seeking to help deserted wives who have raised their families on their own since they were deserted by their husbands ten to 20 years before.  Sometimes this meant that they had to seek employment in an effort to cope and they have had to meet the rent on their own.</P>
    <P>These women have found that whenever a tenant purchase scheme is offered by a local authority, having been approved by this House, they will not be able to qualify and purchase a house under the terms and conditions laid down if their husband stayed in the house, even for one day, and his name is on the tenant agreement.  Even though her husband has not made any attempt to maintain her or her family she will be precluded from buying a house under a tenant purchase scheme if, as I said, he had stayed in the house even for one day.  In such circumstances she will have to go through the most convoluted process to acquire the house.  This will involve carrying out a search to find her husband even though he may have left her many years before, placing expensive advertisements in the press, engaging a solicitor and sometimes a barrister.</P>
    <P>This provision was included in legislation for a good purpose, to prevent a wife being put out of the house but sometimes it can work against a wife who has been abandoned or deserted and where her husband's name appears on the register.  I ask the Minister to review this matter.  While it was meant to provide protection it may preclude a woman from buying a house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to cases where the tenancy was taken out in both names.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>Correct.  The legislation was not designed for that purpose, to punish a woman with an excellent record when it comes to paying rent and rearing her family.  It is very important that the Minister should look at this matter again to see if this obstacle can be cleared.  I <Col N="1674" /> should have said at the outset that I wish to share my time with my colleague, Deputy Mulvihill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulvihill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for giving me the opportunity to contribute to this important debate and I congratulate the Minister for making an attempt to solve what is a serious problem. We have tried to sweep this issue under the carpet and deny that a problem exists.  I understand that in 1991 approximately 47,000 families were experiencing difficulty and wished to avail of divorce. Each day of the week people come to me to seek my advice on the question of home ownership.  Under the law in the past the man was considered to be the breadwinner and the king of the castle while his wife filled a position in that castle.  I congratulate the Minister for changing that law.</P>
      <P>When the partners in a marriage encounter difficulty pressures build up in the home and the children can suffer as a consequence.  This will have to be taken into consideration when the property is being disposed of.  Last week a woman indicated to me that some years ago she was afraid to seek a separation as she would no longer be entitled to a share in the family home and that she would be kicked out on the street with her children. I also know of a widower in my constituency whose wife died a few months ago.  He is a teacher by profession and has to rear five children.  He is worried that he will not be able to afford to continue to stay in the house.  During the last referendum campaign it was said that we would come up with an Irish solution to an Irish problem but we have not come up with one in the meantime.  I do not want to heap praise on the Minister just yet but I am glad that it is he who is dealing with this matter given that he has dealt with many such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accommodation is provided in Cuanlee House in Cork city for wives and children who are kicked out of the home. Indeed, some weeks ago the Minister <Col N="1675" /> met a deputation from that centre who outlined the difficulties that these women encounter.  In coming to a decision, the interests of the children will have to be taken into consideration.  I know of cases where the children were left to wander the streets.  Children experience trauma when their parents separate particularly children between the ages of nine and 12. It is possible that a child could hold a grudge against society which will remain with him for the rest of his life.</P>
    <P>One could talk at length on the issue of marital breakdown.  As I have said, the home is considered to be our castle in which we seek unity and friendship with our spouse and children.  Unfortunately, many marriages do break down due to outside pressures.  These include financial problems and pressures associated with unemployment.  At present 300,000 people are unemployed and in many instances marriages and relationships are in trouble.  On top of this there is the question of the family home.  If steps could be taken to improve the position in regard to ownership of the family home it would relieve much of the pressure on these people.  I ask the Minister to give special consideration to the position of children under this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Like many other speakers, I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister on bringing it forward.  It is interesting to note that I am the third representative from my constituency to contribute to the debate.  This represents a 100 per cent turnout for my constituency. I am not sure if this reflects the level of competition which exists between the public representatives from County Westmeath or whether we are extremely conscious that social issues need to be addressed.  I think it is a unique record for County Westmeath that its three public representatives have contributed to this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Marriage is a commitment for life entered into voluntarily by the contracting partners.  We seem to have lost sight of this fact.  Many young people tend to regard marriage as a temporary <Col N="1676" /> commitment which may last for a while. Marriage is a sharing of ideas and ideals, of hopes and aspirations, of goals and dreams.  The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy O'Rourke, said that she favoured raising the age at which people could get legally married.  I agree with her, not just because she is my constituency colleague but because I believe young people enter into marriage much too quickly without giving it enough thought and adequate preparation.  I think that the legal age at which people may get married &mdash; the Minister can correct me if I am wrong &mdash; is 18.  People under the age of 21 who get married must have the written consent of their parents. I am of the opinion that the age at which people can get legally married should be raised to 21 years.  All too often young people rush into marriage, and in some cases these marriages turn out to be a disaster.  Consideration should be given to setting up a course which would prepare people for marriage.  I do not know if this is within the remit of the Minister. The various marriage guidance agencies are carrying out much good work.  While they are receiving State suppport at present, this funding should be increased.</P>
    <P>Most marriages survive, with varying degrees of happiness, until one of the partners die.  However, a proportion of marriages end up in separation.  All speakers regard this Bill as a long awaited and long sought after breakthrough for women.  It is important to say that this Bill is also a breakthrough for men &mdash; men who marry women with property, men who marry into the family home of their wives and men who marry into a form or business owned by their wives. The rights of these men will also be recognised under the Bill.  This is an equality Bill &mdash; men and women in similar situations will have the same rights.</P>
    <P>Many speakers said that the Bill did not go far enough, that shared ownership of the matrimonial home may not be enough.  This is an interesting concept which should be pursued.  What about spouses who have given many years of their lives working in a partnership or <Col N="1677" /> building up a family business and who in the twilight years feel they have no rights to what they have created?  This Bill will be poor consolation to those people.  Will a spouse who leaves his or her husband one month after they get married have the same rights to the matrimonial home as a spouse who has shared a home, worked in it and shared the responsibilities and hardships of family life for many years?  I do not think this should be the case.  Consideration should be given to this shortcoming in the Bill.  I am not sure how this issue could be addressed or how one could devise a solution with which we would all agree.  A previous speaker referred to women who brought a dowry to her husband's family farm when she got married and who 40 years later had no rights to that farm.  Will she have the same right to the family home as a person who walks out on their marriage after one week?  Perhaps there could be a graduated increase in rights, so to speak, in different cases.  This matter needs to be looked at in greater depth.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is walking on a minefield.  Having regard to discussions which took place in, I think, 1985, this Bill could cause tremendous difficulties. All Irish people hold property very dear to their hearts &mdash; the high level of home ownership in this country in comparison with other European countries proves this.  No person who has a family business wants to see the family name disappear from over the door of their shop.  No farmer wants to see land which has been in his family for generations being sold. I wonder how far down the road can we go in ensuring total equality so that a husband and wife have an equal share in all property.  I accept that difficulties may arise if a business has to go into receivership. I ask the Minister in his reply to say how far down this road we can go.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the rights of children. Section 6 (3) deals with the position of children where perhaps a spouse has died.  It provides that the Circuit Court has the right to decide most of the issues which may arise.  Where one of the spouses has died, the child has only nine months, or three months after the grant <Col N="1678" /> of representation, to make an application to the court and prove that it is unfair or unjust that section 4 be applied in that case.  A minor child can, with the consent of the court, make such an application. Although these provisions attempt to make matters more certain for persons buying property, the amount of unease will be considerable.  A person buying property where one or other of the joint owners has died will be faced with the possibility that three months after the grant of representation any one of the children can apply to have the sale set aside.  Furthermore, there is the distinct possibility that some of the minor children could come back for a second application, perhaps claiming that they suffered from undue influence in the first instance.  Even though the draftsman has, with the best of intentions, provided that the court can supervise an undertaking given by the child not to make an application, I am not convinced that the tragic loss of a spouse would be helped by the necessity to make a long and expensive court application.</P>
    <P>A further point arises in regard to people living in rural areas.  Circuit Court judges are already greatly overworked. Indeed many judges have complained that family matters are taking up more and more of their time and they do not have enough time to deal with these cases as criminal cases get priority.  The assumption that the Circuit Court will be able to handle all these matters will come as bad news to the public, the Judiciary and practitioners who are already trying to cope with an overloaded system.</P>
    <P>The buildings in which many Circuit and District Courts are held in rural areas are in an atrocious condition.  A building which has closed in Athlone had no room where familes could meet to dicuss cases with their legal representative.  Indeed, many of these discussions had to take place in the corridor or out on the street. By referring these matters to the Circuit Courts the Minister will further overburden the system, thus leading to more trouble.  This Bill is very intricate from a legal point of view and as a layperson I find it very difficult to interpret.  I am <Col N="1679" /> delighted it is being referred to the Select Committee next week as this should provide us with the opportunity to discuss it in detail.  I am not a member of that committee but I am a member of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs and we found the briefings by civil servants invaluable.  It would be no harm I suggest, to arrange briefings for Members.  I suggest the provisions should be explained in every day terms to practitioners who, in turn, can explain them to the committee and deal in detail with the questions that may arise on its intricacies.  There would then be a more enlightened discussion and, as a result, we would have better legislation.  It may be difficult to make these arrangements but from my experience the briefings by officials of the Revenue Commission were very worthwhile.</P>
    <P>In relation to the matrimonial home on a farm I know, as I come from a rural area, the Minister will run into all sorts of difficulties.  On the typical farm it is very difficult to separate the family home from the cluster of buildings and the yard adjacent to it.  It will be extremely difficult to define where the matrimonial home ends and the farm begins.  I know this will only apply in a minority of cases where there is a break up of the marriage and it may be decided to sell the family farm.  It will be almost intolerable to work on the farm thereafter if the sale has gone though under duress.  Another Member raised the difficulties that will arise when the matrimonial home is above the shop or the pub.  How does the Minister propose to get over these difficulties?</P>
    <P>As it is proposed that this legislation will be retrospective how will it stand up to a court challenge?  Article 43.1.2º of the Constitution refers to private property as follows:</P>
    <P>The State accordingly guarantees to pass no law attempting to abolish the right of private ownership or the general right to transfer, bequeath and inherit property.</P>
    <P>Will the retrospection provisions cause a difficulty?  For example, someone who <Col N="1680" /> entered into marriage 30 or 40 years ago will now find that the matrimonial home becomes jointly owned with his or her spouse, and does that cut across the guarantee given in Article 43.1.2º?</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that Article 43.2.2º states:</P>
    <P>The State, accordingly, may as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of the said righs with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister envisage using that provision?  I believe the provisions in the Bill will be challenged in the courts and, perhaps, it should be referred to the Supreme Court at an early stage to avoid possible difficulties later.  Like other Deputies, I received correspondence from solicitors and this seems to be the point they are making.  There is a number of outstanding cases before the courts at present that hinge on this question and I wonder if the retrospective nature of the legislation will cause difficulties later.</P>
    <P>I hope this legislation will have a speedy passage into law.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister for Equality and Law Reform to the House.  I compliment him on the speedy manner in which he has brought forward this long overdue legislation within the first six months of his term of office.  It is long overdue that we dealt with the question of both spouses' interests in the matrimonial home.  In the past some cases were successful in the lower courts but on appeal were unsuccessful and it is high time that we lived up to such responsibilities and brought forward legislation in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is a recognition of the enormous amount of work that women do in the home.  Heretofore it was unrecognised and unpaid and we have neglected to deal with this as a society and failed as legislators to rectify it.  The Bill further recognises the constitutional importance attaching to marriage and the family because it provides support and financial security and in that sense promotes a long and fruitful happy family <Col N="1681" /> relationship.  It underpins marriage while others may think the opposite.</P>
    <P>It is welcome in the preparation for a divorce referendum that the Government in the Programme for a Partnership Government indicated would take place in 1994.  This is, therefore, a timely Bill. No doubt we all remember the last disastrous referendum on divorce.  People were confused by the claims and counterclaims of what would happen to either spouse in the event of the dissolution of their marriage and subsequent remarriage. People did not know how things would operate in regard to children or to property.  We were unprepared because we had not the necessary legislation in place in the run up to the referendum. That is why it is all the more important that we now smooth the way by preparing the groundwork so that people are made aware of the implications of divorce.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that the opinion polls at the time of the previous referendum on divorce indicated that a very substantial number of Irish people wanted divorce, the ratio was roughly 2:1, but when the day of reckoning came it had reverted to 2:1 against.  This was not because people had changed their views.  They still wanted a facility whereby an unhappy and non-existent relationship could be dissolved and an opportunity to be available to establish a new relationship but they baulked at the obstacles that were presented in the steps along the way.  The possible consequences terrified people.  Fear of the unknown and the many obstacles that were raised deterred people from voting in favour of the proposal in that referendum. A majority of people want liberalisation of our laws in this respect and I have no doubt about the direction we will go in a number of years.  It is important that we smooth the way.</P>
    <P>This legislation is welcome and necessary in its own right.  It does not have to be there for any particular purpose or lead to any particular end.  The law in this regard has been inequitable in the way spouses have been treated in the context of the matrimonial home or the family home; and there is a distinction between <Col N="1682" /> the two.  The family home relates in law to the situation where the spuoses are resident in the home.  The matrimonial home does not require residence <i>per se.</i> There has been no recognition of the enormous work done by the very large number of women who spend long hours at home doing work which is very often thankless and never financially remunerated. The Central Statistics Office in 1991 gave us an indication of the extensive work of the spouse in the home.  In that year 640,000 women were working full-time in the home.  That is a colossal number, almost two-thirds of one million. Thus we can see the extent of their contribution to the matrimonial home, creating it, promoting it, increasing it as an asset in every respect.  That must be recognised.  It was recognised by the Law Reform Commission, the Commission on the Status of Women and most latterly by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights.  They all recommended that a system be put in place whereby the matrimonial home would be regarded as of joint and equal interest between the spouses.  Unfortunately the law did not keep pace with the wishes of society or with proposals of the various bodies who sat and reported.  At last we have a Minister bringing forward proposals to regularise the situation.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go through the provisions of the Bill.  The main provision is that existing and future matrimonial homes should be vested in both spouses as joint owners and where one spouse dies the surviving spouse becomes the full owner.  This extends to residential homes in urban settings, to farm homes in the country, to homes where a small business might be run, homes over a shop or whatever.  It refers to the house and to the immediate appurtenances in terms of joint ownership.</P>
    <P>Section 7 relates to what might be called the &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; clause where either partner may opt out of a joint relationship which allows a married couple or a couple contemplating marriage to exclude the application of section 4, the section relating to joint ownership of the matrimonial home.  While an agreement <Col N="1683" /> which would exclude such a partner may subsequently be annulled I am concerned about the lack of constraints on its operation. Undue pressure might be brought to bear on one or other spouse to sign on the dotted line and either in advance of the marriage or during the marriage to waive their rights under this legislation. For that reason I am glad the section specifies that the Minister may make regulations.  I would prefer the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to be changed to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  If the Minister does not make regulations, then there is no determinant procedure whereby agreements would be entered into to exclude or opt out of one's entitlements. I ask the Minister to comment on that in his summing up of the proposals for regulations of this nature and to say whether he will be amenable to accepting an amendment at a later stage that would allow for a change in the wording from &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Those are the main issues I wish to raise.  I will mention one or two other points.  I am sure we all at one stage or another have had personal knowledge of marriages that do not exist any longer and of the hardship imposed when two people are by law unable to alter that situation and be free to embark upon a new relationship in an open fashion.  As an open society concerned for the wishes, needs and lives of all the citizens, we should provide law which enables them to live their lives to the full in entering into one relationship, being able to leave that relationship in proper circumstances and being able to enter into another relationship.  This Bill has a good balance in that respect because in it we are recognising the importance of marriage.</P>
    <P>I do not think it has been recognised sufficiently that this Bill underpins not the legal entity of marriage but marriage as a desirable relationship and the importance of the security of marriage. That is the key element of this Bill.  It is attaching to marriage a security and support system that has not previously existed.  We cannot divorce the financial support mechanisms from the emotional support mechanisms.  If such mechanisms <Col N="1684" /> are there it is likely that the marriage will endure.  This element of the Bill is most welcome.  The other elements in relation to equity, the recognition of the contribution made by spouses to developing and maintaining the home, are contained in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I look forward to its speedy passage through this House.  I look forward also to the next stage of the process where the Minister will begin to prepare further for the referendum promised in the Programme for a Partnership Government by producing the referendum Bill for debate in this House so that the issue can be put to the people with a greater degree of knowledge than in the past.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the speedy presentation of this legislation.  I am glad to welcome it to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I am glad to welcome this Bill and to say to the Minister that he is fortunate that in 1993 the Opposition will not be playing a neutral role and then oppose the Bill, as happened in the past, although not by his party.  When people were neutral they did everything possible to sabotage any effort which was made.  I welcome the Bill because it is difficult to deal with marriage breakdown and especially with property.  Earlier today one of the Deputies said marriage was all about property.  That came as a shock to me.  I thought marriage was all about &ldquo;love and marriage&rdquo; and so on, but property seems to play a very important role especially when marriages break up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am old fashioned enough to think that marriage should be for life and that people should live happily ever after, but we have to be realists as well.  Unfortunately, marriage for some ends very quickly and there is no great enjoyment in it.  When marriages break up everything should be made as easy as possible for the couple.  The division of property etc., should not lead to a big legal wrangle and a couple should know automatically what will happen.  We welcome the Bill for the reason that it is making an effort to do that.  We have all been briefed with documents, but I do not like reading <Col N="1685" /> them in front of somebody who was a practising solicitor and who, by the way he is going, will not be practising again for years to come.</P>
    <P>The difficulty with property arises where farms are involved.  I note that land is omitted from this Bill but the farmhouse itself is included.  The case has already been made in the House about the actual farmhouse on a farm, the surrounds and how much goes with the house, whether it is the orchard, the vegetable garden or whatever.  Difficulties will arise for farming afterwards if the farmyard is going with the farmhouse and the farmer is trying to use it.  There is also the whole question of businesses linked up with the home &mdash; for example the case of the family home which is over a public house or shop.  It is very difficult to legislate for peace, comfort and good relationships. The breakdown of marriages causes all these problems and no matter how one tries to divide property there will be difficulties.</P>
    <P>Several speakers today referred to section 7.  When I first saw the opting out clause I thought it could pose a danger. I am sure it is well intentioned.  Does anyone really think that the normal couple getting married have the slightest idea of difficulties ahead or what might happen?  One partner could easily be talked into signing an opting out clause because they do not foresee any crisis arising where there would be a discussion on the division of property.  All they can see is long sunny days, starry nights and happiness all the way.  I hope that is the experience of most people.  I am sure section 7 is well intentioned.  Perhaps it is intended to prevent golddiggers from getting married and deciding there is great property, that somebody can decide to seal it off and ensure that this will not arise.</P>
    <P>This Bill consoled me very much.  I realise now that my wife must have married me for love because she certainly did not marry me for my property or my money.  I am a very happy man tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> She will not be allowed sign anything at this stage.  She has suffered enough so she may as well continue.  The length of time a couple is married is important.  Sometimes marriages break up after three months or even after three weeks.  I doubt very much if justice would be served by somebody claiming half the family home at that stage.  The question then is: how does one manage that part?  It is a matter that should be seriously considered.  In my view a marriage should last at least 12 months before somebody could begin to make claims to property to which they made no contribution in the purchase, repair etc.  People could be prevented from being fooled into marriage.  It is amazing how many people are soft in the head when it comes to falling in love, or somebody fooling them slightly and disappearing after a couple of months. There should be a safeguard to ensure that they are not conned.</P>
      <P>Section 4 (8) deals with shared ownership where, say, a parent, a mother and son, mother and daughter, father and son or father and daughter have shared ownership of the house.  Perhaps the Minister would explain if when the new spouse comes they all have a third of the property?  This is something I do not understand.  As so many others have said, this legal document is not for people who have not studied law.  One would almost need to be a barrister to understand all the details.  In a document I have here I read that many legal difficulties arose from previous legislation, but I hope that will not happen in the case of this legislation. Loopholes and other difficulties will arise, but that is part and parcel of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could repeat much of what has been said, but the Minister has heard it all.  I welcome the Bill.  I hope very few will have to use its facilities.  We would all hope that people would not be in a legal wrangle over property and that marriages would not break up.  Unfortunately they will break up and therefore I welcome <Col N="1687" /> the fact that spouses who are abandoned or ill-treated will have the right to claim without having to take out expensive law suits, that they will have some happiness and some defence in a future which may appear bleak at the time of the marriage breakup.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I sincerely thank all the Deputies who contributed to the Second Stage of this Bill, which is a landmark measure, as many Deputies have been good enough to point out.  There have been some very constructive contributions from all sides of the House.  I look forward to considering all the points on Committee Stage and I hope we have adequate time to discuss them in a reasoned way.  I hope Deputies will forgive me if I do not cover all the points raised but I assure them that they have been noted and will be considered carefully. I am sure many of those comments will be put forward again in the form of amendments on Committee Stage when they will be examined constructively and objectively.</P>
      <P>The opt-out clause appears to have attracted most comment and criticism from Deputies on all sides of the House during the debate.  Deputy McManus took an extreme position on this matter and suggested that there should not be a provision for opting out in any circumstances. Other Deputies made the point that if there is an opt-out provision it should only be allowed if prior advice is given to the opting out spouse by a lawyer, in other words, the person's consent to opt out would be signed and witnessed by a lawyer.  That is a fair point which we have already discussed at length in the Department.</P>
      <P>It would not be reasonable or proper to compel one spouse in a marriage to receive and accept a half share in a tenancy or valuable property if he or she does not want to do so.  This is a free country and a spouse should not be compelled to accept a half share in a property if he or she does not want it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1688" /> I am sure we will discuss at length on Committee Stage the question of whether it should be compulsory for a spouse to seek legal advice and have the opt-out form signed by a solicitor, but in the meantime, I will keep an open mind on the matter.  However, as many Deputies referred to that matter I will make a couple of points now.  A wife may be under duress to sign an opt-out form, but it is probably fair to assume that even if she went to a solicitor and listened to what he or she said, similar duress would apply in regard to signing the opt-out form.  There is a down side to that question as well because in general law if a person signs a document under duress the court can void it.  A person can go to a court at any time and say that he or she was compelled to sign a document and it would be declared void.  However, if the document was witnessed by a solicitor a person would not succeed in that regard. A court would not listen to a claim that it had been signed under duress because it will maintain that the person had independent legal advice on the matter. There is a potential weakness in that respect.  The broad general question as to why or whether people in full command of their senses should be compelled to pay a solicitor if they decide to opt out of a property clause is another aspect of the matter to which I am sure we will refer on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello queried whether I will introduce regulations or whether I should be obliged to do so.  It is my intention to introduce them and to draft a form on which it will clearly state that the form the person is signing is an important legal document and that it may be advisable to consult one's solicitor or adviser before signing it.  I hope that will meet the requirements.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty asked whether a person or persons might challenge the Bill's constitutionality.  It is open to anybody at any time to go to court and challenge the constitutionality of any Act, arguments can be made for and against that.  In so far as this Bill is concerned, based on the best possible legal advice furnished to me, it is constitutional and <Col N="1689" /> in order from that point of view.  I am aware of the reference to rights to private property in the Constitution but there is a saver there, the family is dealt with on an equal basis in our Constitution.  It must be borne in mind that the Judicial Separation Act, which has operated without difficulty since 1989, gives power to a court to make many types of property transfer orders on the family home and on any other aspect of property in a separation case.  Hundreds of property transfers, pursuant to court orders following judicial separations, have been made and continue to be made on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty also raised the question of mortgages.  Section 14 of the Bill deals with liability for payment of the mortgage when the mortgager spouse dies.  This section provides that the mortgage will continue to be a charge for which the property is primarily liable and in that case the surviving spouse will be liable for payments of the mortgage. Under the statutory joint tenancy during the lifetime of both spouses, the mortgager spouse is liable for payment as before.  If the benefiting spouse can afford to pay his or her share, he or she should do so, and if they fail to do so in an unreasonble manner then in accordance with the terms of section 6 there is the possibility the court could make an order terminating their right to the joint tenancy. In any case, before any building society or bank will give a mortgage on a family home they invariably require the signature and guarantee of both spouses before they will grant it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty asked if section 21 replaces section 12 of the Married Women's Status Act, 1957.  That is the Act which gave the court power to settle disputes between spouses about matrimonial property.  In fact, it is section 19 of the Bill before the House which replaces section 12 of the 1957 Act and in so doing takes into account the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission's first report on family law.  The object of section 21, which was referred to by a number of Deputies, is to amend the existing law in relation to the effective contributions by a spouse to the improvement <Col N="1690" /> of real or personal property other than a matrimonial home jointly owned, by virtue of section 4 of this Bill.  In other words, section 21 refers to business premises or premises owned by the spouses otherwise than in equal shares.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell expressed concern about banks foreclosing on a judgment mortgage after the husband had pledged the home and business as security.  The bank can only register a judgment mortgage against the husbands's interest if the judgment is against him alone so that the wife's share of a joint tenancy would not be affected on that basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Harney suggested that the opt out facility should perhaps be extended to a right to opt out under the Family Home Protection Act also.  I would be reluctant to do this without very careful consideration.  The non-owning spouse is only required to give consent when the family home is being sold or mortgaged.  However, I have gone some distance towards meeting this point of view by allowing a spouse to give a general consent in advance to any future sale of the home.  However, if Deputy Harney wishes to raise this point again on Committee Stage I certainly will look at it in more detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On section 6, Deputy Bradford wanted to know whether the criteria for disallowing the joint interest of a spouse who has behaved wrongly would be spelled out more clearly and was wondering whether there would be any uniformity in decisions.  I will look at the question of clarifying the criteria further on Committee Stage.  Deputy Bradford also asked if I was happy about the giving of jurisdiction to the District Court in property matters and pointed out that it would put a heavy strain in staffing in that court.  However, I do not envisage that there will be a large run of litigation as a result of the passing of this Bill.  This is quite a different proposition from and is not comparable to the passing of the Judicial Separation Act which led, predictably, <Col N="1691" /> to a flood of applications to the Circuit Court which was the court provided for judicial separation.  There was a huge increase in the volume of business and this has been increasing year on year ever since the Act was passed.  I take the view that the number of applications brought under this Bill will be few.  There will be various applications in regard to certain aspects of the matter but I do not envisage that many.  In regard to a strain on staff, if cases go to court there will be a strain on whatever court they go to, be it the District Court or the Circuit Court.  I think it was Deputy McManus who said that there have been bizarre decisions given in District Courts on occasions.  I am quite sure there have. There have been some bizarre decisions given in Circuit Courts too on occasions that some Deputies will know about and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in the High Court; we will say nothing about the Supreme Court.  There is no monopoly on such decisions.  As to the question of district judges dealing with matters of title to land, I take the view that district judges are the best qualified to deal with such matters.  Having been for the most part solicitors that is precisely what they have been dealing with virtually all their professional lives and consequently they would be very well qualified in that area. There is a major advantage in giving jurisdiction to the District Court.  The costs are only a small fraction of what they would be in the Circuit Court.  Many of the applications arising under the Bill would be straightforward and of a summary nature.  It is far cheaper and much speedier to deal with them in the District Court.  One can be in and out of the District Court with a decision in a couple of months at the outside.  In the Circuit Court the lists are hugely in arrears and there is a much more extensive array of paperwork necessary before one gets a hearing at all.  In addition, one does not <Col N="1692" /> need a barrister to go to the District Court; solicitors do that on their own, whereas in the Circuit Court or the High Court one usually needs a barrister. There are many advantages in allowing the District Courts deal with some aspects of these matters.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGrath or Deputy Browne suggested that there could be difficulties in defining boundaries between the house and the farm.  There might be the odd case where there would be a difficulty in deciding such an issue.  However, we are talking about spouses.  We are not talking about marriages that have broken down. Most cases this will apply to are cases where marriages are proceeding happily and the purpose and intent of the Bill is to give recognition to the work that the wife has put into the family over the years.  In most cases the spouses will agree on the boundary between the farmhouse and the farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> It would only arise when there are marriage difficulties.  A happily married couple will not have any difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>In a case where there are difficulties the matter goes to court and there is provision for that.  There may be a difficulty in drawing the boundary between the farmhouse, its adjoining garden and ancillary outhouses and the rest of the farm, but there is nothing insuperable about it.  Any district judge used to dealing with title matters will look at the drawings or, if necessary, go and inspect the scene to see what it is reasonable to say is the garden and an appropriate adjunct of the house as opposed to where the farm begins.  I cannot say I am that familiar with the layout of farms and farmhouses but from what I have seen of them in most cases the garden is clearly shown.  The main reason for providing access to a court in the event of difficulty was not so much to determine a boundary line, which may be fenced off in any case, but to provide for access to the water supply.  In many cases the house water supply comes from an area of the farm. In the case of a separation and the sale <Col N="1693" /> of the family home or farm the parties involved would require a right of way to gain access to the water supply.  It is necessary to make provision for court access to settle such easement problems. I would not envisage that access to court would be sought in many cases.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flaherty raised the question of whether the Judicial Separation Act would continue to apply in the event of parties separating following a marriage breakdown.  The same provisions will apply in that case.  The powers the court has under the Judicial Separation Act to make property distribution orders, including those in respect of the family matrimonial home, will continue to apply and there will be no change in that regard.</P>
      <P>The District Court has no jurisdiction where a judicial separation is concerned and one must attend the Circuit Court in this regard.  Deputy Harney raised at Question Time the costs of such a Circuit Court proceeding.  The costs are substantial. As the law stands people are obliged to attend court even though the value of their assets may be very small and possibly less than the costs involved in obtaining a judicial separation in the Circuit Court.  This is a matter we may have to examine in the future.  We may have to provide District Court jurisdiction in this regard.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bradford stated that an extension of the legal aid scheme might be necessary to enable spouses avail of their rights under the Bill.  As I stated yesterday at Question Time, it is the Government's intention to extend and expand the legal aid service and preliminary steps are under way in that regard.  I do not consider this Bill will involve any major recourse to the law or lawyers in the majority of cases.  The impact and thrust of the Bill is automatically to vest joint ownership in both spouses without any real or pressing necessity to take any steps in that regard. This Bill provides for joint ownership and action will only have to be taken if a person wishes to opt out of a property contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If people wish to register their legal <Col N="1694" /> interests they will need to visit a solicitor. At present if a husband wishes to put the property into the joint names of the husband and wife he will also have to attend a solicitor.  The costs of this operation would be much more expensive than having a simple registration document prepared under the terms of this Bill and lodged in the Land Registry or the Registry of Deeds.  The costs involved would be minimal.  It is not essential to obtain a registration document.  The spouse does not have to attend a solicitor to obtain a half share joint tenancy interest under the terms of the Bill.  The Bill vests this interest in them automatically without their having to take any affirmative or definitive steps.</P>
    <P>Deputies McManus and Browne raised the case of a mother and son who own a dwelling jointly and asked what the legal position is if the son should get married. In that case the three parties do not become joint owners.  The joint tenancy which formerly existed between the mother and the son is severed.  In other words, the mother retains her half share and the other half share becomes the joint holding of the son and his wife. What was previously the son's half share becomes the joint half share of the son and his wife.</P>
    <P>A question was raised as to whether the extent of the vesting of the interest in the matrimonial home should be on a phased basis to provide that one would get say 5 per cent of that interest after six months and 10 per cent after a year.  I understand the thinking behind this suggestion but it is not a realistic proposition. Most people would agree that when one enters the state of marriage one enters a contract, whether it is for three weeks, three months, three years or 30 years.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;would consider it inappropriate to have a progression of interest.  A husband and wife by reason of their relationship should become equal partners in their home and own it jointly on marriage.  I am not referring to property outside the home.  I am aware that the Commission on the Status of Women recommends that all property in a marriage acquired after the date of the marrige should be held on a community basis. We may progress to provide for that, but in this Bill we are just referring to the home in which the spouses live.  Their home is their base and they both contribute to it and work in it.  A special case arises in marriage and the intent of the Bill is to provide for joint ownership of the matrimonial home.  This is the recommendation of the Joint Commission on the Status of Women.</P>

      <P>If a couple never lived in the family home it might not be their matrimonial home.  There is a qualification in the definition and the definition of matrimonial home may not apply in such a case.</P>
      <P>The question was also raised as to why the Bill does not apply to people who are already separated.  This point can be discussed further on Committee Stage but in most cases where people are separated they have made their arrangements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not always the case, but in most cases the people have their arrangements.  There are many cases where a matrimonial home would have been in joint names initially.  When a couple separates there are many cases <Col N="1696" /> where the wife has bought out the husband's half share of the family home.  I do not think any members would suggest in those circumstances that the husband should be revested with a half share in the dwelling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>In cases where no agreement exists and a separation has taken place an application will have to be made under the Judicial Separation Act.  If the parties cannot agree to enter into a separation agreement it is appropriate for them to make an application under the Judicial Separation Act.  It would be best for the parties to negotiate terms and enter into a separation agreement.  If the parties cannot agree to this the Judicial Separation Act provides that an application should be made.</P>
      <P>Many Members have commented that the Bill is complex.  Before I started work on the Bill I did not realise how complex it was.  However, I assure all Deputies that on Committee Stage I will endeavour to be as forthcoming as I can, and any help that I or my officials can offer before that will be given willingly.  I look forward to Committee Stage when we can discuss all these complexities in detail.</P>

      <P>The European Communities (Amendment) Bill which is before the House provides: (i) for certain amendments to the EC Treaty concerning the Statute of the European Investment Bank; (ii) for the incorporation into domestic law of the European Economic Area Agreement; (iii) for the retrospective confirmation of Ministerial Regulations previously made under the European Communities Act 1972, and (iv) for the transfer of the statutory functions of the former Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation to the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>The European Council at Edinburgh in December 1992 called for actions to contribute to economic growth and employment.  Among these was the setting up of a European Investment Fund (EIF).  The founder members would be the European Investment Bank, which would be the major shareholder, as well as the Community and other major financial institutions.</P>
      <P>This fund would be a self-sustaining fund to provide financial guarantees for borrowings and so facilitate private financing of infrastructural projects.  It would also help small and medium sized enterprises.  The fund would consist of two billion ECUs, about 40 per cent of which would come from the EIB and 30 per cent from the Community, the remaining being contributed by major financial institutions.  Because of the prudential ratios that would be likely to operate, the two billion ECUs are expected to cover about five to ten billion ECUs in guarantees.  This impetus to infrastructural investment in the Community is seen as a significant contribution to stimulating economic activity and so helping create jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Infrastructural works in Ireland are eligible for grant funding under the <Col N="1698" /> Cohesion Fund and the Regional Funds. The EIF will be available to Ireland also. It would also apply to stimulate activity in areas which are not Objective 1 regions. Any impetus that could stimulate economic activity in the Community at the present time must be welcome and would enhance the prospects of increased employment in Ireland and throughout the Community.  The recent European Council in Copenhagen, as we know, laid considerable emphasis on this aspect.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been to the forefront in the Community in pressing for action to stimulate economic activity and employment in Europe.  Prompt ratification by Ireland of the instrument that allows the European Investment Fund to operate will give a clear message about the importance we attach to the growth initiative &mdash; an initiative which goes much wider than this instrument alone.</P>
    <P>The Copenhagen European Council has attached great importance to the growth initiative and developed it further. This includes a significant increase in another EIB facility initiated by Edinburgh. This will be a further stimulus to public and private investment in Europe at a time when there is great need to stimulate economic activity.  This other facility, operated directly by the EIB, is additional to the European Investment Fund, which will be set up by the EIB, the Community and other shareholders as a separate instrument.</P>
    <P>To enable the European Investment Bank to be a shareholder of the EIF it was necessary to amend the Protocol on the Statute of the European Investment Bank, which is part of the EEC Treaty. The amendment, called the Act Amending the Protocol on the European Investment Bank, was signed by the member states, including Ireland, on 25 March.  With a view to ratifying this Act and enabling the European Investment Fund to become operational, it is proposed to add this instrument to the list of treaties constituting the European Communities in section 1 of the European Communities Act, 1972.</P>
    <P>It is also proposes to add to the list a purely technical treaty signed in 1975.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1699" /> This was a technical amendment which it was not legally necessary to add to the list at the time; but, given that the 1993 amendment is being added, it is considered appropriate in the interests of clarity to add the 1975 amendment to the list also.</P>
    <P>In relation to the European Economic Area Agreement, Deputies will recall that this agreement was approved by the Dáil on 30 October last.  The agreement had been due to come into effect on 1 January 1993 following ratification by all the parties.  However, following rejection of the agreement by the Swiss people in a referendum on 6 December, it became necessary to modify the agreement to take account of the non participation of Switzerland.  An adjusting Protocol was accordingly negotiated and signed in Brussels on 17 March.</P>
    <P>The adjusting Protocol itemises the technical adaptations necessary to exclude Switzerland from the agreement. It also sets out the agreement reached on the adjustments to the Financial Mechanism. This is the fund totalling 1.5 billion ECU in soft loans and 500 million ECU in grants to be provided by the EFTA side for Ireland, Greece, Spain and Portugal as a contribution towards the reduction of social and economic disparities in the EEA.  Switzerland was to have contributed 27.3 per cent of this fund.  The agreement in the adjusting Protocol on the Financial Mechanism leaves the grant element untouched while the interest subsidy on the loans will be reduced from 3 per cent to 2 per cent. This involves the other EFTA countries taking up 60 per cent of the burden arising from Switzerland's exclusion from the agreement.</P>
    <P>The adjusting Protocol to the EEA envisages entry into force of the agreement on 1 July 1993 provided that all contracting parties have deposited their instruments of ratification before that date.  I attach considerable importance to the early entry into force of this agreement, which will provide a more intensive and structured framework for relations with the EFTA countries, with which <Col N="1700" /> Ireland has always enjoyed excellent political and economic ties.  Four of these countries &mdash; Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway &mdash; are in the process of negotiating accession to the EC.  While the EEA Agreement is separate from the accession applications, it is nevertheless the case that substantial work done through the EEA process on a wide range of the Community's legislation will facilitate the accession negotiations to a considerable degree.</P>
    <P>Ireland's trade with the EFTA countries is buoyant and in surplus.  Its further growth should be facilitated by the removal of obstacles as provided for in the EEA Agreement.  We also stand to gain from the operation of the Financial Mechanism.  I am hopeful, therefore, that both the agreement and Protocol can enter into force as soon as possible and that this important agreement can be implemented without delay.</P>
    <P>An amendment to the European Communities Act is required to enable Ireland to ratify the agreement and adjusting Protocol.  The amendment proposed in section 3 of the European Communities (Amendment) Bill will make the EEA Agreement and acts of the EEA institutions part of the domestic law of the State.  The Bill also caters for adaptations and amendments to existing legislation required to enable Ireland ratify the EEA.  Future obligations arising under the EEA Agreement will, where appropriate, be implemented by means of future domestic legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill will ensure, in advance of the Supreme Court decision in the Meagher case, that existing Ministerial regulations under section 3 of the European Communities Act, 1972, will, in so far as necessary, be validated retrospectively as from the time when they took effect.  The effect of the High Court judgment &mdash; subject to the outcome of the appeal to the Supreme Court &mdash; in the Meagher case is to declare part of the regulation making power in section 3 (2) of the European Communities Act 1972 to be unconstitutional.  Subject to the outcome of the appeal, this judgment creates a serious defect, with implications not <Col N="1701" /> only for the present and future but also for the past, in the State's implementation of its obligations under the European Community Treaties.  Such implementation depends to a considerable extent on regulations made under the 1972 Act from the time we joined the Communities.  Furthermore, the State is about to accede to the EEA Agreement and the implementation of our obligations under that agreement would also depend to a considerable extent on regulations made under the 1972 Act as adapted pursuant to section 4 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>If these problems in so far as they affect existing regulations were not addressed in the Bill, questions might be raised as to the propriety of the State's ratifying the EEC Agreement.  For this reason and in view of the interests involved it is not appropriate that the position should be left unaddressed any longer.  The appeal to the Supreme Court is being heard this month and will be fully contested by the State.  In this regard, section 5 (3) makes it expressly clear that the section should not be construed as prejudicing the State's position in the appeal.  It should be noted that the section only concerns ministerial regulations under the 1972 Act which are in force at the passing of the present legislation; the outcome of the appeal is, of course, of great importance for the future exercise of the regulation-making powers under the 1972 Act.  The provisions of section 5 do not cover this.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the statutory functions of the former Oireachtas Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities be transferred to the new Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  The European Communities (Amendment) Act, 1973, provided that regulations made under the European Communities Act, 1972, shall have statutory effect unless the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation recommend to the Oireachtas that a regulation be annulled and both Houses passed a resolution annulling the regulation concerned within one year.  The terms of reference for the Joint Committee <Col N="1702" /> on Foreign Affairs as approved by the Dáil on 28 April provide for the consideration by the committee of regulations made under the European Communities Acts.  The Bill puts that role on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>The various measures contained in this Bill touch on a number of very important aspects of EC membership.  Three significant issues are covered.  Firstly, the capacity of the European Investment Bank to provide development finance is increased.  While the European Investment Fund involves a relatively minor aspect of the Community's development effort in Ireland, it is, nevertheless, an important indication of the contribution which the Community makes to our development.  The current negotiations on the Stuctural Funds and the Government's very determined stand clearly underlines the Community's position in our strategy to tackle unemployment and bring about economic recovery.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the implementation of the European Economic Area shows the importance for the community in the operation of our relations with other European countries.  Ireland has substantial economic and political links with the EFTA countries.  We hope after detailed negotiations to welcome four of those countries as members of the Community and of the European Union. Implementation of the EEA will benefit the Irish economy.  It will send a signal as to Ireland's commitment to the enlargement of the Community.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the Bill transfers the legislative scrutiny functions of the old joint committee to the new Foreign Affairs Committee.  The new committee will be in a position to monitor fully all aspects of Irish foreign policy of which EC affairs are an essential component.  With the powers given to it under this legislation it will be able to revive and continue the vital task of monitoring secondary legislation.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is something oddly compelling about the legislative potpourri before us tonight.  Several of its <Col N="1703" /> provisions are simple housekeeping provisions, incorporating two legislative titles in the 1972 European Communities Act relating to the European Investment Bank and the new European Investment Fund and the transfer of functions from the old Oireachtas Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation to the new Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  This Bill is also interesting for its revelation of the Government's attitude towards public accountability and openness in Government.</P>
      <P>The Government's records in respect of the implementation of EC directives and regulations has been less than satisfactory. Far too often Ireland has been brought to heel by the European Court of Justice for its failure to implement Community directives.  The Government is putting the taxpayer at enormous risk by its failure to implement EC directives promptly.  A judgment was issued in November 1991 when a group of Italian citizens took its Government to court for failure to implement a directive on redundancy payments, thereby creating a precedent for other member states in respect of the rights of citizens.  This case which is known as the Francowich case represented a landmark case for the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In spite of the fact that this judgment was made in 1991 the Government still continued to show contempt for taxpayers, who will eventually have to pay the legal costs if an Irish citizen is successful in taking a similar case against the Irish Government.  This clearly indicates that the Government is taking a casual approach to Community law, particularly in terms of the implementation of EC directives, thereby compounding the alienation the public feel towards Europe generally.  The Government is fuelling a growing cynicism among the public through its refusal to open up debate on regulations.  This attitude has, unfortunately, led to a decision by the High Court in the Meagher case to throw out all ministerial orders and regulations &mdash; the mechanism and process of <Col N="1704" /> implementing EC directives &mdash; made since 1972.</P>
    <P>Ireland has failed to ratify at least 25 EC Directives since June 1991.  They range from approving the transparency of gas and electricity prices charged to industrial users, package travel, package holidays and package tours, the approximation of laws of member states relating to trademarks, unfair terms in respect of consumer contracts and various directives relating to the insurance industry. This legislation seeks to validate all ministerial orders since 1972.  It is legal voodoo which seeks to make lawful what has been found unlawful in the High Court.  It is peculiar that the Government has not waited for the Supreme Court decision to establish if some of the directives are valid or if the exercising of power by ministerial order has been unconstitutional, in which case a referendum to amend the Treaty of Rome may be required.</P>
    <P>Ministers should not be allowed to make or amend legislation outside the democratic process.  A ministerial order eliminates the need for full legislative review.  Fine Gael believes the ordinary citizens of the European Community are too far removed from decision-making and that they lack power.  On many occasions the Minister and others made statements about the need for subsidiarity and removal of the democratic deficit.  This Bill provides an opportunity to put in place measures in that regard. Fine Gael will be tabling amendments to this legislation to ensure that all EC directives and regulations will be referred to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs for approval before implementation and that resolutions will have to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, thereby giving us an opportunity to debate issues and ensuring that the public knows what is in the regulations.  The European Community already suffers from what has been termed the democratic deficit.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the famous £8.6 billion.  The Taoiseach is anxious to distract attention from his own political embarrassment in respect of the allocation <Col N="1705" /> of EC Structural Funds for the next seven years.  On 16 December 1992 the Taoiseach stated to Dáil Éireann on the outcome of the Edinburgh Summit: &ldquo;the agreement now reached ensures, and I say this with complete confidence, that Ireland will obtain in excess of £8 billion over seven years.&rdquo;  In various statements in the last few weeks the Taoiseach clearly indicated that the £8 billion agreed at the Edinburgh Summit was &ldquo;in the bag&rdquo;.  Obviously there is now a gaping hole in the bag.  I sympathise with the Minister who was not part of the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is certainly relevant to the growth initiatives referred to in the Minister's contribution.  It transpired recently that the Taoiseach received nothing more than a wink and a nod from a Community official at Edinburgh and he has been seeking to exploit this encounter as an agreement.  While the Taoiseach and Ireland were engaging in an unnecessary general election in November the Spanish Prime Minister was engaging in serious political lobbying in the European Community to ensure that the issues of national prosperity, demographic patterns, the level of unemployment and the needs of rural development were fully understood by his EC members, and he was able to fight a very strong case.</P>

      <P>Section 2, which is the first substantive part of this Bill, facilities the establishment of the European Investment <Col N="1706" /> Fund as part of the European Investment Bank.  The new investment fund has been designed to bolster the efforts of EIB investment in viable projects throughout the Community and as part of the EC growth initiative, referred to by the Tánaiste, launched at the Edinburgh Summit and reviewed recently in Copenhagen.  The unfortunate weakness of these programmes and initiatives is that they are too meagre to be effective and are working against contradictory national policies.  Thus they have no significant impact on either employment or growth.  I doubt if the Minister could point to a single job in this country which has resulted from any of these projects.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately this reflects our national malaise in which form has replaced substance &mdash; something which this Government illustrates all too well.  When faced with an immediate and pressing problem, the first reaction of this Government is to appoint a board, a forum, a council or a commission.  Instead of effective Government we get ineffectual chatter.  If this Government or, indeed, the EC is serious about a Community-wide growth initiative then what is required is a common macro-economic policy and effective wealth redistribution with an economic and monetary union.  I wish that was what the Government was now proposing instead of this sticking-plaster approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill formally ratifies an agreement between the EC and all but one of the countries of the European Free Trade Area on the creation of a European Economic Area.  Rather than bury this critical European development within this legislative measure, the Government should today be providing this House with a serious debate on where it sees future European developments heading.  The EEA agreement does not stand alone.  It is part and parcel of much wider and critically important developments in Europe.  The EEA agreement has implications for the institutional development of the EC, membership applications to the Community, Ireland's position in the evolution of the Community and, crucially, the relationship <Col N="1707" /> between the EC and trading blocs throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Most of the EFTA states have already made applications for EC membership and are in negotiation with the Commission on the terms of their accession. If the EEA is, as it seems, a half-way house on the road to membership the Visegrad countries &mdash; Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic &mdash; may soon look to the EEA as a logical next step in their membership campaign.</P>
    <P>In its presentation of this Bill, the Government has failed to inform this House of the long-range implications of this provision.  What is the Government's view on institutional changes necessary to accommodate four new member states as early as 1996 and another four states within the decade?  Would the Government support accession to the EEA agreement by the Visegrad states?  What steps has the Government taken to ensure that Ireland's absolute share of Regional and Structural funds is maintained in an enlarged Community?  Has the Government yet analysed Irish interests <i>vis-à-vis</i> the EEA and other trade blocs such as the North American Free Trade Area and emerging blocs in Asia?  None of these issues has been appropriately dealt with by the Government. Perhaps the Tánaiste would take the opportunity on Committee Stage tomorrow, to examine those issues.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill provides for the formal transfer of the statutory powers of the former Oireachtas Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities to the new Foreign Affairs Committee.  As Fine Gael Spokesperson for European Affairs, I pay tribute to the members of the former committee for their dedication to a task which lacked great public visibility.  The members of that committee took their responsibilities seriously and, in a number of reports, analysed the implications of a number of important European developments.</P>
    <P>The task of the Foregin Affairs Committee and its sub-committees will be to build upon the tradition of careful legislative <Col N="1708" /> review established by the previous joint committee.  The new Foreign Affairs Committee is working very well and I commend the Tánaiste and the Department of Foreign Affairs on the wide variety of documents which have been preesented to the committee for discussion and on the manner in which they have made themselves available for consultation when requested by the committee.</P>
    <P>The most offensive part of this Bill is nearer to the end of it.  Section 5 provides for the retrospective validation of all ministerial orders which the Meagher decision in the High Court has ruled to be invalid.  At the risk of paraphrasing complex legal issues, the High Court found that the Government's translation of EC Directives into Irish law by using ministerial orders was invalid as each provision which either created new laws or amended previously passed legislation must, in law, be approved by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>What we have before us is an ill-conceived attempt by the Government to patch over a gaping hole in our legislative process.  We have been found wanting with regard to the manner in which we have examined recent EC Directives. This legislation represents a sad, pathetic attempt to make lawful what has been deemed unlawful.  I understand the haste with which this must be done, particularly having regard to the EEA, our goodwill towards the processs emerging there and the promises that the Tánaiste and the Irish Government have given in respect of our agreement to that process in July 1993, but the Government must not be given the luxury of arguing that this is either a hiccup in the process that has served the country well in the past or that this is a requirement of EC law.</P>
    <P>A number of legal scholars have been insisting for some time that the use of ministerial orders to bring EC rules into Irish law was not necessary and was potentially unsound.  Mr. Anthony Whelan of Trinity College, Dublin, for example, raised this issue some time before the Meagher case arose.  He argued convincingly that the Government <Col N="1709" /> has taken a dangerous path of least resistance in this regard &mdash; leaving itself open to precisely the sort of legal challenge that the Government now faces.</P>
    <P>Instead of soberly and seriously addressing itself to the real issues raised by the Meagher case the Government has spun on its collective heel and cobbled together a legislative illusion.  The provision before us makes everything legal that the High Court has declared to be illegal, while at the same time insisting in its own legislation that this effort is unnecessary because in the Government's view everything the High Court found to be illegal is, in fact, still legal. With this kind of legislation emerging from his Department it is, frankly, a wonder that the Tánaiste's head has stopped spinning long enough for him to enter this House.  Even more seriously, this legislation fails to address a fundamental issue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation fails to address the fundamental issue that Ministers should not be allowed to make or amend legislation outside of the democratic process.  A ministerial order eliminates the need for full legislative review and it is undoubtedly a swifter, surer method of lawmaking than tedious sessions in this House.  I urge the Tánaiste in his quest for open government to seek to amend this legislation to ensure that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs will have the ability to examine and approve the various EC Directives and so that this House will get an opportunity to debate the legislation in order that people outside the House will have some indication of the way in which European law is being transposed into national law and will <Col N="1710" /> have some indication of the contents of the Directives before they are implemented.</P>

      <P>The Progressive Democrats support this Bill.  Sections 1 to 4 are unexceptional as far as we are concerned.  Section 5, which deals with the result of the Meagher decision, is right in parts and questionable in other parts but the reality is that the judgment of Mr. Justice Johnson in the Meagher case in the High Court is open to debate and as we speak it is being argued before the Supreme Court.  It is a finely balanced argument and it is not one on which I would care to hazard any of my money. The State is correct in seeking to have the European Community regulations made under the statute validated retrospectively.</P>
      <P>It is a source of worry that we have not taken on board some of the lessons we ought to have learned and anticipated in the context of the decision handed down in the Meagher case and the proceedings which gave rise to that case.  When the Single European Act was debated in this House &mdash; I was a Member of the House at the time &mdash; my party, the Progressive Democrats, proposed that the words &ldquo;necessitated by&rdquo; should be replaced with the words &ldquo;consequent upon&rdquo; in the section of the Constitution which allows the ratification of the European Community Treaties.</P>

    <P>The then Taoiseach, Mr. Jack Lynch, introduced the legislation which led to Ireland's accession to the European Community.  The original text stated that acts done &ldquo;consequent upon&rdquo; our membership of the European Community should have the force of law in the State.  It was Dr. Garret FitzGerald, on behalf of Fine Gael, who led the crusade against it on the basis that the Government would be allowed too much flexibility and that it would allow the creation of a common foreign policy without there being a need to refer the matter to the people.  In order to achieve interparty consensus, the then Taoiseach, Mr. Jack Lynch, narrowed the scope of the <Col N="1711" /> original referendum proposed by him to necessitated obligations.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Single European Act Deputy O'Malley and I drew attention to the probability &mdash; we have been vindicated thus far &mdash; that somebody some day would take the view that necessitated obligations were different from consequential obligations and some of the things done on the presumption that they were necessitated were not necessitated but merely consequential and optional so far as the State was concerned. By using the term &ldquo;necessitated obligations&rdquo; in Article 29 we have imposed an unduly restrictive constraint on Ireland's membership of the European Community.  We do not take any pleasure in saying &ldquo;we said so&rdquo; because the Supreme Court may say that we were wrong, but at least we have been vindicated as far as the High Court is concerned.</P>
    <P>It strikes me that the more important question is not whether all the regulations made under the European Communities Act, 1972, should be validated retrospectively but rather what we propose to do in the future.  It is made clear in the explanatory memorandum and in the Minister's speech that that matter is not being decided today.  Despite Deputy Hogan's encomium for the former Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, it is nonsense and untrue to suggest that any legislation of the European Community has been adequately vetted or that a committee is capable of vetting adequately what has happened on the foot of the use of ministerial powers under that Act.</P>
    <P>I remember what happened.  The regulations relating to unit trust funds were one inch thick when delivered in 1988 or 1989 and were immensely detailed.  As far as I am aware, they were not the subject of a worthwhile debate when presented to the Members of the House.</P>
    <P>The second point that needs to be made is that the notion that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs is competent to deal with unit trust funds legislation is ridiculous.  Likewise, it is <Col N="1712" /> nonsense to suggest that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs has a special competence to deal with regulations relating to angel dust and thyrostatic substances. I have attended that committee and I agree with Deputy Hogan that it functions extremely well, but I do not think that Deputy Hogan, Deputy De Rossa and I could legitimately claim we have any expertise to deal with the vast panoply of subjects to which secondary legislation applies.  It is absurd that that committee should have to review regulations relating to angel dust.</P>
    <P>Last night I spoke about how good the committee was but it is self-deception of the worst kind to suggest that that committee is in a position to scrutinise secondary legislation of the European Community.  If regulations relating to angel dust were to be presented before that committee tomorrow I do not think that it would be any more capable than any other committee of this House to deal with them.  If the committee took its job seriously it would soon snag up and fail to function.</P>
    <P>That brings me on to the main point.  I agree with Deputy Hogan when he says that regulations should be circulated some time in advance so that the views of those Members who wish to make an input in regard to unit trust funds or angel dust which are different from, helpful or complementary to the views being expressed in the draft regulations can be taken into account before the regulations are made.  I would stake my life on it, subject to contradiction, that no regulations have ever been reversed by this House.  If that is the case, why do we find ourselves in a position where substantial decisions on the content of domestic law fall to be decided by ministerial fiat?  The Legislature which is supposed to keep an eye on what is happening is not consulted in advance and is given a negative veto to be exercised through a mechanism which is ineffectual.  I have never read in the newspapers that regulations were annulled by the House except perhaps in a case where an error was made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Legislature is to take itself seriously &mdash; I agree with Deputy Hogan on this point &mdash; it should have a role in relation to draft regulations and if this committee is to take itself seriously it should ask to see draft regulations before they are made rather than say that it will see them when completed and that we can annul them if we are dissatisfied.  That is common sense and for the life of me I cannot imagine why such a pre-consultative role is excluded.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hogan's suggestion that consideration should be given to the introduction of such a pro-consultative role is entirely sensible.  The committee in question should not deal with these issues.  The committees of this House, which have been established to deal with broad areas of public policy, should in general have these regulations allocated among them on the supposition that they are reservoirs of expertise in particular areas rather than the contrary.</P>
      <P>Section 5 (4) offends me on the basis that it provides:</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding section 10 (4) of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851, proceedings in respect of offences committed after the passing of this Act under regulations (whether made before or after such passing) under the Act of 1972 may be instituted at any time within two years from the date of the commission of the offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know precisely why this has been done. As the explanatory memorandum says, it is to deal with a specific point raised by the plaintiffs in the Meagher case and canvassed by them.  With respect, why should there be a two year commencement period for proceedings imposed on us by Europe while the ordinary norm in respect of Irish criminal law is that summary proceedings should be commenced within six months?  These are proceedings in which the rights of the individual are at stake in many cases. With regard to the angel dust cases, about which I know something, the idea that <Col N="1714" /> one can commence such a prosecution two years after the detection of the substance in a beast on somebody's farm is offensive to reason and should not be done.  I do not believe there is any logic in deciding that because an offence is created under a European rubric, the State, the prosecutor in most of these matters, should have a two year lead-in period whereas every other Joe Soap should have a six month lead-in period. It is offensive to my reasoning that such a distinction should be made on a blanket basis.  As I said, I know why this has been done: it is specifically tailored to the Meagher case, but it is indefensible.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs is the proper place for any of this supervisory work: it is obviously the wrong place.  I have been a member of that committee in recent times and it is working well, but it has no special expertise in the areas with which it will have to deal under this Bill.  It will carry out the duty this Bill and the 1972 Act confers upon it in a cursory way and without any sense of particularity in what it does.  I do not accept Deputy Hogan's point that heretofore the committee has executed its functions admirably or at all well.  On a few occasions it has examined particular areas, but in general terms it has let most things drift past it.  Instead of the rubric now being proposed for us, it would be much better if we had some pre-consultative role whereby the parties in this House would get even one month to express a view before a regulation is made.  The parts of the Bill to which I have referred are a somewhat lazyminded response to a real problem in this House, that is, its inadequate capacity to deal with the legislative load which has been cast upon it, not only by the Constitution but also by the European Community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>This is something of an omnibus Bill; it deals with a number of issues which are broadly related to European affairs.  It is unusual to have all these issues incorporated in one Bill and presented to us in a way and at a time <Col N="1715" /> when very little detailed debate can take place on them.</P>
      <P>It can be argued that the European Economic Area proposal was already dealt with by the Dáil and therefore what we are doing here is simply approving the changes made in the European Economic Area Agreement as a result of the decision by Switzerland not to proceed with its membership of that body. However, this is not purely and simply a technical matter.  I have read some of the opinions of the committees of the European Parliament on this matter and they have expressed concerns not just about the technical aspect but also about the political and legal aspects of the withdrawal by Switzerland.  One opinion states:</P>
      <P>In the areas of police and customs co-operation, Border checks and the fight against transfrontier crime, Switzerland's withdrawal from the EEA also give rise to problems of a technical and (partly) political nature.</P>
      <P>It goes on to state:</P>
      <P>In its latest opinion, the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs recalls that it originally accepted the flaws in the EEA Agreement with regard to legal and political co-operation between the EEC states solely because most of the EFTA countries, including Switzerland, were expected to be accepted as full members of the EC within the not too distant future, which would automatically resolve the shortcomings mentioned.  This does not now apply to Switzerland, which increases the need to implement measures at Community level to take into account the existing differences between the national legislation of the EC countries and Switzerland with regard to the fight against transfrontier crime, particularly economic crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the opinion of the Committee of Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs of the European Parliament and also, I believe, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the European Parliament, which acts as a <Col N="1716" /> clearing house for the various opinions of other committees of the parliament in order to speed up the process.  I am not an expert in the areas to which they refer, but it highlights the fact that we are not given a serious opportunity to deal with queries which could arise.  It may well be that these reservations will not have any serious effect on Ireland, but we are ratifying an agreement as part of the Community and therefore we must take seriously the reservations which are expressed by members of the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>When debating the European Economic area agreement in October of last year I indicated my broad support for it. I referred to the nature of the parliamentary provision in the agreement; it did not provide for representation of the 12 national parliaments and I suggested it might be possible to address the issue in the context of any changes to the agreement which might be negotiated in the future.  I did not expect the agreement to be negotiated so quickly following my remarks.  That issue was not addressed in the renegotiations.  This is important because the EFTA members we are talking about are applicants to the EC and some of them have serious reservations about continuing their applications.  I am talking about reservations among the general public; clearly the administrations of those countries are going ahead full steam.</P>
    <P>A newsletter which I received from the Swedish Embassy dated 30 June stated that an opinion poll which had been carried out in May in Stockholm on the proposal to join the European Community found that only 28.2 per cent of voters would have voted in favour of a referendum if it had been held at that time.  That is a clear indication of unease at the way the European Community is operating.  I know that among Swedish women there is a significantly strong feeling of unease about the operation of the social provisions.  In brief, the European Community has still not come to terms with the fact that most of the unease arises from the lack of transparency and the democratic procedures involving citizens <Col N="1717" /> for the Community in its decision making.  If we continue to ignore that reality we will be stoking up serious problems for the future.</P>
    <P>We are ratifying the procedures to incorporate the EIF, which was agreed at the Edinburgh Summit in the treaties of the Europen Community.  It seems that we are again trying to deal with a massive economic problem of the Twelve member states by applying a band aid. The fund &mdash; and the additional funds provided at the recent Copenhagen Summit &mdash; are grossly inadequate.  There is a palpable sense of panic in the Community at the situation in which we find ourselves.  The Commission believes that approximately 50 million citizens of the European Community are living below the poverty line &mdash; this is based on the number of people living on 50 per cent of the average EC income.  An estimated 17 million people are unemployed and the number is climbing.  The expected growth rate in the Community will be -0.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>At the G7 Summit in Japan they are frantically trying to come to an agreement to reflate the world economy.  Yet the approach in the Maastricht Treaty is based on the now discredited free market thinking of Reagan and Thatcher which has clearly driven the European Community and the world economy into recession.  It is interesting to read in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Friday, 2 July 1993 that the German Finance Minister, Mr. Waigel, believes that Germany will be unable to join a European Monetary Union in 1997 or 1999 but argues nevertheless that, of course, we must stick to the criteria set down in the Maastricht Treaty.  We are like lemmings heading for the cliff.  There seems to be an unwillingness to address the fundamental flaws in the Maastricht Treaty to which I drew attention during the referendum.  There were echoes of that in the Minister's statement tonight when he spoke about giving a clear signal by ratifying quickly the instruments for the EIF to deliver a clear signal that we fully support the EC and want to ensure <Col N="1718" /> it is successful.  Those who voted in favour of the Maastricht Treaty &mdash; I did not &mdash; did so on the basis that what we had to deliver a clear signal we were good Europeans who must not be critical of the terms set down in it.  We are now reaping the whirlwind and will continue to do so until we press for change in the terms of the Maastricht Treaty.  It will destroy the Community economically. Common sense should prevail and indeed it could prevail given that the Leader of the Labour Party is Minister for Foreign Affairs and, in theory at any rate, his party is committed to an interventionist approach to the economy.</P>
    <P>However, it should not be interventionist in the old sense because Irish Governments have intervened traditionally by throwing money at the problem and expecting private enterprise to pick up the pieces and provide jobs. Clearly that has not worked and is not likely to work in future.  There must be a planned approach to intervention and we must ensure that investment is directed to areas where jobs can be created and the economy reflated.</P>
    <P>The Select Committee on Foreign Affairs has responsibility now for the areas dealt with by the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation.  As has already been pointed out, this committee worked passively.  My recollection of it &mdash; I was a member briefly at one stage &mdash; is that it dealt with matters that had long since been decided at European level.  We debated matters which had already been agreed and we had no influence over the content of what we were being asked to approve.</P>
    <P>Certainly, I am not aware of regulations to implement EC directives or of decisions being reversed.  As far as I am aware, regulations were reversed by the Government, an Opposition party did not manage to have one reversed.  I understand that only twice in the past 15 years did the Opposition manage to get a debate on a regulation which the Government tabled on what is termed a <Col N="1719" /> negative order.  The Select Committee on Foreign Affairs will have neither the time nor the numbers to deal adequately with the material from the European Community or in such a way that it can be tapped into at an early stage.  Proposals are initiated either by the Council or the Commission and in the normal course it takes about two years before decisions become regulations or laws.  The Select Committee on Foreign Affairs is about to establish a sub-committee on European Affairs.  With the best will in the world I do not see how that sub-committee, comprising ten members, will be able to deal with the amount of work sent to it unless, of course, the Government decides to allocate the resources and back-up required to deal with the work in terms of consultancy and staff.  At present, as previous Members indicated, the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs is working quite well but, generally speaking, matters are discussed in a general and global way and we are not getting down to detail.  We are getting things off our chests but I hope we will get down to the serious work of preparing position policies.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us could have been productively referred to a committee such as the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs in advance of coming to this House.  I argued in my submission on Dáil reform that we need a secondary legislation committee which would look generally at the regulations which at present this House approves on the nod and rarely looks at.  It is worth looking at this in a general way to see whether we can improve the manner in which this House deals with the mountain of legislation which we have to deal with.  The leisurely days of legislation, which I believe applied in the early days of this Dáil, no longer exist.  Even sitting the hours we do here and establishing the committees we have established, it seems to me that the whole nature of this Dáil will have to change if we are to be legislators <Col N="1720" /> in the true sense, knowing and understanding what we are passing and being able to make informed contributions to the legislation coming before us.</P>
    <P>In relation to the proposal to retrospectively approve of about 500 regulations which are now in question as a result of the Meagher case, I always understood whenever I proposed amendments in this House over the years that retrospective legislation was not the thing to do, that one could not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Obviously, there is a need to regularise the position; but again we are being asked to do it in a way which seems odd.  We have the Government in court at the moment appealing the Meagher High Court case decision and at the same time bringing forward a Bill here which seeks retrospectively to regularise the position as regards regulations from the EC on the basis of that High Court decision.  The Government can say that they do not want this to jeopardise or influence the Supreme Court's decision on this matter, but I wonder if that is the case.  I am struck by an article in today's <i>Irish Times</i> by a Mr. Ken Murphy, who, it says, is a partner in the EC and competition law department of A &amp; L Goodbody, solicitors.  He suggests that when this Bill is passed, and I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Imaginative lawyers might pose more intriguing questions, however, such as whether all fines ever paid for criminal offences created under the ministerial regulations in question should now be repaid by the State? Should fishermen who had nets seized say ten years ago now have those nets returned or compensation paid? Should the Beef Tribunal be discontinued as some of the legislation <Col N="1721" /> of which alleged breaches are being investigated may never have been in force?</P>
    <P>These questions are intriguing and I am sure will make small fortunes for lawyers of various hues and colours.  It is an example again of legislation being brought through this House in a way where adequate attention is not given to the detail.  Increasingly guillotines are used on important Bills, which prevent the calm and quiet consideration which Bills need.  The Government will argue that they have given us three hours for this and five hours for that and so on; but oftentimes consideration of legislation takes time.  You need to sit down and look at it, talk about it and come back to it again in a week's time in order to really tease these things out.  The committee system, if it works properly, will do that very effectively.</P>
    <P>I want to make a point related to the economics of the EC and Ireland's role in it.  That is the whole debacle of the £8.6 or £8.7 billion which the Tánaiste's flexible friend and colleague, the Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, has claimed &mdash; not once but a number of times &mdash; is in the bag.  I understand the £8 billion which the Taoiseach claimed to have got last December, allowing for devaluation, should now be around £8.6 or £8.7 billion, give or take a few hundred thousand pounds, a minor matter.  We are told now that the Commission has offered us £7.5 billion and we may come out with £7.8 billion.  I have no doubt that if we do come out with £7.8 billion or even £8 billion, it will be claimed as a victory, that we got the £8 billion we were promised and so on.  Of course, we will not have got the £8 billion promised in December.  We will still be short.</P>

      <P>I am saving the Tánaiste the embarrassment of having to bring in his Minister for Social Welfare <Col N="1722" /> and his Minister of State to deal with the Statistics Bill and the compendium Bill on Social Welfare, so if he likes to sit down we can bring them in.</P>
      <P>I want to make a point about the various figures that have been bruited about.  In the Maastricht referendum Jacques Delors came to Ireland and said we were going to get £6.5 billion over the next five years.  As I understand it, the Masstricht offer, taken over the five year period, was about £1.8 billion per year. The Edinburgh offer reduced that to £1.3 billion for the same period.  The Brussels offer, which we have got recently, reduces that still further to £1.08 billion. Assuming we get £7.8 billion &mdash; and I am working this out on the original five year period that was talked about in Maastricht &mdash; that will probably give us roughly £5.6 billion in all for 1993-97. No matter whether the Taoiseach or the Minister comes back next Monday with £7.8 billion or even £8 billion in his pocket, we are still going to be seriously below the figure originally promised in the Maastricht Treaty and which was used as the carrot to encourage 70 per cent of the population to vote for Maastricht &mdash; we were told that if we did not vote for Maastricht we would not get this money.</P>
      <P>I think we are going to be bamboozled with figures over the next few weeks. One will need to be a fairly competent mathematician to keep tabs on the Taoiseach when it comes to claiming what he has got and what he has not got.  I would like to draw the House's attention to the fact that even if we come out at the end with £8 billion, we are still seriously below the figure we were promised not only by the Taoiseach but by Jacques Delors in the Maastricht campaign.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make some brief remarks in response. First, I thank the Deputies opposite for their contributions.  I hope the technical points in relation to the various sections <Col N="1723" />&mdash; for example the six months <i>vis-à-vis</i> the two years in bringing prosecutions &mdash; can be dealt with on Committee Stage where it would be more appropriate to deal with technicalities.</P>
      <P>In the generality of the Bill we must accept that EC membership has changed political and economic life here in this country in a fundamental and far-reaching way.  The European Communities Act is fundamental to the way in which our membership of the Communities is given expression and today we are dealing with certain aspects of this diversity.</P>
      <P>Various Deputies have raised points in relation to the fact that this is a global Bill, a jumbo Bill, dealing with three separate but equally important aspects involving the Community.  In that respect had time permitted it could have gone to Committee and we could have had a long and detailed discussion on Committee Stage.  Despite the fact that we were not able to do that on this occasion I hope we can put other legislation affecting my Department into Committee for longer consideration.  In the time available to us and given the superb skills of the Deputies opposite in relation to processing legislation we will give this Bill a good reading and we can go through it in detail.  The European Investment Fund will enable the EIB to become a more active performer in the European Economic Arena, leading to investment and growth.</P>
      <P>The early ratification by Ireland of the amendment to the EIB Protocol, to enable the European Investment Fund to come into operation, will be a clear signal of our support for efforts to stimulate economic activity and jobs in the Community. I do not think anybody would object to our wanting to do that, given the pressure not only on this country but on the rest of the Community.  After a long time, unemployment has become the number one item on the Community agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The entry into force of the EEA <Col N="1724" /> Agreement will lead to the enhancement of relations with our closest neighbours in Europe, several of whom will soon be members of the Community.  It will reinforce the strong links which exist in the political and social spheres and will increase the already high level of trade and mutual investment.</P>
    <P>It is very important that this Bill be passed before the summer recess.  We had indicated that we would do so and it is important that we honour our obligations in that respect.</P>
    <P>It has been accepted by all Members of the Committee as well as the House that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs has got off to an impressive start, with meetings taking place on enlargement of the Community, meetings on former Yugoslavia and meetings in relation to Somalia.  It is right for Deputies to point out that the committee will not be able to do everything.  Over a period it will define for itself the amount of work it can take on.  I want that committee to be effective.  It is a two-way process between myself as Minister and my officials, and, indeed, Members who wish to make a contribution to the evolution of foreign policy for this country.  I would like to see that as being the role of the committee.  It is open to the committee to bring in expertise.  I take the points made by Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Michael McDowell in regard to resources but obviously that is a matter for the House.  If I can assist in that respect I will.  It is important to have open and considered debate on all issues in relation to the foreign policy area, the creation of foreign policy, the evolution of foreign policy and legislation from the European Community, regulations and the effect they will have on the public generally.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan made a valid point concerning the importance of adequate debate before the legislation comes into effect so that the public are made aware well in advance of the impact it will have on them.  Deputy Hogan raised the issue <Col N="1725" /> of the implementation of EC legislation. We rank very high on the list of our Community partners who have implemented EC Directives in that we have implemented about 80 per cent of the Directives.  During the past six months this matter has been raised regularly by the Taoiseach in Cabinet.  He wants EC Directives implemented and there is a regular check on Departments to ensure we are implementing them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan criticised the Government's record on openness.  I believe the establishment of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs in relation to the work we are doing this evening is an obvious example of openness in relation to the discussions we can have in terms of foreign policy matters and legislative scrutiny of foreign policy matters in the Community.  There is a very strong commitment by the Government to honouring that pledge of openness in relation to the Committee.</P>
    <P>The question of Structural Funds has been raised by all Deputies who spoke. Deputies will be aware of the negotiations which took place on Friday of last week and continued into Saturday morning.  Those negotiations are continuing. It is important that this House send a strong signal that we want our £8 billion and that the funds are very important in terms of the development of this country for the next six to seven years and in the context of the creation of the national plan.  We will continue those negotiations on the basis of getting our entitlement of £8 billion.</P>
    <P>The question of institutional implications of the current and future enlargement of the Community was mentioned by Deputy Hogan.  In relation to the current accession the Lisbon European Council agreed that no new institutional measures are required to cater for the four new countries but I expect they will be required if we extend the Community to Eastern Europe.  This will obviously be done in the context of 1996 in the review of Maastricht.  There would be <Col N="1726" /> little point in having an institutional debate at this stage until we have the ratification and implementation of Maastricht and the enlargement completed. That should be done in the first instance otherwise we leave ourselves open to more confusion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael McDowell and Deputy De Rossa raised the question of the Foreign Affairs Committee and its ability to deal with the amount of work now before it.  I would like to think I can assist the committee in looking at its own work procedures.  My officials, the committee and myself can discuss the question of reviewing draft regulations when they are put forward.  I would have no difficulty with the committee examining these draft regulations.  Ultimately many of these matters will depend on the time available to the committee or a sub-committee of the committee.</P>
    <P>The whole question of whether we afford ample time to the examination of legislation going through this House, whether through the committee system or through a full sitting of this Chamber, is a matter for the House.  Invariably, towards the close of this session there is much legislation we want to get through before we recess.  We have commitments to the European Economic Area and we are setting out to honour those.</P>
    <P>The committee system generally, which obviously has a bearing on other areas of legislation, will result in a significant improvement in the manner in which legislation is processed through this House.  Time has to be provided. Obviously the sittings of the House have been extended and the committees will sit through the remainder of this month. As I understand it, the committees have a good deal of work for September which can be done and processed before the Dáil resumes.  That will improve the quality of legislation and the way in which legislation is dealt with.  Notwithstanding that, Deputy De Rossa made the point that legislation would not be challenged if we had more time to deal with it. <Col N="1727" /> Invariably, there will be occasions for challenge, given the skills of the Law Library and solicitors firms in this town, notwithstanding the amount of time which has gone into it.</P>
    <P>A strong point has been made concerning the obligation of Members of this House to act as legislators.  It is important that we are well informed on the content, quality and the impact of legislation that goes through this House.  In the past, people did not regard it with the same seriousness as is now being shown in the committees.  Deputy McDowell made the point that adequate briefing should be available &mdash; we shall try to assist in that regard &mdash; that there should be a facility for the committee to call in consultants. In the context of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs there is a facility to call in experts from any Government Deparment on the various areas of legislation. As Deputy McDowell mentioned, there is no obvious expertise in relation to angel dust on the committee.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>In the short time available to me I wish to raise an issue relating to a citizen of this country, Mr. Matthews, and his treatment in the United Kingdom recently.  I understand he was arrested in relation to the recent bombing in London on the basis of what proved to be flimsy so-called identification evidence and detained for a <Col N="1730" /> period of ten weeks.  The identification evidence proved not to be evidence at all, and when his case came before the relevant court for further processing it transpired that the Crown proposed to offer no evidence.  Accordingly, he was ordered to be discharged at a preliminary stage.  That is welcome and nobody can quibble with the fact that he was discharged. However, one must query why it took ten weeks for a decision to be made by somebody in authority that there was no evidence against Mr. Matthews.</P>
      <P>During that ten week period a number of Deputies here, including myself, and public representatives on both sides of the Irish Sea, including the leader of the SDLP, John Hume, who is acquainted with Mr. Matthew's family, queried the basis on which he was detained and called for some form of public accountability in relation to the absence of evidence warranting such detention.  We now have the extraordinary situation where, as soon as he was released, he was rearrested under the Prevention of Terrorism Act and detained in Paddington Green police station in London in order that an exclusion order should be made against him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The United Kingdom's rules on exclusion orders are most extraordinary. There is no other major country within the European Community or within the Council of Europe which arrogates to itself the right to describe itself as a united jurisdiction and at the same time, on an administrative basis and without any adequate judicial review, excludes citizens from travelling freely within its confines, particularly citizens of one portion of the United Kingdom who can be excluded from travelling through the remainder of that country.  Those provisions are repugnant to reason.  They amount to a form of internal internment, an internal exile of sorts.  If it were not for the fact that the rest of the island existed, it would mean that people in Northern Ireland could effectively be <Col N="1731" /> confined to that corner of that country by a process which is neither accountable nor justiciable and is in no way reviewable by any transparent process.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on the Minister for Justice and on the Minister for Foreign Affairs repeatedly to raise with the British authorities in the Anglo-Irish process the use of exclusion orders in circumstances where people are released on the basis that there is inadequate evidence against them.  The presumption of innocence is entirely subverted by a process which puts somebody on hazard as to their liberty and then, when that process proves to be fruitless from the point of view of the prosecutor it is transformed into a process of internal exile without any justiciable or reviewable content.  I ask the authorities here to raise this device again and again with the UK authorities through the Anglo-Irish process and to question the way in which it is deployed to save embarrassment on the part of those who have deprived people of their liberty on the pretext of claiming to have evidence which would warrant their charging and detention in the first place but which pretext proves to be insubstantial on close examination.  It is invidious and wrong that ordinary people, whatever country they come from, but particularly when they are people over whom we claim some form of protective function, should be excluded from earning their living, excluded from travelling within a country which claims their loyalty and their fealty under English jurisdiction.  It is wrong and it should be challenged by our Government.  I ask the Minister to explain what he proposes to do to underline our displeasure at these steps taken by the British authorities.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will understand if I begin by welcoming the fact that the charges <Col N="1732" /> against Mr. Matthews have been withdrawn and that he has been released from custody.  As Deputies are aware, the Government has followed closely developments in this case from the outset.  They have taken steps to ensure that the British authorities were aware of the widespread concerns expressed, both here and in Britain, about various aspects which gave cause for disquiet.  In this regard the Taoiseach raised the matter during his recent meeting with the British Prime Minister and I raised the case with the British Foreign Secretary.  I also had the opportunity to meet Mr. Matthews's parents to discuss their concerns and to assure them of the Government's interest in their son's case and our wish to provide them with all appropriate assistance.  The family have been in touch with my office over the past two days and I remain in continuing contact with them.</P>
    <P>I share the Deputies' concern about the latest development in this case.  As I understand it, following Mr. Matthews's release he was immediately rearrested under the Prevention of Terrorism Act and transferred to Paddington Green police station where he was served with an exclusion order this morning.  I understand that he has now been removed from Britain to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have been informed that where a person is served with an exclusion order under the Prevention of Terrorism Act he has the right to make representations to the Home Secretary in writing against the order seeking his exclusion.  It is of course a matter for Mr. Matthews if he wishes to make representations against the decision taken in his case.</P>
    <P>The British Government is fully aware of the Government's views with regard to the use of exclusion orders and its concern that such measures, in the absence of sufficient evidence to proceed with court proceedings, effectively deny individuals the right to prove their innocence. We have previously suggested to the British authorities that exclusion orders might either be dropped from <Col N="1733" /> legislation of this kind, or failing that, that provision might be made whereby a person to be excluded could appeal an order in the courts before its execution. We will continue to pursue this aspect with the British authorities.</P>
    <P>In this case I can assure the House that steps have been taken by the Government to ensure that the British authorities are fully aware of the concerns expressed about this recent development, including those raised by Members of this House.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from the question of the exclusion order, Mr. Matthews's case and other previous cases have given rise to particular concern with regard to the manner in which a number of Irish citizens have been detained and subsequently charged with terrorist-related offences under the Prevention of Terrorism Act in Britain in recent months. Deputies can be assured that the Government will continue to impress on the British authorities the need to ensure that the legislation is applied in an even-handed manner, with a view to avoiding further cases of this nature.  For its part the Embassy in London will continue to monitor the operation of the legislation in Britain, to follow closely developments in individual cases and to offer consular assistance whenever it is required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> A Cheann Comhairle, I thank you for giving me this opportunity to raise such an important matter.  On previous occasions I have raised the ill treatment of self-employed people who apply for <Col N="1734" /> unemployment assistance.  I raised on the Adjournment the unfair treatment four people who were unemployed received from the Department.  The Minister asked me to supply the names and said he would have a special look at the situation. There is an extra person now, a young man assessed as having £200 per week even though he has no work.</P>
      <P>Their cases were appealed and I find it infuriating that an appeals officer, who must be living in cloud cuckoo land and guaranteed his own job for life, has decided that although the people are unemployed, they are earning the same money as they had when they were working. For example, one has been assessed at £155 per week, one at £135 per week, one at £200 per week, one at £85 per week and one at £154 per week.  All these people were unemployed.  The letters from the Department of Social Welfare stated that the appeals officer disallowed the appeal on the grounds that, having regard to the person's previous earnings, the assessment represented a reasonable expectation of his likely earnings over the following 12 months.  Could anything be more absurd than a well-paid appeals officer talking about the expectation of earnings of a person who cannot get work?  How do wives and children survive on mythical income?  The final line states that the appeals officer's decision is final. This is incredible in 1993.  I have spoken with the Minister, for whom I have a very high regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have explained the unfair way in which the system works.  The Minister agreed that the system is as I stated.  It is time this unjust system was scrapped and that people who are unemployed should not be further insulted and humiliated. Recently I met a young man who was employed as a carpenter on a building site in 1991, earning £200 a week.  Despite the fact that that man had been out of work since Christmas because of a record of his previous earnings his original application for social welfare benefit and subsequent appeal was turned down.  He has <Col N="1735" /> now been told that he will have an income of £200 per week.  This illustrates how unfair the system is.  Is this system unconstitutional? It is amazing that people who are out of work can be told that they have the same income as they had when they were working.  If this illogicality is accepted it would justify half a million people being unemployed.  Why would people work if they could earn the same income while not working?</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to tackle this problem of gross injustice.  Failure to address it does not reflect well on the Minister.  Even though the Minister is aware that the present system is producing grossly unfair conclusions in respect of those involved, having regard to decisions made by his officials, the Minister has not taken any action to deal with this problem.  Could anyone survive on the salary he or she earned two years ago or would he or she be relying on next month's salary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Self-employed people, such as painters, carpenters and bricklayers, who through no fault of their own cannot find work, are treated badly; and insult should not be added to financial injury in respect of those people by officials who are clearly out of touch with reality.  It is time to deal fairly with a most iniquitous system to show that fair play exists for those who cannot get employment.  It is time for this injustice to stop.  The unemployed, their spouses and children deserve better.  We must ensure they are treated fairly.  I hope the Minister will rectify this injustice.</P>

      <P>The Deputy referred to a number of cases.  I have details of the cases to which he referred.  The Deputy <Col N="1736" /> referred to an assessment of £135 per week.  I will outline how the assessment process works.  In that case the drawings, the net income after expenditure, in the year 31 March 1991 was £11,650.  That income was declared by the painter and decorator in that case.  The net declared income for the following year was £7,582 and the figure for the following nine months up to January 1993 was £8,926. Those figures are the declared net drawings in respect of a case to which the Deputy referred.  The figures differ from what the Deputy understands the position to be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There does not appear to be any disagreement about the source of the income.  One contract was lost and that contract may now be restored shortly and there appears to be agreement on that.</P>
      <P>I mention the points to indicate that the investigators are not flippant people who make harsh decisions; they make decisions under statutory legislation. They make their assessment on last year's income and the expected income for the current year.</P>
      <P>There is a statutory basis for the assessment of means of an applicant for unemployment assistance.  The key element of this statutory provision is that in assessing means of an applicant account must be taken of &ldquo;all income which he/she (or his/her spouse) may reasonably expect to receive during the succeeding year.&rdquo;  In addition the Act goes on to specify that &ldquo;the income of the person shall, in the absence of other means of ascertaining it, be taken to be the actual income received during the year immediately preceding the date of calculation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly the assessment has to be based on a starting point.  In general this <Col N="1737" /> approach is to the advantage of people, but where the opportunities for selfemployment and income are likely to be less over the year ahead an adjustment will be made to reflect this.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress that the starting point is as I have outlined.  It is, however, only a starting point.  It is a duty of deciding officers, having ascertained the previous year's income, to then consider the prospects of earning a similar income in the coming year.  Officers must be satisfied that similar opportunities for selfemployment exist in the coming year and that the claimant would reasonably expect to receive the same income from his/her work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should take note of how the officers do their work. Where there is evidence that the income earning potential has been reduced in any way then the deciding officer can adjust the assessment to take account of this information.  For the vast majority of cases this method of assessment works well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many cases where this assessment is working well. Where subsequent to the original decision on the means assessment a client finds that his or her circumstances have changed significantly, then it is open to him or her to apply for a review of the means assessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy has recently drawn to my attention a number of cases where he <Col N="1738" /> feels that this approach has failed.  As he knows, these cases were all reviewed in the light of his representations and the original decisions were confirmed.  In some of the cases referred to there was a good history of earnings from selfemployment over a number of years and so it was possible to form a realistic forecast of potential earnings.  There was no evidence to show that circumstances had so dramatically changed as to eliminate entirely the previous earning potential.  I feel that it is important to also point out that the assessment arrived at takes account of the outgoings as well as the income and that the assessment is based on the net position.</P>
    <P>I have indicated to Deputy Browne that I accept that it is vital that the method of assessment of means in the case of a self-employed person should have the flexibility to be able to respond to significant variations in the circumstances of such claimants.  Deciding officers, in determining entitlements, try to ensure that any assessment is based on a realistic view of what is likely to happen in the coming year, as required by the legislation.  This is what the current method of assessment seeks to achieve.</P>
    <P>I have directed my Department to keep the method of assessment of means under review to ensure that it responds to the actual circumstances of claimants.  In this context I have directed that the communication of such decisions to claimants be reviewed so that they fully understand how their entitlement was assessed.</P>

      <P>Last night's television programme about the Dublin and Monaghan bombings raises the most serious <Col N="1739" /> concerns about the investigation into the bombings, about the planning and planting of the bombs and about what now appears to have been a cover up by Northern and British authorities with a possible compliance of the then Irish Government.</P>
      <P>According to the programme, the Garda had within weeks of the bombings established a list of 20 suspects, eight of whom had been identified by eye witnesses and some of whom, according to the Garda, could have been taken to court on the evidence that was then available. However, the Garda investigation was apparently frustrated by the RUC, the suspects were never interviewed either by the Garda or by the RUC and there appears to have been a cover up of the whole affair.</P>
      <P>There are now a number of serious issues which must be addressed.  First, why was the Garda investigation frustrated by the RUC?  Why were the suspects never interviewed and why were the Garda never permitted to pursue their investigation?  Was there a massive coverup by the Northern and UK authorities? Second, did the Garda, as was inferred in the programme, report on this to their political masters, the then Dublin Government, and if they did what action, if any, was taken by the Dublin Government to obtain clearance from the British authorities for the continuation of the investigation?  One of the most extraordinary aspects of the whole issue is that no action was apparently taken by the Irish Government following the frustration of the Garda investigation and following the Garda report on this matter to their governmental superiors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Was British Intelligence involved in the planning and execution of the bombings? The evidence presented on the programme suggests that Loyalist paramilitaries did not then have the expertise to plan and to plant bombs of such sophistication and that as the respected former Garda Commissioner, Eamon <Col N="1740" /> Doherty, stated, &ldquo;they must have been helped.&rdquo;  Did that help come, as is implied by the former military intelligence officers who were interviewed on the programme, from military intelligence and possibly from the SAS?</P>
    <P>What are we to make of the statement made by the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Merlyn Rees, who effectively stated that there was a SAS operation based in Lisburn which was out of control and which, as the programme implies, may have been involved in the Dublin bombings.</P>
    <P>These matters must be addressed and clarified urgently.  The issue should now be taken up at the highest level with the British authorities, it should be raised with the British Prime Minister and, indeed, at the next meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference.  A method must be found to pursue the investigation which is independent and seen to be independent. In view of the possible involvement of British Intelligence in the bombings it may be necessary to have an investigation carried out by some independent international force, possibly under the supervision of the United Nations or of the European Community.  This whole issue cannot now be allowed to become a one day wonder and must be followed up urgently.  To do less than that is to deny justice to those who lost their lives not only in these bombings but in the many other bombings and atrocities that have occurred over the past 25 years on this island on both sides of the Border.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister for Justice to spearhead an immediate investigation into this issue, to establish an inquiry and to report back to this House on the issue. Earlier this evening I attended a public meeting on this matter which was attended by relatives of persons killed and injured in the bombings and they are insisting that there should be a full judicial inquiry into this affair and I support that call.</P>

      <P>With regard to the individual <Col N="1741" /> referred to in the programme as &ldquo;The Jackal&rdquo;, and whose identity is widely known, will this matter be addressed urgently in view of the assertion made in the programme that he continues to be involved in numerous horrific murders in the North including the murders of three members of two families, the O'Dowds and the Reidys, while allegedly under the protection of the security forces in the North?  This is the same protection that all of the 1974 bombers allegedly had and which this man appears to continue to enjoy.</P>
      <P>I attended a meeting of relatives of the victims this evening and they specifically want to know did the Garda report the lack of co-operation of the RUC to the then Minister for Justice, Mr. Cooney, and if so why was no action apparently taken?  Will the Minister have the matter raised at the Anglo-Irish Inter-Governmental Conference tomorrow to seek to establish why not one of the suspects identified in the Garda evidence to the RUC was arrested, charged or even questioned by the RUC?  Will the Minister raise also the statement of Merlyn Rees in the programme that there was a SAS unit out of control in the area at the time and also the allegation that the British security services were implicated in the bombings?  Can the Minister indicate what type of inquiry she will consider to determine the truth concerning all these questions?  Will she consider referring this matter to a select committee of the Dáil or a sub-committee of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security? The relatives, understandably, want a full public inquiry.</P>

      <P>The Dublin and Monaghan bombings in May 1974 claimed 33 lives.  We owe it to those victims and to their relatives and friends to ensure that every possible effort is made to bring those responsible for the bombings to justice. The division in Northern Ireland which erupted the violence of the past 20 years <Col N="1742" /> has produced enormous tragedy.  The appalling events in Dublin and Monaghan on 17 May 1974 stand out not only among the most tragic events of those years but in the history of this State. Thirty three innocent people were slaughtered and a great many more lives of the injured, their friends and relatives were scarred.  Some of those still living have been permanently scarred, others since deceased, carried their loss to the grave.</P>
      <P>It is incumbent upon us to ensure not only that the ongoing effort to find the culprits is characterised by vigour but also that it is characterised by integrity.  As I informed the House in answer to a question on the subject earlier this afternoon, the bombings in Dublin and Monaghan in 1974 were the subject of an intensive Garda investigation over a protracted period of time during which all relevant leads were pursued.  Unfortunately, despite those intensive inquiries, no charges have so far been brought in connection with the bombings.</P>
      <P>The Garda, whose files on these events remain open, are at present considering the contents of last night's programme with a view to assessing as a matter of urgency whether there are any matters which require further investigation.  They will follow any and every lead to bring these culprits to justice.  In this connection, I welcome the assurance at the conclusion of last night's programme that the programme makers will co-operate with any properly constituted inquiry. The proper and most appropriate form of inquiry in this instance is the police investigation which is already under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any investigation into crimes of this nature must have as its purpose the collection of sufficient evidence which will be admissible in a court of law to enable the perpetrators to be brought to justice. Only a properly conducted Garda investigation will achieve that end.  It would be grossly misleading and, therefore, lacking in integrity to pretend otherwise. Suspicions, however strongly held, do <Col N="1743" /> not secure criminal convictions.  The idea that other forms of inquiry at this point would be more likely to produce a result in terms of securing criminal convictions simply lacks substance.  I am not suggesting that those who call for such inquiries actually intend to mislead but, unfortunately, that would be the practical result and we should not pretend otherwise.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that the Garda have my full support in their ongoing investigations into these horrendous crimes against the people of Dublin and <Col N="1744" /> Monaghan.  I reiterate that the Garda files remain open and any and every lead will be followed to bring the culprits to justice.  The Garda Commissioner is heading up the present investigation following last night's programme and will be reporting to me urgently this week.</P>

    <P>(ii)  An meascán ábhair ab oiriúnaí do na haicmí éagsúla sa phobal féachana, na trátha craolta agus an sceidealú ab fhearr i bhfianaise na dian-iomaíochta atá san earnáil chraolacháin in Éirinn cheana féin.</P>

      <P>As part of its general responsibilities in this area, the National Heritage Council commissioned <Col N="1464" /> and has received a report on the legislative provisions, especially the taxation provisions, designed to assist in the maintenance of and succession to heritage property.  The report also raises related issues such as the loss or sale of heritage items out of the country.  I am looking forward to receiving the council's views on this subject in due course.</P>
      <P>Under existing Irish legislation, provision already exists for the licensing of archaeological objects under the National Monuments Acts, 1930, 1954 and 1987, and the Documents and Pictures (Regulation of Export) Act, 1945, and the full resources of the Garda Síochána are at the disposal of the authorities in the event of breaches of these provisions.</P>
      <P>However, I do not accept that there is a significant problem relating to the loss or sale out of the country of heritage items.</P>
      <P>In the context of the advent of the Internal Market of the European Community, I am naturally concerned to ensure that effective measures will be put in place to ensure that the national treasures of each member state &mdash; which together make up the Community's heritage &mdash; will be protected.  My Department has participated fully in the articulation of two important Community instruments aimed at achieving this objective &mdash; a Council Regulation on the export of cultural goods from the customs territory of the EC, and a Council Directive concerning the return of cultural goods unlawfully removed from the territory of a member state.  I am in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General regarding the transposition of these important Community instruments into Irish law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that arts projects received some Structural Funds assistance under the current Operational Programme for Tourism, which covers the years 1989-93. However, I believe that the classification of such projects under a Tourism Operational Programme has imposed inappropriate limitations on their potential to secure funding.  I fully acknowledge that there are areas of overlap between the arts and tourism sectors, and that both areas can be regarded as complementary in many respects.  However, I would contend that there are significant differences at the level of aims and objectives which have automatically rendered arts projects ineligible for consideration.  The eligibility criteria for funding under the current Tourism Operational Programme have, in practice, resulted in a focus on heritage projects largely to the exclusion of the contemporary arts.  This fact has also led to an imbalance in the level of funding for arts projects.</P>
      <P>The Government will very soon be considering the structures for the expenditure of the next round of Structural Funds which will pertain under the next National Development Plan covering the years 1994-99.  No decisions have yet been taken on future structures, but I am hopeful that these structures can, over time, address the imbalance to which I have referred.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be aware that the Discovery Panel, which was established in May 1991, has as its primary aim to work by means of archaeological and related research towards a coherent and comprehensive picture of human life on this island from earliest times.  Its second aim is to formulate the results in ways which can be communicated both to experts and to the general public.  The panel has decided to focus on a core period of the late Bronze Age and Iron Age, or what is called the Celtic period.  It would be prudent to await the results of this research before deciding on how information on this important period should be presented.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the allocation of lottery funds between the various Departments is primarily a matter for the Government through the annual Estimates process.

      <P>The whole area of cultural links is of increasing importance and I am keen to encourage those links which have already been forged.  These include the organisation of an annual Pan-Celtic Festival in Ireland for which my Department provided grant-aid of £10,000 in 1993; the assistance given by An Chomhairle Ealaíon in exchange projects between Ireland, Scotland and Wales; and assistance given by An Chomhairle to an International Festival of Film in Celtic Countries held in Gaoth Dobhair this year.  Moreover, the National Museum of Ireland played a major part in the successful Celtic Exhibition &ldquo;I Celti&rdquo; in Venice last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may also wish to be aware that Ireland is assisting the Directorate of Culture of the Council of Europe in their efforts to establish a series of Cultural Routes, including Celtic Routes, in Europe.  There are two Irish representatives on a small Council of Europe drafting Committee to identify Celtic <Col N="1472" /> Routes.  This drafting Committee has already received the Irish input for the drawing up of information brochures and maps to outline the Celtic Routes, and the Committee will meet in Dublin on 16-17 August next to complete their deliberations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 44 together.  The information requested by the Deputy is shown in the following table.  The data for 1971 and 1981 is taken from the Censuses of Population for those years.  Corresponding data from the 1991 census is still in the course of preparation.  The only information for 1991 available at present is from the Labour Force Survey at the level of the North West and Donegal region.</P>

    <P>As to the number of craft likely to use the Waterway in the first years of its operation, it is estimated that 50-60 boats might use it at any given time during the tourist season.  A positive indication of the anticipated success of the Waterway is the recent decision of the cruise hire company Emerald Star Line to develop a new base in Belturbet which will service 40 cruisers.</P>

      <P>Ireland took an active role in the negotiations which led to the Treaty on European Union.  Irish <Col N="1479" /> concerns and proposals are reflected in a number of provisions in the Treaty.</P>
      <P>Ireland's concerns on economic and social cohesion were taken up in a number of amendments to the EEC Treaty provisions on this subject.  Irish proposals which were accepted include, for example, the provision that the achievement of economic and social cohesion should be among the tasks of the Community (Article 2) and the provision that the cohesion dimension be taken into account in the formulation as well as the implementation of Community policy (Article 130b).</P>
      <P>Ireland also took initiatives in the field of education, culture and public health. In the field of education, Ireland proposed an Article (Article 126), the main features of which were accepted by our partners.  These included developing the European dimension in education, particularly language teaching and dissemination, student and teacher mobility and co-operation between education establishments.</P>
      <P>In the area of public health the Government decided to table a draft Article (Article 129) for incorporation in the new Treaty so as to provide for a specific competence for the Community in this important sector and the Irish proposal is reflected in the text as agreed at Maastricht.</P>
      <P>Finally, Ireland strongly favoured inserting a specific Article (Article 128) on culture into the Treaty.  Together with the Commission Ireland contributed to the drafting of this new Article which emphasises that the Community will respect the national and regional diversity of the cultures of the member states whilst stressing the common cultural heritage of all the peoples of Europe.</P>

      <P>The conclusions of the Europe Council at Edinburgh do not set out specific figures on the share of structural and cohesion funding for each member state.  The Conclusions of meetings of the European Council do not carry such detailed and technical information. The Conclusions of the Edinburgh Council do state, however, and I quote, that &ldquo;expenditure on Structural Actions should be concentrated on the least prosperous member states, outermost regions and rural areas of the Community in accordance with Article 130A of the Maastricht Treaty&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Conclusions further state that, for the four Cohesion Fund member states the figures set out will permit a doubling of commitments under Objective 1 and the Cohesion Fund between 1992 and 1999.  It specifies that &ldquo;for the four Cohesion Fund member states this means about 85becu over the period 1993-1999&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Conclusions specify that in the allocation of the Funds, &ldquo;full account should be taken, as now, of national prosperity, regional prosperity, population of the regions, and the relative severity of structural problems, including the level <Col N="1488" /> of unemployed and, for the appropriate objectives, the needs of rural development&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that it follows from the conclusions of the Edinburgh Council that the Irish allocation from the Structural and Cohesion Funds would be of the order of £8 billion.</P>
    <P>The references given above are in Part C, Section B iii, of the Conclusions of the Edinburgh Council.</P>

      <P>The statement by Commissioner Flynn referred to by the Deputy is the Commission Communication &ldquo;Community-Wide Framework for Employment&rdquo;. This communication listed many areas under which the Commission intended to present analyses and suggestions for co-ordinated action at Community level in order to boost employment growth.  One of these was to investigate &ldquo;the scope for reducing labour costs and increasing employment-intensity, notably by modifying the incidence of taxation systems&rdquo;. The Government awaits with interest the Commission's proposed analyses and suggestions for future co-ordinated action to improve employment growth.</P>
      <P>In the meantime the Government is committed to minimising the tax burden and the tax wedge for workers.  Substantial progress has been made on both these fronts since 1987 and the Programme for Government contains clear commitments to maintain and, if possible, improve upon these achievements. The improvement of the tax position of the low paid and the standard rate taxpayer &mdash; categories which predominate in labour intensive industries &mdash; are a particular priority for the Government.</P>

      <P>To qualify for a retirement pension at age 65 or an old age contributory pension at age 66 a person must satisfy a number of conditions.  One of these conditions requires him to have at least 156 social insurance qualifying contributions paid since first entering insurable employment.  As the insurance record of the person concerned shows only 101 paid contributions, he does not qualify for contributory pension.</P>
      <P>The person concerned may become entitled to a means-tested old age noncontributory pension on reaching age 66 in March 1994.  The pension is currently payable to people over age 66 whose means do not exceed £60 per week, or £62 per week from the end of July 1993. My Department will arrange to issue an application form for this pension to the person concerned three months prior to his 66th birthday so as to allow adequate time for his claim to be investigated and decided.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 64 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions in section 14 of the Social Welfare Act, 1993, students in full-time education are no longer entitled to claim Unemployment Assistance during their summer holidays.  I recently made regulations exempting certain mature students and people participating in the Third Level Allowance scheme for the long term unemployed from this disqualification.</P>
      <P>I have introduced a summer jobs scheme for students who cannot get a summer job and who would formerly have been eligible for Unemployment Assistance.  The scheme provides them with the opportunity to do community work, voluntary work or work provided by public sector bodies and to earn up to £400 over the ten week period from 1 July to the end of September this year.</P>
      <P>In counties Sligo and Leitrim sponsors have come forward offering a variety of jobs to students who have registered for the scheme.  To date the number of sponsors, jobs offered and students approved for the scheme in Counties Sligo and Leitrim is as follows (a breakdown by individual local office within the counties is not available):</P>

      <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) in Dublin 17 who claimed equality arrears only obtained £66 for the second phase; the information available in relation to a group of Cork claimants where it is understood that substantial sums were paid; if further payments are due to the claimant for the years 1986 to 1991; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The legislative provisions govearning the payment of equal treatment arrears to married women are contained in the European Communities (Social Welfare) Regulations, 1992 (S.I. No. 152 of 1992).  Payment of arrears due under this retrospective legislation is being made on a phased basis in 1992, 1993 and 1994.  Phase 1, which covers the period December 1984 to May 1986, provides for the payment of a higher personal rate for certain social welfare benefits and the extended duration of unemployment benefit.  Phase 2, which covers the period December 1984 to November 1986, provides for the payment of Household Supplement for dependants and the payment of Unemployment Assistance.  Phase 2 arrears are payable in two equal instalments in 1993 and 1994 &mdash; with amounts of less than £100 payable in full in 1993.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of disability benefit and unemployment benefit during the relevant period.  She was paid arrears of £342 in August 1992 under Phase 1.  Her entitlement to household supplement under Phase 2 was recently examined.  She had one child dependant during that period.  During the relevant period her husband was employed on a part-time basis and he was claiming unemployment benefit for the days he was unemployed.  She is not entitled to household supplement for the period during which her husband was receiving unemployment benefit.  In such cases the household supplement is deemed to have been fully paid to both spouses on the grounds that the husband received the full household supplement for the child dependant on his claim at the time.  However, she is entitled to household supplement for her child dependant for the periods during which her husband was working.  She was, accordingly, paid arrears of £66 under Phase 2 on 11 June 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1496" /> Her claim has since been reviewed following further clarification of her husband's work pattern.  This has resulted in the Household Supplement entitlement being re-calculated at £211.93.  A further cheque amounting to £40 will issue to her this week.  The second instalment of £106 for Phase 2 arrears will issue to her in 1994 in accordance with the legislative provisions.</P>
    <P>Arising from the delay in implementing the relevant EC Directive one equal treatment in social welfare matters, court proceedings were initiated before the retrospective legislation came into force. In some cases these proceedings were initiated as far back as 1985.  Settlements were made in such cases (including one involving a number of claimants in the Cork area) but equality of treatment has now been provided for in respect of the period of delay.  Arrears are being paid in accordance with the phased arrangements provided for in the retrospective legislation.</P>
    <P>The arrears outlined for the person concerned represent her full entitlement under the legislative provisions.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for unemployment benefit on 18 March 1993.  She works on a part-time basis.</P>
      <P>Under the legislation which extended PRSI cover to some 27,000 part-time workers, mainly women, people whose normal working pattern has been part-time must establish that they have incurred a substantial loss of employment. This is usually established by reference to the 13 weeks preceding the period of a claim.  The person concerned has been working for an average of under two days per week since at least August 1992.</P>
      <P>In weeks in which she only receives one day's work or does not work at all, she is entitled to unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has not applied for unemployment assistance which can potentially be more favourable in these situations.  It is understood that her husband is employed and his income would have a bearing on any entitlement to unemployment assistance.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that following the recent adverse fluctuations in the sterling/punt exchange rates, major losses were caused in the income of Irish residents with British social welfare pensions augmented with Irish social welfare pensions, that the new exchange rate applicable from April 1993 is £1 sterling equal to 0.937841 punts and that this in no way compensates these categories of pensioners for the loss sustained in the period October to April; if he will take steps to ensure that adequate compensation is provided in these exceptional circumstances which are quite obviously not covered by the practice of his Department in using the standard exchange rate mechanism employed within the EC; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>People who are in receipt of a British pension may also be entitled to a non-contributory pension from my Department.  However, the UK pension must be taken into account as means for the purpose of determining their entitlement to the Irish pension.</P>
      <P>The means assessment for non-contributory pensioners disregards the first £6 in weekly means and thereafter the means are in effect assessed in £2 bands. Accordingly people who have a British pension assessed as means and who receive a reduced rate non-contributory pension receive in aggregate more than a person who has no means.  The banding arrangements also ensures that small adjustments in weekly means do not typically require an immediate and corresponding change in the rate of non-contributory pension payable.  The general £6 disregard is a concession which ensures that there is no inequitable treatment in these cases when they are compared with the majority of pensioners.</P>
      <P>When calculating means for non-contributory pension purposes, British pensioners' Sterling income must be converted to Irish Punts.  Even within the EC Exchange Rate Mechanism, there are frequent and sometimes wide fluctuations in EC exchange rates.  It would not be practicable to frequently recalculate pensioners' means based upon the rate of exchange prevailing at any point in time.</P>
      <P>In order to reflect a reasonable pattern of exchange rates, an average exchange rate system is used for converting EC pensions to Irish Punts.  For this purpose, my Department uses figures which are provided by the Administrative Commission of European Communities on Social Security and Migrant Workers. These average exchange rates for each EC currency are published quarterly by the Commission in the Official Journal of the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The average exchange rate system used gives an important degree of security to people who qualify for a non-contributory pension from my Department <Col N="1499" /> by protecting them to a large extent from short term movements in exchange rates.</P>
    <P>A review of old age pensioners receiving British Pensions was initiated in 1991. This review established that 87 per cent of these pensioners had received increases in their other incomes.  In many of these cases the rates of Old Age Pension payable had therefore to be reduced. Because of the age of many of the pensioners no action was taken to recover the amounts overpaid which in many cases would have represented a considerable amount for the people concerned.</P>
    <P>Increases of 4.1 per cent and 3.6 per cent in British Pensions took effect in April 1992 and April 1993 respectively. These increases have not been assessed yet in the bulk of these cases.  If these increases had been immediately assessed, many pensioners would have had their entitlements reduced in April 1992 and again in April 1993.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Department does not immediately readjust entitlements with effect from the date of increases in British Pensions is an important and sympathetic concession.  Changes in the system to keep means assessments fully up-to-date would worsen the overall circumstances of the people concerned.  In the vast majority of cases the non-retrospective adjustment of pensions being applied results in more favourable treatment for pensioners than a retrospective approach.</P>
    <P>For all of the above reasons, my Department does not intend to compensate pensioners retrospectively to cover recent adverse fluctuations in exchange rates.  However, it is open to Old Age Pensioners to apply for a means review at any time where they have reason to believe that their assessments should be reduced.</P>

      <P>The household budgeting scheme is operated on behalf of the Department of Social Welfare by an Post.  Customers who are receiving their unemployment payments by postdraft at a Post Office can authorise An Post to pay a regular amount towards various household bills.  The amount involved is deducted by An Post from their weekly unemployment payments.</P>
      <P>Household budgeting is a free service which has been designed as an aid to managing household finances for those who wish to avail of it.  A person may choose to pay regular contributions to any of the following utilities &mdash; ESB, Bord Gáis, local authority (rents and mortgages) and Telecom Éireann. Having deductions made in this regular way will help customers to cope with ongoing expenses and will also assist in clearing arrears.  I am confident that this scheme will also help to reduce recourse to moneylenders.  Total weekly deductions are limited to a maximum of 25 per cent of a person's net weekly unemployment payment.</P>
      <P>The scheme is currently in operation in Dublin and will be extended to other counties on a phased basis.  Extension of the scheme is dependent on securing agreement with the various local authorities, and also on the transfer of unemployment payments to the postdraft method of payment operated by An Post. Progress to date has been very good and I expect a number of additional counties to come onto the new scheme in the near future.  I am not yet in a position to indicate when it will be possible to extend the household budgeting scheme to County Meath but I can confirm that it is the intention to have the scheme available as soon as possible in every county.</P>

      <P>The weapons used in paintball games are considered to be firearms within the meaning of the Firearms Act 1925 to 1990.  Consequently the licensing of paint marking rifles is a matter for the local Garda Superintendent.  Provided certain conditions are fulfilled by the <Col N="1502" /> applicant the Superintendent issues an Authorisation under section 2 of the Firearms Act, 1925 as amended by section 15 of the Firearms Act, 1964.  These conditions include the following:&mdash;</P>

      <P>In relation to the case referred to by the Deputy the conditions were not fulfilled, as a club was not involved and consequently an authorisation could not be granted.

    <P>In this connection I welcome the assurance at the conclusion of last nights programme that the programme makers will co-operate with any properly constituted inquiry.  The proper and most appropriate form of inquiry in this instance is the police investigation which is already in being.</P>
    <P>I cannot say any more at this stage except to say that any investigation into crimes of this nature must have as its purpose the collection of sufficient evidence, which will be admissible in a court of law, to enable the perpetrators to be brought to justice.  It is only a properly conducted Garda investigation that will achieve that end and it would be misleading to pretend otherwise.  Suspicions, however strongly held they may be, do not secure criminal convictions.  I can assure the House that the gardaí have my full support on their ongoing investigation into these horrendous crimes against the people of Dublin and Monaghan.</P>

      <P>Since the passing of the 1984 Act, there has been a number of detailed examinations undertaken of the possibility of extending the scope of the Act to so-called &ldquo;informal&rdquo; insolvencies i.e. where the employer just ceases trading.  However, successive Ministers have not found it possible to devise an amendment which would be suitable in the circumstances &mdash; bearing in mind that the 1984 Act was not designed primarily to define insolvency situations.</P>

      <P>Sligo Corporation were informed last April that in the absence of detailed information on alternative alignments, it would be inappropriate for me to certify their present proposals for the Sligo Inner Relief Route as being environmentally acceptable.  The corporation were therefore requested, in co-operation with Sligo County Council, to arrange to have a new traffic study of the borough and its environs carried out.  Within the context of the development plans of both authorities, and the current and expected land uses, the study would quantify the pattern and volume of traffic demands over the next 25 years, and identify the need, if any, for widening and-or new road facilities.  I have recently approved the terms of reference for the study.  Pending its completion, it would be premature to speculate about the timing of new road works.</P>

      <P>Sligo Harbour Commissioners have submitted a development plan comprising six projects to the Department of the Marine for consideration in the context of the preparation of the national plan for the utilisation of the next round of Structural Funds.

      <P>I recognise, however, that port facilities at towns such as Sligo are vital links in the economic infrastructure of their areas and as such should be developed to ensure that they remain as central links in the chain of regional economic development.  With this in mind I will be seeking an increased emphasis on port development in the next national plan.</P>

      <P>The relevant EC Regulations provide for suckler cow quotas to be based on the number of cows on which a producer was paid premium under the 1992 suckler cow premium scheme.  The person named is not entitled to a suckler cow quota because he did not apply for premium under the 1992 scheme.</P>
      <P>EC regulations provide for the establishment of a national reserve equal to between 1 per cent and 3 per cent of the sum of the individual quotas allocated to producers and a special reserve equal to 1 per cent of the total of the individual quotas allocated to producers in the disadvantaged areas.  As the applications for the suckler cow premium scheme were accepted to the end of 1992 and as the retention period for the scheme is six months, it will not be possible for some time yet to indicate the total number of suckler cows which received the premium in 1992 and, therefore, to indicate the size of the reserves.  When these reserves are established I will be making a decision on the priority categories for the allocation of these reserves.  The person named may then submit a formal application for reserve quota to my Department at Michael Davitt House, Castlebar.  He will, of course, be required to provide documentary evidence to support his claim for reserve quota.</P>

      <P>There are no proposals to index link payments under either the headage or livestock premia schemes.  However, the position as regards the livestock premia schemes is as follows.  The special beef premium will be increased to 75 ECU in 1994 and to 90 ECU in 1995 from its present level of 60 ECU.  The suckler cow premium will be increased from its present level of 90 ECU to 115 ECU in 1994 and to 140 ECU in 1995.  The annual ewe premium is calculated on the basis of the average Community fall in income when the EC average market price is compared with the EC basic price for sheepmeat for the year in question.</P>
      <P>With regard to the compensatory headage payments made under the Structural Funds, the position is that the Government will decide shortly on the allocations for each Government Department, including the amount to be allocated to headage in the next round of the Structural Funds which will cover the period 1994-99.</P>

      <P>My Department's areas of responsibility in relation to trade are as follows.  First, to develop and implement an effective trade promotion policy.  This is realised by my Department working in conjunction with An Bord Tráchtála by: (a) developing indigenous industry in its capacity to sell more abroad; (b) targeting export increases of an average of 12 per cent per annum over the next five years; (c) more diversification into mainland European markets; and (d) supporting the international services sector in its efforts to increase its foreign earnings receipts.  Second, to ensure that the best mechanisms for the enhancement of Ireland's foreign earnings capacity are put in place abroad.  I am currently awaiting a consultant's report on how these mechanisms can best be structured.  Third, to contribute to the implementation of the EC Single Market by representing Ireland's interests on the Internal Market Council and ensuring full partnership as between member states and the Commission in this process. Fourth, to develop bilateral trade relations and economic links with other countries in the rapid pursuit of new business opportunities with downstream employment benefits.  Fifth, to participate in EC and GATT decision-making processes with a view to the maintenance of an open, liberal, world trading system which will offer new market possibilities <Col N="1521" /> and growth potential for Irish goods and services.  Sixth, to operate an effective system of export credit insurance which will support Irish export efforts, wherever possible.  Finally, to implement national and international measures governing the importation and export of certain goods.</P>

The question of production, on set aside land or otherwise, is primarily an agricultural matter.  Recognising the potential importance of this energy source, I have in consultation with my colleague Deputy Liam Hyland, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry who has responsibility for rural development, established a Biomass Committee chaired by my Department and involving other interested Departments and agencies, to examine the potential for production and use of biomass crops in this country.  The areas of particular interest in the context of Common Agricultural Policy reform are short rotation forestry for power generation and crops such as oil seed rape for biofuels.</P>

The board employs the equivalent of approximately 40 whole time speech therapists in its community care services and a substantial proportion of their time is devoted to young children, including those attending primary school.

      <P>It is estimated that the present mental handicap population is approximately 25,000. Of these, about 15,400 have a moderate, severe or profound degree of mental handicap and most require extensive support from the health services.  The <Col N="1532" /> remainder have a mild mental handicap. A minority of this group require ongoing support from the health services.</P>
      <P>Agreement has recently been reached between my Department and statutory and voluntary agencies providing services to people with mental handicap on the development of a national mental handicap information system which will be put in place in the coming months.</P>
      <P>This system will provide information, on an ongoing basis, on the numbers of people with mental handicap in each region, the number in services and awaiting services, their current and future needs and the level of support which is required to meet those needs.</P>
      <P>The availability of such information will enable my Department and those responsible for the provision of services to plan in a co-ordinated manner the services which will be required to meet both current and future needs.</P>
      <P>For a variety of reasons, including the reluctance of some people to be labelled as disabled, there is no comprehensive source of information on the numbers of people with physical disabilities. However the following figures are based on the experience of organisations providing services to people with disabilities:</P>

      <P>The patient concerned is on the out-patient waiting list for assessment at University College Hospital, Galway, but it is not possible to give an appointment date at this stage.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the scheduling of appointments and admission is a matter for the consultant concerned and urgent cases are always accorded priority.  Should the patient feel concerned about this condition he should return to his general practitioner who is in the best position to emphasise the urgency of his case directly to the consultant.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the £20 million Major Action Programme which I recently launched in relation to hospital in-patient waiting lists which was specifically targeted at those areas of hospital treatment where long waiting times are causing the greatest hardship.  The Western Health Board has been allocated £2,192,600 from the Waiting List Fund. This will enable the board to carry out an additional 1,884 procedures this year of which 250 will be cataract operations. This should impact significantly on the average waiting times in these areas.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 140 and 141 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In March 1988 the Government approved a multi-annual capital programme which provided for the expenditure of £27.51 million on major sports <Col N="1539" /> facilities at national, regional and local level over a number of years funded from the proceeds of the national lottery.  The locations of the local and regional sports centres were identified.  A total of 52 projects are involved in the regional and local sports centre programme and a total of 39 projects have either been completed or are under construction.  The remainder of the projects are at tender or detailed planning stage and progress towards the commencement on these projects is proceeding satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>A small number of projects identified in the 1988 programme and nominated for grant assistance have not proceeded to construction stage and the grants were withdrawn.  Lack of progress on these projects has been due mainly to the inability of the local sponsoring groups to provide the necessary local contribution required under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Funds made available by the withdrawal of the grants from these projects have been reallocated to alternative projects within the existing programme where additional funds were required. The question of a standby list does not arise.  I am satisfied that, in general, the progress on the capital programme for the provision of major sports facilities at regional and local level has been satisfactory.</P>

      <P>The principal recommendations of the Committee on Public Safety and Crowd Control chaired by Mr. Justice Hamilton were the establishment of a National Authority for Safety at Sports <Col N="1540" /> Grounds and the preparation of a code of practice for safety at sports grounds.</P>
      <P>A working party was established under the auspices of my Department to prepare the code of practice.  A code of practice for safety at outdoor pop concerts and other outdoor musical events, was also prepared, following a detailed consultative process with sporting and other interested groups and organisations. Many of the other recommendations of the Hamilton Committee are covered in the codes of practice.  I am awaiting the final submissions of the committee.  The question of establishing a National Authority for Safety at Sports Grounds will be fully examined on completion of these codes of practice, in consultation with the other Departments and agencies concerned.</P>
      <P>I am informed by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, that the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, 1993, which is before the Dáil at present, contains provisions &mdash; along the lines of recommendations made by the Hamilton committee &mdash; giving the gardaí statutory powers to control access to certain events and to allow for the surrender and seizure of intoxicating liquor, etc.  The committee's proposals in relation to licensing arrangements for particular events are being dealt with separately.</P>
      <P>In so far as implementation of the recommendations by the Garda Síochána is concerned the Garda authorities report that they use prepared guidelines on operational planning for control of spectators at sporting and other events which gather large crowds.  These guidelines include arrangements for policing both outside and inside stadia and on the main routes used by spectators.  As part of their planning for major events of this kind the Garda authorities meet the organisers and the necessary arrangements are planned in advance.  In addition, seminars on the subject of public safety and crowd control are held as required by the Garda College, Templemore to ensure that Garda personnel in charge of operations and sections of the ground at major events receive appropriate training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are ongoing consultations <Col N="1541" /> between my Department and the Departments of Justice and the Environment in relation to this matter.</P>

      <P>Arrangements for staffing in national schools for the 1993/94 school year provide for the retention of 200 posts which would have otherwise been lost due to falling enrolments.  These posts have been allocated as remedial posts, concessionary posts in disadvantaged areas, home/school liaison teachers posts and posts for Special Education.

      <P>Any further adjustments would be major and would involve considerable extra cost to a service which is already very expensive relative to the norm nationwide.</P>

      <P>I have recently allocated an additional 15 home school community liaison posts at primary level which facilitates the inclusion of a further 27 schools in this scheme.  The post-primary scheme also is being extended by the inclusion of a further 13 schools.</P>
      <P>This brings the total number of schools currently in this scheme to 106 at primary level and 39 at post-primary.</P>
      <P>School selected for inclusion in the scheme have been taken in the main from those already designated as disadvantaged. There are no schools from the area mentioned by the Deputy in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  However, the selection process for including further schools is currently underway.</P>
      <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to developing a nationwide Home/School/ Community Liaison Service.  As part of this commitment, I will be keeping the question of further need in this area under review.</P>

      <P>The children from the Glenamoy area are eligible for transport to Rossport Post-primary Centre.  However, some <Col N="1550" /> parents from the locality wish to send their children to Lacken Cross and Belmullet Post-primary Centres.  They are not eligible for transport to either of these, which are in other catchment areas.</P>
      <P>Consequently, the most they can be offered by my Department is concessionary transport from the catchment boundary of their appropriate school.</P>
      <P>Catchment boundary transport may be allowed, provided seats are available on an existing service after all eligible pupils have been accommodated.  The other proviso is that no extra cost is incurred, either by way of using a larger or extra bus, or by re-routing an existing service.</P>
      <P>Children from the area have been availing of transport under these conditions. My Department has been informed that there will not be sufficient accommodation on the service in September next to cater for catchment boundary pupils.  This matter is being investigated, as a matter of urgency, and I will advise the Deputy of the outcome.</P>
