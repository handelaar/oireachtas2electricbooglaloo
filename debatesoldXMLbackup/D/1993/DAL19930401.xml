      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 and statements on Northern Ireland.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders that:</P>
      <P> (1)  Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 shall be decided without debate.</P>

      <P>I observe that Deputy Bruton.  Is the proposal for a late sitting today satisfactory and agreed to? Agreed.  Are the proposed arrangements for dealing with statements on Northern Ireland today satisfactory and agreed to? Agreed.  Is the proposal for tomorrow's sitting satisfactory and agreed to? Agreed.  Are the proposals for statements on European Community affairs tomorrow agreed to?</P>

      <P>In relation to that proposal, would it be possible to extend the scope of those statements to allow Members of the House to express views on the truly appalling events now occurring in Bosnia?  People in Bosnia, in their anxiety to flee from the activities of the Serb besiegers, are being crushed to death as they are loaded on to cattle lorries, events reminiscent of Nazi terror at its worst during World War II.  Could the House agree to the extension of the scope of tomorrow's statements to allow Members to speak on European affairs rather than on European Community affairs?  I know that Members on all sides of the House are deeply concerned at the appalling atrocities that are occurring.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To add the following to the motion:</P>
      <P>;and</P>
      <P>(6)  That the Joint Committee shall report to both Houses of the Oireachtas within six months on the adequacy of the resources available for the Library and research service for Members and on how these services might be improved.</P>
      <P>In moving this amendment may I assert that we need a proper research service in this House if we are to do our business properly?  The Library staff has been reduced since 1976, even though the number of Members in the House has been increased from 148 to 166.  Therefore, it will clearly be seen there are fewer people serving more Members.  There are now more full-time Members in the House than there were in 1976, placing more demands on the Library research service.  The budget for the research service of the Library has been frozen for the past three years despite large increases in publication costs, particularly in the case of newspapers, which they must buy.  This means that, in effect, the Library is unable to buy basic texts necessary to the work of this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has two primary objectives: the establishment of peace in Northern Ireland and making an impact on reducing the problem of unemployment.  Both objectives are inter-linked.</P>
      <P>The deaths of two children from bombs in Warrington and the killing of four Catholic workers in Castlerock last week, as well as other recent tragedies, have brought home to us, by no means for the first time, the reality of violence and its total unacceptability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been more than 3,000 deaths in Northern Ireland alone in a period of more than 20 years.  To these must be added deaths in Britain, here in the Republic and on the European Continent.  The lives of human beings of all ages and backgrounds have been destroyed in an instant, wrecking families and communities in the process.  Many of those who died were the victims of completely random killings.  Attacks have occurred at times and in places, where no danger could reasonably be expected.  No section of the community <Col N="13" /> has been spared.  Many of the deaths have taken place in particularly horrible circumstances; bodies blown to pieces, groups of people sprayed with bullets, executions in lonely lanes, in certain cases sadistic killings, children and young adults killed by plastic bullets, young people and people with young families, in a uniform or out of it, whose lives have been brought to an abrupt and untimely end.  It all amounts to a litany of horror, which has not brought a political resolution to the problems of Northern Ireland one whit closer.</P>
    <P>All of us would want to express again our deepest sympathies to the families of Jonathan Ball and Tim Parry in Warrington and to the families of the workers killed in the quiet village of Castlerock last week, as well as of other recent victims of violence.  Those who perpetrate these actions have no mandate from the people of Ireland, North or South, regardless of the cause they purport to serve.  The Irish community in Britain do not deserve to be exposed to the ill-feeling that inevitably arises from incidents like those that occurred in Warrington. There are no acceptable excuses. Tragic civilian deaths are the inevitable and foreseeable consequence of any bombing campaign, whatever the intentions or the warnings.  Responsibility cannot be evaded or shifted elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Once again, as happened after Enniskillen, the people of this country are saying loudly and forthrightly that they want the violence to stop, that they repudiate any campaign of violence carried out in their name.  The self-determination of the Irish people is unequivocal on this point and has been made clear repeatedly.  Humanity must come before politics.</P>
    <P>From time to time we encounter veiled suggestions that this State is a &ldquo;safe haven&rdquo; for paramilitaries to plan and launch terrorist attacks in other jurisdictions. I want to take this opportunity to refute these allegations in the strongest possible terms, on behalf of the Government and the overwhelming majority of the Irish people who have consistently <Col N="14" /> shown their support for constitutional parties at the ballot box.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government has always condemned paramilitary violence and employed all means at its disposal to combat the evils of terrorism.  The measure of the Irish Government's response to the Provisional IRA and other paramilitary organisations is evident in their on-going commitment to providing all necessary resources for the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces, the enactment and application of legal measures, and the maintenance of effective security co-operation with the Northern Ireland and British authorities.  The notion of a &ldquo;safe haven&rdquo; for terrorists in this State is a fallacy, which is clearly exposed by the reality of the following: Our <i>per capita</i> expenditure on security, which is three times that of the United Kingdom; the fact that several offenders are serving long sentences in Portlaoise prison for subversive offences; the huge and growing stockpile of arms and explosives in Garda custody as a result of seizures from bunkers, and the experience of many of those persons whom our courts have imprisoned here in connection with serious offences committed in other jurisdictions or who have been extradited for trial.</P>
    <P>Commentators who persist in alleging that this State is somehow soft on terrorism would do well to consider these realities, before making misleading claims.  Opposition leaders should not lend credibility to hostile propaganda in the press designed to make this country responsible for weaknesses in security elsewhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The mere fact that a person is suspected, even strongly suspected, of being involved in criminal activities does not, of course, constitute a basis for arrest and prosecution.  This is true, irrespective of whether those concerned reside here, in Northern Ireland, or in the United Kingdom.  In all cases, the authorities require evidence before they can act.  The gathering of evidence <Col N="15" /> here is not hampered by lack of resources, and the absence of sufficient evidence to convict suspects, wherever they reside, cannot be taken as implying that either jurisdiction is disposed to harbour terrorists or that either is a &ldquo;safe haven&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Legal co-operation with Northern Ireland and Britain in respect of fugitive offenders takes a number of forms.  The extradition arrangements we have been operating with Britain and the North provide one means by which a person can be returned to the jurisdiction in which the offence has been committed.  The provision made for extra-territorial trial is an alternative means by which a person can be brought to trial in one jurisdiction for offences committed in the other. These are complementary procedures. Both Governments are committed to their use in appropriate cases.  Both Governments are also committed to strengthening those procedures, where change is necessary and desirable.  The moves are not just on one side.  The British Government are incorporating specialty into their legislation in a Criminal Justice Bill &mdash; which provides additional statutory safeguards for accused persons &mdash; at present going through Parliament.  They have also finally ratified the European Convention on Extradition in 1991, which Ireland ratified over 25 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For our part, the Minister for Justice has already made clear her intention to bring proposals to Government as soon as posssible to tidy up our extradition laws by amending the Extradition Acts. The primary purpose of that legislation will be to provide for an amendment of the Extradition Act of 1987 in order to further clarify the circumstances in which offences are excluded from the political offence exception and to deal with issues raised by the judgments of the Supreme Court in the Magee, McKee and Sloan cases.  However, while it is necessary and desirable to close loopholes that have been established exist only since late 1991, we should not be under any illusion that on its own that Act will have any <Col N="16" /> great practical impact in bringing violence to an end.</P>
    <P>No one would deny the existence of a strong sense of grievance and injustice felt by the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland.  For a long time they were treated as aliens in their own country. To the sense of injustice about partition was added the injustice of a long period of systematic and blatant discrimination; but there are political remedies to these ills, even if some of them will take time.  Nothing justifies the creation of new injustices or the attempt to force the issue in a totally counter-productive way that drives the communities even further apart.</P>
    <P>If we look abroad we can see examples that are inspiring as well as examples that contain awful lessons.  Most of the countries of Eastern Europe suffered for 40 years the most appalling oppression with no freedom of opinion or personal liberty.  Eventually, there were largely peaceful revolutions in which popular power was exerted not unlike the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland in the late sixties, and an undemocratic system of government was removed.  If we look on the other hand to Cyprus, the Lebanon or the former Yugoslavia, we see countries torn apart as factions try to solve ethnic disputes by force.  Instead of the prize of a peaceful and prosperous united country, they have dismembered it and created even more intractable divisions which it may take generations to heal, if ever.</P>
    <P>All parties in this House and the vast majority of the Irish people everywhere are convinced that the genuine problems of Northern Ireland, both in the present and in the future, have to be resolved by a process of political dialogue and co-operation between parties dedicated to the democratic process.  I would again appeal to the paramilitaries on both sides to think again on the futile course they are pursuing.  Surely few, if any, of them in their hearts can relish taking a life. A Unionist life is just as sacred as a Nationalist life.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Unionist community also have legitimate grievances.  There is <Col N="17" /> no justification for the terrorist attacks of which many of their members have been victims.  The Irish Government proceeds from the self-evident basis that both traditions have a permanent place and permanent rights on this island that must be firmly guaranteed in any settlement. They both have an even greater contribution to make in the future.</P>
    <P>I would have to express my equal concern and revulsion at the recent upsurge in Loyalist violence, which last year and so far this year has claimed more lives in Northern Ireland than any other source. It is very disturbing, that some of this violence may have a part of its source in collusion between paramilitaries and a small number of individual members of the security forces or the intelligence services and this is a matter that we have repeatedly raised in the Anglo-Irish Conference. I would like to see the same forceful condemnation by all democratic political parties in the North of both the campaign by the Provisional IRA and the indiscriminate sectarian murders by the Loyalist paramilitaries.  There is a very clear attempt at present to intimidate and terrorise the entire Nationalist community and not least its elected politicians in the run-up to the local elections.  I regret very must certain attempts to provide political explanations of so-called Loyalist violence which can all too easily be seen as providing some justification for it.  This morning's shocking revelation of the extent of support among Loyalists for violence shows that all and not just some Unionist political leaders must be unequivocal in their condemnation.</P>
    <P>We in this State are proud of our independence and are grateful to the generations, both of constitutional politicians in the 19th century and of the Republican leaders from the United Irishmen to the 1916-21 period, who together and in different ways strove for freedom and the sum of whose efforts eventually achieved it for the greater part of Ireland.  But it was clear to most Irish leaders, even 75 years ago, that the use of force against fellow Irishmen was an inappropriate means of solving the deep-seated <Col N="18" /> divisions between Unionist and Nationalist in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Partition was adopted as a temporary expedient in 1920.  As some historians have observed, nothing lasts so long as pragmatic solutions intended to be temporary. It is important to remind ourselves of the balance between conflicting constitutional ideals and aspirations adopted at that time.  It was not just Irish Nationalists, but the British Government as well, who recognised that Ireland ought to be united in the longer term. The Government of Ireland Act, 1920, which partitioned the country, was based on the concept of the essential unity of Ireland.  It sought to foster the development of North-South co-operation through a Council of Ireland designed &mdash; I quote from the Act &mdash;&ldquo;with a view to the eventual establishment of a Parliament for the whole of Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It was the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921 that first established the Irish Free State and gave it nominal jurisdiction over the 32 Counties.  At the same time it gave the Northern Ireland Parliament the right of secession, though still subject for the time being to the provisions in the Government of Ireland Act, encouraging eventual Irish unity.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder then that in the Irish Constitution of 1937 these underlying principles of national unity were reiterated in the first three Articles?  These express the Irish nation's right to self-determination, acknowledged by the British in 1920-21, while limiting effective jurisdiction to the 26 Counties.  While successive British Governments since 1949 have guaranteed that Northern Ireland will remain part of the United Kingdom as long as a majority of their parliament or people wish, even this conditional formulation reflects, however obliquely, the fact that there was explicit recognition in 1920-21 that ultimately the people of Ireland, North and South, ought to come together.  Since the seventies it has been made more explicit once again that the people of Northern Ireland are free to join a united Ireland if a majority so desire.  The present Secretary of State for Northern Ireland <Col N="19" /> stated recently in a speech to the Foreign Press Association:</P>
    <P>If one looks at an island of that size with no natural territorial divide of a geographical kind, then if other things were equal, and there was no historical influence which is decisive, there is no reason why it should not, and the natural thing is that it would be one political entity.</P>
    <P>He added that there was of course a very strong historical overlay.</P>
    <P>The provisions in our Constitution are not unique.  There were close parallels in Article 23 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany, the preamble of which stated: &ldquo;The entire German people are called upon to achieve in free self-determination the unity and freedom of Germany&rdquo;.  The spirit of Article 23 of the German Constitution was almost identical in wording to Article 3 of our Constitution: &ldquo;For the time being the Basic Law shall apply in the territory of the states of Bavaria, Hamburg etc.  In other parts of Germany, it shall be put into force on their accession&rdquo;.  The same criticisms were made of the German Constitution as are made of ours, that it made a theoretical claim over those who did not participate in its drafting, that it presented a phantom which would not stand up in international law compared with the reality of the West German state.  Of course, the circumstances are not exactly the same, but nevertheless what has happened since has justified those parties who were not dismissive about that part of the German Constitution.  Now Article 23 has become redundant in the context of German unity and no longer exists.  The CSCE has always kept open the possibility of the peaceful change of frontiers.</P>
    <P>Let us remember that our Constitution took the gun out of politics on this side of the Border by providing a constitutional framework which all political parties could accept.  The Constitution was never recognised by Republican paramilitary groups until recently and never invoked by them to justify their campaign.  All <Col N="20" /> Irish people now want another framework that will take the bomb and bullet out of the politics of the entire island.</P>
    <P>In our agreed programme for Government, stressing the importance of dialogue, we speak of a &ldquo;willingness to discuss all constitutional issues and to initiate and incorporate change in the context of an overall settlement.  Our long term policy is to make possible the eventual achievement of a united Ireland by agreement and consent in the spirit of the New Ireland Forum Report&rdquo;.  The programme also speaks &ldquo;of seeking any necessary endorsement in a referendum for an agreed policy which achieves a balanced accommodation of the differing positions of the two main traditions on constitutional issues&rdquo;.  This was an idea that I endorsed last October in my Bodenstown speech.</P>
    <P>If we want peace, if we want a political solution, we cannot ignore or gloss over the fundamental position of either community. The present Irish constitutional position means a great deal to the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland.  They see it as affirmation that they belong to the Irish nation.  They also see it as giving the Irish Government a status to negotiate with the British Government on their behalf.  It reflects their deeply held convictions about partition. In effect, the first three articles are seen as the Irish constitutional guarantee to Northern Nationalists.</P>
    <P>None of us has any difficulty in recognising the facts of a situation.  It is another thing to ask people to endorse as morally right a situation which they feel deep down represents an historic injustice. Our commitment to a united Ireland is expressed in constitutional terms, with an explicit commitment in Article 29 to settle international disputes by peaceful means.  Any attempt in a political vacuum to walk away from constitutional republicanism would be a very dangerous exercise and would most certainly provide a new recruiting platform for terrorism. Constitutional change, therefore, must be placed in the context of a broad-ranging agreement that includes a balanced constitutional accommodation, <Col N="21" /> one that not only recognises and respects the importance of the present wishes of a majority but also the validity and legitimacy of an agreed Ireland as a long term goal.  I am happy to endorse the idea that goes back to the Forum report that in any future situation the rights of minorities should be entrenched.  A similar type of proposal has recently been put forward by the Tánaiste in the form of a covenant.</P>
    <P>It is not enough merely to insist on our constitutional position and to hope that somehow or other peace and Irish unity will ensue. Every leader of this country, from de Valera down to the present day, sought creatively to achieve political progress, not resting solely on the fundamental position but making efforts to advance and reach out.  Indeed, the very foundation of Fianna Fáil in 1926 and its decision to participate in the Dáil came as the result of a break with the orthodox and inflexible dogmas of the then Sinn Féin Party, which offered no hope of advance.  In 1937, de Valera included a little known provision in the Constitution, Article 15.2.2º, which allows for the recognition of subordinate legislatures. This was the basis for de Valera's offer to the Unionists to keep Stormont, with appropriate guarantees for the minority, if sovereignty were transferred.  He was also prepared to keep bridges open by his offer of external association first made in 1921 and repeated publicly or privately over the rest of his career.</P>
    <P>Seán Lemass broke with the reflex of non-recognition, in a form of <i>Nordpolitik</i> of his own, in his famous meetings with the Unionist Prime Minister, Captain Terence O'Neill.  As part of an Oireachtas Committee he was also prepared to contemplate constitutional change, if that would advance the situation.</P>
    <P>Jack Lynch was the first to face the challenge of the current Northern troubles.  He made it clear from the outset in 1969 that the Government sought reunification of the country by peaceful means and by agreement.  He said that of its nature this policy was a long term one, with the initial objective being to <Col N="22" /> promote peace and goodwill and to eradicate bigotry and discrimination.  He laid the foundations for the Sunningdale Agreement subsequently signed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Charles Haughey initiated the Anglo-Irish process in 1980, which asserts the central role and responsibility of the two Governments and which was subsequently developed into the Anglo-Irish Agreement by the Government of Dr. Garret FitzGerald and Deputy Dick Spring in the aftermath of the New Ireland Forum.</P>
      <P>The present partnership Government between Fianna Fáil and Labour has the same duty as our predecessors &mdash; not to retreat to the certainties of the past but to strive for a decisive political break-through that will help to bring about a new formula for peace.</P>
      <P>The Government is deeply committed to the achievement of a lasting political settlement which will accommodate the two traditions in Ireland on equal terms and which will bring about a new beginning for relationships within Northern Ireland within the island of Ireland and between the peoples of these islands.  It was to achieve such a settlement that my previous Government recommended a process of political talks between April and November last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those talks were unique in their scope and significance.  Never before had the fundamental issues which lie at the heart of the Northern Ireland problem been addressed in a systematic and collective way by the two Governments and the four main constitutional parties of Northern Ireland.  Never before had Irish Government Ministers engaged in a prolonged face-to-face dialogue with leaders of the Unionist tradition.  The fact that it proved possible to get all participants around a table together and to sustain this process over a period of several months was in itself a remarkable break-through and marked a watershed on the road to a political solution.  It signalled <Col N="23" /> the critical importance of a wide-ranging political dialogue between the two Governments and the parties in the search for a lasting agreement.  Those talks would not have taken place without commitment, goodwill and determination on the part of all concerned. Those qualities were also responsible for the significant degree of progress realised during the talks.  I hope that the same constructive qualities will enable us all to return to the negotiating table soon.  The need for an agreed political settlement has never been more apparent or more pressing.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, no easy route to such a settlement.  The problems which we confronted in last year's talks were deep-seated and long-standing.  Our endeavour was an ambitious one, and we all recognised this at the outset.  We were seeking to resolve profound tensions and divisions which have disrupted our relationships going back over several centuries. It was hardly surprising, therefore, that it did not prove possible to achieve in the time available the comprehensive accommodation of our differences at which we were all aiming.</P>
    <P>What we did achieve in that short period, however, was a considerably better understanding of each other's concerns than we had ever had before, and a much fuller sense of the sincerely held positions on both sides which must be reconciled in any lasting settlement.  The need for political arrangements which respect the validity of both traditions seemed generally accepted.  We identified and discussed most of the elements which would comprise an eventual settlement. We also established constructive dialogue on ways in which an accommodation might be reached on some of the key issues which divide us.</P>
    <P>In short, therefore, we laid an extremely valuable foundation for future talks which may take us further along the road towards a comprehensive settlement. As we have already indicated on many occasions, the two Governments are of the view that further dialogue is both necessary and desirable.  A promising <Col N="24" /> foundation exists upon which we can build.  I hope that all participants will recognise that we should do so soon without further delay.</P>
    <P>The positive and constructive approach of the Irish Government has been evident from the very outset.  We facilitated the talks process by making clear in advance, along with the British Government, that we would be prepared to consider a new and more broadly based agreement than the Anglo-Irish Agreement, if such an arrangement could be arrived at through direct discussion and negotiation between all of the parties. We also agreed a series of arrangements relating to meetings of the Anglo-Irish Conference to facilitate such discussions.</P>
    <P>Throughout the talks last year we indicated clearly our readiness to contemplate change in the interest of achieving a &ldquo;new beginning&rdquo; for the various relationships on this island. However, change could not be in one direction only.  We wished to see change on both sides in the interest of achieving a fair and honourable accommodation between the needs, rights and aspirations of both traditions.  If the negotiations were to achieve the basis of a &ldquo;new beginning&rdquo; in the relationship between Nationalism and Unionism and if an agreement were to entail any constitutional consequences in our jurisdiction, I felt both Governments would respond positively to that situation and that we &ldquo;could approach the electorate with the hope and prospect of a positive response&rdquo;.  That, after all, is the essential consideration.  It is the electorate's judgment in any referendum, and not the wishes of the Government or any individual, which will determine whether changes can be made.  It follows that we need to have an opportunity to assess all the proposals for change in their full practical and political context.  That is why it is important to get back to the negotiating table.</P>
    <P>The Government worked actively for agreement in last year's talks.  We have worked more assiduously to achieve an early resumption of talks this year.  We <Col N="25" /> have set no preconditions for our partners. We have made clear that we are ready to sit down at any time and in any place.  I hope that others will show equal flexibility and commitment.  The saving of a single life in the North or elsewhere demands that flexibility and commitment from all political leaders.  When talks resume, the Government will have its own proposals to present.  We will also be ready to discuss the proposals which other participants wish to present, or which they may already have presented. We are prepared to discuss everything, once we all return to the table, but that is where the discussion should take place. To select for discussion in advance of fresh negotiations only proposals or papers which individual delegations tabled at the end of the last round would not, I think, be conducive to a successful outcome.</P>
    <P>As regards the UUP proposal for an Inter-Irish Relations Committee, the Government is, of course, fully prepared to discuss this idea, when talks resume. However, I would like to correct any impression which may exist, that this proposal has not been studied by the Government.  When the UUP first advanced it earlier in last year's talks, it received our full consideration.  It was then reiterated in a UUP paper of 9 November last.  We are still open to be convinced that it would represent, as the Ulster Unionists claim, a major step forward. However, it would be wrong to base future discussions just on the framework of the Unionist set of proposals, as suggested by Deputy Bruton last week.</P>

      <P>All the ideas and proposals on the table, including both the SDLP's and the Unionists', as well as those from the two Governments, will merit equal weight and consideration in future negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concentration on constitutional difficulties can obscure the progress that is possible on political and institutional questions, and on economic co-operation. <Col N="26" /> Even if only a limited understanding is possible on all constitutional issues at this time, it is still well worthwhile to seek agreements in areas where more unites us than divides us.  There is clearly some potential for agreement on political institutions in Northern Ireland, which would allow the constitutional parties to share responsibility for government there.  In the words of the Report of the New Ireland Forum: &ldquo;A settlement which recognises the legitimate rights of Nationalists and Unionists must transcend the context of Northern Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Closer co-operation between North and South is imperative in the context of the Single European Market and the consequent creation of a single market economy on the island of Ireland, and also in the context of the wise use of resources in almost every economic and social area.  Co-operation is needed in the European Community in dealing with issues that affect the island of Ireland as a whole, or which require a cross-border approach.  Co-operation on security would be necessary, even in a far more peaceful context than exists today.  The two Governments also have an important role, acknowledged under the Anglo-Irish Agreement, in recognising and upholding the identities, rights and interests of both communities.</P>
    <P>The question arises as to whether separate North-South institutions should be established, in which the British Government would play no direct part, or whether it would be better to expand or adapt the role of the Conference to include the full participation of both Governments and the parties to a Northern Administration.</P>
    <P>One of the principal contributions of Fianna Fáil since it took office in 1987 has been to place far greater emphasis in the Conference on economic issues and on North South economic co-operation, with economic Ministers in regular attendance.  Last May, I published a comprehensive study <i>Ireland in Europe: A Shared Challenge,</i> which sets out many of the opportunities that exist to increase employment, through the greater integration of the two economies on this <Col N="27" /> island.  By enlarging the size of the home market, we can give indigenous industries a chance to develop to a size, where they are able to become exporters.  There is scope for joint marketing and promotion of Irish tourism, of Irish products abroad, for the development of complementary manufacturing activities, particularly linkages to multinational firms, and for a strong single voice in Europe for Irish agriculture and fisheries. The business organisations see substantial opportunities and employment potential.  Independent studies show that up to 75,000 new jobs could be created on a basis of all-Ireland co-operation. Our task is to create the political climate, so that these economic exchanges can flourish.  Some of these areas for action were foreseen as far back as the Government of Ireland Act 1920, but were not developed subsequently.</P>
    <P>By our own improved economic performance in recent years we have made ourselves a more interesting partner for Northern business and for many ordinary people.  In many respects our welfare system is now superior to that in the North, especially in relation to older people.  I have always subscribed to the view expressed by Eamon de Valera at the 1933 Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis on the way to reunite the country, when he said:</P>
    <P>There is no use in pretending that we can solve that by mere words.  We cannot; nor can we solve it by force. We have got to solve it, as I have said, in the only way it can be solved, and that is by having a livelihood for our people down here which will be the envy of the people of the North and make them see that their future lies with their own people and not with strangers. </P>
    <P>The INTERREG Programme and the International Fund can do much to improve the economy of Border areas and other deprived parts of Northern Ireland.  Major infrastructural projects are underway, such as the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal, now nearing completion, and the upgrading of the Dublin-Belfast <Col N="28" /> railway.  I do not think Unionists have any major difficulty about this type of co-operation, which is of as much benefit to them as it is to the rest of us. The economic border is gone &mdash; only the political border remains.</P>
    <P>In the absence of a new political agreement, we will pursue this co-operation vigorously within the Anglo-Irish Conference. We will also seek to promote judicial and other reforms and create a better sense of fairness in the eyes of the law.  Further intensive efforts are needed to achieve greater equality.  Down here, the Government is committed to a radical programme of affirmative action, with regard to equality, including the aim of having women representing 40 per cent of the composition of State boards.  We will also have targets for increasing the number of physically handicapped people in the public service.  If existing fair employment legislation does not show results, a similar type of approach may have much to recommend it in Northern Ireland, if we want to set an example in reducing the employment imbalance between Protestant and Catholic, especially in the public sector.</P>
    <P>In my recent visit to America, I was very encouraged by the positive interest and support shown by President Clinton and his Administration and influential members of Congress in supporting the political efforts towards peace of both Governments, and the reform of past injustice and abuses.  This assistance, moral and material, is deeply valued and appreciated by the Irish Government. Both Governments are deeply committed to the search for peace.  It is important that our positions and our policies be clearly understood by all and not be misrepresented, and we will continue to clarify them to the best of our ability. For my part, the appointment of Gordon Wilson to the Seanad was intended to endorse and to show to the world the strength of the simple, straightforward desire for peace and reconciliation among the Irish people, and the yearning that the killing might cease.  This has a force that can no longer be ignored.</P>
    <P>A new formula for peace would create <Col N="29" /> a whole new vista.  The opportunities that would open up for all of us in Ireland, once peace were established, are vast.  It would provide a far better climate for settling or accommodating the differences that remain.  It would bring into the political arena groups and communities that have hitherto felt excluded. A new era awaits us.  It is the duty and responsibility of all of us to make sure that it arrives soon.  Everyone must respond to the changing mood in the political landscape regarding the North of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In my contribution to this debate I want to make two basic points.  The first is that the security situation is now so serious and threatening to everyone on this island that it justifies all-party action and a meeting of all party leaders should take place.  The second point is that if both sides in Northern Ireland look in detail at what the other side is saying they will see there are more grounds for agreement than either side recognises at present.  Solving problems like this by imaginative and creative action is what politics is all about.</P>
      <P>It is the failure to do this in so many other instances that has brought discredit to democratic politics in Ireland and elsewhere. Throughout western Europe there is a profound distrust of political institutions.  This has taken a more acute form in this State largely because of the disparity between what politicians promised and what they delivered.  The last few months has brought this phenomenon to a very high pitch.  That is the dispiriting background against which political action on any political issue in this State now takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For more than 20 years the people of this island have seen an endless cycle of political initiatives towards peace.  A four-stage pattern repeats itself inexorably. First is a long period of political paralysis.  Then there is a shorter period in which there is a flurry of activity, when something seems to be happening.  Next, there is the moment of breakdown and collapse and finally, the inevitable period of recrimination followed by another <Col N="30" /> long period of political inactivity.  It has gone on like this in an endless cycle for over two decades.  This cycle is now so set that the business of apportioning blame is under way before the talks process has finally collapsed.</P>
    <P>Those who say that we have become desensitised to the campaign of terror are wrong.  The powerful public demonstrations of the last week are living proof that even after the years of murder and mayhem, the people of Ireland have refused to be numbed by the atrocities carried out by the terrorists.  It is not that we are paralysed or that we do not care, it is just that so many of the people who care feel that there is so little they can do.  On top of the general disillusionment with political institutions the people of these islands now have something approaching profound despair about the prospects for peace in Northern Ireland. It will thus be a bad day for Ireland if in a major debate of this sort, the Government fails to announce a series of concrete initiatives to advance the political process and to tighten up on security. The lesson of the last few days is that words are just not enough.  Each murder that goes undetected, each bomb detonated without somebody being prosecuted and each time protection money is paid, faith in the effectiveness of democratic politics is further reduced.  In the final analysis any system of Government must be effective if it is to last.</P>
    <P>While all this is happening democratic politicians in Northern Ireland pull further apart from each other, if one is to judge from what one hears on the air-waves. I detect a deep pessimism amongst those involved in public life in Northern Ireland, about the prospects for a successful conclusion to the Brooke/Mayhew talks.  Despite the hundreds of hours of contact, there remain deep differences of perception between the two sides.  It will only deepen the despair if we use this full day of Dáil debate to record yet again well crafted rhetoric but no concrete actions to build peace.</P>

      <P>It is time to return to fundamentals, The <i>Sunday Times</i> carried a report last Sunday naming the chief of staff of the IRA as living in this State at Smithborough, County Monaghan, naming the IRA finance chief as somebody operating from Dublin, naming the head of the IRA bombing campaign in England as also being based in Dublin and claiming that the IRA quartermaster general, whom they did not name but whose name I can supply to the Taoiseach &mdash; the person responsible for supplies of arms and explosives &mdash; lives at Black-rock, County Louth.  Added to this we see the IRA issuing a press release trying to justify the Warrington bomb from some real or imaginary location in Dublin.  This is not acceptable.  It never has been accepted by the two main political parties or by any of the other parties of this State.</P>
      <P>Speaking of much milder atrocities by the IRA at that time, the then Taoiseach, Deputy John A. Costello, said in a national broadcast in January 1957:</P>
      <P>So far as they are directed from within territories under our jurisdiction, it is the duty of the Government of this State to prevent their continuance.</P>
      <P>On 26 March 1957 in the Dáil, the Minister for Justice of the incoming Fianna Fáil administration, Deputy Oscar Traynor, spoke words that have been echoed by countless speakers since:</P>
      <P>There can be only one Army in the State and that shall be the Army established by this Parliament. </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yet it seems, if the <i>Sunday Times</i> report is to be believed, and I note that it has not to date been officially contradicted, that the provisional IRA are maintaining, within this State, the command and supply structure of an army, that is a rival to the Army of this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another newspaper report, this time in the <i>Cork Examiner</i>, has suggested that <Col N="32" /> this rival army is being financed, to a minor extent at least, by the widespread and well organised sale of the illegal angel dust to some irresponsible members of the Irish farming community.  It is also being financed by a massive infrastructure of other criminal rackets on both sides of the Border.  It meanwhile maintains here large secret dumps of arms and explosives, much of which were supplied by the Libyan Government.</P>
    <P>When such a situation as this existed here in 1957, the Fianna Fáil Party, then led by Mr. de Valera, sought and obtained a electoral mandate to deal with it.  Within four months of taking up office it brought into force the powers in Part II of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1940.  That course of action was subsequently endorsed by the Dáil by 103 votes to five, and the IRA virtually ceased to exist in the years that followed, only to be rekindled by the sectarian pogroms against Catholics in the late 1960s in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The situation that exists now is much worse even than that of 1957.  Not only are the IRA far more active than they were in 1957 on a wide scale on both of these islands, but now there is counter-terror. Loyalist terror gangs are capable of maintaining a tit for tat campaign of equal ferocity.  They are just as indiscriminate in their targets.  Politicians, North and South, even members of the GAA, are now publicly on the loyalist hit list.  No part of this island is safe, any more than any part of Britain, from one kind of terror or the other.</P>
    <P>The popular will to put the terrorists out of business that existed in 1957 exists again today.  It exists amongst both communities on this island because both face an equally serious threat.</P>
    <P>The precise policing methods that worked in the less sophisticated world of the 1950s will not necessarily work in the 1990s.  That is a matter that should best be judged by the Government of the day, using the advice that is available only to it.  The same public determination to act now exists.  It must be responded to and recognised in this debate.  It has not to date been recognised by the Taoiseach. <Col N="33" /> The public want action that is even-handed, comprehensive and effective, that makes both of these islands safe from the intimidation of terror.  I have suggested that the leaders of the main political parties in Dáil Éireann should meet to discuss the restoration of peace on these islands.  I am taking up a proposal made by the Tánaiste when he was in Opposition.  I repeat that proposal now in recognition of the fact that the safety of our people is the primary responsibility of Dáil Éireann, coming before all other responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The people have moved on.  They do not want sterile political debate about anachronisms in our Constitution.  They do not want excuses from the Government as to why we should not quickly reform our extradition laws.  The people do not want sophisticated arguments about why &ldquo;the time is not right&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is well over a year since the Taoiseach promised a review of extradition procedures.  Only this week he was sunk so low in empty prevarication that he tried to misrepresent criticism of Government delay in introducing extradition legislation as a criticism of the gardaí.  It is his Government that has delayed this legislation, not the gardaí.</P>
    <P>The Irish people now know that the terrorist organisations have developed an extremely sophisticated cell structure, which ensures that those who are directing operations are able to maintain sufficient distance from the actual crimes to avoid prosecution, let alone conviction.</P>
    <P>People are also realistic enough to know that a political settlement amongst democratic politicians will not, in itself, end the murders.  Even in the unlikely event that Sinn Féin and the UDA were cajoled into agreeing to the terms of a settlement, there is a strong likelihood that break-away groups on the republican and loyalist sides would continue the violence. This has been the pattern of behaviour of violent organisations throughout Irish history.</P>
    <P>A referendum on both sides of the Border in the event of a settlement, as suggested by the SDLP, might help deprive the IRA at least of the claimed <Col N="34" /> ideological basis for continuing their campaign, but the network of rackets and protection that underpins the IRA has by now taken on a life of its own.  Their crimes now have their own inexorable economic logic.</P>
    <P>It should not be forgotten that the IRA ignored every election result here since 1992.  There is doubt whether they would pay attention to any referendum at this stage &mdash; even one occurring simultaneously in both parts of the Island. But it is worth trying.</P>
    <P>It is very important to recognise that there will be no enduring political settlement unless and until the violence stops.</P>
    <P>Prejudice and suspicion are a fact in Northern Ireland.  That explains the reason the statement I have just made is true.  Every time an atrocity occurs, prejudice is deepened, a new family circle is infected with fear and hurt, a hurt that may not disappear for generations to come.  I do not believe that any cross-community political institutions, however ingenious, can actually survive, if terror campaigns continue to undermine the essential cross-community tolerance on which any working political institutions must rest.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to describe those who thought up and implemented the Warrington bomb blast and other atrocities as &ldquo;mindless&rdquo;.  These attacks were carefully planned by skilled terrorists to achieve a precise political effect.  To describe them as &ldquo;mindless&rdquo; is to minimise the real danger that they pose.  We are not dealing with organisations that are influenced by appeals to sentiment.</P>
    <P>Each terrorist atrocity by the IRA and the Loyalists is a rational and calculated act.  The death of a child is just as much a means of exerting political pressure for the terrorist politician, as is a television appearance for a democratic politician.</P>
    <P>There is another comfortable assumption, namely that this present situation is so bad that it cannot get much worse. This, unfortunately, could be mistaken. We should look at what has happened in Eastern Europe.  As long as an overwhelming military presence existed, whether in the form of the Soviet or the <Col N="35" /> Yugoslav Central armies, a measure of peace, peace with resentment, but peace just the same, was maintained over a large area of Central and Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>As soon as this central military power was removed, ethnic violence erupted. We now have violent civil wars in Bosnia, in Azerbaijan and in Georgia and the potential for it in many other parts of Central and Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>Those who argue, for example, that British withdrawal, or a declaration in favour of British withdrawal, would help solve the problem must first, before pursuing that, answer the following questions:</P>
    <P>How will they guarantee that, in the absence of the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army, there would not be a radical intensification of ethnic cleansing throughout the island of Ireland?</P>
    <P>Are they sure that the Irish Army has sufficient military strength to impose order on the whole island?</P>
    <P>Are they sure that they would be able to protect the Nationalists of Portadown and the Unionists of rural Fermanagh?  If not, who would be capable of protecting them?</P>
    <P>These questions have to be answered. Some will suggest that a United Nations presence might solve this aspect of the problem.  One might have thought that until this year.  But we have seen how ineffective United Nations troops have been in Bosnia.  The United Nations have not even been invited to Georgia or Azerbaijan. If the British, who at least have a vested interest in maintaining peace in Northern Ireland, were to be made unwilling to see their young men die keeping peace there, what likelihood is there that the electorates of far away UN member countries, would be willing to see their young men go on dying in Ireland over a sustained period?</P>
    <P>These are practical, and I suggest quite important, questions that must first be answered honestly, if we are to devise a <Col N="36" /> solution that will work.  Lives come before constitutional theories.</P>
    <P>Let me now turn to the process of talks between politicians, the Brooke-Mayhew talks, that are now at an impasse.  The best advice one can ever offer to anybody who is engaged in any process of negotiation, is to try to put himself or herself in the shoes of the person at the other side of the table.  To the greatest extent possible, one should try to use their framework of thinking, their concepts, and their language, as the means of advancing one's own legitimate interests. This is much preferable to insisting on the use of one's own framework, concepts, or language.</P>
    <P>Much of the difficulty in the recent talks seems to me as an outsider to have arisen from the fact that both sides came to the talks with different frameworks, different concepts, and have continued to use different language.  As a result, the talks did not get much beyond formalities, despite all the hours spent on them, to discuss substantive possibilities for agreement.  In fact much of the time the delegation appeared to be talking past each other.  That has to change and the whole negotiating method has to change.  If we have a contribution to make in this House obviously we must urge change on those who are most likely to listen to us.  Let me start by saying how the Irish Government and the SDLP might reassess their position, in order to use the framework proposed by the other side, in order to advance discussion on our own interests and in order to get the talks moving again.  At the close of the recent round of talks, the Ulster Unionist Party tabled a proposal designed, they said, &ldquo;to clarify and develop issues arising from bilateral discussions with the Irish Republic's Government and the SDLP&rdquo;. If one wanted to be critical, one could find faults in this paper.  That is exactly what we should not do.</P>
    <P>I should like to list what I see as the positive elements in the Unionist Paper. First, the Unionists propose that &ldquo;minority rights would be guaranteed&rdquo; within Northern Ireland.  Second, that &ldquo;Nationalists would have a meaningful <Col N="37" /> role in the administration of Northern Ireland&rdquo;.  Third, the Unionists said that they had tabled proposals for a &ldquo;Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland&rdquo;.  Fourth they proposed an &ldquo;Inter-Irish relations committee which would facilitate a new understanding of co-operation between Unionists and Nationalists; initiate studies on matters of mutual interest and benefit to the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic and consult the heads of Departments and Ministers and officials on matters relating to areas of mutual interest.</P>
    <P>Rather than concentrating on the deficiencies in this paper, and of the proposals, the Irish Government and the SDLP should treat this paper as a framework for discussion and further proposals.</P>
    <P>They should, for example, table specific ideas as to how the Unionist concept of <i>&ldquo;minority rights being guaranteed&rdquo;</i> could be developed.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Unionists have accepted that there should be a &ldquo;<i>meaningful role in the administration of Northern Ireland</i>&rdquo; for Nationalists.</P>
    <P>Up to now the Unionists have merely been willing to agree to a concept of committees in an assembly, with some of the chairmanships being granted to Nationalists, who would none the less remain in a permanent minority.  This is not adequate.  The Irish Government and the SDLP should therefore table alternative proposals, which accept the Unionist concept of a &ldquo;meaningful role in the administration of Northern Ireland&rdquo; for Nationalists, but which go on to make much more substantive proposals within that concept far beyond what the Unionists are now willing to accept.  That is the way to make progress in negotiations.</P>
    <P>The Unionists have also proposed a &ldquo;Bill of Rights&rdquo;.  Again the sensible thing for the Irish Government to do is to table a detailed proposal for a Bill of Rights, within the framework suggested by the Unionists.  Obviously, the proposals that the Irish Government and the SDLP might put forward for a Bill of rights <Col N="38" /> could go well beyond what the Unionists presently have in mind.</P>
    <P>The Unionist proposal for an &ldquo;Inter Irish Relations Committee&rdquo; is a major step forward by them.  It is quite a time now since the Unionists were willing to accept any formal institution of a North/South kind.</P>
    <P>Rather than fault-finding and saying how inadequate this proposal is, the Irish Government should start by accepting the title &ldquo;Inter Irish Relations Committee,&rdquo; as proposed by the Unionists, but go on from there to propose functions for this committee that go further than the Unionists now have in mind.</P>
    <P>The key to a successful negotiation is, by accepting the other side's basic framework, to make it easier for them to accept many of one's own ideas.  Timing is important.  In order to solidify the positions taken by the Unionists in their paper, it is important that a Government response to that paper be issued quickly and in good faith.</P>
    <P>I know it has been argued that this Unionist paper was issued at the very end of the latest round of talks, and was designed to serve a propaganda purpose as well.  Of course, that is true, but that does not change the argument.  The paper is there to be used as a vehicle for progress, whatever its defects or presumed motivations.</P>
    <P>Equally, I would advise, as I did last week, the Unionist community to take a serious look at the proposals made by the SDLP, which propose to give the Northern Ireland problem a European dimension.  At first sight, this European proposal might be seen as threatening by Unionists, in so far as it represents an apparent diminution in the so-called &ldquo;British&rdquo; interest in the issue.  This need not necessarily be the result.  There could be considerable additional protection for Unionists in having a European dimension.</P>
    <P>With the opening up of Eastern Europe, Europe is being forced to develop much more sophisticated standards than ever before for dealing with minority-majority situations.  Work is already in progress on this in the Council <Col N="39" /> of Europe and in the CSCE.  There could be an advantage for the Unionists, whose position on these islands is relatively isolated, to bring a balancing European dimension into the issue.</P>
    <P>It is important that Unionists think creatively within the framework suggested by other people, rather than confining themselves to their own framework.  This is what I said last week.  I did not suggest, as the Taoiseach inferred, that the Unionists' framework should be the only one used in the talks.  I advised both sides to seek to use the other side's framework and the Taoiseach knows that I urged both sides to do that last week because I supplied him with a copy of my speech. However, he was unable to resist the temptation this morning of engaging in a not very subtle attempt to knowingly misrepresent the position of other parties in this House.  It has been this constant anxiety to score domestic political advantage within this State that has prevented Fianna Fáil in its long history from sponsoring any major constructive initiative on Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's speech today consisted of an elaborate historical justification of the traditional position of his party and erected yet another psychological barrier to progress.  His speech contained no response to the demand for change expressed on the streets of Dublin and other cities and towns in this State. That emphasises how deeply conservative, in the worse sense of that word, this Government really is.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's speech did not meet the needs of this moment in Irish history. If progress is to be made, people from within the Nationalist tradition must make a public effort to understand and acknowledge the views of the Unionists, as I have done.  That would be a constructive contribution towards a settlement. Perhaps the reasons we have made so little progress in solving this problem over 70 years is that all parties in this House have tended to compete with one another in expressing only one viewpoint about the Northern Ireland issue and as a result of that competition we have <Col N="40" /> become stuck in a rut that has led us nowhere.  In his criticism of my speech, the Taoiseach sought to intimidate me into joining him in that competitive restatement of the existing position.  I will not be intimidated in that way.  I will continue to speak in favour of a settlement and to seek to understand the other side of this issue on this island.  I will continue to express in this House the views of the other community on this island, as I understand them, as well as standing up for the views of the minority in Northern Ireland.  In doing so, I can make my best contribution as an elected politician to achieving a solution to this tragic problem.  If we all continue to compete in demonstrating how green we are, we will make no progress.</P>

      <P>I have never accepted that principle and I never will.  I am willing to pay any price to bring about change.  There will be no progress on this issue until the people on both sides make a special effort to understand the views of those on the other side.  That has not happened so far and there was no reference to it this morning.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to say a great deal about the controversial issues of Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution.  Since Germany was voluntarily united, those Articles in our Constitution are the only remaining case of a legal claim, on territory not currently administered by it, enshrined in the Constitution of any European state.</P>
      <P>Retaining a legal claim like this in one's Constitution also makes one's own state, in some sense, incomplete or provisional. This is undesirable from a civic point of view and from the point of view of establishing the necessary loyalty of the institutions of the State needed for democratic Government.  The Taoiseach has claimed that the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, is a form of counterpart of Articles 2 and 3.  He wants the Act changed as some form of trade for a change in Articles 2 and 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us analyse this proposition.  The <Col N="41" /> Government of Ireland Act is no more than a statutory provision similar to any Bill passed by this House.  It is not part of a written Constitution.  It is not entrenched like Articles 2 and 3 and is not their equivalent at all.  In any event, the Government of Ireland Act has been superseded, as far as policy is concerned, by the British declarations in the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  If the present Irish Government wants the Government of Ireland Act changed, they should state in very plain language what exactly they want in its place.  Otherwise it will simply be seen as raising a debating point, creating a new area of uncertainty, for no clear constructive purpose.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I recognise the fears of the Northern Nationalist community about any unilateral change in Articles 2 and 3.  There is no ground for the fear that Northern Ireland residents could no longer get Irish passports if these articles were changed to an aspiration from a legal claim.  However, I agree that the framing of any alternative wording, and of any agreement to go with it, must take account of the real fear among the Nationalist community of potential isolation or of denial of their identity. That is why there is much sense in making constitutional changes in the context of an overall settlement.</P>
    <P>The Government should state unambiguously that it will be prepared to promote a change to Articles 2 and 3 if there is an overall settlement.  To date, it has not done so.  The Tánaiste spoke of putting a package to the people in a referendum, but he did not refer specifically to those Articles in that context.</P>
    <P>This brings me back to my central theme.  We must all be prepared to make real efforts in the area both of institutional change and policing if we are to create conditions for a settlement.</P>
    <P>The solutions are there; this situation is not impossible of solution.  We must have the political courage to put those solutions into effect.  This debate will put that political courage to the test.  The issue can be postponed no longer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate on Northern Ireland today.  The decision to hold the debate was timely and appropriate.  Our discussion takes place against a background of heightened concern throughout this island, and indeed beyond, about the effects and dangers of the conflict.  Much of that concern is rightly directed at the unremitting catalogue of atrocities and tragedies which have been caused by the proponents of violence on both sides.  There is also, however, a second theme running through many of these protests.  People are also deeply troubled that these terrible deeds are being done by people who purport to act in the name of one or other community.  They may shelter behind convoluted doctrines and unjustifable arguments, but these all ultimately reduce to one element, namely, contempt for the actual wishes of the people they invoke.</P>
      <P>History, particularly in this century, shows that it is always a very small step from contempt for the wishes of the people to contempt for all their other basic human rights, including their lives. Those who uphold these evil doctrines in our island are in the grip of that same pattern.  For that reason it is particularly important that those of us who have been entrusted with a mandate of the people, and who are answerable to the people for our actions, should make our voices heard decisively on this question.  I know that Members on all sides of the House are fully conscious of the gravity of those issues and will, I am sure, deal with them in a measured and reflective way, as free as possible from tactical or partisan considerations. I am certain that is how the people who gave us our mandate would wish to see the issue debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that in present circumstances I need not spend time justifying to the House the high priority the Government gave to the Northern Ireland issue in its programme.  The victims in Warrington remind us that some 128 children have been killed since the beginning of the troubles &mdash; enough to fill a school, had they been allowed to live.  The murders at <Col N="43" /> Castlerock are another tragic reminder, if that was needed, of how heavily the brunt of the violence has fallen on both communities in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there has been some debate, particularly in Northern Ireland, on the extent to which public opinion here may have focused on one tragedy as opposed to others.  That is an invidious and unnecessary debate.  Those who do not care impartially for all the murders ultimately do not really care about murder at all.  All innocent victims have equal claims on our compassion.  It has been well said that there is no difference between Catholic tears and Protestant tears.  Neither is there any difference between Irish tears and English tears.</P>
    <P>We all know from our own contacts how fervently our people want to see this violence ended.  We know the bafflement, even the sense of despair they feel when they see murder become a brutal routine.  Violence has touched almost every aspect of our society, and it has sullied every aspect it has touched.  Even when we finally master it &mdash; as in sheer self-defence we somehow must &mdash; it will take a long time to decontaminate our island from its poisonus after-effects.</P>
    <P>The Government's programme states only the bald truth when it says that the future welfare of all the people of Ireland is overshadowed by the conflict.  In addition to those who have suffered directly from the tragedy, there are many more who have suffered indirectly &mdash; for example, those of the unemployed on both sides of the Border who might have jobs if resources were not being diverted into the essentially unproductive task of protecting ourselves from the effects of violence, or if economic opportunities were not lost because our island has been sadly tarnished by it.</P>
    <P>Those who give themselves a licence to take life, who almost casually dispense death and destruction, violate the most elementary human rights of their victims. They hold in contempt both the unmistakable wishes of the people in both communities and the democratic processes the people choose to express their wishes. <Col N="44" /> They may speak hollow and empty words of explanation and excuse, but these serve only to underline the moral and political bankruptcy of the inhuman doctrines they invoke to justify their actions. I know we all wish the peace movement success in its endeavours to bring home to those who carry out or support these atrocities how deeply their actions are held in revulsion by the peoples of these islands.  They have already been successful in demonstrating to the world how hollow is the pretence that such people have any shadow of a mandate for their actions.</P>
    <P>I believe that those people, against whom neither reason nor moral outrage seems to prevail, will also receive a message from this House today.  They will see again our shared determination that the bomb and the bullet shall not replace the ballot; that those who inflict violence and destruction will not win; that we shall continue patiently and with determination to pursue an agenda of mutual respect and true reconciliation among all Irish people.</P>
    <P>It is not, however, enough merely to condemn violence.  Our people want this conflict ended.  Because it flows ultimately from a political failure, they look to their political leaders to set matters to right.  We have seen violence at close quarters for long enough to know how high the price will be if our political processes fail this crucial test.</P>
    <P>There is no goal of this Government, or indeed of our politics generally, more important than laying this ancient quarrel to rest.  We are not somehow condemned to be fatalistic victims of this situation. All of the factors affecting it lie close to hand, in the relationships within this island and between these two islands.  So, therefore, do the keys to a solution.</P>
    <P>The divisions we must address are undoubtedly deep and intractable, but if terrorism has proved anything, it is that the hatreds it seeks to mobilise pale into insignificance compared to our common interest in peace.  That has been shown again and again by the dignity and forbearance of the victims cruelly picked out at random in this evil campaign.  Our <Col N="45" /> challenge now is to build new arrangements which enshrine that deep mutual respect which the victims, and the greater part of the communities they belong to, so generously and so often reach out to each other, in spite of evil campaigns aimed deliberately at fostering their inherited suspicions.</P>
    <P>All roads to political progress run through the process of political dialogue. We approach the challenge of finding a way to relaunch such dialogue on the basis of a number of key considerations.</P>
    <P>The first, as is clear from my earlier remarks &mdash; indeed from everything I ever said throughout my political career &mdash; is that violence can have no role to play in building a solution on this island.  That is not only because it is profoundly wrong and unjustified from a moral point of view.  It is also profoundly counter-productive, in a very literal sense.  It takes a very blinkered Loyalist not to understand that violence perpetrated in the name of Unionism gravely weakens the very relationship with Britain they purport to uphold.  It takes a very blinkered Nationalist not to see that IRA violence has been far and away the single most influential factor in driving a wedge between both parts of this island, as well as between the two communities in Northern Ireland.  Indeed, if it were not for the signal forbearance and good sense of the general communities on both sides of the divide, the terrorism of both sides would have driven Northern Ireland into a murderous <i>cul de sac.</i></P>
    <P>The second consideration is that an essential condition for peace and stability on this island is agreement between the Unionist and Nationalist traditions.  The talks process last year represented a major step towards a common recognition of this basic fact.  They were an acknowledgement that we will never solve our problems on this island by denying each other's reality.  It remains only to go forward from that turning point in our relationship, since there is literally no alternative to dialogue between us, if we wish to secure the future of peace and prosperity we all hope for our children and grandchildren.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="46" /> A third consideration is that a solution will never be found unless we leave behind us the old shibboleths and slogans, whether they be &ldquo;Tiocfaigh ár lá&rdquo; or &ldquo;no surrender&rdquo;.  The notions of victory and defeat may be heady ones on both sides, but they have brought us destruction, not solutions, and they will always continue to do so.  They will never offer a basis for understanding or co-operation, whether applied in the context of Northern Ireland or the island as a whole.  It was for that reason that the Government programme very deliberately went back to the words of the Forum report and set as our goal an accommodation between the two traditions in Ireland, based on the principle that both must have equally satisfactory, secure and durable, political, administrative and symbolic expression and protection.</P>
    <P>The talks process which took place last year allowed each tradition to define for the other the full dimensions of the positions which must be reconciled in any lasting settlement.  These reflected a broad acceptance that new political arrangements were needed to give expression to the identity and validity of each.  We must now seek to build on that progress.  We are pressing ahead with urgency and dedication to seek the resumption of political dialogue.  We are doing so, as the Programme for Government envisages, &ldquo;in a spirit of openness and honesty, with the overriding aim of achieving peace and reconciling the legitimate rights and aspirations of both communities, showing a willingness to discuss all constitutional issues and to initiate and incorporate change in the context of an overall settlement&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Since taking office I have made clear my wishes for face-to-face discussions with all political leaders in Northern Ireland and have followed up in practice wherever I was able to do so constructively. My hope is that we can stimulate new thinking, both within this island and between these islands, on how new arrangements could be shaped which would match the realities of our own <Col N="47" /> time, which we all recognise even if we do not always acknowledge them.</P>
    <P>In our understandable concern to address the issues which divide us; we must not lose sight of the vast areas of common ground we share and which we can build on.  There is first of all the deep desire for peace on all sides which I referred to earlier and the enormous fund of public commitment and goodwill which could be mobilised if we could be seen to approach that goal.  There are close bonds of history and culture, which we share with Northern Unionists no less than Northern Nationalists, and which link us on the sports field, in our places of worship and in so many other aspects of our daily lives.  There is a shared desire for the best standard of living and quality of life that the resources of Ireland, properly used, can afford all of us.  Our common interests in this area are particularly tangible in the context of the European Community.</P>
    <P>Even where our differences seem greatest, in terms of our identity and allegiance, I believe the common ground is greater than we realise.  We agree that there would be no change in the status of Northern Ireland without the consent of a majority who live there.  We agree that if a majority were to consent to a united Ireland, both Governments would give effect to that wish.  That amounts also to a recognition of the equal validity of both aspirations and offers a fair and equitable foundation we all can build on and develop.  It implies that our relationships in Ireland are now the real agenda for those who wish to see our people united.</P>
    <P>This, then, is the framework which governs our position in relation to political dialogue.  The Government is, in that spirit, committed to seeking the urgent resumption of dialogue addressing comprehensively all the relationships involved.</P>
    <P>I cannot give to the House any precise timescale as to when dialogue will resume.  To say this is not to admit either optimism or pessimism but to simply state the obvious.  Both Governments intend doing all in our power to facilitate the <Col N="48" /> earliest possible recommencement of the dialogue.  In recent weeks I have met many representatives, political and otherwise, from both traditions in Northern Ireland and I have carefully listened to their views.  I can only repeat now what I said to them: this Government's door is open and we are ready to discuss all issues as set out in our programme.</P>
    <P>The responsibility for early and meaningful negotiations belongs to all the participants in the talks since each contains a key indispensable to full dialogue.  It is in the first instance clearly a responsibility for both Governments since we must provide the impetus and the parameters for new negotiations.  It is equally a responsibility for Northern Ireland political leaders since no lasting accommodation is possible unless it rests on the consent of all parties to the dialogue.  That is why I hope there will be an early willingness to resume the discussions that concluded last November.</P>
    <P>I would caution however about any impression of political vacuum in the interval before such dialogue recommences. While open to a new and more broadly based Agreement, both Governments are also committed to the full working of the present Anglo-Irish Agreement unless and until it is transcended by new arrangements.  The Irish Government will continue to pursue vigorously the agenda of the Agreement in all its parts for the benefit of both communities in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We shall use it to enhance to the maximum the security co-operation necessary to ensure that those who resort to violence do not succeed and are brought to justice.  We shall use it to ensure the maximum respect for the human rights and the equal treatment of every citizen in Northern Ireland, whether at the hands of the security forces, the administration or private employers.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement has an impressive record of achievement across the major areas of its agenda over the past seven years.  It has made a very real difference on the ground in Northern Ireland.  The Agreement has been operated <Col N="49" /> with vigour and determination by successive Irish Governments, along with their British counterparts.  While the results in some areas have not come as quickly as we would have liked, it has, nevertheless, been steadily achieving its objectives.</P>
    <P>There has been a continuous level of activity under the various headings of the agreement.  This work may not always have received the publicity it deserves, but it is having a real impact on the lives of ordinary people in Northern Ireland. There have been tangible improvements in the position of the Nationalist community. Reforms delivered under the Agreement have re-inforced the attractions of constitutional politics in that community in a way which the paramilitaries have found very difficult to challenge.</P>
    <P>An important objective of the Agreement is the creation of confidence among the Nationalist community in the security forces in Northern Ireland.  The Government is committed to ensuring that the mechanisms of the Agreement continue to address fully the issues which arise in this regard.  Within the framework of the Agreement a number of changes have been made, including improvement of policing, more impartial handling of parades, better arrangements in prisons and, more recently, some additional measures to improve procedures for dealing with complaints against members of the security forces.</P>
    <P>I recognise of course that these reforms, while representing some progress, have not resolved all the difficulties in these areas.  Much, therefore, remains to be done.  We shall continue to press for meaningful, sustained and effective improvement, for example, relating to the use of lethal force by security forces, conditions and safeguards for detainees in RUC holding centres, the objective of full and effective police accompaniment of British Army patrols and the continuing problem of harrassment by the British Army of persons, particularly young men.</P>
    <P>Important work has also been carried out under the Agreement in the area <Col N="50" /> of the protection of human rights, the achievement of equality between the two traditions and the prevention of economic and social discrimination.  In this area I would mention the Irish Government's substantial input through the Conference to the drafting of the Fair Employment Act in 1989 which introduced a range of new measures to promote equality of opportunity in employment in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a welcome emphasis on the Conference's work programme on North/South economic and social cooperation.  Meetings of the Conference are now regularly attended by relevant Ministers from both sides to discuss ways in which North/South cooperation in their respective areas can be advanced.  The opportunities which can arise for co-operation in the European context are also being actively pursued. I attach particular importance to the Conference addressing in this way the challenges of economic development in both parts of Ireland and the scope that exists for the two economies to make real gains through cooperation.</P>
    <P>The mechanisms of the Conference and the Secretariat provide us with a process of continuous structured co-operation between the two Governments in relation to Northern Ireland and is an invaluable asset.  It is a mistake to see the Agreement, as unfortunately some Unionists do, as designed for the benefit of Nationalists only.  It does give us a certain role in relation to the interests of Northern Nationalists.  However, much of its agenda is actually in the longer term interests of both communities.</P>
    <P>Take the question of security co-operation or the issue of equal rights for both communities.  Both communities stand to benefit from action in these areas.  I am conscious of the work which still remains to be done, but I can assure Deputies that I will be pressing for full and rapid implementation of the provisions of the Agreement in all the areas which it covers.  I am determined that the pattern of co-operation will increase in the interests of all the people of this island. There is an enormous range of possibilities, <Col N="51" /> including those at European level, where North and South can work together in a way that should be of mutual advantage to all our people.  There will be no vacuum in regard to our relationship with the British Government in Northern Ireland.  We will continue our efforts to relaunch the search for new political arrangements.  I believe that we now have a historic opportunity on this island to begin anew.  Our people want an end to violence.  They want an honourable accommodation among Irish men and women of both traditions which lays to rest, once and for all, our hatreds and quarrels.  The Government will do all in its power to achieve such a new beginning.</P>

      <P>The Progressive Democrats welcome this opportunity to discuss in this Chamber the issues involved in the Northern Ireland conflict, which are at the forefront of many people's minds these days.  I have to say, however, that it is very sad indeed that it has taken tragedy, outrage and barbarism to put Northern Ireland on the agenda of this House.  It is a poor reflection on us that this debate would probably not have happened at all if it had not been for the bestial outrage in Warrington.  If the campaign of slaughter in Northern Ireland had proceeded at its slow, obscene pace within the confines of Northern Ireland there is very little indication that this House would have been addressing its collective mind to these issues here this morning rather than dealing with the other Bills which came before the House this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is shameful that Dáil Éireann deals with Northern Ireland in such an <i>ad hoc</i> and reactive way.  That is instanced to some extent by the Government proposal that the House establish a Northern Ireland and Foreign Affairs Committee that would not be permitted to talk about policy and security matters in relation to Northern Ireland and that the Government, despite the protestations of Opposition parties, still wants to prevent the Foreign Affairs Committee to be established <Col N="52" /> by this House from publicly debating the issues.</P>
    <P>I have listened to the debate thus far and have noticed a remarkable contrast between the two partners in Government as represented by their leaders.  The speech delivered by the Taoiseach was not merely disappointing and unsuitable for the occasion; it was downright derelict in the extent to which it departed from what is now needed in this country, real leadership.  We have had much too much dwelling on history and drum beating. We had a good deal more of it this morning from the Taoiseach, who delivered a potted history of our constitutional problems in terms that would do no justice to a secondary school student.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach came to the House with an analysis of our problems and possible solutions for them which beggared belief and demonstrated a poverty of imagination and an absence of leadership that I find very distressing indeed.  One would have only to instance the completely inapt comparison between the German Constitution and Articles 2 and 3 of the Irish Constitution to underline the extent to which the analysis the Taoiseach offered the House today is fundamentally flawed.  The problem in Germany was not of two populations in a land mass being divided in accordance with their wishes; they were divided against their wishes. The articles in the German Constitution to which the Taoiseach referred did not claim for the German Federal Republic a <i>de jure</i> right to administer the whole of Germany.  They amounted to a call to unity, not an imposition of soverignty. What is more, it was not something in the hearts of the German people that held them apart; it was the interference of others.  I do not have to indicate to the Taoiseach the extent to which his analysis tendered this morning fundamentally fails to address the concerns of Unionists nor the extent to which he is out of sympathy with a million people who live upon this island, and with their aspirations and their concerns.  Not one word in the Taoiseach's speech demonstrated even the slightest superficial understanding of their concerns, still less was there any <Col N="53" /> indication that the Taoiseach proposes to make political progress towards reconciliation of the views he and his party have represented in the past with the views that they maintain today.  That attitude contrasts with the views expressed by the Tánaiste, who was at least positive and open-minded.  He dealt with the concerns of ordinary people in a manner which was not exclusively nationalist nor exclusively south of the Border in approach but was directed towards all the people of this island.  I am not attempting to divide artificially the Taoiseach from his Tánaiste.  I am pointing out what must be as plain as a pikestaff to anyone listening to the debate &mdash; that there was a marked and almost irreconcilable difference in the approaches of the two speeches delivered from the Government benches thus far.</P>
    <P>A great wave of human emotion demands that to which we are all entitled and that for which most people long &mdash; an end to the killings, the bombings and the terrorism.  As I said last weekend in Limerick, sometimes the blindingly obvious needs to be restated.  The campaign of political killing in Northern Ireland would stop tomorrow if those who are killing chose to stop it.  That campaign is a matter of choice; it is neither compelled nor excused by other circumstances and it would stop if the people engaged in it chose to stop it.  The IRA campaign has no inevitable momentum of its own; it is going nowhere politically, historically or morally.  I say to the people in the IRA murder machine that they will not be retrospectively pardoned by history.  Now is the time for this Chamber, which the Constitution calls the House of Representatives of the Irish people, to call for, to demand and to resolve to obtain an end to political killing this year, 1993.  Such an aim is neither naive nor unreal.  We are the elected public representatives chosen by a people who, as in any other democracy, have the right to expect of their politicians that they span the gap between aspiration and achievement.  In order to do that, we in this Republic have to be honest with ourselves about what can be achieved, <Col N="54" /> what should be achieved and what is desirable to achieve in the short term.</P>
    <P>Speaking about a unitary Irish state in the present circumstances is not to speak at all, except to show that one ought not to be participating in the debate because one is part of the problem rather than part of its solution.  For the Taoiseach of this country to speak in terms of a unitary Irish state in the terms that he did in his speech this morning ignores completely the realities that exist in Northern Ireland.  Northern Ireland may be seen by some as a failed political entity &mdash; and, doubtless, the extent of its failure is there for all to see &mdash; but the majoritation principle established in Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, an agreement that is registered in the United Nations, binds this country, all its political leaders and all its political parties to the principle that there will be no change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland for as long as the people of Northern Ireland state that there will be no change.  That is the logic that we must deal with now. I believe that the Taoiseach, in running away from that logic and in going back over history and historical justifications for the Nationalist position, does no service in that he fails to address what must be done now, that is, to arrive within the present constitutional status of Northern Ireland, which is not going to change in the foreseeable future, at institutions and political processes that command and deserve the respect of both traditions in the North and that restate a relationship between North and South and between London and Dublin.</P>
    <P>The conflict on this island is a conflict of two absolutist positions.  Our collective perception of history here in the South has, alas, been entirely absolutist.  Many Members of this House would be able to cast their minds back to their school days, when history was taught to all of us in an absolutist way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  The emergence of this State was portrayed as a slow, painful, moral, historical process, <Col N="55" /> almost inevitable, in which every setback such as Kinsale was a tragedy and every step forward such as the Easter uprising of 1916 was a moral triumph.  The history and folklore of the Unionist people in Northern Ireland is similarly and equally replete with absolutism, tragedy and moral uncertainty.  What we need least of all is a Cook's tour of constitutional history over the past 30, 50 or 70 years as seen by the Taoiseach, which does nothing to add to our analysis but does much to increase the obstacles to political progress.  It is abundantly clear that real political progress in such a climate will be made only by those who are willing to step outside their own history and make common cause with likeminded people from different backgrounds, people who can recognise political opportunities above and beyond the logic and the vocabulary of their own historical community. It is to such men and women that history will look back if this island is to escape in these days and months from the cycle of barbarism to which we have descended and in which we are apparently locked.</P>
      <P>I regret to say that collectively this House is nowhere near demonstrating those qualities.  I hesitate to use a divisive example but I feel constrained to say that, if my party colleague sitting beside me, Deputy Mary Harney, could be regarded by some as unsuitable to take part in the political dialogue on Northern Ireland because of her so-called sympathy with the Unionist position, it says more about the people who make that judgment because they demonstrate a poverty of imagination, a lack of intellectual grasp, an absence of any element of leadership that bodes ill for the future of the political process in Northern Ireland in so far as it depends on their participation.  The same applies to the unfortunate remarks made in this House scarcely a few months ago in relation to Deputy Bruton in which he was accused of being a crypto-Unionist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to say that the absence of political leadership, North and South, is one of the greatest recipes for political paralysis.  We need leadership. In turn, leadership needs consistency, imagination and a sense of purpose.  I look at the two speeches delivered in the House this morning.  I have to say that both of them show a passiveness, a lack of determination which beggars belief.  Both of them are mind-bogglingly devoid of a sense of determination or a clear agenda for action.  We cannot afford to have any more Templemore speeches or those made on other occasions when our representatives, for narrow, mean-minded, ephemeral advantage in the South, throw away their credibility and consistency in the North and, ultimately, in the South as well.  Recent events in one of the parties opposite in relation to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution &mdash; at which they were made the pretext of another agenda &mdash; were as degrading as they were pitiful. To use Articles 2 and 3 as a vehicle for personal, political retribution in the way it was done only underlines how wrong it is that peoples' lives in the North should be seen as pawns in the power games of the South.  That ploy was not merely in bad taste &mdash; the phrase used by the Deputy &mdash; it was breathtakingly callous and cynical.  Using Articles 2 and 3 to rally opinion in Templemore or in Rathkeale is equally reprehensible and equally distasteful when it has nothing to do with the problems of Northern Ireland.  In squaring up to the Taoiseach on that issue, the former Minister for Defence really had met his match.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fairness to the Tánaiste it can be said that he is trying to give political leadership where otherwise there is none in this Government.  But the rumblings of discontent from his Coalition partners are aimed precisely at the Tánaiste because he is attempting to give that leadership.  One would have to conclude that within this House there is still one party, now with 65 Deputies, which collectively, with some honourable exceptions, lacks the commitment, <Col N="57" /> responsibility, understanding, generosity and, above all, the leadership we so badly need and which is so sadly absent.  There must be change if there is to be any hope.</P>
    <P>On the subject of extradition I note the remarks made by the Taoiseach.  I note his statement that changing our laws on extradition will not of itself achieve the end of the campaign of violence.  With that view I agree.  But I pose this question: can we put our hands on our hearts and say that it was not through Clogga Strand that the <i>Eksund</i> and the other shiploads of armaments came into this State?  Can we put our hands on our hearts and say that a great deal of that <i>matériel</i> is not stored within the confines of this State?  With Kilcock in mind can we say that a lot of the weapons of destruction are not, on occasion, assembled, designed and put in place within this State?  When we read our newspapers, can we say, with our hands on our hearts, that a lot of the people engaged in the campaign of violence do not use this State for their nefarious purposes? In these circumstances, can we not see that there is a role for a workable law of extradition?</P>
    <P>It is now three years since this party, while a member of Government, put into public circulation, and gave to our partners in Government, proposals for the change of the law of extradition, proposals to close loopholes which had opened up in our laws.  It is three years since we were given an assurance by the then Minister for Justice that if certain court decisions then expected &mdash; and whose outcome was correctly predicted by the Progressive Democrats &mdash; confirmed the existence of the loopholes which we stated were there, the Government would act immediately to close them off.  Three years have passed with that commitment ignored and broken. During that period any person found within this jurisdiction in possession of weapons or explosives north of the Border or in Britain, could still resist extradition to either of those jurisdictions to meet justice.</P>
    <P>The same applies to people using certain forms of weapons, such as single shot <Col N="58" /> snipers' rifles.  They can now rely on the loopholes in our law to resist extradition. I say to the Government that there is a sense of urgency on this because they will find in the near future that somebody will be arrested in this country, or a warrant will be sought for someone, in those circumstances. They will be released by the courts because the courts can only administer the laws handed down to them by the Oireachtas.  There will be the upset; there will be the damage done to mutual trust on this island.  The responsibility for that will fall fairly and squarely on the shoulders of those who did nothing although they knew what was their duty.</P>
    <P>In relation to Northern Ireland's immediate prospects, it has been stated on a number of occasions, with some logic, that present prospects for progress in Northern Ireland must be diminished by the imminence of local elections there. Which is more important in our scheme, in the British scheme and in the Northern Ireland people's scheme of priorities &mdash; the holding of local elections to administer local government now, or the resumption of a dialogue for peace and progress to end the killings now?  Is it more important that Dungannon Urban District Council be reconstituted or that the negotiations between the constitutional political parties in the North resume?  Are local politics in Northern Ireland more important than the dynamic of the peace process, North and South, and between Britain and Ireland?  I query the priorities which put the process of political reconciliation on hold pending local elections.  God knows, in this jurisdiction, we postpone local elections for no reason.  Sometimes it is a surprise to note that they cannot be postponed in Northern Ireland, especially when they interfere with the process that might hasten the saving of lives.</P>
    <P>While it would be absurd to allow one party in Northern Ireland to dictate terms and set down pre-conditions for the resumption of talks, it appears to us in the Progressive Democrats that Unionists participants in particular &mdash; people like Ken Magennis, who have moved furthest to establish a basis for negotiations <Col N="59" />&mdash; would be well served if the Government were to indicate that our Constitution would be changed to accommodate a new treaty and agreement covering relations in these islands and that such a change would involve the deletion of the claim made in Article 3 of the 1937 Constitution.</P>
    <P>I now come to those Articles of the Constitution.  Just as in the moral sphere the Eight Amendment of the Constitution was ultimately self-defeating, it is an irony that we also have there an obstacle to unity, peace and harmony in the guise of a constitutional imperative to achieve Irish unity.  Articles 2 and 3 are a major obstacle to political progress in Northern Ireland and, hence, to any form of worthwhile unity.  The claim made in Article 3 is often misunderstood. It is not an aspiration to unity.  It is not a claim of right for Irish unity.  It is not a formal disputation of partition.  It is about time it was said in this House &mdash; and it should be repeated until it has been finally disposed of as an issue &mdash; that it is an explicit and unabiguous claim that the people of the former Irish Free State, now the Republic, have the right to impose their 1937 Constitution, the Government and Parliament elected under the Constitution and its laws, upon the territory and people of Northern Ireland.  That claim, as set out in Article 3, is unrealistic, unjust and unfounded in international law and no forum of international law and no international legal tribunal would uphold that claim.</P>
    <P>The idea that the people of the Irish Free State in 1937 could draft a Constitution which was unashamedly confessional in tone and content at that time and claim to impose it on the people of Northern Ireland who were not even consulted on its content, and who would not have agreed to it, is patently absurd. A claim to unity is one thing; a claim to unity on our terms is another but a claim to unity to the terms of our grandparents is unstatable in its entirety.  The contents of Article 3 are about as legitimate, in thirties or nineties Irish political terms, as the slogan in the thirties and forties <Col N="60" /> Northern Ireland politics, &ldquo;A Protestant Parliament for a Protestant People&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This party has constantly been committed to the process of peace and progress in Northern Ireland, between North and South and between London and Dublin.  We are, and always have been, committed to the replacement of Articles 2 and 3 by provisions which reflect our aspirations to unity in terms of unity through consent.  Nor is there any reason to believe that the removal of Articles 2 and 3 in their present form would preclude this State and the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland from stating their aspiration to unity in some other terms.  Still less would such a restatement deprive Northern Ireland Nationalists of their links to this State or their entitlement to Irish citizenship or passports. All these matters can be dealt with in a context which does not involve an unsustainable territorial claim such as that set out in Article 3.</P>
    <P>Just as no party in Northern Ireland should hold a veto on talks it is fair to point out that the talks process cannot be abandoned at the behest of any party in favour of a unilateral appeal over the heads of the politicians to the voters by referendum.  Such a course would end in rejection and failure and cannot be contemplated while there is still a great deal to be done, given and agreed by generous-minded politicians in the context of inter-party talks.</P>
    <P>This House has chosen this morning to speak about Northern Ireland to the Irish people and it has chosen this occasion to debate the fundamental issues and prospects for the process of peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland.  We do this in a context where the ordinary men and women on the streets of our cities and towns are fed up to the teeth with rhetoric and want action.  The action they want is political and the politics they want are generous, open-minded and constructive politics.  They demand of this generation of politicians, as of none before, that they look forward instead of backwards.  That is precisely what was so wrong with the analysis offered today by the Taoiseach &mdash; it was backward looking, introverted <Col N="61" /> and self-justifying.  We do not need that; we have had half a century of it and it has achieved nothing.  What we need is a different form of politics, one which is forward-looking, constructive and generous and, as Deputy Bruton said &mdash; I agree entirely with what he had to say in this respect &mdash; which tends to look at the problem through the eyes of and with the concepts of the other people rather than solely analysing their views by reference to our own vocabulary and concepts.</P>
    <P>That is what is now required.  It requires not merely generosity because everyone will pretend to show goodwill but leadership and, above all, imagination were not evident in the Taoiseach's speech this morning.  Not only could these not be found but there was evidence littered throughout the speech in historical examples and references of a very different approach to Irish politics and a very different agenda for the peace process. What the Tánaiste said and gave with the one hand in this debate, unfortunately, the Taoiseach took away with the other. This bodes ill for the success of these talks.</P>
    <P>It is not enough for the smaller partner in a coalition to have goodwill for the talks process and to go to the Unionist community and appear on a bi patisan basis to be more generous.  We need to shift the great bulk of Irish politics &mdash; if I may refer to Fianna Fáil opinion on those terms &mdash; and of Irish thinking on to a new level.  This requires from the Fianna Fáil Party in particular &mdash; there is no point in putting a tooth in this &mdash; an entirely new approach to his issue.</P>
    <P>As long as people of goodwill are held back by atavistic craw-thumping and drum-beating of the kind heard in the House today and by a view of history &mdash; so ably demonstrated by the Taoiseach &mdash; which is wholly devoid of an understanding of the other person's point of view, this cycle of violence will continue and the elected politicians, North and South, will find themselves unable to address the real issues in language they are both equally happy with and exchange views on a realistic basis on <Col N="62" /> how new arrangements in Northern Ireland can be arrived at.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that, if restarted, the process of talking in Northern Ireland could give rise to an imaginative set of proposals, such as a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland, institutions North and South, and a consultative role for this State in areas which are not the prerogative of a democratically elected assembly in Northern Ireland.  It is easy to see the building blocks of the solution but what is needed in a leap of imagination and a new level of leadership here which is wholly absent.</P>
    <P>I note that there was a report in one of the newspapers this morning to the effect that the other House of the Oireachtas has invited one speaker from one party to address it in the near future on Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I would welcome any invitation to any people of goodwill from Northern Ireland to get involved in our affairs and to address us here but I am not aware of any such unilateral invitation.  So far as this party is concerned, the Chambers of both Houses of the Oireachtas must be open to all shades of opinion in Northern Ireland.  I am glad to note that the Taoiseach has indicated that the story in the newspaper that I am speaking about today is not accurate.  No effort should be spared to involve all shades of opinion in dialogue with the South and no partial invitation should ever be issued to one shade of opinion only because that would make us part of the problem and not part of the solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This party, and the parties on this side of the House, have approached this issue with a generosity of spirit and a willingness to climb out of old political positions to see if something can be achieved to stop the killing now.  It is not enough to condemn the killings; there must be action to fill the vacuum in which the killers operate.  This can only take place if there is an early resumption of the talks process in Northern Ireland and it can only be helped if for the purpose of <Col N="63" /> resuming that process, first, the Government indicates that the arid territorial claim in Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution would be, rather than could be, eliminated as part of the solution to be agreed between the parties to the talks and, second, if the Government takes every step to ensure that this State and its jurisdiction is perceived by all the people of these islands as a place that is wholly committed to peace, and which does not tolerate in any degree, violence or terrorism.  In that context every possible step must be taken to enforce and reform our laws, and to demonstrate to the Unionists, in particular, that nothing is tolerated here which is part of the campaign of violence.  With that in mind I ask the Taoiseach, and the Tánaiste in particular, to look to the powers in the Offences against the State Act, for the closure of buildings and the suppression of certain activities which in my judgment, at any rate, should be suppressed because their open execution within our jurisdiction only gives grist to the mill of those who accuse us of being soft on violence.  In that context, too, we should take the opportunity &mdash; and I hope the Minister for Justice does &mdash; to state clearly today what progress can be expected in the reform of our law on extradition and when the Bill will be published and passed.  Have we got priorities or have we not?  Can we spare a day of this House's time between now and the summer to pass a Bill reforming our extradition legislation?  I wonder to what extent such measures are at the head of our list of priorities?</P>
    <P>We must have no more political wrangling either between the Coalition partners or between some members of either Coalition partner in relation to Articles 2 and 3 unless and until they are willing to look to the substance of these Articles and acknowledge what I have said &mdash; that they are a claim by this House and by the people of this State to impose this House and its rule on Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have in the past shown a capacity to legislate quickly and effectively when emergency requires it.  The Office of <Col N="64" /> Public Works Act is one example.  If we have to do something in a hurry we will do it in a hurry.  If something matters politically, we can achieve it at breakneck speed.  Is there not such a sense of urgency about Northern Ireland, extradition and the implementation of the powers that exist now to suppress the terrorism campaign in the manifestations taken in our midst in the Republic?  Is there not such a sense of urgency?</P>
    <P>Today's debate has been useful in that it has allowed it to be clearly demonstrated that there is not a cross-party consensus on every issue, that there is not a shared view and those who are watching us from outside should not be under any misapprehension that there is a consensus that covers all political parties.  There is not and the Taoiseach's speech clearly showed there was no such consensus, but &mdash; and I address my remarks through the Chair to the Tánaiste in particular &mdash; a great majority of Members, all except a group numbering between 65 and 70, share the analysis that has come from these benches this morning.  That is the representative view of the Irish people.  The circumstances in which the Tánaiste finds himself in Coalition with Fianna Fáil now should not under any circumstances be allowed to disguise the fact that the great majority of Deputies in this House were elected to parties to represent voters who have a fundamentally different view from the atavistic views expressed by the Taoiseach this morning.  He is in the minority in this House on this issue and he should know so.  His colleagues &mdash; that dwindling band &mdash; should also know so.  They are not representative of the centre of gravity of Irish political views on Northern Ireland any more and if they want to be part of history making in approaching solutions to Northern Ireland, the first thing they must do is recognise their own minority status and the minority status of their own opinions.  If they do that, and I am not confident they will, they will start to be part of the solution and cease to be what they are now very evidently, a major part of the problem.</P>

      <P>I was deeply disappointed with the Taoiseach's speech because it gave no indication whatever that he understood, to any significant extent, the real basis of the problems that beset this island.  The reality is that the pretence has to stop.  It is a pretence that the removal of the political Border on this island is either feasible or even desirable. The pretence must end because it is feeding the murder machine of the IRA which has brought such tragedy to so many people here, in Britain and on the Continent. That is the challenge that faces the political leadership of this country. We will be judged by future generations on how effectively we meet that challenge &mdash; not on how loyal we have been to political legacies.  Quite frankly, it is irrelevant what Pádraig Pearse, James Connolly or Éamon de Valera believed or said they believed in their time.  We live in Ireland today.  We must find a solution to the problems we have today.  We must seek peace and prosperity, liberty and justice, for ourselves, our children and their children.</P>
      <P>Our responsibility is to the future, not to the past, and if we must betray the past, so what?  Pádraig Pearse said that &ldquo;Ireland unfree shall never be at peace&rdquo;. Well that is the nonsense the Provos use to justify the murder of Jonathan Ball and Tim Parry.  As far as I am concerned, the Irish people will never be free until we have peace.  We will never have peace until we accept the reality that the political Border on this island represents a real divide between the people of this island.  That divide can only be bridged by tolerant pluralist democratic politics. Seeking to bridge it by force has deepened that divide and will ultimately destroy us if it does not end soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must not lose sight of the fact that the Provisional IRA has been the main <Col N="66" /> perpetrator of violence in Northern Ireland during the past 22 years.  Men, women and children have been murdered and maimed, allegedly in the name of a united Ireland, but in reality the murder campaign has been directed at terrorising the Protestant population into acquiescence to enforced unity.  If they do not like it, they can leave: &ldquo;Brits Out&rdquo; means &ldquo;Prods Out.&rdquo;&ldquo;Tiocfhaidh ár lá&rdquo; is the war cry of revenge.</P>
    <P>Nationalist terror is now being matched by Loyalist terror.  The UFF is every bit as ruthless as the IRA and has perfected its capacity to murder to the same degree.  Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and the &ldquo;terrible beauty&rdquo; of the IRA now has a loyalist twin.  And in its own perverted way, the IRA will be pround that it still has no qualms about murdering children.  Make no mistake about it: Warrington was no accident. The Provos set out to murder, and murder they did.  It has taken a particular brutal and shocking outrage to stir us once more out of our collective lethargy. The cruel circumstances of the Warrington bombing stunned people and I hope it will prove to be another watershed in our attitude to the Provo campaign in a way that Darkley and Enniskillen were.</P>
    <P>The placing of a bomb in a litter bin in a crowded shopping centre &mdash; one of them outside of a McDonald's restaurant &mdash; meant that children were intended to be murdered.  Any human being with even a spark of humanity left could not but be appalled by the spectacle of young children fleeing in terror from one bomb explosion, only to run directly into the shrapnel of another deliberately placed to catch them and do maximum damage. Then we had the sickening pretence that they never intended to murder or injure anyone.</P>
    <P>Some people, especially in Northern Ireland, have asked why the Warrington bombing and other similar incidents such as the Enniskillen massacre have created such outrage in the Republic when other equally vicious atrocities carried out by Loyalist gangs do not seem to provoke the same reaction.  I believe that the vast <Col N="67" /> majority of people in this State are appalled by all murders, irrespective of the perpetrators or their victims.  What adds to the sense of outrage about incidents like Warrington and Enniskillen is that those who placed the bombs claimed to do so on our behalf.  This, coupled with the anger at the death of two children, brought 20,000 people onto the streets of Dublin last Sunday.</P>
    <P>There are those who say that we have seen such demonstrations before and they achieved little.  They point particularly to the experience of the Peace People during the seventies and note that it did not stop the violence.  This is to understate the achievements of the Peace People and many other peace groups which continue to operate.  They did not stop the violence completely but they certainly helped to secure the reduction in violence which was seen in the late seventies and to narrow the base of Provo and Loyalist support.  Indeed the Provisionals were in serious trouble during the late seventies.  It was the emotional response to the pointless deaths in the H Block hunger strikes coupled with the intransigence of Mrs. Thatcher which helped breath life back into their campaign.</P>
    <P>Peace groups and public demonstrations are important but on their own cannot end the violence.  There is a need for political action on the part of democratic politicians to match the mass action of people on the streets.  There must be no question of our stepping back and hoping that Susan McHugh and her colleagues can stop the violence.  We must give political leadership so that public revulsion is given a positive direction to ensure that the Provos and the other paramilitary groups are made irrelevant, isolated and ultimatley destroyed altogether as part of the political equation.</P>
    <P>It is not enough simply for us to demand that the Unionists in the North should change; we must be prepared also to abandon the political shibboleths of constitutional nationalism.  We have to examine scrupulously everything we say <Col N="68" /> and do to ensure that it lends no encouragement, intended or otherwise, to any of the murder gangs.  If a permanent peace is to be found, politicians generally will have to be prepared to demonstrate a new flexibility and willingness to compromise.  The people of Northern Ireland have not been well served by politicians who show an unwillingness to compromise and whose ritual response seems always to be &mdash; as was the case with Mr. John Hume's recent statement &mdash; to `blame the other side'.</P>
    <P>John Hume, the Leader of the SDLP, member of the Westminster Parliament and member of the European Parliament has urged the British and Irish Governments to go over the heads of the politicians in Northern Ireland, with an unspecified `solution'.  I have already publicly urged rejection of such a fool-hardy enterprise and welcome its rejection by both the Irish and British Governments.  In rejecting it the Irish Government defined the priority of both administrations as being &ldquo;to get all of the constitutional parties back around the table to resume political dialogue, which is the only sensible alternative to the violence which continues to claim innocent lives&rdquo;.  The Northern Secretary of State has taken a broadly similar line &mdash; that the politicians should listen to what the electorate is telling them and get back to the talks process.</P>
    <P>In welcoming their stance on this issue I also have to say that the positions of both the Irish and British Governments are crucially deficient.  The problem is that unless we honestly analyse why the talks process halted and accurately assign responsibility, it is pointless to make generalised pleas for the parties to get back to the conference table.  As Dr. Garret FitzGerald noted in <i>The Irish Times</i> in January 1993, the talks had seen &ldquo;a visible growth of mutual trust among the Northern participants....  All were at one in remarking on the considerable progress made in the working groups, where bits and pieces of tentative agreements on various issues seemed to be begining to emerge&rdquo;.  One of the key factors which allowed progress to be made was the <Col N="69" /> undoubted capacity to negotiate seriously and to make the significant concessions which were made by Unionists, especially by the Ulster Unionist Party. Despite this, John Hume has recently attempted to suggest that the Unionists are reconstructed champions of Protestant supremacy.  This dishonest position reflects the SDLP concern about the degree to which both the British Government and many people in Northern Ireland are assigning responsibility for the failure of the talks squarely on the shoulders of John Hume and the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Irish Government to state that it would &mdash; as distinct from could &mdash; put to the Oireachtas and to the electorate a referendum on Articles 2 and 3 was a major cause of the collapse of the talks.  I am pleased we have a new Minister responsible for Northern Ireland.  The signs of flexibility on Articles 2 and 3 shown in Deputy Quinn's <i>Fortnight</i> interview and in the Tánaiste's Mansion House address is a welcome development.  However, it needs to be said that there are still too many signs of unreconstructed traditionalism on this issue in the governing parties.  We all should now acknowledge openly that the Anglo-Irish Agreement has made Articles 2 and 3 redundant.  We should not listen to those who suggest that an amendment would leave the Catholic population of the North `deserted'.  Is it not time we got away from the sloppy thinking which presumes that every Catholic is a Nationalist thirsting for unification with this State?  The consistent findings of the Annual Social Studies Attitudes Surveys is that about half of the Catholics in Northern Ireland would not describe themselves as Nationalists.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement represented a belief on the part of the then British Government that as power-sharing devolution was unlikely to be attained, the only way Catholic interests could be represented within the Northern Ireland state was to give a new consultative role to the Dublin Government. I considered that this was an approach that would create more problems than it <Col N="70" /> would solve, as indeed it did.  Nevertheless one beneficial consequence is that the existence of the agreement is the fundamental guarantee that, regardless of Articles 2 and 3, the minority in Northern Ireland cannot be deserted by the Government of this State.  So what other reasons can there be for wanting to retain these articles?</P>
    <P>It is here that we must deal clearly with the SDLP.  This is the party which, despite Mr. Hume's constant lecturing of the Unionists about politics being about negotiation, showed no inclination to move from its opening position which was effectively for a form of joint authority shared between Britain and Ireland.  This point is crucial to our own debate in the Republic.  Like the Anglo-Irish Agreement, this commitment of the SDLP to this so-called solution shows that constitutional Nationalists, whatever their rhetoric, have decisively left behind the Ireland for which the 1937 Constitution was thought appropriate.  Joint authority is not compatible with Articles 2 and 3 which seeks undisputed domination of Northern Ireland by the Republic.</P>
    <P>We must be honest in the way in which we discuss the issue of constitutional reform.  If we are saying to the Unionists and the British Government that we are open to change in the context of what the Tánaiste called `a generally acceptable package' and mean by this the kind of settlement envisaged by the Leader of the SDLP, we will get nowhere.  If what is being sought is joint sovereignty then we should honestly admit it.  Like the Anglo-Irish Agreement it also effectively makes Articles 2 and 3 redundant.  I personally think that such a `solution' would be a recipe for a massive increase in the level of Loyalist violence, without doing anything significant to undermine support for the Provisionals who would see it as a sign that they are winning.</P>
    <P>We must acknowledge that the talks saw important signs of movement and flexibility on the part of the negotiators of the Ulster Unionist Party.  Given the nature of the current Protestant `angst' about a possible British desire to disengage, <Col N="71" /> which was articulated forcibly by the leader of the Alliance Party, this flexibility was unprecedented and extremely brave.</P>
    <P>However, despite protestations that constitutional nationalism would be open and generous, constitutional nationalism has virtually turned its back on this development, where it has not actively denied, disparaged and misrepresented it.  We have to choose between continuing to be the uncritical cheerleaders for an increasingly obviously bankrupt Northern Nationalist tradition or doing our utmost to support those forces in Northern Ireland from both `traditions' arguing for the politics of realistic political compromise.  At the core of any such compromise will be a clear recognition that just as Unionists will not be bombed into a united Ireland, they will not be blathered into one either.</P>
    <P>If the parties in Government are to break new ground they must not allow themselves to be held back by those incapable of a broader vision.  Some politicians down here have also been unwilling or incapable of change.  Unionists in Northern Ireland are still, in the view of some, some sort of trespassers on this island who, in the words of Deputy Bell in July 1991, should return to Britain `where they belong'.</P>
    <P>Some, like Fianna Fáil Deputy Noonan, are simply the Nationalist mirror image of Unionists like Dr. Ian Paisley in Northern Ireland.  The Unionist mantras of `no surrender' and `not an inch' are matched by Nationalist mantras about the sacredness and inviolability of Articles 2 and 3.  The territorial claim to Northern Ireland in Articles 2 and 3 are, Deputy Noonan says, a core value for Fianna Fáil.  He was, of course, prepared to sacrifice core values before in order to attain or remain in Government, but people like Deputy Noonan are not prepared to even consider amendments to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, as a step towards ending the violence which has claimed more than 3,000 lives.</P>
    <P>One has come not to expect anything better from Deputy Noonan who has <Col N="72" /> become the voice of the worst type of narrow, intolerant Fianna Fáil nationalism, but it is shocking to find a Labour Party Deputy who is prepared to speak the language of the Provos.  I am referring here not only to Deputy Bell, but also&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to Deputy Bree who made a statement recently which echoed virtually word for word the kind of language used by Mr. Adams on a consistent basis in his statements.  I can see no sign of any willingness on the part of the Provos to acknowledge either the immorality of their actions or the futility of their campaign.  The latest statement from Mr. Gerry Adams in which he called for a &ldquo;new beginning to build peace&rdquo; is notable only for its cynicism.  How can there be a new beginning while the Provos continue to murder and destroy? The Provos seem to have adapted their former strategy of the ballot box and the Armalite and are now seeking to go forward with a peace plan in one hand and a pound of semtex in the other?  What people want to hear from Mr. Adams is not patronising lectures warning those in peace groups about the dangers of being manipulated, but a statement from him as the most prominent figure in the Provisional movement for more than a decade, announcing a total and unequivocal end to the Provo campaign. People are sickened by the soft-spoken hypocrisy of Gerry Adams, a man whose eloquence cannot stretch to a straight-forward condemnation of murder. Anyone who might be tempted to give credence to Adams' current talk of peace should bear in mind his words following the IRA murder of two building workers in 1988.  &ldquo;There is a war going on&rdquo;, he said &ldquo;and they took sides&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Northern Ireland is not just a security problem.  There are serious economic problems in Northern Ireland for which the British Government have serious responsibility and on which they must take action.  There are serious problems <Col N="73" /> in relation to the administration of justice and the operation of the courts and the police service, even though there have been significant advances in these areas. Anything we can do in this House to encourage the development of the economy in Northern Ireland, the introduction of a Bill of Rights in Northern Ireland, the development of a democratically devolved Government, we should do, because that is the path which will lead ultimately to peace and prosperity there.  The Dáil and the people of the Republic have a role to play as I outlined earlier, but perhaps the most important contribution we can make is to end our fascination once and for all with the rituals of death and instead address ourselves to and concern ourselves with the policies of life and place the co-operation of people on this island at the heart of our politics.  We should end our fascination and constant harking back to the whole question of territorial integrity or territorial unity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Without spending any of the valuable and too short time available to me on this very serious matter I am just saying, after my colleague has spoken, that there is nothing so self-righteous as a poacher turned bailiff.</P>
      <P>I will get on to the very pertinent issues before us.  We do not have to go back further than the imposition of Partition. Partition was imposed by the threat of a terrible bloody war and maintained by the blood of our people since then.  Anybody who talks here or elsewhere as if the intransigent Unionist attitude was on a par with nationalist aspirations should have his head examined.  This gives an importance to the intransigent Unionist position that is not in any way based on either fact or fair claim.  Neither is it true that those of us who wish to see our country put together again want to be rid of those who bear the name &ldquo;Unionist&rdquo;. Of course we do not.  I live amongst them. I represent them from my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only did Partition divide people and the farms of some of our people, it even divided the actual households, such was the stupidity of its application.  It <Col N="74" /> divided the province from which I come. Why was Donegal left out of Partition? Why was Cavan or Monaghan not included?  It was because, on a head count on a religious basis, it was found that it was not tenable and that the majority would not be in favour.  Therefore Partition was imposed by blood through blood and the threat of a bloody war and we have had it maintained, after the majority which it has enjoyed for the union was contrived by a count of heads, splitting houses, farms and the historic province of Ulster.  Since then it has been maintained by the most outlandish discriminations &mdash; job discrimination, housing discrimination and harassment by the alleged peacekeeping forces.  This is what is being talked about today as if it is something we should tolerate, should even say we have no further interest, other than as neighbours, by abandoning Articles 2 and 3.  We in this House do not have the right to abandon Articles 2 and 3.  That is the right of all the Irish people, North and South.</P>
    <P>The end of Partition should not come about only if and when the majority in the Six Counties decide.  The Irish people as a whole, and only they, have the right to decide.  We in this House, even with the full complement attending, do not fully represent all the people of the island because of Partition and therefore when we talk about giving up our claims to the territory of all of Ireland, we do not have that right, despite the fact that we have a Parliament and are elected democratically in our constituencies.</P>
    <P>Institutional violence is the root cause of the counter-violence and terrorism which has been the lot of the people in the North, not just since 1969.  Over the years since Partition was imposed there were uprisings and the people were beaten into the ground and out of sight. In those days we did not have television, there was not good radio coverage and the world did not know about it.  In 1969, and particularly in the seventies, it was the breaking down of the paper wall by virtue of television that really brought to the eyes of the world the chaos and the abomination of the little statelet of the <Col N="75" /> Six Counties.  Those are our counties and all the people in those Six Counties are as Irish as you, I or anybody else.  We must get around to the thought that Partition is, has been and will continue to be, the root cause of the terrorism which all of us deplore but cannot stop.  Let there be no doubt that it will not stop of its own volition while we have Partition.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the six counties south of the Border.  There is a great concern for the Nationalists, rightly, who are beleaguered in the Six Counties.  There is much concern about the Unionist or Loyalist people in the North.  What about the Nationalists, Loyalists &mdash; or whatever you like to call them &mdash; Catholic, Protestant, or covenanter, in the six counties south of the Border who have been divided from their friends and families, who have had their lands divided, and more recently have had their access roads blown up and cratered not by the terrorist but by the occupation forces, all because of the partition?  These are the people who sit daily and look at what has been erected in 1992 &mdash; the new steel gun towers, the turrets and the battlements, the like of which is not to be seen in any part of the world today.  This is their daily lot and we in this Parliament have never recognised that the counties south of the Border, immediately adjoining it, have had problems above and beyond any other problems that the rest of the counties have had.  No steps have ever been taken nor sympathy expressed regarding the deprivation suffered by the people of the six southern Border counties.  Talks about Articles 2 and 3 are talks about abandoning any claim or aspiration. When that goes, the Protestant people along the Border south of the line will have been finally abandoned.  They were betrayed as no other people were betrayed when Partition was instituted and the line drawn, leaving them separated from their natural brethern, the same as the rest of us in the Border counties.  Are we to say to them: &ldquo;Never is there a hope of reunification with your nearest and dearest across the line, with your co-religionists, the majority of <Col N="76" /> whom are in the North and a minority in the South&rdquo;.  Surely this is a matter to which some credence should be given. Let us stop waffling and making gestures and token offers to people such as Ken Maginnis, Peter Robinson, Ian Paisley or James Molyneaux.</P>

      <P>These people want a reason for not continuing talks.  This is the reason they have picked on and we, foolishly, are following the line that if we abandon Articles 2 and 3 the talks will continue, they will be all-embracing and we will reach a solution.  That is the greatest nonsense ever thought up.  It is being perpetrated through the media and is almost brainwashing our people into believing that if they can continue the talks with the full participation of the Paisleys, the Robinsions and the like, we will find a peaceful solution.  It is a nonsense.  It is merely something that has been thought up by the Unionist extremists to give them an excuse at any time to break off the talks because we will not say: &ldquo;here, keep the Six Counties, we are not concerned about them any more&rdquo;. We do not have the right to do it and it would be wrong of us to do it, even in a tactical way.</P>
      <P>Articles 2 and 3 are not the problem but rather section 75 of the Government of Ireland Act.  If the Government really want to make progress whether in the short or long term they, together with the British Government, must accept that a British withdrawal from this country is essential if we are ever to live in peace. That does not mean what many of the propagandists from the other element would say, that this is a method of driving the Protestants, Presbyterians, Unionists and Loyalists out of Ireland.  Far from it. The entire island would benefit greatly if we were united in our economy and in our entire work ethos.  We would be far better off in Ireland today if we were working together, as we would be doing if we were naturally put back together, as we were always meant to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This fight did not start when Partition <Col N="77" /> was imposed or as a result of 1916.  That was merely the emergence of the fight which had been going on and the disquiet of our people for 800 years.  To say that is of no great concern, that we should have these talks, that we should soften up Unionists extremists by agreeing to Articles 2 and 3 being replaced by some other form of words, is a lot of nonsense. To further enhance or strengthen our extradition laws is merely to give a sop to these people.  If we have any sense of justice or fair play we will realise as those of us who oppose extradition have believed all along, that you do not extradite a citizen of your jurisdiction into the jurisdiction of another country where they are not assured of getting a fair trial. We know that the administration of so-called justice has been so partisan over the years as to be sickening and is part and parcel of the subjugation of the Nationalist people of the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>The police and the British Army who are the peacekeepers, have been involved in a shoot-to-kill policy.  Let us remember Bloody Sunday.  We did not then have anything like the holocaust of shootings and deaths which we now have. How did that come about?  Why did it come about?  Is it not to ensure that it is instilled in the minds of the people that they are occupied and that the occupier is in control?</P>
    <P>Section 75 does not claim the territory or jurisdiction of the Six Counties on behalf of the Unionist or Loyalist people far from it.  It claims it on behalf of the UK Government.  The Unionists should understand that the claim in section 75 is not necessarily in their interests.</P>
    <P>People who have been accused of offences committed outside this State have been dealt with properly &mdash; and perhaps more than adequately &mdash; in our courts under the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act.  It cannot be said that they would be treated fairly in the jurisdiction to which they might be extradited.</P>
    <P>Extradition is merely tokenism and a kowtowing to the occupation of our country. The British Army do not find it wrong to shoot innocent people and, over the <Col N="78" /> years, some members of the police have co-operated with the Loyalist terrorists. Do we want this to continue?  A total of 95 per cent of the middle and top management of both public and private undertakings are Protestants.  That is not my figure, but that of the Fair Employment Agency.  That matter is under investigation in the European Parliament following which a report will be produced. Four out of every five cross-Border roads are closed, more than 80 per cent of our means of access across the Border.  Is this what we should expect in 1993, the year of open frontiers?  New towers, turrets and stockades have been built as a sop to the extreme Unionists and as an indication to the Nationalists of the Six Counties and those south of the Border that the British are in control and can see their territory from one big steel gun tower to the other, from Carlingford Lough to Lough Foyle.  Is that the position we want to see continue in Northern Ireland?  Is that what we would abandon by changing Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution?  I do not believe so. Brain washing or propaganda has been instigated outside the country, and taken up within the country, by those who claim that the majority of our people would support a change in Articles 2 and 3 in order that the talks can proceed.  The talks will not proceed just because of a change in Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution. Again, that would merely be seen by the Unionists as kowtowing and that we were not concerned about who was abandoned when partition was instituted &mdash; our Nationalist brethern in the North and many others who might not be described as Nationalists.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton made an all-embracing speech this morning.  He asked if the British withdrew from Northern Ireland would we be able to secure peace on the island of Ireland.  The two Governments should sit down together and deal with the root cause of the entire chaotic position in Northern Ireland rather than smothering over the effects of institutional violence, terrorism, destruction, fire and death.  Those atrocities are brought about by the root cause of the <Col N="79" /> problem, the partition of our country. Many years age I advocated to my colleagues in Government to try to get the British and Irish Governments to sit down together to prepare for the day they will go &mdash; and go they will some day. Deputy Bruton's question can only be truly answered then, but we must prepare for it.  We cannot have an unannounced withdrawal tomorrow morning.  There must be a declaration of intent to go.  But prior to that an ultimate plan on how matters will be dealt with in the immediate aftermath must be drawn up.  There would undoubtedly be trouble, but not the bloodbath that has been talked about. The atrocities of the past 20 years have been far worse than anything we might encounter if Britain declared it was pulling out of Northern Ireland and set a date for that.  At that stage Unionists, extremists and ordinary people would realise that they would have to live together or hang together.  When that day comes we can have real peace in Northern Ireland.  It would not necessarily mean that in the immediate future there would be one Parliament on this island.  There is room for various administrations. But we must get rid of the third partner in the bed, otherwise the partners will never be able to share the house, not to mention the bed.</P>

      <P>Today's discussion is long overdue.  There are far too few opportunities in this House for a real examination of issues such as those before us today.  That is not for want of a disposition on the part of Members.  Both Deputy John Bruton and the Tánaiste, for example, recently made very thoughtful <Col N="80" /> and thought-provoking addresses to the Irish Association.  Deputy Bruton's contribution this morning was in sharp contrast to the Taoiseach's dreary, cold and passionless attempt to patch together the shreds of erratic and contradictory Fianna Fáil policies over the past 40 years.  Much of the Taoisach's speech can be seen, and was designed to be, a pandering to ancient prejudice and an absolutely obdurate failure to give real passionate leadership in a major crisis for politics and civilisation on this island.</P>
      <P>It is part of the received wisdom that constitutional issues are at the heart of what we call the Northern Ireland problem. The Tánaiste put it rather elegantly when he addressed the Irish Association on 5 March last.  He said:</P>
      <P>The unresolved dilemmas which shaped the arrangements of the 1920s still cast their shadows across the political landscape in both parts of Ireland. </P>
      <P>Speaking on the failure of the last round of talks to reach agreement, he said:</P>
      <P>Potential agreement... did not crystallise because both sides felt politically vulnerable in the absence of agreement on the constitutional issue, which inexorably overrides all other issues for both sides in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>There can be very little room for disagreement with either of those statements. Later in the same address the Tánaiste went on to indicate that he suspects that:</P>
      <P>.... the debate so far on the constitutional aspects has been somewhat at cross-purposes. </P>
      <P>I have to say that in the Tánaiste's mouth, which up to last November was more accustomed to excoriation and issuing admonitions all round, that is monumentally an understatement.  Even in the context of the very careful orthodoxy of Iveagh House, it is still an under-statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This morning the Tánaiste showed a <Col N="81" /> glimmer of understanding of that problem without really analysing its implications. He said:</P>
    <P>The concentration on constitutional difficulties can obscure the progress that is possible on political and institutional questions, and on economic co-operation.  Even if only a limited understanding is possible on all constitutional issues at this time, it is still well worthwhile to seek agreements in areas where more unites us than divides us.</P>
    <P>That is a useful thought which should be followed up.</P>
    <P>The plain fact of the matter is that these constitutional aspects have remained unresolved for the past 72 years.  I am coming to the view that these aspects might well remain unresolved for some time in the future, possibly for as long again.  I suggest that we should consider leaving those issues unresolved for a time and concentrate our energies and imagination elsewhere, on other problems which are more capable of resolution in a time frame shorter than a generation or two.  I make that suggestion not because I underestimate in any way the crucial and central nature of the constitutional issues, but precisely because I understand how powerful are the emotions and convictions that lie behind the positions adopted on these constitutional issues.</P>
    <P>It is commonplace &mdash; and nonetheless commendable for all that &mdash; to say that it should be our ambition to recognise fully the legitimacy of the aspirations of each of the two traditions on this island. The trouble is that some of those aspirations are, quite simply, incompatible with one another, no matter how many or how sincere our expressions of understanding or how passionate our desire for reconciliation.</P>
    <P>The quintessential Nationalist aspiration is for a 32 county Republic.  The quintessential Unionist aspiration is to remain a part of the UK.  No amount of political ingenuity will allow those two aspirations to be fulfilled simultaneously. Even though we might recognise and <Col N="82" /> esteem each of these aspirations in its own context, we cannot hope to fulfil both of them simultaneously.  Wisdom may then dictate that we should recognise that the constitutional issues must remain unresolved for a time because the different aspirations cannot be fulfilled simultaneously, and fulfilling either one of them inevitably requires the other to be dashed.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, an imbalance in that the Nationalist aspiration is just that, an aspiration, and the Unionist aspiration we talk of is now a <i>de jure</i> situation, albeit an uneasy one, with that unease shared in varying degrees on all sides in Northern Ireland.  If a decision to leave those constitutional issues unresolved for a time requires any of us to make a constitutional affirmation of any kind, then that affirmation must be made.  The model and prefiguration for this is to be found in Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <P>No amount of violence or bloodshed can ensure that either one aspiration or the other can be fulfilled, because the more likely it seems that either group of gunmen will move nearer to its professed objective, the greater will be the revulsion its methods and promise give rise to among the greater number of those people who have a political conviction that is similar to the gunmen's declared objective.</P>
    <P>To what, then, should be turn our energies?  There is no lack of matters demanding action.  States exist to serve people.  In the democratic framework, political systems, government and administrative structures all exist to serve people.  They cannot effectively serve an ill-defined notion or ideal of nationhood if that notion or ideal is not common to all the people concerned.  Nationalists and Unionists in Northern Ireland have totally different, and equally vague, notions and ideals of nationhood.  No state, therefore, can serve these two concepts of nationhood equally.  It seems to me, however, that it is possible or that it should be possible to imagine and to construct a political system and an administrative system that serves all of the <Col N="83" /> people of Northern Ireland equally while explicitly recognising and admitting that some constitutional issues cannot for the time being be resolved.</P>
    <P>We should then ask ourselves: what do people need, and in what way do they want to be served?  This cannot be an exhaustive list as there is not time for this.  Nevertheless, I wish to refer to the most important needs people expect the State to fulfil.</P>
    <P>They first want the rule of law and the establishment of order.  They want to be able to live, work, worship and play in safety, free from the fear of arbitrary and random violence.  To have these things they need a police force that is integrated with the community and that is trusted by the community.  Over a great part of Northern Ireland those conditions do not exist.</P>
    <P>Paradoxically, the more the RUC organises itself to fight terrorists, the further away it gets from the life and trust of the community.  In turn, the further away it gets from the life and trust of the community, the less capable it is of understanding and dealing with the roots of terrorism.  Anyone who has been involved in talks with the RUC will know the truth of that statement.</P>
    <P>Over much of Northern Ireland members of the police force have either no links or very tenuous links with the communities they police &mdash; they neither live nor play there.  Over much of Northern Ireland there is nobody who is a member of the police force or who has a son or daughter who is a member of the police force.  This must change, and it must do so before the rule of law can be fully applied and order properly established. It is clear that the reverse has not worked.</P>
    <P>People need a decentralised local government system, in the sense in which we in this House understand it, to which they can relate, which they can trust and which has a substantial degree of autonomy and the power to meet their needs in a framework of normal political argument and choice.  This system should be based on secular and immediate needs <Col N="84" /> and requirements rather than on confessional and historical divisions.  I believe that that requirement is greater and more urgent in Northern Ireland than it is here, and it is already long overdue here.</P>
    <P>People need an administrative structure which is responsive and fair and which is perceived to be responsive and fair and it should be one which values all citizens equally in the framework of the job that it is given to do.  If it were grounded clearly in a clear bill of rights, I believe that it could be seen to do so. People need an educational system that is not burdened by the dilemmas of 72 years ago or by the religious values and antagonisms of 300 years ago and which is not warped by the bitterness, divisions and suspicions, religious, civil and political of the last 72 years.  These three needs which I have mentioned seem to be the principle and peculiar needs of the people of Northern Ireland.  There are, of course, many other needs which they share with communities all around the world and which, God knows, are difficult enough to meet adequately in the world of today.</P>
    <P>I cannot prescribe now how those needs will be met but I am convinced that the efforts to meet them are far more important and worthy of our attention than the unfulfillable aspirations on which we all too often concentrate.  To meet those needs will probably be the work of a generation.  I think that that will be time well spent.  If we can undertake that task I believe that we can, and should, leave the other aspirations, the constitutional issues, to a later generation of men and women in Northern Ireland. I believe that after a generation of the kind of work that I have suggested the people of Northern Ireland will make far wiser decisions about those issues and those aspirations, even if those decisions mean doing nothing about them even then, than we can possibly make, with the best will in the world, today.</P>
    <P>In trying to imagine a different framework for thinking about Northern Ireland, it is no part of my intention to denigrate work that has already been <Col N="85" /> done or to attack convictions and principles which are sincerely held and honestly expressed.  I say that, Sir, in the conviction that what we heard today from the Taoiseach was a speech that I have described as cold and passionless and without any commitment, and a speech from the Tánaiste that was in serious sharp contrast to his address to the Irish Association.  What he gave us today, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, was a very disappointing piece of ultra-careful Iveagh House diplomatic orthodoxy which is not what the situation calls for today.  I believe we have to move past that.  I am trying to find a way to make politics serve people rather than perpetuate the tragedies of history and I can do no better than to state again what Deputy John Bruton reiterated this morning &mdash; lives do come before constitutional theories.</P>
    <P>I neglected to say, Sir, at the beginning of my remarks that I wish to share my time with my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.  I am sure the House will have no objection.</P>

      <P>It is time to make a fresh start in seeking a solution to the problem of Northern Ireland.  In the past 24 years over 3,000 people have been killed and countless numbers have been maimed and wounded.  Various political and peace initiatives have been tried, so far without success.  A new approach is now necessary.  This is a good time to make that new beginning.  Following the appalling atrocities in England, there is now a tide of public opinion that not only supports a political solution but demands one.  It is, I believe, the bounden duty of all politicians on these islands to work <Col N="86" /> together to put that solution in place.  If we are genuinely seeking that solution, it is time also for all politicians to leave behind the exaltation of blood and soil over reason.  It is also time to leave behind the inflexibility of historically fixed positions.  It will be only if there is a shared generosity of spirit and a total commitment to peace and reconciliation that a compromise formula can be arrived at which is fair and reasonable.</P>
      <P>In the past there has been far too much emphasis on protecting the tactical position of all parties to these discussions. This protective tactical approach in some instances related to insecurity on the part of those involved and, in others, to unwillingness to compromise.  This unwillingness to compromise has, unfortunately, been related very often to narrow perceived political advantage and, even worse, to internal jockeying for power within parties.  It is important, therefore, that those who are unwilling to compromise be exposed and isolated at this stage.  This can only be done if those who are genuinely seeking a compromise solution are prepared to enter into discussions with a clear, open generosity of spirit and a clear willingness to agree to what must be seen by all as the essential ingredients of any settlement. While it is inevitable that the suspicion, distrust and insecurity will continue for some time, my hope is that the Irish Government will do everything possible to dispel these by the open, generous approach I am talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At least, that was my hope until this morning.  Rarely have I been in such despair as when I listened to the windy, rhetoric and retrospective justifications of the Taoiseach and Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party this morning.  I had genuinely allowed myself to hope that the latest attrocities, the efforts of peace people like Susan McHugh, and the public response to those efforts, must result in a fresh approach from the Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds.  Instead, we were treated to a lesson in historical revisionism and, even worse, we were served an empty diet of hollow sentiment. It is indeed ironic that the Taoiseach <Col N="87" /> concluded his remarks this morning with the words &ldquo;everyone must respond to the changing mood in the political landscape regarding the North of Ireland&rdquo;.  I know that, in the order of things, the Taoiseach did not write that himself but I assume that, having delivered it, he believes in the expression of view contained in that sentence.  Why, in the name of goodness, with the country gasping, hoping, praying for a solution could we not have some sense of hope, some sense of vision, some sense of direction from the Taoiseach, who is the lawfully elected leader of the Republic of Ireland?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach propagated a message of despair and hopelessness.  I understand the pressures coming from Fianna Fáil Party backbenchers and I understand the pressures coming from the back benches of the Labour Party, but surely the Taoiseach would rise above those in the context of the awful problems we face on this island.  By contrast, the approach of the Tánaiste, the Leader of the Labour Party, was at the very least fresh and imaginative.  I studied the Tánaiste's speech carefully, but there was no real substance that would give expression to the desire for peace and trigger a political response to the public hunger for reconciliation. The Tánaiste must realise that style without substance will achieve nothing.  I encourage the Tánaiste for the future, now that he has responsibility for Northern Ireland affairs, to shake off the caution and conservatism of his Government partners and match his undoubted desire for peace with real initiatives to achieve that peace.  It is often said that the problems of Northern Ireland are essentially political.  If so, we the politicians must all realise that we have been a failure in finding a political solution.</P>
    <P>In many ways the Republic has a strong position in the approach to finding a solution. We are an independent, sovereign State.  Fortunately, we have been spared the worst effects of the violence, and that is all the more reason for us to be generous in our approach and understanding of the insecurity of the Unionist <Col N="88" /> and, indeed, the Nationalist communities in Northern Ireland.  That must be our approach to political dialogue.  Needless to say, any political solution must be fully underpinned by agreement on justice and security matters and in the meantime, pending an agreement, there must be full security co-operation between the two Governments and confidence and trust must be built up between the security forces and the two communities in Northern Ireland.  The best prospect of ending violence is to have a political solution, preferably endorsed by referendum throughout the whole island of Ireland, and with that democratic legitimacy to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that the will of the people is respected.  I firmly believe in the old maxim <i>salus populi suprema lex esto,</i> that the safety of the people be the supreme law.</P>
    <P>The thugs and hoodlums of the Provisional IRA, the UFF and the other murder gangs must be confronted.  There can be absolutely no ambivalence on this point.  I am horrified and appalled at what I could only describe as ambivalence on the part of some politicians on this island, ambivalence principally on the issue of extradition.  The right noises are made following some awful atrocity such as the Warrington bombing and then the issue is forgotten.  It is absolutely clear that the 1987 extradition legislation as interpreted by the Supreme Court in 1990, three years ago, did not remove the political exemption to extradite for a substantial number of offences which would be ordinarily considered to be part of the paramilitary stock in trade. Offences such as murder &mdash; yes, murder &mdash; use of non-automatic firearms, possession of explosives and possession of firearms are not offences specifically declared in the 1987 legislation to be outside the scope of the definition of a political offence.  It was assumed at the time that following the 1984 Shannon decision in the courts political exemption would apply only if the accused was &ldquo;at the relevant time engaged directly or indirectly in what reasonable civilised people would regard as political <Col N="89" /> activity&rdquo;.  The 1990 Finucane decision expressly allowed that political exemption could apply to politically motivated offences of violence.  Hence, glaring loopholes in our extradition laws have been obvious for more than three years.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party believes that the best way to combat international terrorism is through a European framework of law that crosses national boundaries. Such framework should be combined with a European system of rights to protect the innocent.  At national level the Fine Gael Party demands that the Government introduce a Bill to amend the 1987 extradition legislation. It is completely unacceptable that the Fianna Fáil/Labour Government should talk about further delay in this regard.  In reply to a parliamentary question I tabled on Tuesday last, the Minister for Justice once again repeated that work on the legislation was under way in her Department. I remind the Minister and the Government that almost three years ago and immediately after the Fine Gael Party carefully drafted an amending Bill designed to close the obvious loopholes. There is a precedent for amending legislation and, as I had professional help in drafting the Bill to which I refer, my Bill could be taken in its entirety.</P>
    <P>Today we need a Government commitment that will introduce and pass into law a Bill to amend the law on extradition so as to remove from the scope of political exemption a range of offences relating to the use and possession of firearms and explosives and offences of violence against the person.  There can be no scope whatsoever for ambivalence on the issue of extradition and there should be no question of using it as a bargaining point in the Northern Ireland talks.  The legislation should be amended because such an amendment is right in itself.  I wish to make it clear that, following the failure of the previous Government to take action on this front, unless I have a commitment from the present Government to introduce such amending legislation before the resumption of the Dáil and to pass that legislation before the resumption of the Dáil and to pass that legislation <Col N="90" /> into law in the next session, I shall on behalf of the Fine Gael Party re-introduce my Private Member's Bill to close the loopholes in the extradition legislation and I will move same and put it to a vote after Easter.</P>
    <P>I also demand that the Goverment be absolutely unequivocal in relation to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  It is inconceivable in relation to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  It is inconceivable that there will be an overall solution without an amendment to those two Articles. Nobody is calling for the deletion of those Articles, which is the point on which confusion is deliberately being created.  All that is being sought is amendment to the Articles to conform their aspirational nature.  The position of those who will not give a clear commitment in this regard in the context of an overall settlement is just as irrational and just as unhelpful as the position of those who would make it a precondition to talking at all.  Again, I believe that there is no room for ambivalence on this issue and the Government should now clear up present ambiguities in this regard.</P>
    <P>Having cleared up the Government's ambivalent position by prompt action in closing the extradition loopholes and by giving a clear commitment to amend Articles 2 and 3 as part of an overall settlement, the Government should be in a strong position, genuinely seeking to re-open Northern Ireland talks.  I feel that if there is not clear evidence of such an open, generous approach, rather than the empty rhetoric we heard from the Taoiseach this morning, those who do not wish such talks to happen or hope that such talks would fail will have their way and the awful violence that has afflicted our island for so long will continue indefinitely.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I very much welcome this opportunity to contribute to the statements on Northern Ireland.  It is essential that the House <Col N="91" /> engage in regular debate on matters relating to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I wish to express disappointment with some aspects of Opposition contributions. Deputy John Bruton came very close to calling for internment.  The Government does not believe that that would be helpful.  By contrast, a good part of the contribution made by Deputy Dukes was both positive and supportive. I regret deeply that Deputy Michael McDowell should use this occasion to make a strong personalised attack on the Taoiseach by completely misrepresenting what the Taoiseach said.  Deputy McDowell tried to indicate that there was a gulf between the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, while the contributions made by both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste were based on the Programme for a Partnership Government and did not deviate in any way from the programme.  Of coure, attempting to drive a wedge between two parties in a coalition Government is one of the oldest ploys in the Opposition book.  The contribution made by Deputy McDowell was charaterised by a complete lack of concern or interest in Northern Nationalists.  As for the interests of the Progressive Democrats in Unionists, the level of that was shown last autumn, when neither of the two senior Progressive Democrat Cabinet Ministers was able to give priority to the historic meeting with Unionists in Dublin Castle.  Deputy McDowell is quite wrong if he believes that his views represent the majority of opinion in this country.  Deputy De Rossa said it all in the first statement of his speech; he said that the removal of the Border &mdash; in other words, Irish unity &mdash; was neither desirable or feasible.</P>
    <P>The timing of this debate has been set by the huge wave of public reaction in this state to the recent spate of cruel, senseless, murders in Warrington and Castlerock. I join with all right-minded people in condemning these savage murders. These awful atrocities have unleashed among the people of this state and elsewhere a new tide of revulsion at paramilitary <Col N="92" /> violence.  In particular, the murder of the two young children, Johathan Ball and Tim Parry in Warrington, has reawakened basic human feelings in many people which, understandably, have for some time been numbed by the day-in, day-out accounts of shootings, bombings and other terrorist acts which we hear and read in the media.</P>
    <P>The murder by the Provisional IRA of two innocent children has brough to mind the deaths of 121 &mdash; I repeat 121 &mdash; other children in Northern Ireland since the beginning of the troubles.  The wave of sympathy which has followed the murders has reminded us of the similar public grief which followed the death of the Maguire children in 1976 and led to the emergence of the peace movement which attracted such tremendous support North and South and also in Britain.</P>
    <P>Since the deaths of the children in Warrington we have witnessed the advent of a new peace initiative in Dublin which has been born of the outrage felt by so many people at the horror of Warrington, Castlerock and other terrorist crimes. The objective of this movement would appear to be to send a message to the terrorists of all colours that they must lay down their arms and give way to dialogue in the interest of achieving a lasting peace.  The people who have organised the peace meetings in Trinity College and O'Connell Street are not being used &mdash; as has been suggested from one quarter &mdash; in a cynical attempt to decry any particular paramilitary persuasion.</P>
    <P>The real cynics are those who attempt to minimise the sincerity and impact of the peace movement by suggesting that those involved are simply being used. The reality is that the genuine people involved are opposed to all forms of terrorism and are motivated solely by a desire for peace.  For my part, I have been deeply impressed by the sincerity of their words and actions.  I would like to assure them that I will do all in my power to support their call and strive for the peace which they and so many people here, in Northern Ireland and in Britain want to be a reality. <Col N="93" /> As Minister for Justice I have responsibility for matters relating to law and order and the security of the State.  This responsibility embraces not only policy on internal security to safeguard the institutions of this State and the lives and property of its citizens, but also policy on security co-operation with other Governments to enable us to work together with them for the greater security of all our citizens.</P>
    <P>The security policy of successive Irish Governments has been to oppose all forms of terrorism, whether perpetrated within the State or elsewhere.  There is no ambivalence in our attitude to terrorism. There is no tacit support here for those who do not respect the rule of law.  There is no succour or shelter here for those who commit violent acts in pursuit of their objectives.  We do not turn a blind eye to evidence against those who plan, assist, or carry out terrorist actions.  We deplore paramilitary bomb and gun attacks and do all in our power to apprehend and convict those responsible.  Our policy is entirely clear.  We do not deviate in any way in the practical expression of that policy.</P>
    <P>The principal terrorist threat to this State and its citizens is posed by the Provisional IRA.  It would be foolish in the extreme for us to think that the violence of the PIRA is directed solely at Northern Ireland and Britain and that this State does not feature on the Provisional's agenda.  Sadly, the death toll from terrorism on this island &mdash; though predominantly made up of fatalities in Northern Ireland &mdash; also includes members of our security forces and civilians from this State.  The Loyalist paramilitary organisations, the UVF and UFF, also have a long history of murderous involvement.  The upsurge of Loyalist paramilitary violence over the past year or so is the source of grave concern and is a matter which has been the subject of specific discussion at Anglo-Irish Conference meetings.  It is a matter which I discuss internally on a regular basis with the Garda Commissioner.  I would like to assure the House that it is an issue which <Col N="94" /> will continue to have my constant attention and that of the Government.</P>
    <P>The reality is that terrorists on both sides of the political divide match each other &mdash; indeed seem to vie with each other &mdash; in the viciousness and ruthlessness of their activities.  The terrorist campaigns of both sides must be met with a determined resolve to defeat them. There is no such thing as a neutral position where terrorism is concerned.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that I should put on record the actions taken by this Government and its predecessors which give expression to our policy of combatting terrorism.  The following facts illustrate the extent of the Government's commitment to the defeat of terrorism:</P>
    <P>Against the background of a difficult economic situation and an ever-increasing need to restrict public expenditure, the Government has continued to provide the costly Garda and other resources necessary to combat terrorism.  The current annual cost to this State of additional security arising out of the Northern Ireland situation amounts to more than £200 million.  This is a very considerable commitment for a relatively small economy such as ours and is a serious burden on our public finances at a time when over 300,000 of our people are out of work.  As the Taoiseach said this morning in comparative terms our <i>per capita</i> expenditure on this additional security amounts to three times that of the United Kingdom.  In all, the violence of the PIRA and other paramilitary organisations has cost this country about £2.5 billion pounds since the beginning of the troubles.  I mention these cost statistics, not to score points of comparison or to imply that Irish Governments have begrudgingly spent money to protect lives, but rather to demonstrate the extent to which terrorism has robbed this country of money which could have been put to more productive use in creating employment and livelihoods for so many of our people.  This is an aspect of terrorism which does not always come to mind but which has a direct and damaging impact on the quality of life in our country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="95" /> Since 1970 close on 1,000 extra gardai/ have been assigned to the Border divisions such that Garda strength in those divisions is more than double the 1970 level.  At the same time there has also been a doubling in the number of gardai dedicated to anti-terrorist work within the Garda Síochána as a whole.  This represents an enormous commitment against a background where resources are scarce and there is concern about the nature and incidence of non-paramilitary crime.</P>
    <P>Since 1972 more than 1,500 persons have been convicted in the Special Criminal Court of subversive-related offences. Since 1985 the Garda Síochána has recovered 1,954 firearms, 350,000 rounds of ammunition and 16,550 lbs of explosives, including 790 lbs of the deadly semtex explosive.  Most of the arms and explosives have been recovered in the course of special search operations, such as &ldquo;Operation Mallard&rdquo; in 1988, the highly successful &ldquo;Operation Silo&rdquo; last year and the recent &mdash; and very significant &mdash; operation at Kilcock in which a large consignment of explosives and bomb-making material were recovered.</P>
    <P>These facts give lie to any suggestion that this State is in any way &ldquo;soft&rdquo; on terrorism or that our security forces are not doing all in their power to bring terrorists to justice.  I would remind those who are apt from time to time to suggest that terrorist suspects are to be seen openly in this jurisdiction that, under the rule of law, suspicion alone is not sufficient to convict a person of a criminal offence either in this jurisdiction, in Northern Ireland or in Britain.  The essential element required is evidence to prove that a suspect has committed an offence.  The Garda Síochána are well aware of their powers to arrest and charge terrorist suspects.  They do not lack the resources to do so.  They are, however, much more aware than the occasional alarmist commentator that, in the absence of evidence likely to convict, the arrest and charging of terrorist suspects can provide a source of propaganda to the terrorists on their release, which is certainly a result to be avoided.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="96" /> I want to turn now to security co-operation. Article 9 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement provides a framework for developing and reviewing co-operation between the security forces North and South in combating the terrorist threat. Security co-operation matters are included on the agenda of every meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference and very substantial progress has been made on security co-operation through the medium of the Conference.  Indeed, I would have little hesitation in saying that the current climate of security co-operation is at an all-time high &mdash; a view which is shared by both the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, and the Minister with responsibility for security in Northern Ireland, Mr. Michael Mates, who have made public statements to this effect.</P>
    <P>Security co-operation is, of course, a two-way process.  Both Governments decide on the approach they wish to take to security issues in their separate jurisdictions, but they rely on co-operation with one another to help develop and enhance the effectiveness of their respective security efforts.  We co-operate with the British Government in helping to prevent and detect terrorist crimes in Northern Ireland and Britain.  In return we receive similar co-operation from the British side which assists us in combating the terrorist threat to this State.  Untimately, security co-operation is all about protecting lives and property and ensuring that the security resources available to both Governments are used in the most effective way possible in achieving our common aim of defeating terrorism.</P>
    <P>Legal co-operation is another important element in the fight against serious crime and terrorism on these islands.  Successive Governments have sought to ensure that the legal means are available to respond to the problem of fugitive offenders.  This Government will ensure that that continues to be the case.  To that end I propose to bring proposals to Government in relation to amending legislation in the area of extradition as a matter of priority.  That legislation will have as its main purpose an amendment <Col N="97" /> of the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, with a view to further clarifying the circumstances in which offences are excluded from the political offence exception.  In that way it will deal, among other things, with the issues raised by the judgments of the Supreme Court in the <i>Magee, McKee</i> and <i>Sloan</i> cases.  The commitment made by the former Government in that regard will thus be given effect, contrary to what some of the other side have attempted to suggest in recent days.  That should already have been clear.  It does no service for anybody when groundless suspicions are raised to the effect that the Government's commitment in this regard is less than sincere.</P>

      <P>I have already stated, in response to questions from Deputy Harney on 17 February, that I would be proceeding with this legislation. It should also have been clear from the joint statements issued after the meetings of the Anglo-Irish Conference held on 3 February and 23 March that this is the Government's intention.  Against that background I regret the attempts made in recent days to suggest otherwise.  To imply, especially in the wake of the tragic events of last week, that there is lack of commitment on the part of the Irish Government to tackle terrorism with every means at its disposal not only plays into the hands of the tabloid press abroad and causes great unease among the vast majority of decent, hard-working people here and in our neighbouring island, but it is also grossly misleading.</P>

      <P>I cannot, either, allow to go unchallenged the statement made on Tuesday by the Leader of the Opposition on the Order of Business &mdash; which I hope he will take the opportunity of correcting now &mdash; when he sought to convey a most misleading impression about the State's attitude to the extradition of terrorists.  He said:</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that a major newspaper last Sunday named four key IRA personnel, including the person allegedly directing their bombing campaign in England, as living openly in this State, will the Taoiseach state when exactly the promised legislation will be introduced? </P>
      <P>That statement creates the clear impression that but for defects in our extradition law these people could be extradited to Britain.  That impression is totally wrong.  While I cannot, for obvious legal reasons, go into the position in relation to the named individuals, I can and must point to the realities.</P>
      <P>The reality is that the means are there which ensure that persons who may be &ldquo;wanted&rdquo; in Northern Ireland or Britain for serious offences are amenable to justice. Evidence to warrant the institution of proceedings must, of course, first exist, the but, where that evidence does exist, the record shows that the procedures which are there can be successfully used to tackle the problem of fugitive offenders accused of terrorist-type offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extradition arrangements we operate with Britain and Northern Ireland provide the means by which a person can be returned to the jurisdiction in which the offence has been committed.  The simplified backing of warrants procedure which applies to those jurisdictions means that Northern Ireland and Britain have a special status in the Irish extradition code.  Those arrangements predate <Col N="99" /> the present campaign of violence and have already been strengthened in recent years &mdash; most notably by way of the legislation enacted in 1987 &mdash; in response to it.  The Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, placed restrictions on the political offence exception and enabled Ireland to ratify the convention without recourse to a reservation &mdash; one of only eight countries out of a total of 21 countries which have ratified the convention to have done so.  The safeguards introduced by the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, ensured that those arrangements would continue to inspire public confidence.</P>
    <P>Our response to the campaign of violence in Northern Ireland has also involved adopting, on occasion, approaches other than extradition to deal with fugitive offenders.  Our law provides for the possibility of persons who are alleged to have committed serious crimes in Northern Ireland and who are found in this jurisdiction being brought to trial here.  That is the provision for extra-territorial trial contained in the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976.  UK legislation provides for the corresponding situation and allows the trial of persons in Northern Ireland for offences committed in this jurisdiction.  Extra-territorial jurisdiction exists more generally in relation to certain explosives offences.</P>
    <P>There is no question therefore of this State providing a safe haven for persons wanted for terrorist-type crimes committed in Northern Ireland or Britain. The Government hopes that recourse will continue to be made to both extradition and extra-territorial trial in appropriate cases and will, as I have already indicated, improve them by legislative change where that is necessary and appropriate.</P>

      <P>This debate follows closely on a further series of terrorist outrages and deaths both in Northern Ireland and Britain.  I have already <Col N="100" /> referred to those events in an earlier part of my speech.  The impact which those events has had on the public on both sides of the Irish Sea is also clear from the manner in which so many people have in different ways sought to express their solidarity with the suffering of those directly affected.  The great mass of public opinion is now demanding of the terrorists on both sides that they should cease their campaigns of terror and lay down their arms.</P>
      <P>What should now be clear to us as politicians is that it is no longer enough simply to condemn the violence perpetrated by the minority who engage in terrorism on both sides or share in the sense of public outrage and revulsion at the slaughter by them of the innocent. Nor is it enough to say that we have committed, and will continue to commit, the maximum amount of resources at our disposal in terms of security and legal co-operation to deal with the problem.</P>
      <P>It is now recognised on all sides that security measures alone will never provide an answer to the extremely difficult and complex issues which underlie the Northern Ireland problem.  The key to a lasting solution lies in dialogue and in compromise.  The most important requirement at this point is to get the constitutional parties back to the negotiation table &mdash; to talk and continue to talk until, together, we find the answers which the people of these islands so badly want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have mentioned the need for compromise; that is a crucial point.  To suggest that it is a matter of taking the agenda, or an element of the agenda of one side or the other and running with it, so to speak, would not, as some appear to suggest, be an act of generosity but one of folly.  It is folly because it tends to encourage those of less thoughtful disposition to believe that it is simply a matter of securing victory, or a series of victories, on particular issues for their own side rather than considering what compromise might be necessary and possible to meet the legitimate concerns of the other side.  It is only by encouraging both sides to look at the prospects for <Col N="101" /> matching compromise that we will arrive at a comprehensive settlement likely to meet the very deep concerns of the greatest possible number.  It is only by means of a comprehensive settlement that each side can show that they truly understand and respect the separate identity of the other and that they genuinely recognise the legitimacy of their aspirations.</P>
    <P>The notion of victory or partial victory for one side over the other, therefore, has no part to play in terms of finding a solution and any attempt to proceed in that way would simply guarantee the perpetuation of the sense of injustice and lack of balance which is the very seed bed on which terrorism thrives.</P>
    <P>While it is of course argued that the more shades of opinion that are reflected in the negotiating process, the better the prospects of a satisfactory result, the reality is that some, by their actions and by their support for violence, continue to exclude themselves from the process, despite the fact that they know full well that a change of policy would open the way for different possibilities.</P>
    <P>It will, I hope, prove possible to resume the talks process soon.  That is what the public throughout these islands demand of the politicians on all sides. The climate in which those talks take place and the prospect of a successful conclusion would be greatly enhanced if those engaged in terrorism were to desist from their campaigns of violence.  Our message to those who engage in violence should be the same as that of the people &mdash; on both sides of the Border and in Britain &mdash; who have acted and spoken of their desire for peace in recent days and weeks: stop and stop now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for agreeing to share her time with me. Almost a quarter of a century ago the first big civil rights march took place in Derry when thousands of Catholics, joined by many of their Protestant neighbours, walked through the streets of their native city to demand what all right thinking people would regard as fair play; nothing more, nothing less.  Their demonstration was a dignified one without <Col N="102" /> any aggressive intent.  Unfortunately, the Stormont authorities were so paranoid that they regarded this simple plea as a declaration of war and responded accordingly.</P>
      <P>The television cameras recorded the battering of defenceless people by the police and audiences in Britain were appalled that this could happen in the United Kingdom.  Indeed, many of them were surprised to learn that Northern Ireland was part of the United Kingdom, such as the manner in which Westminster had allowed Stormont go get on with its own business unhindered.</P>
      <P>I happen to live just a few a miles from Derry and I believe that if the civil rights movement had been allowed to continue as planned history would have taken a much more productive course and we would have been spared almost 24 years of slaughter and destruction.</P>
      <P>The goodwill generated by Seán Lemass and Terence O'Neill was replaced by an ever-growing fear and suspicion. Twelve months after the 1968 march we witnessed the flight of hundreds of refugees from Derry into Donegal in fear of their lives.  The lack of sanity in official circles drove the two communities back into their trenches. Passive resistance is something which requires enormous courage and patience but it has been shown to be one of mankind's most powerful weapons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the saddest thing that happened was the fact that a movement with huge potential for good was eventually hijacked by the Provos and we are now too painfully aware of what this led to. What was ostensibly set up to defend Nationalists in their ghettos has become one of the most cynical and hated terrorist groups on earth.  They have the gall to claim that they have some sort of mandate from the Irish nation.  They have no such mandate.  Successive elections have clearly nailed this lie.  They have caused Irish people throughout the world to hang their heads in shame.  I trust that the present peace campaign will not allow itself to be cynically used by the men of violence for their own ends.  Gerry Adams's response is that to condemn <Col N="103" /> violence is to indulge in platitudes.  It is surely not a platitude to express horror and condemnation at the sight of little children being blown to pieces as some part of a holy war.</P>
    <P>The mirror image of the Provos is the UVF, whose activities are marginally more reprehensible, if that is possible. From these two groups we have just witnessed atrocities which no cause can justify &mdash; the slaughter of innocent children in Warrington by the Provos and the wanton sectarian murder of Catholics by the UVF at Castlerock.  Ethnic cleansing is alive and well in Northern Ireland and the perpetrators did not need instruction from the Serbians or anybody else.  In the words of Susan McHugh, &ldquo;It is time to call a halt: enough is enough&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The question is where we go from here. We in this House are the freely elected representatives of our people on this side of the Border.  It is to be noted that no representative of the Provos has succeeded in being elected, either as an abstentionist or anything else.</P>
    <P>We have a grave responsibility in this debate in the type of language we use.  In my opening remarks I have tried to put on record the plain historical facts of recent years.  I hope I have given a fair account of events and I urge the House strongly to refrain from pointless recrimination. It is time we looked to the future. We should only refer to past events so that we might learn something to our benefit, and that includes our mistakes. I am certain that our sense of guilt for what has happened is not exclusive to any one side.  We should not join the people in glasshouses.  Where is the logic in accusing the Unionists of intransigence if we wrap the Green flag around us and shout &ldquo;no surrender&rdquo;.  If we are serious about ending this torment we must face the fact squarely that there has to be give and take on all sides.  Compromise is not a dirty word if it means that both traditions can offer some hope to their children and grandchildren that they can live side by side in harmony, peace and in some degree of prosperity.  We must aim for nothing less.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="104" /> Many people in Britain and elsewhere have a misguided belief that this is a religious conflict.  Nothing could be further from the truth to suggest this is very close to blasphemy.  Are we expected to believe for a moment that the perpetrators of Warrington or Castlerock went on their knees to ask for God's blessing for what they were about to do? I think not.  By a cruel accident of fate the Plantation of Ulster left us with two communities of different Christian denominations.  Had they a common religion, one or the other, they would probably have merged long ago with some common identity.  The present conflict derives from a population which eventually may be split evenly between those who passionately wish to remain Irish and those who see themselves attached to the land of their ancestors in Britain.</P>
    <P>The people who live in Northern Ireland are not responsible for what happened 300 years ago and neither side can be coerced into being what they are not. My passionate hope is that one day the goal of the Presbyterian leaders of the United Irishmen will be achieved and that Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter will acknowledge that they are Irish, be they Anglo-Irish, Scots-Irish or native-Irish.</P>
    <P>However, it is quite evident that this happy day is not around the corner and, short of driving all Unionists or all Nationalists from their homes, there is only one course to take.  It should not be outside the bounds of human ingenuity to come up with a solution which can accommodate both traditions.  A few days ago an opinion poll in Britain indicated that the majority of people there want to withdraw altogether from Ireland.  That might sound to some people like an instant solution to all our problems but we should remember that Britain withdrew from a few other countries around the world over the years and left behind them a mess that has not been cleared up yet.  From Sir Patrick Mayhew's recent remarks it would appear that this fact is uppermost in the minds of the present British Government. <Col N="105" /> Regardless of what Britain may decide to do, either in the short or long term, the fact remains that the people of this island must learn to come to terms with each other.  Otherwise the word &ldquo;united&rdquo; will have very little meaning.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of speculation recently about the attitude of the Taoiseach to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution. It will be remembered that before last year's talks got under way he clearly stated that, as far as he was concerned, everything was on the table, including the Government of Ireland Act, and that, like all the other parties to the talks, he agreed that there should be no pre-conditions.  I can find absolutely nothing in what the Taoiseach has said in the meantime which would suggest that he would support any move to change Articles 2 and 3 in advance of an ultimate agreement and his speech today has further confirmed that.  I am certainly quite happy to take him at his word.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the Unionist party is not really serious in imposing any kind of pre-conditions.  It would be equally valid for the Taoiseach to demand the repeal of the Government of Ireland Act before allowing talks to proceed.  Anyone who sends out messages like this is merely stating that he has no intention of allowing any talks to take place in the sure knowledge that these demands are totally unrealistic.  In view of recent events the public would impose a very harsh judgment indeed on those of either side who are seen to stand in the way of meaningful talks.  I hope that anyone who is tempted to adopt this course will have second thoughts.</P>
    <P>We should all remember that on this occasion no solution can be imposed on the people on either side of the Border by any politician or set of politicians.  It has been clearly stated that any agreement must be submitted to the people on both sides for approval or rejection.  At this stage I cannot see what anyone on any side has to fear.  Meanwhile I suggest to Deputies that we should refrain from fighting among ourselves over spurious notions about the likelihood of some sort of betrayal.  This is simply not possible <Col N="106" /> in the circumstances.  Instead we should bend all our efforts towards achieving an agreement which can command support in both parts of Ireland.  The alternative is too horrible to contemplate.</P>
    <P>I have enough knowledge of Northern Ireland to be convinced that the vast majority who live there are the salt of the earth.  Any apparent support that Unionists have, as indicated this morning, for Loyalist violence comes from the fears similar to those present in the Nationalist community.  These people are well capable of being generous to each other if they are afforded the climate that allows them to do so.  Politicians, North and South, can make a huge contribution to creating such a climate if we simply offer the hand of friendship to each other and make an effort to refrain from offensive language.  It can be very tempting to play to the gallery by shouting the same sterile cliches that have always proved to be counter-productive but which are calculated to raise a cheer from those who never think clearly about anything.  It has been said that Ireland has too much religion and not enough Christianity. Charity was regarded by Christ as the greatest of virtues.  The truth is that if all the Christians of Ireland, of whatever denomination, were to practice charity we would never harm, let alone kill, each other.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would remind the House that it is our obligation to address the paramilitaries who claim to act on our behalf. It is up to Unionists to deal with the so-called Loyalist gunmen.  For our part, it was highly significant that last Sunday's massive demonstration for peace took place at the GPO.  I am sure that there are at least some people among the Provos who genuinely feel that they are part of a noble crusade.  I would ask them to go inside the GPO and read again the words in the Easter Proclamation which called upon citizens never to dishonour the Republic by cowardice or inhumanity. How can anyone who claims to follow in the footsteps of the men who wrote those words possibly seek to justify Bloody Friday, Darkley, Enniskillen and now <Col N="107" /> Warrington?  Surely the time has come to call a halt.</P>

      <P>I listened with great interest to the contributions on this very vital and important issue of Northern Ireland.  It was refreshing and encouraging to hear the speeches of Members, particularly those from this side of the House.  Their speeches demonstated a breadth of vision, compassion and sympathy and this House must send these qualities forward as signals if we are to tackle in a constructive and new way the dreadful problem that is Northern Ireland.  Unfortunately, not all speakers showed those qualities.  Some of them indicated by their words that they still hold the attitudes of the seventies and eighties.  We must recognise that if the problem is to be tackled, and the horrible cycle of violence resolved, we will have to look at Northern Ireland in a new light and be prepared for new departures.  We are continually asking those on the other side of the divide to be brave enough to change their opinions and old hardened attitudes in order to make progress.  We must be willing to do the same.</P>
      <P>Northern Ireland is the defining issue in Irish politics.  Other issues, be they issues of social or economic policy, are obviously vital but Northern Ireland underpins all of them.  If politicians are unwilling to be compassionate, reasonable, brave and daring in relation to Northern policy we will equally be unwilling to react to the other problems.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 28 together.  Following is a tabular statement setting out the roads and environmental projects in respect of which Cohesion Fund assistance is being sought.  The individual projects have been selected on the basis of various criteria, including the social, economic and environmental benefits involved.  Projects for the period 1994 to 1999 will be included in the National Development Plan, which is being compiled at present. As indicated in the reply to Question No. 168 on 9 March 1993, I will not be in a position to confirm the projects to be part-funded by the Cohesion Fund in 1993 until the 1993 programme is approved at EC level.</P>

      <P>This year the allocation from the Cohesion Fund amounts to <Col N="110" /> about £120 million in total.  In order to get the maximum possible draw-down for 1993 we must proceed at full speed. About £18 million of that money will go to my Department to be used for transport and environmental projects. Examinations have to be undertaken. The cost-benefit analysis which was necessary has been completed in the context of road projects and is in the process of completion in relation to environmental projects.  Consideration will be given in the next couple of weeks as to who will be consulted in relation to the national plan.  This is not a matter on which wider-ranging consultation could have been contemplated within the timescale for 1993.</P>

      <P>When does the Minister envisage a start on some of the Cohesion Fund projects in view of the fact that the Maastricht Treaty has not yet been ratified by all 12 member states?  Perhaps the Minister will outline the procedure by which we will proceed on completion of ratification of the Treaty.  The Minister mentioned the question of cost-benefit analysis.  Will he indicate whether environmental impact assessments will be required for all the projects carried out under the Cohesion Fund?</P>

      <P>It would be impossible at this stage to say whether environmental impact assessments will be necessary in all projects but they will certainly be necessary, and have been conducted, in quite a number of the schemes that have been considered for assistance under the Cohesion Fund this year.  Secondary treatment projects and major motorway schemes will be subject to environmental impact assessments.  In answer to the earlier question, there is a financial instrument invoked by the Commission which enables us to draw down EC funds ahead of ratification of the Maastricht Treaty by the last two members of the Community.  Therefore there is no problem in the drawing down of funds for 1993.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The EC Environment Council of 22-23 March 1993 took note of a progress report from COREPER on the draft Directive on the Incineration of Hazardous Wastes.  Because of time constraints, there was virtually no substantive discussion by Council of the proposal, and COREPER is to continue examination of it.  Ireland's general position on the proposal is to support the imposition of strict controls on hazardous waste incineration, while maintaining some reserve on whether the draft Directive, in its current form, can suitably address clinical as well as industrial wastes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister tell the House what his view is on the draft Directive? Do we support it or have we such reservations that in its present form we will not be able to support it?  I would like to know how the draft Directive will marry with a national waste policy from the Minister's Department.  What are the Minister's views on this matter?  Does Ireland support the proposals to date and, if not, in what areas are there reservations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We can safely welcome the overall parameters contained in the <Col N="112" /> Directive.  The substance of what is involved needs to be debated at COREPER level.  We have to take a reserve position in some areas, for example, in relation to clinical waste.  There are about 150 incinerators dealing with hospital, clinical and infectious waste, which is not a very satisfactory system.  It is not clear whether all countries wish to manage that element of waste in concert with this Directive, and that matter will have to be teased out.  I would very much welcome, particularly for a country as small as Ireland, an arrangement whereby all hazardous waste could be managed in a single unit as distinct from the quite dispersed and dangerous system in operation at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister what is the state of play in relation to the selection of a single site for a national toxic dump?  Will he outline the action taken heretofore in relation to the selection of such a dump?  I would also like to know how the Council of Ministers will handle the whole issue of incineration of hazardous waste.  For example, will it be on the June agenda and will it be progressed from there fairly quickly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I will begin by thanking Deputy Doyle for what seems to be a non-hysterical question in relation to this whole matter.  I welcome her to her new post and I hope she will have a very long sojourn in that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very often incineration is considered as the only way of solving the problem of hazardous waste.  In the context of support for recycling, legislation on air and water pollution and the various controls put in place in this regard, incineration has to be considered as one element in the complex management of waste.  First, we have to improve considerably on the system that has been in operation up to now.  It is difficult to put a timescale on the solving of this problem.  At present there is a derogation on the export of waste to Finland, France and the UK.  The Community is moving much closer to a self-sufficiency regime and it will not be possible in the long term <Col N="113" /> to continue transferring our problems elsewhere.  There is no scientific or technological advance of which I am aware to convince me that we will not have problems of that kind, even with technological advances in recycling and controls. We have to solve our problems in this country.  I would not like to suggest a timescale.  There is a clear need for more open debate and involvement.  I hope to have a conference later this year, perhaps in the summer, to broaden this question so that we can reach consensus as to how it can be answered, without ducking it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister support a voluntary or a compulsory eco-audit scheme?  Does the Minister see a time lag before there can be any compulsion in relation to environmental audits in general? Are we concerned about competitiveness if all our markets do not move together in establishing a compulsory environment auditing scheme? Does the Minister feel that it is in the interests of businesses here to adopt fairly quickly the principles involved in this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Eco-auditing is a management tool which integrates environmental considerations into the management process.  There is a lot of momentum behind this in the Community at present.  It is vitally important that we have regulations which give us the capacity to judge objectively companies that are using this as a marketing arm.  I support a voluntary system.  It would not be possible to move to mandatory systems <Col N="114" /> immediately.  We need to put in place the criteria to be met and systems to verify findings.  That is a little bit down the road, but we want to start the process of letting companies know that there will be a system which will judge objectively on proper criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider that the State and semi-State sectors should give a lead to the private sector in accepting the principle of environmental audits?  This was part of the concept in the fifth action programme.  Ireland could lead in this area with our State and semi-State sectors.  Will the Minister seriously consider that?  There are some difficulties in the private sector, particularly for older companies but we should flag the way with our State and semi-State sectors. In view of the fact that eco-auditing will be introduced by way of regulation, will there be an opportunity to debate it in this House, as it will not need to be enacted specifically in law but it will be imposed from Europe?  Will the Minister give an assurance that all views on this can be properly debated in this House at the appropriate time?  That is important.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree more. Very often the relationship between this House and developments at European Community level is not as transparent as it should be.  This is a matter for the Whips.  Consideration was given to using Fridays to debate not alone this proposal but much wider and bigger questions related to our involvement in the Community.</P>
      <P>With regard to the first part of the Deputy's question I would not differentiate between semi-State companies and private companies as to how they should respond.  I would like the agency to encompass a combination of the strengths already in the national standards authority and in business and commerce generally.  We are targeting the country as a whole and getting the response from wherever it can come immediately, as distinct from approaching sectors, but I am open to suggestion on these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to consider giving a lead in the State and semi-State sector because the private sector is a little nervous.  This is a new area and they are afraid that these ecoaudits, if published, may be incriminating or may be used in evidence against them if something goes wrong environmentally. Will the Minister agree that the financial institutions will be pressurising companies and big business, particularly in relation to larger loan applications, to produce environmental audits, especially if land is being offered as collateral for a loan, with &ldquo;the polluter pays&rdquo; principle firmly established?  The financial institutions are nervous of taking on collateral that may cost them more than the loan in the long run, if things go wrong.  Will the Minister be a little bit more vigorous in his approach to environmental auditing and lead the way in the State and semi-State sector in order to encourage the private sector, particularly as the financial institutions and insurance companies will be pushing for environmental audits in the future to back up business proposals generally?</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Environment</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the town of Balbriggan in Fingal, County Dublin has an incomplete inner relief road which will cost about £1 million to finish; if, in view of the fact that 855 people out of the 2,000 families in the town are unemployed and that over the last ten years 30 per cent of the shops in the main street have closed and that this modest road will give access to land already zoned industrial as well as ease congestion from new traffic flows caused by Euroroute section soon to be constructed, 2.75 km east of the town, he will in keeping with the advice of the IDA, the technical staff of Dublin County Council and all public representatives for the area sanction a special improvement work grant, similar to the £1.75 million grant given to provide road access for Shannon Aerospace recently, to complete this modest road and help alleviate unemployment.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1985, my Department informed Dublin County Council that it was not proposed to provide a special road grant for the Balbriggan inner by-pass.  Revised proposals for Balbriggan by-pass, involving a 12-km new route from south  of Gormanston, have been included in the Operational Programme on Peripherality, 1989 to 1993 and, subject to the statutory procedures involved, the scheme is scheduled for construction in the period 1994 to 1996 at an estimated cost of £35 million.  This will be met in full from State road grants, with assistance from EC funds.</P>
      <P>As the proposed inner relief route would not form part of the network of national roads, responsibility for undertaking the project is a matter for Dublin County Council.  The council may use the discretionary grants for non-national roads provided annually by my Department to supplement expenditure from its own resources on such works.  The determination of priorities in the expenditure of these funds is entirely a matter for the local authority.</P>

Will the Minister sanction a loan, because the council do not have the money, to allow access to be created to the industrially zoned land, for the sake of employment, as was done at Aerospace Industries Limited by the Department?  The development levies would become available as a repayment to the Department.  Does the Minister realise that there is an overwhelming feeling of neglect in the town of Balbriggan? The fact that I am standing here as the only TD from Balbriggan in the past 60 years would bear out what I am asking.</P>

The Deputy raised the question of Aerospace Industries Limited which was grant aided and was serving a new industry and other potential development, but that is not comparable with the situation the Deputy has outlined.  It involves considerable acquisition of land, 1,000 jobs which should be on stream next year &mdash; 340 are already on stream.  It was a direct response involving a totally new road. There is little scope for assistance of the nature outlined by Deputy Sargent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of reports and analyses have recognised that deficiencies in the road network can be a major obstacle to economic development and employment creation.  Poor quality roads add to transport costs, increase journey times, reduce travel time reliability and inhibit access to raw materials and markets.  Remedying these problems requires a sustained programme of investment, the first phase of which is being implemented under the Operational Programme on Peripherality 1989-1993.  Under this programme, £700 million is being invested in the development of the road network, £580 million in the vitally important national primary network and £120 million in other roads of importance to industrial or tourism development.  In 1993 alone, over £240 million is available for improvement works on national roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strategy set out in the operational <Col N="122" /> programme has been widely supported, most recently in the Culliton and Moriarty reports, which not alone endorsed the strategy, but also called for an acceleration of the investment programme. The additional support available from the Cohesion Fund from 1993 onwards should make this possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the only way to tackle unemployment is to encourage enterprise and that the best way to encourage enterprise is to remove, or at least reduce, the competitive disadvantages of our industrial and business sectors and that one of the major disadvantages is our appalling road network?  Can the Minister justify the deterioration in our county road network in recent years?  I accept that money is being spent on the national road network, but if we are to promote industry and business in both parts of our island we must maintain our county roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that there are real pressures on the Exchequer to meet in full the cost of the maintenance and improvement of county roads.  In the years 1990 to 1993 a total of £267 million was invested in regional and county roads and in the years 1983 to 1986 that investment was £57 million.  Investment in our county road network is now six times greater because of additional Structural Funding and the Governments' commitment to county roads.  I have no hesitation in saying that we do not have the resources to deal with all the problems in regard to our road network, but if this programme is maintained over a period of time many of our roads will be upgraded and improved.  This will include the Bandon road on which we are spending £7 million to facilitate Deputy O'Keeffe when travelling to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that my personal highway is being improved, but my constituency stretches 100 miles west of Bandon.  Will the Minister agree that we have no chance of having a proper regional policy here unless there is a <Col N="123" /> determined commitment on behalf of the Government to ensure that our regional and county road network is brought up to an acceptable standard in a reasonable period of time?  If we do not achieve that we will condemn the peripheral parts of our island to a continuing diet of unemployment and emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Every device available to us is being utilised in this regard.  For example, the INTERREG programme is in operation in Border areas and we also have the supplementary grants scheme and the rural development operational programme.  I will endeavour to improve resources in regard to our road network wherever possible as a good road network is important for our tourism, agricultural and industrial sectors.  The argument is often made that the reason for the substantial expenditure on our national primary routes is the heavy vehicular traffic to sea ports and airports, but this traffic filters on to those main routes from minor routes.  More than 50 per cent of it comes from the county and regional routes.  As I have outlined, substantial resources have been allocated for this purpose over the past number of years and, if possible, I will provide additional resources for this area out of the next tranche of Structural Funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The poor standard of roads is a major problem in my county, as the Minister is well aware.  Question No. 28 could have been taken with this one if the Minister was not trying to shy away from the contents of that question which queried the reduced allocation for county roads in Cavan.  However, I do not wish to be parochial on this matter today.  I want to look after the interests of Deputies Dukes and O'Keeffe also. We should all work together in an effort to get the Minister to tackle this major problem.  Will he agree that tourism is one of the main growth industries in the EC and world today?  This country depends heavily on that industry and in that regard our county roads are very important.  Many tour operators have refused <Col N="124" /> to penetrate into the north east and north west because of the poor road structure in those areas.</P>
      <P>If agriculture, and alternative farm enterprises, are to develop, the road structure must be improved because many processors and people involved in those alternative enterprises are refusing to service the farmers who wish to develop in this area.  Will the Minister give a commitment to the allocation of a decent road grant in the coming year to all counties that are hard hit, especially Cavan?</P>

      <P>I compliment Cavan County Council on the number of initiatives it has taken to deal with this problem. It is the hardest hit county in the country. This is a long-standing problem and I am delighted the resources of the county council are being used for this purpose as against the picture some years ago when a number of pilot schemes were in operation. While considerable progress has been made, there are still underlying problems that must be dealt with.  The grant to Cavan County Council this year on a mileage basis is approximately £1.7 million greater than any other county.</P>

      <P>The allocation is five times the resources provided by the Exchequer in the previous four years. There is no evidence to suggest there has been a reduction.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>

In my county that allocation has been reduced by approximately £250,000 and the overall expenditure is less than £3 million in that category.  How can the Minister justify that in view of what the Taoiseach said when agreeing with the then Commissioner MacSharry that sections of the road grant from the EC should be used on minor roads and not <Col N="126" /> on major national and secondary roads as has been the case up to now?</P>

      <P>In regard to the Minister's final remarks, how does he propose to provide funding for new roads when he cannot provide for the maintenance of existing roads?  Will he agree that due to the standard of our roads there must be an integrated strategy in relation to other forms of transport, particularly the railway network?  Would he not agree that a case can be made in those circumstances for giving one ministry overall responsibility for transport and roads?  It could be either the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications or the Department of the Environment.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has raised a number of questions.  When Fianna Fáil &mdash; in fairness to the Labour Party, it did likewise &mdash; outlined an expansive programme of new investment in roads during the general election campaign it was castigated by both Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats on the issue of where the money would come from.  The Government has found as much money as it can for these programmes.  The Deputy suggested giving one ministry overall responsibility for transport matters.

It seems that money will always be available &ldquo;next year&rdquo;.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>The Meteorological Service has now commenced monitoring of levels of ultra-violet radiation at Valentia Island.  It is intended to extend this monitoring to the Dublin area shortly.  While some previous monitoring of ultra-violet radiation has been carried out in Ireland, the Meteorological Service monitoring will provide the first systematic data on the national impact of ozone layer depletion.</P>
      <P>Monitoring of the ozone layer itself has been carried out mainly through major international research projects, including a recent EC programme.  My Department is considering with the Meteorological Service the possibility of contributing to this EC programme by establishing a specific Irish programme for the monitoring of the ozone layer in co-operation with interested third level institutions.  Monitoring information on ozone layer depletion will be made available to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that there are no baseline data for Ireland? Will he say that <i>en clair,</i> so to speak, so that we will know where we are starting from?  Does the Minister have any plans to include in the public information the kind of warning required on expected levels of radiation?  There is a growing concern at the effects of ozone depletion, for example, an increase in skin cancers, not to mention anything else.  Does the Minister envisage that we might reach the point where warnings similar to those on potato blight will be issued, as a matter of routine?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> There are no baseline data on the condition of the ozone layer directly over Ireland, nor on the levels of ultra violet radiation in Ireland.  With regard to the need for public health warnings, calls have been made for the establishment of a system <Col N="129" /> of public health warnings in the event of evidence that Ireland is receiving increased ultra violet radiation.  The Department of the Environment and the Department of Health are already engaged in discussions on this matter.  So far very few countries in the northern hemisphere have adopted such a system of health warnings.  While the Department is fully committed to the open and transparent availability of information, it does not follow that it would be useful to translate this information directly into a health warning system.  All public agencies concerned and, in particular, the Department of Health will take stock of the monitoring information and consider the extent to which health warnings may be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I invite the Minister to think again on his last point.  I know his officials will tell him to be very careful about giving new commitments.  Would the Minister not agree that by far the safest thing to do in relation to issues which concern the environment and the possible effects of radiation on public health is to assume that the worst will probably happen and give people the information they require in order to prevent it happening, rather than take the very obdurate position which his Department always takes of never doing anything until there has been a major disaster?  Will he reflect again on his last point and do the simple and safe thing first instead of coming along like Offenbach's carabineers after the problem has worsened?</P>

      <P>I am very interested in this issue.  May I ask the Minister how the EC directive on freedom of information will affect the policy of his Department in so far as the availability of information is concerned?  The Minister said that information would be made available.  Will this information be available on radio?  Will it include details regarding the ozone layer outside Ireland?  Such information would be very relevant to the many people who go abroad either on business or pleasure trips.  Many people travel abroad during the summer months, when they face the greatest risk of getting skin cancer.  Will there be any involvement by the Department of Health in terms of funding or will the funding be provided entirely by the Department of the Environment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> Co-ordination arrangements between some local authorities in relation to waste management are already in place.  I intend that the new waste Bill will embody provisions designed to facilitate such arrangements.</P>
      <P>The Discussion Paper on Waste published by my Department in July 1992 referred to the advantages of joint provision, agency arrangements and regionalisation of waste management services currently provided by individual local authorities.  The number of local authority landfill sites decreased by 25 per cent between 1984 and 1989, so that a trend towards consolidation of services is already well established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat disturbed at the present mesh of landfill sites, although the number of sites may have decreased.  The priority under EC guidelines is prevention, second, recycling and re-use and, finally, disposal.  In regard to co-ordination arrangements between local authorities, I hope this is the road <Col N="132" /> we will follow.  Instead of increasing the number of landfill sites we should be considering how to prevent waste, recycle and reuse it.  When this is done, we can then talk about disposal, which is a totally different question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> We are already thinking along these lines.  The waste Bill will be introduced towards the end of the year; there will also be a strategy for recycling.  These issues are being looked at.  For a number of years all waste in Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Borough areas has been disposed of in landfill sites in the county.  Under the waste Bill we will be urging more co-operation between local authorities, which can prove very difficult to achieve at times.</P>
      <P>If, for example, we want to send waste from Wexford into Waterford, I doubt that it would be acceptable.  It is an emotive issue.  The siting of local authority landfills in other jurisdictions will be subject to normal planning and environmental impact assessment requirements. It is the environmental suitability of a site rather than the local authority jurisdiction which has priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>This question deals with greater co-operation between local authorities on the question of waste disposal. I would ask for greater co-operation between the Minister's Department and local authorities.  In my constituency last year we had the disastrous dumping of 12,000 tonnes of charred meat on a greatly elevated site called Creggahill in Roscommon. When I ask questions here in the Dáil, the Minister tells me that it is not his responsibility.  When I ask the county manager in County Roscommon, he is inclined to pass the buck to the Minister. Nevertheless, this waste was obviously dumped in contravention of the EC ground water Directive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a general principle <Col N="133" /> here, Sir.  Now that the question has been raised, what responsibility does the Minister have in relation to the disposal of dangerous waste of this kind?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I would hope that we can make provision in the new waste Bill for the type of situation that developed in Roscommon.  Obviously that was an emergency at the time and the local authorities were not prepared for it.  I would welcome suggestions from all sides of the House as to how we could have defined sites available for emergencies such as that in the future so that we would not have the kind of rows that we have had in the past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is now a crisis in Dublin with regard to waste management and disposal resulting in Dublin County Council proposing to commit itself to a 20-year dump in north Kildare, the constituency of the Minister's colleague?  Will he consider bringing forward the waste management legislation and the proposals regarding the recycling strategy so that those will be in place in advance of any commitment to a 20-year dump at Kill in order to avoid the classic case of the door being shut after the horse has bolted? Will the Minister bring forward the legislation to avoid a situation where a major dump is to be located in north Kildare?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has referred <Col N="134" /> to environmental impact assessment several times.  Surely here rests much of the problem in the absence of a national plan, particularly since local authorities are both judge and jury on the question of landfill sites.  Does the Minister have any plans to ensure that agencies promoting programmes of one kind or another insist that these assessments are carried out by independent bodies and not by the agency or local authority itself?  Until we face up to that anomaly in our environmental impact assessment legislation, effectively we are talking around the subject because one local authority will take one view of environmental impact assessment which may differ considerably from that of the neighbouring authority.  Has the Minister any plans to rectify that and ensure independent assessments of projects such as landfill sites?</P>

Will the Minister be liaising with other members of the Cabinet on the question of waste reduction?  I know, for certain, that in the whole area of industry the encouragement contained in legislation is very important in choosing the type of packaging and, following on from that, the type of waste that is created.  It is imperative that the Minister uses every means at his disposal at that stage.  Does he intend to do that so that we do not need to deal with disposal if at all possible?</P>

      <P>Standing advice to local authorities on landfill site selection includes a document prepared by the Geological Survey of Ireland incorporating geotechnical guidelines on waste landfill site selection.  Local authorities regularly seek advice on landfill issues from the GSI or from private hydrogeological consultants.</P>

      <P>My question asks specifically whether the Minister considers the expertise of the Geological Survey of Ireland essential in the initial selection of the landfill site.  I know local authorities and others often approach the GSI, generally for drawings and maps only, often at the environmental impact assessment stage.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Geological Survey of Ireland is unquestionably the leading public sector body of expertise in geotechnical issues.  Hydrogeological expertise in the private sector has increased considerably in recent times.  There is, of course, in-house expertise in local authorities' engineering staff who may have special qualifications on ground water <Col N="137" /> issues.  Thus, there is a plethora of expertise from which the local authority has a choice to base its judgment in these matters.  The GSI has prepared the base document for local authorities on which they make judgments on landfill sites. That base document has been used for some time.  There is therefore no question but that the expertise of the GSI is available to local authorities.  The expertise is not necessarily essential if private expertise is available to a local authority. It is a matter of local autonomy, something that the Deputy has often spoken in favour of.  The power to make decisions in matters such as this is vested in the local representatives on the local council.  It is up to them to decide what is best for them in given circumstances. It is not a matter for the Minister.</P>

The GSI has for many years been to the forefront as this country's leading expert in the selection of landfill sites for waste disposal. That is an indisputable fact, and I do not think that the Minister is disputing it now. Why, then, in the initial selection of the Kill site did Dublin County Council not ask the GSI to visit the site and give advice on suitability before the council handed over £1 million of taxpayers' money to Roadstone for a gravel workings, without even a requirement for planning permission?</P>

      <P>It is now a matter for the local authorities between them, since the Minister amended SI 25 of 1990 by SI 209 of 1992, having had his fingers burnt locally by the issue of the Slievenamon dump in his own county.  I know that it is now a matter for the councils.  In the context of a waste management policy for Ireland, would the Minister consider the inclusion of a condition that in the initial selection by local authorities of all landfill sites benefit is gained from use of the expertise and advice of the GSI?  That would avoid a repetition of the fiasco that is being witnessed in relation to the proposals for the dump at Kill.  Could the Minister at least give a guarantee that in future the GSI will be asked to help in the initial selection of landfill sites?</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Environment</askee>
      <Quest>his policy on the hundreds of group water schemes throughout the country that remain stalled for the past two years or more because of lack of funding; his views on this situation; and the steps, if any, he intends to take to resolve the problem.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Individual group water schemes are approved for grant payment on an ongoing basis.  The 1993 overall provision for group scheme grants has been increased to £2.5 million from £2 million in 1992.</P>
      <P>Problems of financing occur in relation to certain schemes where local contributions represent a small proportion only of the total requirement and further subvention is being sought from the capital provision for public schemes. However, I expect that a large number of schemes currently well advanced in their preparation will be approved in 1993.  I have already been quite generous to County Roscommon earlier this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister did not take my Question No. 57 together with this question.  Perhaps that might have been too embarrassing for the Minister.  In relation to the £2.5 million allocation, I estimate that at least 10,000 households throughout the country are awaiting a clear water supply through the medium of the group water schemes.  An allocation of £2.5 million might service 200 houses, or, at the most, 300 houses in the current year.  Surely the Minister is not claiming that as progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that the Deputy has severe problems in making calculations as the number of houses that could be serviced by an allocation of £2.5 million to group water scheme grants.  Perhaps it would be a good idea to refresh the Deputy's memory and give the House an indication of last year's position.  Last year 108 group water schemes were able to serve 3,684 houses and 1,408 farms.  I intend to better that achievement in the present year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I could provide the Minister with the example of the Fairymount group water scheme in County Roscommon, for which the estimated cost of supplying about 180 houses with clean water is £2.5 million.  The Minister's overall <Col N="142" /> allocation of £2.5 million would not go very far if that scheme were included. The Minister seems to be providing figures for schemes that are easy to service. None of the high-cost water schemes is progressing.  What are the Minister's plans for schemes that would cost more than £500 per house?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fairymount scheme, to which the Deputy referred, I understand will serve approximately 130 houses.  Its cost is not £2.5 million but rather £750,000.  The inspector from my Department examined that and found it would be possible to serve 70 per cent of the houses at about one-third of the cost. I understand that Roscommon County Council &mdash; though the Deputy may not be aware of it &mdash; has already decided that the first phase should be undertaken. That was agreed by Roscommon County Council and I am prepared to go down that road.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister speaks about £2.5 million being allocated in this year's Estimates, would he not agree and recognise that there has been a carry-over from last year's group water schemes of £1.5 million?  Therefore, would the Minister not agree that the new allocation amounts to only £1 million? What is the response of the Minister <i>vis-à-vis</i> the 89 group water schemes awaiting final approval of funding this year?  Surely the Minister would agree that that constitutes a disappointment in relation to Leader projects, as such, which were to be expanded in this country and in respect of which considerable emphasis has been placed on infrastructure.  Could some accommodation not be arranged in regard to group water schemes <i>vis-à-vis</i> Leader projects in an endeavour to stimulate some extra group water schemes this year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I am under tremendous pressure. For example, at the Progressive Democrats' Conference last weekend there were strong arguments advanced against spending any more money on water or <Col N="143" /> other schemes.  I have to take account of all these views.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Having said that, if the Deputy considers that a question arises of moneys being allocated this year in respect of last year's schemes, he should not under-estimate my ingenuity in achieving a similar position at the end of this year in order to maximise the number of schemes that can go ahead.  The Deputy asked me what do I have to say about 89 schemes.  As quickly as possible, I will be saying &ldquo;go ahead.&rdquo;  There is no question but that the resources are available for a considerable number of schemes this year.</P>
      <P>In regard to various other EC schemes, Leader and others, we will endeavour to embody a component which would involve certain infrastructural developments essential to their administration. There is a need for better co-ordination of all the schemes in terms of ensuring a match between the service being provided, the industry or craft going ahead and the ability of the basic infrastructural needs in the area to serve that purpose.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 32 together.  I refer to the reply given by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to Question No. 25 of 9 March 1993 in relation to the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government that 1 per cent of the budget for capital projects being undertaken by local authorities should be spent on artistic embellishment. I have no proposals to increase the percentage limit.</P>
      <P>Information is not readily available in my Department in relation to the number of works initiated as a result of the scheme which has been in operation since July 1986.  Ministerial approval is not required for the award of contracts by local authorities for artistic features.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very disappointing to learn that we do not know exactly what has been the result of that scheme.  Being somewhat parochial I should say our experience in Dún Laoghaire &mdash; where we endeavour to ensure works of art are integrated in municipal buildings, such as our fine new courthouse and so on &mdash; has been encouraging.  Would the Minister agree that it is something deserving attention, not alone because we should encourage our artists in their work but, as we like to have environmental issues considered <i>vis-à-vis</i> all aspects of our lives, that the marrying of artistic and environmental matters is most appropriate?</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Quill's second question, would the Minister not agree that it would not be unreasonable to make the scheme mandatory and ascertain its result?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two basic problems about that.  First, let me say that I did not indicate to this House that I was unaware of what was going on.  I was asked specifically for the number of <Col N="145" /> projects initiated.  Since it is local democracy, local authorities, who decide these matters, without reference to me for sanction &mdash; about which I am delighted and to see that all of that is flourishing &mdash; I am not aware of the number.  Of course, I am very much aware of the artistic merit of the sculptural projects which have enhanced these sites.  I am very glad that 1 per cent of the overall capital cost is available to allow such projects to proceed. It is an extraordinary move by the Progressive Democrats to call for these schemes to be mandatory.  First and foremost, that would mean that every local authority project would have to incorporate one, even if it be a single house in a rural area&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>When one begins to examine that aspect &mdash; take the example of a sewerage scheme which is partly underground and cannot be seen &mdash; one realises one has to be sensible about this. There are some very nice schemes developed by local authorities.  Let us put as much resources as we can into their profile and their added artistic merit.  Let us not have the nonsense of imposing mandatory schemes in respect of everything local authorities do.  I am quite sure the Deputy will appreciate, as I do, that of all the demands she is making of me &mdash; were I to submit to undertake the others &mdash; then I would not have any money available to fund even the voluntary ones going ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it extraordinary that the Minister is not in a position to give this House some indication of the take-up of these schemes.  Would he inform us approximately what percentage of schemes have actually availed of this option?  In addition, could he give us some indication of the total expenditure thereon to date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have that information available to me at present.  I could endeavour to ascertain it by a fairly <Col N="146" /> tedious process, by consulting all local authorities nationwide, inquiring what they are doing in these matters.  But that would run totally counter to the other demands being made on me to endeavour to delegate to local authorities more functions while, at the same time, be expected to have the day-to-day returns from local authorities on all of these matters.  I will go as far as I can on a general basis to inform the Deputy in regard to what is involved.  I might add that most of the major schemes undertaken, on roads and sanitary services, encompass some artistic element.</P>

      <P>I welcome the copy of the Minister's document which I received this week, as I am sure did every other Member, and his invitation for comments from different sectors of the public.  My immediate reaction to it was that we are at present in default, in terms of ratification, of certain EC Directives on recycling.  The Minister does not need my comment on that.  Evidence of goodwill in terms of a national recycling programme can be measured only by the speed with which the Minister keeps apace with EC Directives.  As I speak I am thinking particularly of the recycling of batteries Directive.  I have not quite the correct title but I am sure the Minister knows the one to which I am referring. Perhaps, as a start, he could tell us why we are in default of the deadline on that and inform us when it will be ratified and incorporated in Irish law?</P>

We would like to see some evidence of the Minister of State's commitment <Col N="148" /> to a national recycling programme. There will be some costs involved &mdash; a figure of £75 million has been mentioned.  Is there a commitment to fund a national recycling programme or are we talking about something that might happen in the year 2010 or in the short to medium-term?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to allocate 20 minutes of my time to Deputy Currie.</P>
      <P>Before Question Time I made the point that Northern Ireland was the most important issue in Irish politics and that everything else was secondary.  For the past few years those of us who live on the southern part of the island have been fortunate to live in splendid isolation, relative peace and security.  As a result we have not always looked at the problems in Northern Ireland as closely as we should.</P>
      <P>While it would be realistic to accept that a certain level of horrible but contained violence could continue indefinitely in Northern Ireland it is unreasonable to think that this will not or could not be visited upon us.  Because of this we cannot wait any longer and the time for action is now.</P>
      <P>There is a song which contains the word, &ldquo;What do you say when words are not enough&rdquo;.  In relation to Northern Ireland we must ask ourselves that question. Many words have been spoken &mdash; criticism and statements of concern and condemnation &mdash; yet for the most part those words have fallen on deaf ears.</P>
      <P>We in the Republic must begin to take decisive action to demonstrate that our first priority is peace in Northern Ireland and that this comes before everything else.  Peace and harmony in Ireland, North and South must be our first priority ahead of any long term political settlement, be it in a unitary State or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to admit that a unitary state is the goal of some parties, North and <Col N="199" /> South, for some it is the reason for their existence.  Side by side with this aspiration we must admit that the quest for a unitary state has resulted in the deaths of many people in Northern Ireland &mdash; murders carried out in our name.  It has been said many times before, including today, that we must disown the people who claim to represent us in carrying out their desperate deeds and actions.  I concur fully with those sentiments.  We must ask ourselves what we can do to bring these violent deeds and actions to an end.  Words are not enough.</P>
    <P>Some speakers referred to the delicate subjects of Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution and extradition.  The topic of extradition has been raised at Question Time and on the Order of Business on many occasions in recent weeks.  It would be unforgivable if we, in this Hosue, did not do everything possible to close every legal loophole which allows people to remain in this State, despite the fact that we know they have assisted in or committed atrocities in Northern Ireland or in other parts of the United Kingdom. We must take this action.</P>
    <P>In relation to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution one would not have enough time in a speech of 60 minutes to address them fully but if we, in the Republic, have ideological hang-ups in dealing with them this will cast grave doubts on our ability to deal with the much more difficult questions that would emerge if a political settlement were on the table. The political, economic and cultural aspects require attention but if we have ideological hang-ups about Articles 2 and 3, will we have the will to tackle the broader issues?</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell mentioned eduction. For far too long in our history books one side was considered to be right and the other wrong.  That is something we in this House could address and which we could redress.  This must be done if we are to prevent the next generation adopting the semi-warped ideology and philosophy that has led to people with guns and bombs going North to blow <Col N="200" /> apart their fellow Irish citizens.  We have eliminated from our history books those people in this country who believed that political progress could be attained without resorting to military force.  We hear very little about Daniel O'Connell or Charles Stewart Parnell, yet our history tells us that those gentlemen made political progress without the use of weapons or force.  We must try to focus on political progress through a peaceful process. Peace must come first and if we demand peace on this island a political settlement will follow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Bradford for sharing his time with me.  In the time I have available I hope to cover new ground and where at all possible I will not repeat points that have been made earlier in the debate.  Therefore, I wish to put on the record my support for the peace movement, my support for the courage and humanity of Senator Gordon Wilson, who will be meeting the IRA as the father of his murdered daughter, and my total commitment to reconciliation and consent as the only way forward in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throughout my political career I have been a strong advocate of an all-party approach in this House to Northern Ireland.  I have always considered such an approach to be in the broader national interest.  For the same reason I support the proposal, first put forward by the Tánaiste, and now strongly endorsed by Deputy John Bruton, for a forum of all the parties which would enable matters such as security, to be discussed without the glare of publicity.  I support and will continue to support the all-party approach.  However, I found the Taoiseach's speech today deeply disappointing. He said his Government is committed &ldquo;not to retreat to the certainties of the past but to strive for a decisive political breakthrough which will help to bring about a new formula for peace&rdquo;.  That is what the people want. That was the demand of those who demonstrated for peace last weekend, but in the Taoiseach's speech it was unfortunately, no more than a pious platitude <Col N="201" /> and, I regret to say, he failed entirely to respond to the national mood.  He seemed to be more motivated by fears and uncertainties within his own party.  I say that with regret.</P>
    <P>Time is running out in Northern Ireland.  The elimination of terrorism by political means must be a central political objective.  I say &ldquo;political means&rdquo; because there is no other way which would not be self-defeating.  How is this elimination of terrorism by political means to be achieved when so many attempts over a period of more than 20 years have failed? It is invariably useful to work back from an objective to ascertain the conditions necessary to achieve it.  A prime requirement is the existence of political institutions which people are prepared to support and defend.  People should have the maximum say in governing themselves, the greatest possible power to change their own lives, and central to all of this, to protecting and defending democratic institutions and empowering themselves is the capacity to implement their decisions through acceptable policing. There will never be peace, normality or stability in Northern Ireland until there is acceptable policing.  That means the involvement in the policing process of both Nationalists and Unionists without feeling or being made to feel any less of a nationalist or a unionist for being involved in that process.  We will all know that the Northern Ireland problem has been solved when children and grandchildren of prominent Unionist and Nationalist politicians serve side by side in the police force.  When that day comes the Northern Ireland problem will be solved.  All of these necessary pre-conditions for the eradication of terrorism are currently lacking in Northern Ireland. What action can we take to remedy that situation?  The answer lies in the proposal for joint referenda, North and South.  A package of agreement arrived at in the talks between the two sovereign Governments and the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland put to the people in the North and South in simultaneous referenda and approved by them would be the greatest instrument ever forged for the <Col N="202" /> eradication of terrorism throughout this island.  For those of the Republican tradition, the sovereign Irish people would have spoken.  For those of the Unionist tradition the Ulster people would have spoken.  The agreement and the new institutions created by it would have unchallengeable authority.  Terrorism would end or would be eradicated.</P>
    <P>The first necessary step in this process is the immediate resumption of talks. That is the very least expected of constitutional politicians in the aftermath of Warrington and the barbarities of Loyalist paramilitaries north of the Border. What if politicians, for whatever reason, do not resume the talks process or if they do resume it and fail to reach agreement? The possibilities have to be faced that there may be some doubts about some politicians in regard to a sincere commitment to dialogue.  I admit to having serious doubts in this regard.  Nothing is as powerful as a timely idea.  Yet, 20 years after the power-sharing Executive there are still Unionists who refuse to commit themselves to the concept of power-sharing.</P>
    <P>There are still Unionist politicians who refuse to unequivocally condemn paramilitary activity when perpetrated on the Unionist side, but who every day of their lives condemn paramilitary activity on the Republican side.  There still remains what I call the spectre of Ian Paisley.  As Members know, I believe in calling a spade a spade.  In my opinion the only person who can compete with the IRA in terms of harm done in the community in Northern Ireland over this past quarter of a century is Ian Paisley and, unfortunately, over the years he has not changed that much.  He is temperamentally incapable of political responsibility.  As an avid Paisley watcher for more than a quarter of a century that has been and always will be my view.</P>
    <P>If we are faced with the circumstances that some politicians, for whatever reason, do not resume the talks process or, if they do resume it and fail to reach agreement, must we stoically accept the inevitable escalation of violence, more Warringtons, Castlerocks, Dublins and <Col N="203" /> Londons until we end up in a position already planned for by the paramilitaries of a Lebanon or a Yugoslavia?  No new arrangements will work without at least the tacit consent of those to be governed. The withdrawal of consent by any significant section of the population would ensure the continuation of terrorism, but that is not to say that in the face of the awful alternative I have outlined that the great majority of the population of these two islands should be held to ransom by a few politicians unwilling or incapable of compromise and accommodation.  There are other ways forward which all politicians should seriously consider before putting their own personal or sectional interests first.</P>
    <P>The two Governments can proceed through the full use of the mechanism of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  In a perceptive and prescient article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 31 December last, an architect of the agreement, the former civil servant Mr. Michael Lillis, suggested that the Irish Government &ldquo;should work the Agreement vigorously and creatively as though from a new beginning&rdquo; and he outlined the areas in which this could be done: political structures; human rights and other political and identity issues; policing and other security structures; social and economic issues; prisons, both policy and individual cases; the courts and the judicial system and nominations to public bodies.</P>
    <P>In two months time it will be 25 years since the start of the Civil Rights Campaign in which I played some part.  It is 21 years since the British Government took direct responsibility for affairs in Northern Ireland.  It is almost seven years since the Anglo-Irish Agreement was signed.  The days are long gone when the Unionists could be blamed for everything. Yet we still have a situation that it is only in recent weeks that the most blatant discrimination in the North's premier educational establishment, Queen's University, my own <i>alma mater,</i> is being effectively tackled.</P>
    <P>The two Governments by the use of the most democratic instruments available to <Col N="204" /> us &mdash; the referendum and the plebiscite &mdash; can proceed with the consent of the people.  The greater use of these democratic instruments as well as a means of promoting change can be of valuable assistance to those Northern Ireland politicians who wish to escape the dead hand of history.  Agreement in advance that the end product will be subject to approval by referendum will assist those who wish to escape from the hooks on which they have been impaled.  I have referred already to the essential role of joint North-South referenda in establishing institutions with sufficient authority to bring about peace and stability.  There is another dimension to a possible solution, the British dimension.  Whatever the future relationship between Northern Ireland and Britain and Ireland and Britain, the views of the British people will be of crucial importance also.  A strong case exists for the British people expressing their views in a referendum on arrangements proposed to be entered into in their name and in particular any proposals with implications for the future of the United Kingdom.  Such a proposal, while having implications for all parties, has particular implications for Unionists. Continued membership of the United Kingdom has responsibility as well as advantages.  Terms of membership of the United Kingdom club should be determined by all members and not by fewer than 2 per cent of it.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat, there is no way forward except by consent and it is my fervent hope that the gravity of the present situation will concentrate the minds of all politicians on the necessity of compromise. Time is running out for Northern Ireland and it may be running out for politicians of all parties concerned with Northern Ireland, not only in Northern Ireland but here and in Britain as well. The downward spiral must be halted. Nothing I have said, I hope, takes away from the responsibility of those of us who belong to the majority tradition on this island to make the major contribution to a solution.  We are the suitors.  It is we who wish to bring about change and we must show generosity and take the risks.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="205" /> In his important contribution this morning Deputy John Bruton again emphasised the continual necessity to bear in mind the viewpoint of the other tradition.  We must all bear this in mind. It might be difficult for some Members of this House who have been used to thinking all their lives in terms of one tradition and one solution and now they are being asked to think in terms of other possible solutions.  If we are all Irish, Irish of two traditions, then it is only by reconciling those two traditions and recognising the differences between us that we can start to eliminate them.  I fail to understand why it was not possible for the Irish Government to tell the Unionists during the first phase of the talks that finished some time ago of its commitment to change or to substitute Articles 2 and 3 in the context of an overall agreement. I do not understand why it was not possible to say that across the table because it could have made a difference.  I would like to know, either privately or publicly, why the Government did not find it in itself to make that move across the table. I fail to understand why it was not done.</P>
    <P>All possible options must be considered. The people in all parts of these two islands have a right to expect their politicians to respond to their demands for peace.  That is the first priority.  Other issues are secondary at this stage.  The late Cardinal Conway, when asked on radio in 1974 whether the power sharing Executive of that time would lead to a united Ireland or &mdash; because Nationalists were now getting a fair deal &mdash; to a perpetuation or partition, replied &ldquo;I am prepared to leave the answer to that question to history.&rdquo;  He was a wiser man than we recognised at that time.</P>
    <P>I now wish to raise a number of points in the time remaining.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, how much time do I have left?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>They relate to points raised in the course of the debate.  I now <Col N="206" /> wish to comment on Deputy De Rossa's attack on the SDLP and its leader, Mr. John Hume.  I am biased because I was a founder member of the SDLP and contributed to all the major decisions taken by that party until I moved from the North.  Deputy De Rossa is also biased because he is the leader of a party that is in direct confrontation with the SDLP in Northern Ireland and has been for some time.  The difference between his party, and indeed the previous party he led, and the SDLP is very clear in terms of the Unionist versus the Nationalist traditions. I am not saying that the SDLP &mdash; I no longer have to defend them &mdash; did not make mistakes over the years. They made mistakes, and indeed I contributed to making those mistakes as well.  But the remarkable thing is that, considering the crucible in which those politicians operate, they did not make a damn sight more mistakes than they actually did.  There is one achievement of the SDLP for which all in this country and further afield owe a deep debt of gratitude &mdash; its staunch unyielding upholding of the democratic process under threat.  The SDLP held the democratic line in Northern Ireland in circumstances where, if the line had gone, the situation would have been fatal. Supposing the Provos had received the mandate of the majority of the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland, how would they have used that mandate and, particularly in relation to the United States, how many extra bombs and guns would have been attracted to their side? The effect of any such mandate in terms of the spill-over into this part of the island has to be borne in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had hoped Deputy Blaney would have more sense in his old age but apparently that is not the case. While I am critical of the Deputy I would take the opportunity to pay tribute to the very good and distinctive contribution made by his fellow Donegalman, Deputy McDaid.  Deputy Blaney said there is a distinction between British withdrawal and a declaration of intent to withdraw, but there is no such distinction.  A declaration to withdraw <Col N="207" /> and a British withdrawal would have the same effect.  In those circumstances it is not the Border communities to which Deputy Blaney referred that one would have to worry about; it is those isolated communities where in some areas there is a Nationalist minority and in other areas a Unionist minority.  Those are the people one would have to worry about. For those who quote Connolly and say that Ireland is the people of Ireland and not boundaries on a map, that is what ought to concern people.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about Portadown, Larne and Carrickfergus and what the position of the Catholic minority would be in those circumstances.  I am concerned about South Armagh, Fermanagh and many areas throughout the North where the position of the Protestant minority would have to be considered.  I have thought long and soberly about this matter and if we want a recipe for civil war, for a Yugoslavian type situation, we would have it in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>I see the Leas-Cheann Comhairle moving forward, which means my time is up.  I would say &mdash; I hope this prediction never comes true &mdash; that there may be a time when Deputy Blaney, myself and others will plead with the British not to withdraw in certain circumstances rather than ask them to go.  That has to be very carefully worked out.  For us to talk about it in these circumstances at this time is entirely dangerous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much value the sentiments expressed by Deputy Currie. He is one man who has been through the mill in relation to the North.  While I might not always agree with what he says, he speaks from some position of authority. In relation to what the Deputy said about Articles 2 and 3 in terms of the previous talks, my information was that <Col N="208" /> Irish Government representatives always made the point that the Articles were on the table in an effort to find an overall solution to the problems on this island.  I do not think there is any change from that position and I question the Deputy's information in that regard.</P>
      <P>I concur with the remarks made by Deputy Currie in relation to Deputy De Rossa.  Deputy De Rossa has no authority to speak in relation to peace on this island, and in saying that I am not being in any way critical of him.  The Deputy's fellow travellers of years gone by, constituents of mine, will remember the antics of some of his predecessors along the Border.</P>
      <P>I want to put on record my abhorrence of the use of violence to further political aims.  The bomb and the bullet only prevent the achievement of lasting peace on this island.  As a Deputy who lives literally a stone's throw from the Border I feel that I have some authority to speak today on the unacceptable situation on this island.  My constituency in Louth has been at the coalface since the partition of the governing of this island &mdash; the cold-blooded murder of Tom Oliver is a stark case in point.</P>
      <P>In the early seventies refugee families descended upon my home town looking for assistance.  North Louth has been dogged with problems peculiar to Border areas.  My own area has suffered on the economic helter skelter caused by disparity of prices and taxes on either side of the Border, though thankfully this has lessened in recent years because of prudent economic management here and increased recession across the Border.  I also feel that I have some authority to speak on this issue in view of the fact that I have participated in peace talks involving representatives from both sides of the community from across the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Efforts to secure some advancement in the peace process have floundered because of unwillingness to change on both sides.  Sunningdale was one such effort, but the British Government capitulated under Unionist pressure.  We can only speculate on how things would <Col N="209" /> be on this island had this effort succeeded and subsequently been built upon.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement was another such attempt to fill the political vacuum.  The Unionist attempts to scuttle this were rightly resisted by the British Government.  It is no secret that my party had problems, and still has, with the agreement.  It was perceived at the time that it was giving an unwarranted veto to an agreed Ireland.  I have been on record both inside and outside this House as supporting the Agreement in that, for the first time, it allowed the Republic some say in the internal affairs of the North. This has been brought home to me time and time again by the way people on the Northern side of the Border got much more action on their local problems through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat.</P>
    <P>We moved on from this to last year's talks process, which unfortunately has not superseded the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Efforts to recommence these talks have so far been fruitless.  Anyone who has at heart the genuine wellbeing of all the Irish people on this island must hope and wish they will recommence as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I personally got the impression over the last few years that the British Government was making a genuine effort to understand the Irish problem.  Peter Brooke showed an acute appreciation of the different emphasis on both sides of the divide.  In my opinion, initially Sir Patrick Mayhew showed that he too was trying to get to grips with the problem. Unfortunately, his recent speech, in which he attempted to reassure Unionists on the retention of the Union, is depressing in that he indicated that British Government opinion has fallen back to the age-old rhetoric.  He also harked back to the sentiments in Article 1, Subsection C of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, that is, that if in the future a majority of the people in the North favoured a united Ireland, the British and Irish Governments would facilitate this wish by passing the necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>I have previously stated that one of my hang-ups about the Agreement is that it proposed a simplistic solution to a very <Col N="210" /> complex problem in that it very dangerously suggested that if there was ever a 50 per cent plus I majority in the North in favour of a united Ireland, that would happen.  In effect, if this were to happen the former majority in the North, the Unionists, would be coerced into a united Ireland against their wishes just because they had lost the numbers game.  This would then leave a large minority on this island unhappy with their situation.  Is it any wonder that the Unionists refuse to have anything to do with the Agreement particularly in view of the recent survey evidence that the population discrepancy between Nationalists and Unionists is getting closer and closer.  This over-simplistic approach originally stated in the Agreement and most recently articulated by Sir Patrick Mayhew, compounds the problem of partition, which was not of our making on this side of the Border.</P>
    <P>While the recent statement by John Hume has received a luke-warm response on both sides of the Irish Sea, it should not be dismissed out of hand.  If any of the various interested parties cannot find it possible to talk they should be coerced, not into a solution, but to the talks process. Why should any one group hold a veto over talks?  Obviously, if one side wishes to exclude itself, it does so at its own risk and it would have to justify its dog in the manger approach to its own supporters and people.  The two-way referendum would be a device to get consensus by letting the people have their say on new structures which could easily be set up as part of the &ldquo;tripod&rdquo; of relationships as recently referred to by Sir Patrick Mayhew.</P>
    <P>It has been represented that the Southern negotiators in the recent talks showed an intransigence in regard to Articles 2 and 3.  This is not the case, as far as I am aware.  It has always been the position of Irish Governments that, in the event of an agreed Ireland, as the new Ireland Forum put it, &ldquo;a constitutional change of such magnitude would require a whole new Constitution&rdquo;.  Unilateral change of Articles 2 and 3 would have the direct effect of allowing Sinn Féin to claim that they are the only party aspiring to a <Col N="211" /> united Ireland.  Never before have they looked to the Constitution for their <i>raison d'etre.</i></P>
    <P>They claim their position in Irish life from the 1918 election.  That is a spurious claim.  If they do not recognise our Constitution why change it to give them such a mandate?  Deletion of Articles 2 and 3 could possibly lead to the alienation of the Nationalists and consequently an escalation of violence.</P>
    <P>We were told before that if we got rid of the special position of the Catholic Church from our Constitution relations would be better between Nationalists and Unionists.  Did this happen?  Many political watchers have warned against amending Articles 2 and 3 in that they would lead to a very divisive debate with potentially dangerous consequences. Our President, Mrs. Robinson, stated in an article in April 1990 that in the climate at that time there was &ldquo;a serious risk&rdquo; that any referendum on Articles 2 and 3 could &ldquo;highlight divisions, exacerbate fears and prove to be counterproductive&rdquo;.  Has the situation on the island improved since then to allow us to move for constitutional change?  I think not.</P>
    <P>Our Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dick Spring, during the debate in December 1990 on the Bill put forward by The Workers' Party to amend Articles 2 and 3 said that the Bill could amount to writing a Unionist veto into our Constitution. He wondered would a negative result in a referendum to change Articles 2 and 3 not set back reconciliation.  Why should we, by making such a constitutional change at this stage, further confirm a Unionist veto?</P>
    <P>Why did Mrs. Thatcher and her advisers not take up the misguided offer by Garret FitzGerald and his team to delete Articles 2 and 3?  I suggest that they were being realistic.  If we delete Articles 2 and 3, would it not lessen our right and duty to speak on Northern issues?  Would it not help confirm the Unionists view that we have no right or say in Northern Ireland affairs?  Could it lead to the unwanted position whereby <Col N="212" /> the Nationalist people in the North were isolated?  Who would they turn to? Maybe this is why the British were reluctant to entertain unilateral change at that stage.</P>
    <P>Surely Articles 2 and 3 should not be touched until such time as we have something better to put in their place.</P>

      <P>I represent two Ulster counties in this House and I do not intend to spend the very short time available in this debate going back over the fact that a boundary was drawn around six of the nine Ulster counties for the purpose of ensuring a permanent Unionist majority over the Nationalists.</P>
      <P>Instead, I wish to dwell on one or two political and socio-economic issues.  I believe in the re-unification of Ireland by agreement.  I was a member of the New Ireland Forum whose preferred option was a unitary state.  I deplore violence from all sources and the destruction of human life as a means to an end.  This accomplishes nothing.  Instead, it perpetuates the futile cycle of violence and death that has brought so much sorrow to the people of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I recognise that there are two communities with legitimate rights in Northern Ireland and this is recognised by both sovereign Governments.  It was reinforced by the Haughey/Thatcher meeting in 1981 and through the Anglo Irish Agreement.  The DUP appears to recognise not only the right of the Unionists to be British but to ignore the Nationalist right to be Irish.  All the constitutional Nationalists on this island unequivocally condemn violence from all sources and it is long past time that members of the DUP stopped trying to justify Loyalist violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of grave concern that further progress has not been made in the talks between the interested parties. I deplore the fact that some Unionist politicians are calling for Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution to be dealt with in isolation from other fundamental issues such as the Government of Ireland Act, 1920.  These Articles are of fundamental importance.  The Taoiseach dealt at <Col N="213" /> length with the issue this morning.  There should not be any change in Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution in isolation and they should only be changed when something as good or better is put in place, otherwise we will be betraying the northern Nationalists.  It is disappointing that the parties to the talks, particularly the Unionists, did not first discuss the very many social and economic issues on which agreement can be reached and leave the more difficult constitutional issues until later.</P>
    <P>It has not all been bad news.  We are all aware of many successful areas of co-operation across the Border with an input from both communities in the six counties, some involving support through EC Structural Funds and the International Fund, along with support from both Governments.  The creation of the Single European Market with its elimination of trade barriers and tariffs has further reduced the differences between North and South.</P>
    <P>While I was Minister for Health, I met my counterpart, the Northern Ireland Minister, about every six months when we agreed on a number of very practical initiatives beneficial to all the people on this island.  Because there are only five million people on the island, North and South, it was agreed that duplication of certain high technology procedures was expensive and undesirable.  It was evidently more practical and effective to develop co-operative measures.  As a result lithotrypsy, the crushing of kidney stones is performed in Dublin for the whole island and total body irradiation for children awaiting bone marrow transplant is performed in Belfast.</P>
    <P>At a joint meeting in October 1990 it was agreed to establish a joint working group on procurement and supplies in the health sector to ensure how the best value for money might be achieved.</P>
    <P>During my period as Minister I established a national cancer register in close association with the Northern Ireland health department.  Similar statistical data is collected on both sides of the Border, making the register more relevant <Col N="214" /> to research into cancer on the whole island.</P>
    <P>Other areas where great progress was made included joint immunisation programmes and a number of health promotion projects.  European Community money through INTERREG has provided a number of joint facilities.</P>
    <P>At local level there is increasing co-operation between adjoining area health boards North and South.  For instance many hospital services in Altnagelvin, Derry, are provided for people from Innishowen peninsula.</P>
    <P>I have referred to health, but such forms of co-operation are happening in a variety of other policy areas also.  I would call upon all the parties involved to focus more of their energies on developing such beneficial models of co-operation.  If the talks were to identify a range of economic and social areas and deal with them first, leaving the difficult constitutional areas until the end, it might be beneficial.</P>
    <P>Representing a constituency which has two-thirds of the Border as a boundary, I am concerned about a number of issues including the closure of Border roads.  It contributes nothing to security and is a source of major inconvenience to people living along both sides of the Border.  The Government should use its influence to have these roads re-opened, particularly those which are a life line to towns such as Clones and Belturbet which have been economically devastated by the Border over the years.  It is difficult to understand, at a time when there is freer movement throughout the EC, why so many major new permanent vehicle check points are being erected, particularly as there is a large volume of opinion that believes mobile patrols are more effective.</P>
    <P>There has been much documented evidence over the years of harassment of the Nationalist community, particularly by the UDR.  It was agreed through the Anglo-Irish Agreement that the Army and UDR, now replaced by the RIR, would be accompanied by a member of the RUC.  In my experience this is only partially implemented.  I ask the Tánaiste to continue to raise this matter <Col N="215" /> through the Anglo-Irish Conference. Because of the manner in which the Six Counties was contrived, the normal rules of democracy have never worked there and for a number of years policy has been formulated on the basis of a London-Belfast axis.</P>
    <P>In this context I would see a more significant role for the British-Irish Parliamentary Group.  We must all be concerned at the serious and tragic situation that exists on this island.  There is an obligation on all of us, North and South, to do all in our power to bring about a solution to the problem whereby all the people of this island, Nationalists and Unionists, can live in peace and harmony.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this debate at a time when violence is continuing unabated in a more vicious and horrible manner than was thought possible heretofore with no regard for human life.  I would hope the talks can be resumed and in this regard I wish well the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring and the negotiating team.</P>
      <P>It is important to reject the claims which are continually made that the South is a safe haven for IRA terrorists. I live closer to the Border than any other public representative at national level and know this is not the case.  The Government's commitment in terms of additional security costs due to the Border situation and the Northern troubles in 1970 was £2 million or £1 <i>per capita.</i> In 1989 the cost had risen to £180 million or £51 <i>per capita,</i> so that costs to date would be in the region of £2 billion. Part of that cost arose when snatch squads crossed the Border and we appealed for additional forces to be brought to the Border to safeguard our own people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said concerning a single economy for the entire island and the benefits that would accrue.  The lack of progress in cross-Border development is disappointing, especially in areas such as agriculture and tourism where they have <Col N="216" /> much in common.  There has been a marked improvement on the industrial front, an area which is much more competitive. Industrialists, both North and South, see great advantages for inter-trading. North-South trade in 1991 amounted to £1.2 billion, comprising some £792 million, or 61 per cent, of exports from the South to the North and £496 million, or 39 per cent, in exports from the North to the South.  In the period 1986-91 North-South trade &mdash; at a time when there were serious problems so far as paramilitary activities were concerned &mdash; increased by 37 per cent. Recent studies indicate that trade could be trebled with a major impact on employment, both direct and indirect, resulting in something of the order of 75,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>The Single Market and the moves towards economic integration will provide a stimulus to open up new commercial opportunities for cross-Border trade.  Indigenous industries, North and South, face similar problems in trying to expand their business.  The small scale of native industry and their reliance on small domestic markets makes it difficult for firms to achieve success in businesses where economies of scale are crucial.  It is self evident that with the reduction of the physical and technical barriers &mdash; the removal of the Border and customs post &mdash; firms both North and South would seek to increase their domestic market by going across the Border for sales opportunities.  There is a need to develop and intensify such cross-Border linkages with our enterprises and to co-operate effectively in the European Community.</P>
    <P>In recent years a wide range of initiatives has been taken to improve the level of cross-Border trade and economic contact. In this regard I pay tribute to the National Fund for Ireland and the States in New Zealand, and Canada who contributed funds.  The CII and the CBI have co-operated on each side of the Border, as well as the chambers of commerce, the IDA Mentor programme in conjunction with Ledu in the North, Córas Tráchtála and IDB.  It was regrettable when customs controls were removed on 1 January <Col N="217" /> that we had the devaluation and sterling problem to contend with so that we have not reaped the benefits.</P>
    <P>From discussions I have had recently with industrialists I found an awareness and a desire to co-operate between the two parts of the country.  At the end of the day public representatives can do very little so far as changing the minds and hearts of the people in the North is concerned, but we can in our own way contribute by cross-Border co-operation and by our meetings with people on the other side of the Border.</P>
    <P>Last week North-West Tourism announced a development plan which included a number of projects with a cross-Border content.  Projects in this State would complement the Ulster Trail and the north-west passage tourist development.  I hope the tourism agencies, both North and South, will grasp this opportunity, particularly community groups actively engaged in developing their own regions.  This is very important in the Fermanagh-Tyrone area, where some of the most terrible atrocities have been committed down through the years; yet they are still willing to co-operate and to try to develop their area.  The INTERREG initiative was set up in 1991 to assist internal border areas of the Community in overcoming their special development problems.  If those programmes were used to the best advantage it would make a huge difference to both the social and the economic life of those areas.</P>
    <P>Earlier today Eamon de Valera was quoted.  He said in 1933 that we cannot solve the problem by words or by force but only through a better livelihood for our people here.  If de Valera were alive today and examined the social welfare, health and all the other benefits North and South, he would certainly be a surprised man, because most of the benefits for the aged are at a higher level here.  I had experience of this recently when I had a hip replacement operation in Navan.  I was discharged before the appointed time, after 12 days.  A person I know very well, who lives across the Border in my own parish, was discharged <Col N="218" /> after six days without having fully recovered. That is the difference in the approach to health matters both North and South.</P>

      <P>The previous speaker, Deputy O'Hanlon referred to the Border roads.  Road closures continue to create serious problems for local residents and have social and economic consequences. I appeal to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, to do everything possible in this regard.  At cross-Border meetings we have pursued this matter continually. The Aghalane bridge in County Cavan between Belturbet and Enniskillen was blown up by Loyalists in 1970.  There has been sustained pressure to have that bridge restored.  This is in the same area as the Slieve Russell Hotel and the large Quinn development across the Border, which has given so much employment to the people of west Cavan.  The town of Clones is virtually surrounded by the Border and has suffered economic and social disruption because of closed cross-Border roads.  There have been persistent calls for the opening of Lackey bridge and the road from Clones to Roslea via Finn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A study carried out by the Social and Economic Committee of the EC on both sides of the Border listed Clones as one of the most disadvantaged towns in a disadvantaged area.  The social and economic life of the towns of Belturbet and Clones has been seriously affected by the closure of cross-Border roads.  Many of those closures were expected to be temporary, but there is growing frustration in that area at present at the apparent permanent nature of those road closures and the IRA and Sinn Féin are quick to exploit that frustration.  They are the winners and we must not forget that those organisations use such road closures very effectively.  Members of the IRA and Sinn Féin have been appealing to have Border roads opened.  We made a road <Col N="219" /> at Aughnacloy at a cost of £250,000 and within one month £80,000 worth of damage was done to the Moy bridge on that road by the people &mdash; making those appeals.  That illustrates the genuineness of their appeals.  I would ask the Tánaiste and his team to do something in regard to the closure of cross-Border roads.</P>
    <P>Another cross-Border problem which affects the counties of Fermanagh, Tyrone, Cavan and Monaghan is that of animal disease.  We had hoped that the funding listed for such problems in the INTERREG programme would have been availed of.  Twenty years ago those areas were completely clear of animal disease, but they are now black spot areas and we have requested that they be designated as pilot areas.</P>

      <P>Once again we are making statements on Northern Ireland.  It is regrettable that we are not having a debate through which some clear strategy could be articulated, because many of the contributions today have dealt with violence carried out by the IRA and UFF, violence in Northern Ireland and in the United Kingdom and, perhaps in the future, violence in this State.</P>
      <P>If we have learned anything over the past 25 years it must be that speeches by politicians, churchmen and many well-meaning people will not bring about an end to violence.  The men of violence on both sides in the North must be extremely pleased by the world attention that has been focussed on them in the past fortnight. Both Parliaments on these islands have had debates on violence.  The men of violence will be encouraged by this and convinced that what they are doing is correct and, to use their own words, will &ldquo;bomb their way to the table&rdquo;.  It is a reflection on every politician here that we have not been able to do more to resolve that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="220" /> What will bring about an end to violence is political structures in Northern Ireland which both traditions see as being fair and representative and to which they can give their loyalty.  If such structures can be agreed and are endorsed by a referendum in both parts of this island, support for those who use violence to achieve political goals will fade and democratic politics will take over.  That process will take time, because too many people in Northern Ireland have a vested interest in the perpetuation of violence.</P>
    <P>However, there is a body of people in Northern Ireland who have a vested interest in peace, that is the mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers of those who have been killed, injured or in some way touched by the violence of the last 20 years.  Those people want peace and they will ensure that there is peace if there are political structures in place which will, in the words of the Anglo-Irish Agreement:</P>
    <P>acknowledge the rights of the two major traditions that exist in Ireland, represented on the one hand by those who wish for no change in the present status of Northern Ireland and on the other hand by those who aspire to a sovereign united Ireland achieved by peaceful means and through agreement; </P>
    <P>The generosity of spirit and ability to forgive displayed by relatives of the victims of violence constantly amazes me. The parents of the children in Warrington are a perfect example of that and another is the many appeals for no retaliation from the loved ones of those of both traditions killed in Northern Ireland.  Frequently the response of ordinary people to violence has been to take to the streets in huge demonstrations for peace, such as that in Dublin last Saturday.  The goodwill and concern expressed in such demonstrations is welcome and useful. However, that will dissipate unless there is a corresponding response from politicians. It is the responsibility of this House to close all loopholes in our extradition laws so that if the perpetrators of such crimes are found in our jurisdiction <Col N="221" /> they may be sent to face the courts in whatever jurisdiction charges are brought against them.  We must redouble our efforts to find a political solution.</P>
    <P>Approximately two years ago the two Governments initiated a process of talks on three levels: between the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland &mdash; by far the most important of the three strands &mdash; between political parties in Northern Ireland and the Dublin Government and between the Irish and British Governments.  Those talks have the support of the majority of people in both Ireland and the United Kingdom. Many people, including myself, wished to comment on those talks but submerged that wish in an overriding desire to give the Governments and the parties to the talks as much room and as little criticism as possible so that agreement could be reached primarily between the four constitutional parties in Northern Ireland. They represent the people whose differences must be resolved.</P>
    <P>We were told that the talks would be open-ended, without precondition and that nothing would be agreed until everything was agreed.  However, it was not long before the &ldquo;without precondition&rdquo; undertaking was abandoned, first, by the Unionists who wanted Articles 2 and 3 of the Irish Constitution amended and, second, by the present Taoiseach &mdash; his predecessor was too astute and wily to fall into this trap &mdash; who wanted the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, on the table.  In my view both that Act and Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution have been superseded by Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, which states:</P>
    <P>The two Governments</P>
    <P>(a)  affirm that any change in the status of Northern Ireland would only come about with the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland;</P>
    <P>(b)  recognise that the present wish of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland is for no change in the status of Northern Ireland;</P>
    <P>(c)  declare that, if in the future a <Col N="222" /> majority of the people of Northern Ireland clearly wish for and formally consent to the establishment of a united Ireland, [This is where Deputy Ahern misread the article; he should read it again] they will introduce and support in the respective Parliaments legislation to give effect to that wish.</P>
    <P>This Article, in an Agreement which has been ratified by the Dáil and the House of Commons, registered as an international agreement in the United Nations and supported by the majority of people in Ireland, should be accepted by all the parties as a starting point in the process of identifying and establishing administrative structures for the future in Northern Ireland.  It protects the position of Unionists and recognises the aspirations of Nationalists.  More importantly, it contains an undertaking by the British Government that if the majority of people in Northern Ireland consent to a united Ireland it will introduce legislation to give effect to that wish.</P>
    <P>There is always a reason for postponing action.  At present the two Governments appear unwilling to go beyond appealing to the parties in Northern Ireland to return to the talks process.  They do not want &mdash; this is understandable &mdash; to give any ammunition to the extremists on both sides in the local elections which will be held in May.  This is not good enough. Next year it will be the European elections, and no doubt something else will arise the year after which will prevent the Governments bringing the parties to the table.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement should be dusted off and worked far more vigorously than it has been for the past six years.  I was glad to hear the Tánaiste say this morning that he intends to work the agreement very vigorously.  The agreement has not, for some understandable political reasons, been worked as vigorously as it should have been since 1987.</P>
    <P>The Unionist community were opposed to the agreement because they felt it gave the Irish Government a say in the administration of Northern Ireland. <Col N="223" /> This is true; the agreement allows the Irish Government to make proposals on political, security and legal matters and a whole range of other matters which I believe would contribute to a more stable political environment in Northern Ireland and on the island of Ireland.  The Unionist community were told by their leaders that the agreement was a step towards a united Ireland.  This was not the case, as Article 1 clearly shows.  I believe most Unionists below the level of their political leadership &mdash; and perhaps even at that level, although they would not admit it &mdash; now recognise that this is a fallacy.</P>
    <P>The Nationalist community favoured the agreement because they saw that for the first time in 70 years the matters which were of concern to them would be addressed without damaging the interests of their Unionist neighbours.  It was never the intention of either the British or Irish Government to place the Unionist community in an invidious position.  The purpose of the agreement was to provide a process by which the Nationalist community could participate in political structures and begin to identify with the institutions of that society.  This includes participation in and confidence in the security forces to the extent that a Nationalist should be able to join the RUC without in any way being regarded by his neighbours as being less of a Nationalist.  I made that point many years ago when I was co-chairman of the Anglo-Irish Conference.  If there is to be confidence in the security forces then a Nationalist who joins the RUC should still be able to be recognised as a Nationalist.  If this can be achieved then there will be some hope of bringing about peace in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>Any new arrangement which is agreed in Northern Ireland, accepted by the two Governments and endorsed by a referendum, must contain those two ingredients.  Both communities must have confidence in the political <Col N="224" /> structures, must identify with and feel represented in those political structures and have confidence in the security forces.</P>
      <P>Some of the parties concerned are refusing to participate in talks until their preconditions are met.  A political vacuum exists at present.  The British and Irish Governments must not allow this political vacuum to persist.  The Irish Government could begin &mdash; I welcome the points made this morning by the Tánaiste about the Anglo-Irish Agreement &mdash; by addressing all the problems set out in Articles 4 to 10 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  Therein lies the key to political progress on this island.  These Articles deal with political, economic and legal issues and their resolution could benefit not just the Nationalist community but also the Unionist community and make a contribution towards peace.</P>
      <P>Talks about talks do not constitute the kind of dialogue necessary to facilitate a process which will bring about peace and reconciliation, which are so vital to the achievement of stability and normal political exchange.  Aspirations are not enough.  The Governments and politicians must take action and demonstrate that the political process can work.  The future of these two islands depends on that process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Barry for sharing his time with me.  Northern Ireland has been in turmoil for almost a quarter of a century.  The statistics of thousands dead and maimed have been repeated so often that we are in danger of becoming desensitised and almost dehumanised as a community to the full horror and pain they represent.  The extent of the problem becomes apparent when one considers that more than 3,000 people have been killed.  Comparatively speaking, a greater percentage of the population has died in Northern Ireland since the conflict began there than died in the American Civil War.  For this reason alone, this debate is especially welcome; we must never allow ourselves as a nation to become indifferent to or aloof from the problems in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="225" /> Northern Ireland has been a problem on the political agenda of this House for a long time.  It is a problem of equal proportions, if dissimilar in nature, to the many economic problems confronting this Assembly.  The problems in Northern Ireland contribute in a very tangible way to the economic problems of this country. In addition to being a human and political tragedy, the problems in Northern Ireland have had enormous economic consequences.  Countless millions of pounds and punts have been invested and exploded in Northern Ireland and much needed investment has been discouraged because of the troubles.</P>
    <P>The name of Ireland has been sullied throughout the world by ruthless gunmen acting in our name and in defiance of democracy by perpetrating their carnage on innocent victims.  Their most recent atrocity in Warrington is neither excusable nor was it accidential.  Rather, it is part of a strategy designed to inflict terror in the hearts of people and destabilise the institutions of the State and people's confidence in them.</P>
    <P>The ritual condemnation of violence has become part and parcel of our political process.  The vocabulary used in these condemnations has been well nigh exhausted at this stage.  The time is now right for us to move meaningfully and with purpose onto a new agenda which hopefully will bring about a lasting settlement of the Northern problem.  Having said that, important opportunities such as this debate have to be used to restate our total opposition to violence and intimidation as a means of achieving political goals.  To put it simply, the bomb and the bullet have no role to play in our society; they are the tools of the politically inept, the weapons used by those who have been rejected by the democratic process.</P>
    <P>Those elected by the democratic process have enormous responsibilities in this context.  Public representatives in Northern Ireland are not living up to these responsibilities and the vacuum is being filled with the blood of innocent victims who have been killed by terrorists who thrive in this vacuum.  The resolution <Col N="226" /> of these problems does not rest solely in Northern Ireland or among its elected representatives.  The two traditions in the North look in different directions in terms of the State to which they believe they properly belong.  The British and Irish Governments must also play their part in resolving these problems.  Political posturing and fragmentation in regard to Articles 2 and 3 for political gains, and political inaction on the question of improved extradition procedures, do not help resolve the problems.  &ldquo;Green&rdquo; political statements made by Members of the Government parties, including the Taoiseach, which are of relevance only to a bygone era, serve no purpose.  They further delay dialogue, send wrong signals and fuel further Unionists intransigence. To put it simply, such statements have not helped to resolve these difficult problems; rather they have added to them.</P>
    <P>The challenge facing us today in terms of Northern Ireland is the creation of new arrangements and political structures and institutions to accommodate the legitimate aspirations of the two traditions, namely, the right of the Nationalists to effective political and administrative expression of their identity and the right of Unionists to effective political and administrative expression of their identity, ethos and way of life.  Dominance or victory for either tradition is no solution. New arrangements not acceptable to both will ensure continuing violence.  In this regard, I am glad the Government has rejected the idea mooted by John Hume, the leader of the SDLP, of a solution foisted by the two Governments on the two communities, and I am glad to read the Government's response to this which stressed the importance or renewed talks.  However, we need Government action now in this regard. Talk about talks is cheap.</P>
    <P>With regard to Northern Ireland it is all too easy to despair.  Increasing paramilitary violence and political intransigence have driven the people to the streets.  Twenty thousand people marched in Dublin as a response to the latest acts of violence perpetrated in England <Col N="227" /> and in Northern Ireland last Sunday. Similar marches were held throughout the country.  This is, first and foremost, an expression of revulsion by ordinary people, North and South, of violence as a means to a political end.  It is also an expression of frustration with the political process.  We, as democratically elected politicians, must take our cue from this.  The constitutional political parties must never despair as this plays into the hands of the terrorists.  This is the time for brave action in search of a political solution and for effective extradition arrangements from this country.</P>
    <P>A little over 12 months ago I had occasion to visit Northern Ireland, especially Derry and Belfast.  It was informative, if somewhat disheartening. However, I believe there are straws in the wind that offer some hope.  In Derry, a Nationalist-dominated council shares power with Unionists, and today there is a Unionist mayor from the Democratic Unionist Party.  Unfortunately, in Belfast Unionists' intransigence means they cannot even fete our olympic medalists when they return victorious.</P>
    <P>Further evidence of change for the better can be found in the fact that some Unionists have already come to Dublin and spoken.  It can be found in the fact that the Northern Ireland issue is high on the political agenda both in this country and in the United Kingdom.  I believe the election of Mary Robinson as President will be interpreted in the North as a sign of the creation of a more open and pluralist society down here.  Furthermore, I believe that expressions from some elements of the prison community, who are a very important element in the North, questioning the continuing operation of the arms struggle are significant. Indeed, we have heard voices from Sinn Féin saying that no-one can be coerced into a united Ireland.  There is also the possibility of Unionist leaders emerging with some vision and policies, leaders who will break the mould in terms of reactionary intransigence that has, for too long, been the sole response of the <Col N="228" /> Unionist community in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>All in all, I believe an historic cocktail may be beginning to emerge and converge. It is our role as democratic, constitutional representatives of the people to use every means at our disposal to facilitate the emergence and convergence of this cocktail.  It may be some time in the future, but better to light a penny candle than curse the darkness.</P>

For much of the 70 years of its history the minority Catholic population in Northern Ireland was routinely and systematically repressed and deprived of its rights.  Constituency boundaries were rigged and public housing and public jobs were more likely to be given to Protestants than Catholics. Nationalists played little part in the security forces, the Judiciary or the Civil Service. Nationalists were prevented from displaying and enjoying the very emblems of their nationalist identity, the Irish language, music and its culture.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that many Catholics never identified with the State of Northern Ireland in the first instance, but it is equally true to say that this pattern of oppression alienated many who might otherwise have acquiesced.  Even today in 1993, with much of the more overt discrimination removed by the UK Government, there are still many Catholics in Northern Ireland who are profoundly alienated from the state in which they live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What do we do about it?  There are those who say that Northern Ireland has failed as a political entity and should be <Col N="229" /> abolished.  According to this analysis the British Army should withdraw, the British Government should signal its intention to withdraw and the Irish people would come together to negotiate a new and united Ireland.</P>
    <P>I believe, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that this analysis is profoundly and dangerously flawed.  The British presence in Northern Ireland does not consist of some 14,000 troops; it comprises one million people who think of themselves as British &mdash; one million people who identify with the symbols of Britishness up to and including the British Crown.  Northern Ireland is not a colonial outpost, it is not in a post colonial situation.  Northern Protestants were living in Ireland long before Australia was settled and many years before Europe's current political states were established.  These people are not going to set aside their identity just because a British or Irish Government wants them to, and why should they? They are as entitled to their identity as much as any one of us.  There is nothing illegitimate or wrong about the British identity of Northern Protestants.  If we have learned anything from the history of our country and our Continent, we must surely have learned that feelings of national identity are not easily suppressed. We do no service to anyone on this island if we create or seek to create an all-Ireland unitary state with a dissident minority which feels itself to be oppressed.</P>
    <P>It has been said in this debate that the Irish Border is an artificial one.  Perhaps the lines could have been drawn differently, but surely the essential point is that there are one million people in Northern Ireland who want no part of an all-Ireland unitary state.  Until we accept the legitimacy of that decision we will never be able to deal honestly with Unionists.  That is not to say that the <i>status quo</i> is acceptable.  It is common cause between all constitutional parties of Britain and Ireland that the three sets of relationships in these islands have to be radically redefined.</P>
    <P>We must create or help to create in Northern Ireland a structure and administration <Col N="230" /> which both communities can accept.  Discrimination must be eliminated. Human and civil rights must be guaranteed.  Both communities must have a say in the running of ordinary day-to-day life.  Alienation must be combatted, ensuring that as many people as possible have a stake in society. However, in isolation this will not be sufficient.  Many Catholics think of themselves as Irish and identify with Dublin rather than with London.  This fact must be reflected in all-Ireland institutional arrangements.  I do not have a rigid view as to the exact nature of such institutional arrangements, but they must have real teeth.  I fully appreciate that it is difficult for Unionists to accept even the principle of an all-Ireland dimension, but I fully welcome the indications in the position paper which they put to the talks before they were completed last November that they are willing to do that.  The precise functions of an all-Ireland institution can evolve over time; equally any structures which we put in place must recognise and give voice to the identity of Northern Unionists.  This we can best do by enshrining and solemnly repeating the principle of consent, the principle that there will be no change in the status of Northern Ireland without the consent of the majority of the people living in that State given in referendum.</P>
    <P>Many Unionists claim that Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution are an obstacle to peaceful cohabitation on the island. They see the Articles as a threat.  That view can only have been compounded by the Supreme Court decision of some years ago.  Most of us had previously thought of the Articles as an expression of aspiration.  It is fair to say, I think, that if the Constitution were being written anew, Articles 2 and 3 would scarcely appear as they do now.  The Tánaiste recently said that the Articles are not written in bronze.  I fully agree with that, but a referendum is needed to amend the Articles and this referendum must be passed by the Irish people.  A failed referendum would be a major setback and it would be irresponsible to contemplate such a referendum if there was <Col N="231" /> not a decent chance of it being passed. This can only be done in the context of a broader settlement and negotiations between all parties concerned in the future of the peoples of these islands. Having said that, I cannot conceive of any settlement which would not involve a change in Articles 2 and 3, and I believe we should clearly indicate in advance that we are willing to embrace such change.</P>
    <P>Much progress was made during the talks held last year.  I hope those talks will recommence soon.  The talks should be approached in a spirit of openness and generosity.  There is much in the Unionists' position paper of November last that I welcome.  I welcome the acceptance of the Irish dimension, however grudging; I welcome the commitment to a Bill of Rights, I welcome the apparent willingness to develop structures within Northern Ireland that would allow the minority a say.  The Unionist proposals do not go far enough, but it should be acknowledged that they go further than they have done for some years.</P>
    <P>I commend the Tánaiste for the courageous and generous tone of his contribution this morning and his recent speech in the Mansion House.  I am sure that he will have the support of all of the House in his efforts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanBree" hpid="Mr. Bree Mr. Bree">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bree</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much welcome the objective in the Programme for a Partnership Government to recommence and sustain the process of dialogue with the parties in Northern Ireland and with the British Government.  I particularly welcome the proposals to conduct dialogue in a spirit of openness and honesty, with the overriding aim of achieving peace and reconciling the legitimate rights and aspirations of all the people of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join Deputies from all sides of this House in condemning the recent outrages committed in Britain and Northern Ireland and in offering sympathy to the families and communities who have suffered loss.  Members of Dáil Éireann have a duty and an obligation to condemn the activities of the paramilitaries.  We also <Col N="232" /> have an obligation to investigate the source of the ongoing violence in our country and to take active political measures with the aim of achieving peace with justice in our country.</P>
    <P>In recent years many people have been reluctant to criticise the British Government, indeed many people have been afraid to voice concern about much of what has been happening in Northern Ireland, they fearing that they will be branded as Provos or Provo fellow-travellers. All one has to do is merely express concern about British repression in the North and immediately the revisionists in the media and in this House will scream &ldquo;Provo&rdquo; in an attempt to isolate and marginalise one.</P>
    <P>As one who is not a Provo nor a Provo sympathiser, I believe that I speak for the great majority of people when I say that the Irish people have a fundamental and democratic right to unity and independence. This right was most blatantly suppressed by the undemocratic imposition of partition, an imposition that establishes Britain's central guilt and responsibility for the political crisis in Ireland.  It is now just over 70 years since the British Government responded to the struggle for national independence by forcing partition on the Irish people.  The seeds of the ongoing political crisis, the violence, the torture, brutality, deaths and repression, lie in this injustice and are directly Britain's responsibility. Indeed, the continuous political crisis in Northern Ireland since October 1968 has clearly shown that the 1920 solution to the Irish question is a failure.  Partition has distorted the political, economic, social and cultural life of our country and has fostered sectarian divisions among our people.</P>
    <P>Harassment, brutality, ill-treatment, torture, internment and political executions sanctioned or tolerated by the British State for over 20 years have been part and parcel of life in the Six Counties. Non-jury Diplock courts, the use of supergrasses, the blackmailing of young people by the RUC and British Army, the widespread and deadly use of plastic bullets and official shoot-to-kill policies <Col N="233" /> have eroded any confidence people might have had in the law.  We are all aware of the writings and experiences of John Stalker, Fr. Denis Faul, Fr. Raymond Murray and many more courageous people who have documented the ongoing litany of injustice that is Northern Ireland.  It is now an accepted fact that the forces of the British State have been responsible for unjust killings, direct murder and indirect unjust killings and murder by collusion with Loyalist paramilitaries.  Catholics in particular despair of getting fair treatment in human rights from the British Government. Catholics do not trust the RUC and the British Army and regard the Royal Irish Regiment as a sectarian force.  Day in and day out, week in and week out and year in and year out, the British Tory Administration perverts justice by imposing policies that are appropriate only to a totalitarian state.  This is a matter of public record.</P>
    <P>In 1990, the Helsinki Watch Committee published a 93-page report criticising British rule in the North and documenting a wide range of human rights abuses.  In May 1991, Britain was brought before the United Nations Human Rights Committee to answer questions about shoot-to-kill, its responsibility for the continuing armed conflict and discrimination against Nationalists.  The committee expressed dissatisfaction with Britain in all these areas.  In June 1991, Amnesty International issued a 63-page report documenting widespread and systematic abuses of human rights in the North by the British Authorities.  In 1992, Amnesty International released another report showing that these abuses, if anything, have increased.  Britain has been found guilty of human rights violations by the European Court of Human Rights more times than all the other countries put together.  When we receive such reports from other countries &mdash; like South Africa, El Salvador or Iraq, Deputies from all sides of this House raise their voices in protest, yet when it relates to Northern Ireland and our own <Col N="234" /> citizens there is a deafening silence from many Deputies.</P>
    <P>The Twenty-six County State over the years has left a lot to be desired, particularly in terms of secularism and cultural pluralism.  However, the Northern Six County State, since its inception, has been a blatantly undemocratic and sectarian state.  Down through the years Unionist regimes treated Catholics and Nationalists as second-class citizens and imposed a system of discrimination which could only be compared with apartheid in South Africa.  When ordinary people peacefully protested and demanded one man, one vote and civil rights they were beaten off the streets on the direct instructions of Unionist and British politicians. We should remember this when we talk to the Unionist parties.  We are talking to representatives of extreme right-wing parties who have little or no regard for the concept of democracy as we know it.</P>
    <P>As a socialist, I abhor sectarianism and am totally opposed to the concept of a Protestant State or a Catholic State.  Like many people, North and South, I cherish the dream of creating an Irish Republic which could guarantee democracy, secularism and cultural pluralism, a Republic which would unite Protestant, Catholic and dissenter.</P>
    <P>Today there are people on the other side of the House demanding that the people of this country should unilaterally remove Articles 2 and 3 from our Consituation. Articles 2 and 3 did not cause the conflict in Northern Ireland and their deletion will do nothing to stop it. Dropping Articles 2 and 3 would not save a single life.  In fact, the deletion of Articles 2 and 3 would strip Northern Nationalists and Unionists of Irish citizenship and the rights and protection it offers.  It would leave the British claim set out in section 75 of the Government of Ireland Act and section 1 of the Northern Ireland Constitution Act as the only claim to sovereignty.  It has always been accepted that our Government had a constitutional duty to intervene in Northern Irish affairs.  This <Col N="235" /> has been most notable in cases of human rights abuses.  Irish Government Ministers have regularly demanded explanations from the British Government following instances of shoot-to-kill by British forces, unrest in jails, evidence of collusion between the British Army/RUC and Loyalist death squads. They have the legal authority to do this because of the provisions of Articles 2 and 3.  Without these Articles our Government would have no more right to intervene in Northern Ireland than have the French or Pakistani Governments.</P>
    <P>It is right that the Members of this House condemn the activities of the paramilitaries. However, peace and justice can be achieved only by addressing the root cause of the problem, which is the continued interference of Britain in the internal affairs of this country.  Northern Ireland is one of Britain's last colonies.  I believe that, if we are to find a way out of economic decline and the vicious circle of violence in Northern Ireland, we will require an end to British repression and a declaration from the Tory Government that it intends to withdraw within a specific time from all interference in Irish affairs, political, military and economic; thus opening the way for the Irish people, North and South, to determine what future political and economic structures are needed to best serve their interests. The winning of a British declaration of intent to withdraw is of great importance because it would remove from the Unionist leadership the major weapon by which it maintains the division of the people in the North, the so called guarantee of union with Britain.</P>
    <P>The great majority of people in Ireland and indeed our neighbours in Britain desire a peaceful resolution of the Northern conflict.  I believe that by working together we can achieve that resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to these statements.  I thank the two previous speakers for giving me the opportunity to make a short speech. Unfortunately, because of significant interest and the number of Members who wish to contribute, each speaker is limited as to time.</P>
      <P>In the late sixties when the civil rights movement was organised and became active in Northern Ireland very few people anticipated that by 1993, more than 20 years later, more than 3,000 people would be dead and many thousands more would have been injured and maimed, both physically and mentally, in the North.  The formation of the civil rights movement was a direct response to the discrimination that then obtained in the North &mdash; democracy simply did not function there.  The murder, violence and mayhem over all those years have led to a very serious and pronounced polarisation of the two communities in the North.  The ruthlessness with which the Provisional IRA and the paramilitaries on the Protestant side carry out many of these murders makes us despair of a solution ever being found.  The process of ghettoisation which inevitably comes with inter-community violence will take a long time to thaw out.  Overcoming a siege mentality is a slow, tedious process.  In order to reach a final solution it will be necessary to come to terms with this mentality, if we are to overcome the problems that have obtained in the North of Ireland for so long.</P>
      <P>The importance of getting talks going again cannot be over-emphasised.  I believe that if the representatives of the two Unionist parties can be persuaded to sit down in a positive attitude to find a final solution we can put in place a clear, distinct accommodation which would recognise the tradition and culture of the Protestant community in the north.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Removal of Customs frontiers within the EC will see the process of integration accelerated.  Let us hope that that process of acceleration will help to change attitudes in the North of Ireland.  Sometimes here in the South we tend to overlook <Col N="237" /> the fact that, despite the violence and unrest in the North, the economy there is developed and in a condition we might well endeavour to emulate.  Anybody who lives in close proximity to the Border and to the North of Ireland must constantly admire the great sense of organisation and work ethic that obtains there.</P>
    <P>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, has said that if the Provisional IRA will stop and renounce the violence, there is a place for them at the conference table in order to become involved in the political process. Getting all the parties to the table will constitute a momentous step forward. Therein lies the key to progress.</P>
    <P>Enormous responsibility rests with the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dick Spring.  If he can convince the Unionists of our sincerity, then a great obligation to reciprocate will rest with them.  If meaningful talks cannot be got under way, the violence in the North will continue indefinitely.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the local elections due to be held in the North in the month of May are a major inhibition to progress at present.  Clearly, timing is very important. Despair of making progress must never be allowed weigh down our efforts. We must continue to work at the process of bringing the different parties together, getting the representatives around the table and working towards a final and firm solution to what has been a most intractable and historic problem in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for affording me a few minutes to place a couple of points on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been involved on the Border in many respects over many years.  In 1984 and 1985, as Mayor of Drogheda, I initiated the first cross-Border exchange of delegations from local authorities by inviting them to visit us in Drogheda to discuss mutual co-operation between local authorities in the Border area.  That was followed up by an exchange visit or visits.  Nevertheless, the unfortunate position still obtains.  While there was a full attendance by SDLP representatives <Col N="238" /> and Independents, we never achieved any involvement on the part of any public representative of the Unionist parties. That position still obtains today.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Kirk well knows, many important local authority committees in the Border area try to co-operate on infrastructural development, sewerage, water schemes and tourism.  This co-operation has continued during all the violence. It continued on a weekly or monthly basis over the years throughout all of the troubles.  That is why I took strong exception this morning to the remarks of Deputy De Rossa, who made a personal attack on me.  It was not the first time he did so, nor the first time I had to respond.  In that attack he included the SDLP and our colleagues in that party.  I want to say to Deputy De Rossa that his interpretation of what I said in relation to the Unionists, and the manner in which I said it, was totally misrepresented by him this morning.  I never said that the Unionists should go back to where they belong.  I said that, in the context of a united Ireland being achieved by peaceful means, if there were Unionists who wished to continue their allegiance to the British Crown they could very well do, as was done in India, Pakistan, Israel and other countries &mdash; they could be repatriated to their homeland and continue their allegiance there to the British Crown if they were not prepared to give that allegiance to a new all-Ireland democratic State.</P>
    <P>It was in that context that I made those remarks.  Yet Deputy De Rossa continues to misrepresent them.  Since I made those remarks I have seen 16 different versions written.  I made those remarks also in the context of Dr. Ian Paisley's daughter, Rhonda Paisley, actually OK-ing the bombing of publichouses and stores in my constituency, endangering the lives of the people I represent. It was within that overall context and discussion on radio and the media generally that I made those remarks.  I am glad to have the opportunity, once and for all, to nail that down.  In fact, I take it as a compliment, coming from Deputy De Rossa, because while I was commanding <Col N="239" /> troops on the Border in 1969 and 1970 keeping the peace, he was commanding troops blowing up the railway in my constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I addressed the House earlier today I expressed the hope, in view of the gravity of the issues under discussion, that we would have a measured and reflective debate, as free as possible from tactical or partisan considerations. While it might be something of an exaggeration to say that that happened in every case, nevertheless I feel we had many thoughtful contributions which made this debate very worthwhile.</P>
      <P>I believe there were two themes which emerged with great clarity from the interventions from all sides of the House. The first was a strong and unequivocal condemnation of violence, from whatever quarter it may come, and a profound sympathy for those who are its victims. As elected representatives we have also asserted our collective belief that those who seek to impose their will by violence and force act in violation of our shared beliefs and fundamental democratic values.</P>
      <P>The second point, which again was common to a great many interventions from all sides of the House, was the importance and indeed the urgency of renewed political dialogue if we are to find the way forward to a solution.  The Government fully subscribes to both these positions which in a sense form the core of a common approach shared by almost all Members of this House in relation to Northern Ireland.  In that respect the message which will have gone forth from this debate will be a helpful one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I would like to address a number of particular issues which were raised in the course of the debate.  Let me <Col N="241" /> first address the question of differences which Deputies purported to see in the approach between the partners in Government.  I would remind Deputies that this Government was formed on the basis of a carefully worked out Programme for a Partnership Government. That programme contains a full section on Northern Ireland policy.  It deals in detail with a range of aspects of that policy &mdash; political dialogue, the goals of agreement, the measures necessary to deal with violence, the challenges of economic co-operation, the need for a balanced accommodation of the differing positions of the two main traditions on constitutional issues and many other aspects.  That programme remains the common mandate and point of reference for both partners in Government and will ensure that the divisions and dissensions which some Deputies seem to dread so much for us will remain safely at bay.</P>
    <P>In relation to some of the comments made on the Taoiseach's speech and also to related comments on the position of the SDLP, I would remind the House that the goal of our programme is to work towards an accommodation between the two traditions in Ireland based on the principle that both must have equally satisfactory symbolic expression and protection. I subscribe fully to the sentiments which were expressed on the need for a careful and sympathetic understanding of the Unionist tradition on this island.  I have tried as hard as I could to put that into practice since coming into office. However, I must stress that respect for the Unionist tradition must not and should not imply disrespect or disregard for the values of the Nationalist tradition on this island.  Our aim is to extend and not to limit or deny respect for the ethos and identity of each Northern community. A denial of the rights of Northern Nationalists would be just as inconsistent with our programme as a denial of Unionist rights.</P>
    <P>In deploring the ravages of violence in Northern Ireland and elsewhere, including that perpetrated by the IRA, we should also acknowledge how much more extensive the support for such groups <Col N="242" /> might be had not the SDLP, under the leadership of John Hume, consistently and tenaciously fought to show that the true expression of Nationalism is peaceful and political.  The leadership of the SDLP has taken courageous political and, indeed, personal risks to uphold that principle.  In view of some of the comments which have been made here today it is right to put that tribute on the record.</P>
    <P>Another charge that was made was that the positions adopted by the Taoiseach and myself reflected a lack of urgency in our approach to the situation.  I would again remind the House that the Northern Ireland issue has been one of the key priorities of the programme from the outset and our actions reflect that priority.  Since taking office I have had a total of four meetings with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland &mdash; two meetings of the Anglo-Irish Conference and two informal meetings.  We have addressed together, as a matter of the greatest urgency, how we can both help to achieve the resumption of talks.  We remain in continuous contact on the subject.</P>
    <P>I have met the leadership of the SDLP and Alliance parties.  If I have not had meetings with Unionist parties in Northern Ireland it has certainly not been for lack of interest or lack of trying.  While I regret that it has not as yet been possible to establish the direct face-to-face contact with the Unionist leadership that I would like to see in place, nevertheless I have done my utmost to ensure that I have first-hand knowledge of as many strands of Unionist opinion, whether political or otherwise, as I can manage to acquire.  I can safely say that no day has gone by since I assumed office that I have not devoted at least a part of it to work on some aspect or another of the Northern Ireland problem.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has met the President of the United States and the top echelons of American political leadership to update them on this problem and to ensure that the great potential for good offered by the interest and concern of the United States is brought to <Col N="243" /> bear as helpfully as possible on the search for a solution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred to the possibility of a peace forum.  I share his concern to ensure the widest possible consultation and consensus between all sides of this House in relation to the Northern Ireland problem.  For this reason one of my first acts as Minister for Foreign Affairs was to offer a full briefing on the current situation in regard to Northern Ireland to the Fine Gael spokesperson on Foreign Affairs.  This offer has not been taken up, but is still available to Opposition spokespersons.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that he would be more than welcome.  I wish to emphasise my availability to party leaders or their spokespersons, both individually and collectively, for discussion and consultation in relation to Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I was at pains to ensure that a Foreign Affairs Committee was brought forward as a priority objective.  Subject to certain constraints arising from the obvious sensitivity of some issues, such as security, the proposed Foreign Affairs Committee can be a valuable forum for inter-party discussions on the issue of Northern Ireland and for exploration by all the parties in this House as to how progress towards peace can best be made.  I would not claim that any party in this House has the answers and it will test all the parties to find the answers to the difficult problems.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is very welcome to the debate at this hour of the day.  I have notified the Whips that I am agreeable to appropriate provisions being made for this purpose in the terms of reference of the proposed committee which are under consideration at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debates in the Seanad last week <Col N="244" /> and in this House today are a forum in which Members of the Oireachtas can offer their opinions on the best way to achieve peace and stability.  I look forward to their continuation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton also spoke of the Unionist paper which had been submitted at the end of the last round of talks.  I was not a member of the Irish Government delegation which took part in those talks.  However, I have studied the papers.  The paper he referred to was put forward after a general election had been called in this jurisdiction and in the context of a Unionist refusal to agree to &ldquo;time out&rdquo; for the election period, as had been the precedent in the case of the British general election earlier last year. Therefore, perhaps it was inevitable that the paper should have been seen as a tactical exercise, all the more so in that it was vague on the scope and functions of the proposed Inter-Irish relations committee but very specific on the point that the conference which was scheduled for mid-November should be the last conference and should, moreover, announce the modalities of a referendum on Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>However, I agree with the view expressed by many people here today and since last November, that there were positive developments from the talks that took place last year.  The recognition by the Unionist leadership of the need for new arrangements, including new structures, to cater for the identity and aspirations of the Nationalist community was a step forward.  The conclusion I draw from the discussion of this paper is this: if its potential is as great as its authors suggest it is a very strong reason for them to return to the negotiating table to explore that potential further and to carry forward the process of dialogue.</P>
    <P>I listened with care to the comments made by a number of speakers in relation to problems arising for the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland, in relation to confidence issues and the closure of cross-Border roads, which also inconvenience a large number of people on this side of the Border, as has been made clear by several Deputies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="245" /> The matters of cross-Border roads and confidence in the security forces are constantly on the agenda of the Anglo-Irish Conference and it is my intention that they should remain firmly on it in the hope that we can achieve progress.  I am well aware from the deputations I have met and from contacts with Deputies of the inconvenience and disruption in the economic and social life of Border counties caused by the closure of cross-Border roads.  I will pursue an active policy to try to convince the British Government and the authorities in Northern Ireland that it would be helpful if many of these roads were re-opened to allow normal community interaction to take place in the Border counties.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, it is the policy of the Government to seek progress in relation to the Northern Ireland problem at every level possible.  We are pursuing the question of resumed dialogue vigorously and energetically.  At the same time I want to underline carefully and adamantly that there is no political vacuum.  The provisions of the Anglo-Irish Agreement are being implemented as fully and as extensively as is within our power.  At the meetings of the Anglo-Irish Conference which I have chaired these issues have featured prominently on the agenda.  Progress is not always as rapid as we would like.  Nevertheless, I wish to reassure Deputies, as I have made clear in public statements I have made elsewhere, that these issues are not being and will not be neglected. They will continue to have my full attention as co-chairman of the Anglo-Irish Conference.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of progress in the political field it is our joint intention in the Anglo-Irish Conference that a whole range of issues will be discussed with other Ministers. Apart from myself and the Minister for Justice attending to deal with security matters in the norm, we also had the Minister for Tourism and Trade at the last meeting.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment will attend the next meeting and, throughout the rest of the year at scheduled meetings Ministers from economic and social areas and, <Col N="246" /> indeed, arts and culture, will be attending to ensure that the wider agenda between North and South can be addressed in the context of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <P>Some people have referred to suggestions and articles in the press in relation to the workings of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. I can assure Members on all sides of this House that it is my firm intention that the Anglo-Irish Agreement, which I personally and politically value as an important instrument between the Irish and British Governments, will be fully implemented.  It is important to reiterate that it is not in the interest only of one community in Northern Ireland.  The proper and full implementation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, I strongly believe, is in the best interests of all people there, both the Unionist and Nationalist communities.  I would like to think that the Unionist community could view it in that light.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the importance of cross-Border economic co-operation. Many Deputies, particularly those in Border counties, raised this issue.  I can assure the House that the Government will use all its resources to advance the process in every way open to us.  I echo also the tributes paid to the agencies active in this area.  The work of the International Fund for Ireland has had a particularly beneficial effect in the 12 counties where it operates, both in terms of the funds which the donors have generously made available and the role of the fund in making use of them, in the interest, in particular, of disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>The problem of Northern Ireland is in the first rank of issues which confront this Government.  There can be no doubting the determination of the Government to achieve political progress which will facilitate an agreed solution.  This is one of our central objectives as a Government and is one to which we are profoundly dedicated.  It is not a matter which comes and goes on our agenda; it occupies constantly the highest possible position.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice set out in some detail the action being taken to ensure <Col N="247" /> that those who resort to violence do not succeed and are made answerable before the law.  Everyone in Northern Ireland, and in these islands generally, is entitled to lead his or her life in peace, protected from the threat of murder from whatever quarter.</P>
    <P>This Government is resolutely opposed to terrorism in all its forms.  We have unhesitatingly committed enormous resources to combating it and will continue to do so for as long as that is necessary.  Our security co-operation with the British authorities is at an unprecedented level.  This has been publicly acknowledged on several occasions by the British Government in recent months.  We are determined to maintain this level of co-operation with the British Government in order to ensure that those who resort to violence do not succeed, and never will succeed, on this island.</P>
    <P>The initiation of a process of political dialogue involving a range of different and conflicting interests is no easy task. It calls for courage, patience and goodwill on all sides.  It calls for a readiness on the part of all participants to adjust their positions to those of others and to explore actively areas of potential co-operation and agreement.  This Government has been actively and assiduously exploring such areas.  Every conceivable approach which might assist in a resumption of talks on agreed terms has been and will continue to be examined.  We are engaged in a process of continuous and intensive consultation with the various interests involved in the search for a way forward.</P>
    <P>I have said again and again that the reality is that neither tradition can dominate or coerce the other, whether in a Northern Ireland or in an all-Ireland context.  We must seek to build new political arrangements on this basic reality.  That will require compromise on all sides, ours no less than theirs, but negotiations are needed to establish the lines on which a stable accommodation <Col N="248" /> must be found.  To achieve this would be the single most important contribution which could be made to all our futures.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention the work of the British-Irish parliamentary tier with the founding of which I was associated.  At that time it was a very important inter-parliamentary body.  I want to ensure that members of the British-Irish tier can resume their work as soon as possible.  It is a very important instrument between these two islands in breaking down mis-comprehensions which existed for many years between Members of this House, the Seanad, the House of Commons and the House of Lords.  To date its work has been instructive and, indeed, constructive. I hope Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas and our colleagues in London will continue to build on the foundations which the British-Irish parliamentary tier founded in its short time.</P>
    <P>I can also assure the House that the British Government is as anxious and determined to bring this conflict to an end as is the Irish Government.  I had extensive experience in working with the British Government in the eighties.  I cannot in any way fault the approach of that Government now or, indeed, then.  Just as we share the burden of the historical conflict in this island, we must strive to find a lasting solution which will lead to peace and reconciliation on this island.</P>
    <P>Far from contenting ourselves with words, as some might like to suggest, I believe the approach of this Government is practical and action-oriented.  We have a clear political purpose in view &mdash; the recommencement of political dialogue at the earliest opportunity.  The obstacles are formidable but, with sufficient patience and determination, we may reach our objective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this topic on foot of reports in daily newspapers which quote the Minister as saying we must burn our own toxic waste.  The Minister also said that Ireland will have to face up to reality and build its own toxic waste incinerator, but I ask him to what reality does he refer?   We all know that there is toxic waste here, but our first premise should not be to accept the present level of toxic waste and concede the need to build a national incinerator. There are some questions that need to be asked in this regard.  For example, how much toxic waste is generated here and why is it being generated here?  How can it be reduced?  How is it being treated at present and what are the future options?  We do not know how much toxic waste is generated at present.  I would like to know the steps this Government is taking, if any, to persuade companies using toxic materials to find replacements to reduce the amounts and recycle materials.  Is the Minister aware of the number of companies who have voluntarily undertaken programmes of waste reduction?</P>
      <P>We should regard these ventures as pilot programmes and learn from them. They can show us the way to deal with waste.  I cannot accept the Minister's view that Europe is imposing the solution of a toxic waste incinerator on us although I have views on the emphasis the EC is putting on waste disposal.  I earnestly entreat the Minister to introduce the new waste legislation as a matter of urgency and to place major emphasis on waste prevention and minimalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should have a policy on regional waste management.  Some local authorities <Col N="250" /> have organised successful pilot programmes. We need to establish such programmes nationwide.</P>
    <P>We could make a start by a public education programme to alert people on the steps they can take at home, in the garden, in schools, at work and in garages to minimise waste and to control the use of toxic materials, which are in daily domestic use.  I find it disturbing that our whole emphasis is topsy-turvy.  Indeed, it was borne out at Question Time today that we are not putting enough emphasis on waste reduction.  One report says that once a hazardous waste incinerator is built it will become a disincentive to waste reduction and prevention and a stimulus to polluting industries to move to Ireland. My great fear is that the signal we are sending out will give a totally wrong picture of the way we should be addressing our waste problem.  I ask the Minister to bring forward the anticipated legislation as soon as possible and place the emphasis on prevention and recycling instead of disposal in land filled sites and by incineration.</P>

      <P>Irish waste policy is committed to respecting the hierarchy of waste management strategies established by the European Community.  This gives primacy of place, where possible, to <Col N="251" /> waste prevention, followed by promotion of recycling, reuse and then by the optimisation of final disposal methods for waste which cannot be reused.  We have recently developed a number of initiatives to assist waste prevention and reduction.  These include a study of clean technologies commissioned by my Department from international consultants and the establishment of relevant information services for industry. Nowhere in the European Community is it the case that waste prevention measures account at present for anything but a relatively small proportion of overall waste generated.  Other waste management strategies are also necessary, as is envisaged in the EC Framework Directive. Among these other strategies, incineration is well recognised and extensively practised throughout the industrialised world.  I find it extraordinary that countries like Denmark and the Netherlands, which are constantly cited as the countries that give primacy of place to the environment and lead the field in terms of implementation of EC directives, have both placed incineration at the centre of how they manage waste which cannot otherwise be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Environmental standards are becoming increasingly higher.  At EC level there are two directives already in place in relation to municipal waste incineration, a further draft directive on the incineration of hazardous waste and a draft directive on packaging waste which recognises incineration with recovery as a reasonable environmental solution. Against this widespread recognition of waste incineration as an environmentally acceptable strategy, it would not be sensible for us to discard incineration as a possible solution to certain difficult waste management problems.  Irish policy on this question was set out in the Environmental Action Programme 1990 which recognised the need for sophisticated and safe methods of disposal for hazardous waste and proposed to grant-aid the provision <Col N="252" /> of a central hazardous waste incinerator. Subsequently the need for this facility was endorsed by the Culliton report, which pressed for an early decision on the safe disposal of hazardous waste to facilitate further industrial development.</P>
    <P>Without prejudice to the overall policy established in the Environmental Action Programme, my Department for some time, has been conducting a more detailed review of hazardous waste management requirements in the light of various developments since 1990.  It is proposed, for instance, that the draft EC directive on hazardous waste incineration would encompass clinical waste.  We have approximately 150 small, relatively inefficient hospital incinerators operating around the country which do not meet the best international standards.  This requires action and we must consider how best to replace these existing facilities.  In addition, the dumping of sewage sludge at sea must be discontinued from 1998 for environmental reasons but the disposal of this waste on land may not be feasible in all cases.  What then is the best solution? In short, waste disposal problems will not go away.  There are no simple answers. Incineration must be considered, at least, as one element of the solution.</P>
    <P>I intend to announce a strategy based on the current review in the context of the new national development plan.  The <i>status quo</i> is not a viable option.  The thrust of EC environmental policy is towards self-sufficiency and involves disposal of waste as near as possible to its source, making use of the most appropriate technologies to ensure environmental protection.  This thinking is reflected in the increasing reluctance of other EC and EFTA countries to take waste from elsewhere.</P>
    <P>While we have made notable progress in recent years in recycling industrial solvents, the rate of recycling now stands at 70 per cent, Irish industry still generates some 60,000 tonnes of hazardous waste per annum.  Indeed, a significant residue <Col N="253" /> of this is currently exported for disposal by incineration and other means.  I have to continue to seek a derogation in order to be able to export our waste, for which we have no immediate solutions.</P>
    <P>We are currently examining the optimisation of waste management resources through the application of a mix of strategies. To suggest, as some interests do in a one-sided way, that the issue of waste can be addressed solely by relying on either waste prevention or disposal or that one approach excludes the other is to create a false impression.  We will continue to promote waste recycling and prevention but we are realistic enough to accept that a range of safe disposal options is also essential.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am given to understand that it is proposed to sell the Teagasc premises at Sandymount Avenue in Dublin.  Those premises, as I am sure the Minister is aware, were purpose built for An Foras Talúntais many years ago and passed to Teagasc, when that organisation was set up in 1988.</P>
      <P>I understand the proposal to sell the premises arises directly from the very restrictive approach to the funding of Teagasc taken by successive Governments and by successive Fianna Fáil Ministers for Agriculture ever since it was set up in 1988.  From its very inception it has been unmercifully squeezed both in relation to current and capital funding.  It is the fact that it has been throttled by Fianna Fáil Ministers for Agriculture that has apparently led to the current proposal to sell the premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that the current market value of the premises at Sandymount Avenue is estimated to be between £1.5 million and £2 million but that the replacement cost of the site and building is estimated at £4.5 million.  Apart from the acquisition of new premises, relocation costs are estimated at about £800,000, including the cost of the first <Col N="254" /> year's rental on new premises.  In addition, there would be recurring annual costs as a consequence of the sale, amounting to £300,000 for administration and management and a further £300,000 for the extra costs of carrying out the current range of activities from new and more dispersed locations.</P>
    <P>There is an alternative to outright sale, to mortgage the premises.  A suggestion has been made that a mortgage be taken out of 75 per cent of the assessed market value of the premises. On the analysis I have seen, any mortgage up to a market value of £4 million would produce a financially more attractive result than outright sale at a price of between £1.5 million and £2 million. There is a very clear question here in relation to the taxpayers' interests and the interests of Teagasc.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of sections 15 and 21 and the First Schedule of the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act, 1988, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has a direct key role in any decision about property in the possession of Teagasc.  I would like the Minister to give a clear account of the current financial position of Teagasc which has led to the proposal being made.  Why is the sale of the Sandymount Avenue premises being considered?  Is it, for example, for the reason enunciated some time ago in Enniscorthy by the current chairman of Teagasc, a man noted for his tact and gentleness, who said the premises would have to be sold to stop the animals from wandering back into the sheds?  Will the Minister tell us what other options, if any, have been considered, what the benefits, if any, of those options will be, where those benefits will accrue and how?  In the absence of clear explanations on those points I fear very much that the interests of Teagasc and of the general taxpayer will be seriously at risk.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with accumulated borrowings of the order of £10 million by 1992.  In order to place the organisation on a sound financial footing an efficiency plan was drawn up last year by a working group representative of my Department and Teagasc.  This plan was adopted by the authority and accepted by me and the Minister for Finance.  The plan involves the rationalisation of Teagasc's physical resources, selected voluntary early retirement, improved income through increased charges for its services, efficiencies within the organisation and the funding of £6 million to reduce the core debt.  The plan is now in the course of implementation and the Government made a once off payment of £4 million to Teagasc last December for the purpose of reducing its core debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the efficiency plan it was envisaged that a reduction of £6 million in the accumulated borrowings would be achieved through the once-off Exchequer £4 million contribution and £2 million from Teagasc by disposal of surplus assets.  I understand that the sale of headquarters was identified in the efficiency plan as the most appropriate means of raising the authority's contribution.  They recently decided that in order to assess adequately the various options open to them in relation to the headquarters building it would be necessary to establish the market value of the property. Accordingly, it was advertised for sale on 10 March last.  The Teagasc authority will consider its options having regard to the market response.  They will also have full regard to the costs of relocation of headquarters and to the performance of the functions carried out from the headquarters <Col N="256" /> office.  The options include direct sale, sale and lease-back or a mortgage on the property.  None of these options will involve a loss of employment for the staff in question.</P>
    <P>The manner in which Teagasc's contribution of £2 million is raised is primarily a matter for the authority subject, of course, in respect of the disposal of assets, to the approval of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in accordance with section (1) of the First Schedule of the Teagasc Act, 1988.  It is important to realise that the efficiency plan was drawn up and agreed as being the most effective means of ensuring long term financial viability for Teagasc consistent with delivery of relevant and cost-effective services to the agriculture and food industry.  A central element of the plan was the provision of £6 million to eliminate or reduce the core debt.  The Government had provided £4 million of this and it is essential that Teagasc provides the balance of £2 million.  This is the context in which the authority has decided to place the headquarters on the market.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House this evening to deal with this matter of extreme importance to farmers in rural Ireland.  The buy-out purchase scheme was introduced by the Minister last year in response to severe difficulties being experienced by farmers on the matter of land purchase annuities.  This is a welcome scheme. However, by demanding immediate payment <Col N="257" /> by farmers of the purchase annuities the Minister is attempting to draw blood from a turnip &mdash; the Minister and his Department will be quite familiar with that vegetable.  It is unreasonable to expect thousands of farmers, many of whom received notices in the last fortnight, to make payments to the Department of the order of £3,000 or £4,000 by 31 March, which was yesterday.  Unless the deadline is extended for a period of perhaps a couple of months the buy-out scheme will amount to little more than a useless exercise.</P>
      <P>In the interests of fair play and to ensure a reasonable take up of what is basically a sound scheme I ask that the deadline be extended.  The Minister must be aware that farmers do not have ready access to cash.  Indeed as most of them will have to apply to financial institutions for loans &mdash; it takes four to six weeks to process loan applications and we all know how anti-flaithiúlach financial institutions have been to farmers in recent times &mdash; it will be some time before they are able to make payment.  If the Minister extends the deadline the scheme will be an even better one.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Flanagan for allowing me share his time in respect of this important matter.  I welcomed the initiative taken by the Minister in 1992 in introducing this important scheme which was designed to eliminate serious financial hardship experienced by a number of small farmers in respect of payments of annuities to the Land Commission.  In operating the buy-out scheme the Minister should ensure that further financial difficulties are not created.  He should understand that the deadline of 31 March, 1993, and the notice given in respect of the matter is not enough, particularly at this time of year, because of the seasonal nature of farm income receipts.  The deadline is insufficient to ensure that the maximum number of applicants participate in this scheme.  I do not wish us to have to come back to <Col N="258" /> the House in a year or two to revamp a scheme that has the capacity to work effectively and to solve the problem.  I appeal to the Minister to give more time for this matter to be resolved, by extending the deadline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Flanagan for raising this matter and also his colleague, Deputy Hogan, for his contribution. I acknowledge that both Deputies have supported this scheme which was introduced some months ago for the purpose of relieving the financial burden on many farmers.</P>
      <P>I am happy to inform the Deputies that the deadline for exercising the option to buy-out land annuities at a discount of 50 per cent of the outstanding advance has been extended to 31 May 1993.  This extension should allow ample time to all interested farmers to take up the buy-out offer.  I am very pleased with the interest already expressed by farmers in the scheme and to date some 6,000 of the 13,500 potential participants have taken up the buy-out offer which is an indication of the attractiveness of the scheme and its acceptability to the farming community.</P>
      <P>The overall land annuity package agreed by the Government last September is a very generous one.  It involves benefits for some 42,500 annuitants and should resolve what has been for some time a growing problem and one which has considerable social implications.  The package provides that with effect from 1 May 1993 all land annuities over 10 per cent are to be reduced to a common 10 per cent rate and repayment periods are to be rescheduled; all small land annuities with half-yearly instalments of less than £10 are to be written off; a buy-out discount of 50 per cent of the outstanding advance is offered to every annuity payer not in arrears.</P>
      <P>The buy-out discount can be availed of by all annuity payers but those in arrears must pay any arrears in full no later than the date of their buy-out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="259" /> The scheme is a generous one and is recognised by farmers themselves as evidenced by the take-up already.  The extension to the end of May will help farmers to make full use of the arrangement and to avail of the more favourable borrowing which is now developing.  The overall package will resolve the land <Col N="260" /> annuity problem once and for all.  I have also had discussions with the major banks and have pressed on them the importance of assisting farmers in raising finance when necessary.</P>

      <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1992 (S.I. No. 209 of 1992) amended the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1990 (S.I. No. 25 of 1990) as regards environmental impact assessment for projects, other than road works, which a local authority proposes to undertake outside its functional area.  Such projects require planning permission and the changes introduced by the 1992 Regulations require them to undergo EIA through the planning process in the same way as private development.</P>

This recognises the importance of improving the road network to help promote economic development and assist the economy to derive full benefit from the Single Market, while also ensuring that this work is undertaken in such a way as to prevent, reduce or offset any significant adverse effects on the environment.  The evaluation of all significant road projects, including those submitted for Cohesion Fund assistance, includes either a review of any likely significant environmental effects or a full environmental impact assessment, whichever is appropriate.</P>

      <P>Primary responsibility at Government level for energy conservation and efficiency measures rests with the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  However, my Department will later this year undertake jointly with the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications a public awareness campaign relating to climate change.  The campaign will be coordinated <Col N="152" /> with existing energy conservation programmes and will focus on how individual action in relation to energy consumption can help to mitigate global climate change.</P>
      <P>Public lighting offers opportunities for energy conservation.  Since 1991, my Department has had a programme in place to replace street/road lights on national roads with modern, energy efficient SOx lanterns.  Local authorities are carrying out corresponding light replacement programmes on non-national roads from their own resources.</P>
      <P>In March 1992, my Department, wrote to local authorities about the environmental and financial benefits to be gained by replacing inefficient lighting and by identifying, in conjunction with the ESB, other electrical energy saving opportunities in their premises and plant.</P>
      <P>I am considering provisions to give effect to the measures in the Programme for a Partnership Government on improved energy efficiency in local authority buildings and housing and, in conjunction with the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, the introduction of requirements for thermal efficiency audits.  The application of new environmentally-friendly technologies to deal with waste disposal, while also providing useful energy for heating, is also under examination.</P>

In addition to the normal, mileage-related, block grants for improvement and maintenance, this total includes a supplementary grant of £700,000 in recognition of the special needs of that county, as well as £350,000 for pilot schemes, and £500,000 for Interreg schemes.  The funds available to me in 1993 for road grants have been fully allocated and there are no funds at my disposal from which an additional allocation could be made to any road authority this year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>Government policy in relation to the provision of accommodation for travellers is outlined in the Programme for a Partnership Government and in &ldquo;A Plan for Social Housing&rdquo;.  Policy in the matter is underpinned by commitments to continue to make adequate finance available to local authorities for the provision by them of residential caravan parks.  Local authorities are being continually urged to press ahead with their programme for the provision of such parks.</P>
      <P>The determination of the form of accommodation to be provided for travellers, whether in standard housing, group housing or caravan parks, and its location, size etc, are matters for individual local authorities to decide having regard to local circumstances and the needs of travellers.  Accordingly, it would not be practical to set down centrally specific targets on the number of sites to be provided in each area; this is more appropriately a matter for settlement by authorities themselves.  Local authorities have been directed to include an assessment of the needs of travellers for accommodation in residential caravan parks as part of the assessment of housing needs which they have been asked to carry out by 31 March 1993.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to give details at this stage of the number or location of permanent caravan parks which will be provided by each housing authority in 1993 or in any subsequent year.  Information on the caravan parks provided by housing authorities up to 31 December 1992, based on information supplied by the authorities, is given in a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>Agreement was reached at the EC Environment Council of 22-23 March 1993 on a Council decision for a monitoring mechanism of Community CO 2 and other greenhouse gas emissions. While no formal CO 2 monitoring obligations exist pending the adoption of this decision, Ireland in common with other member states has already submitted a national CO 2 strategy to the EC Commission; I intend to publish this shortly.</P>
      <P>EC policy is to stabilise CO 2 emissions on an overall Community basis.  It recognises that countries such as Ireland with, as yet, relatively low energy requirements which can be expected to grow in step with their development, may need targets and strategies which can accommodate that development, while improving the energy efficiency of their economic activities.</P>

      <P>The N9 forms part of the network of national primary routes.  Over £35 million in road grants has been paid to the relevant local authorities in respect of improvement works on the route in the period 1989-92, all of which has been co-financed from the European Regional Development Fund at a rate of up to 75 per cent.</P>
      <P>Improvement schemes carried out or underway include realignment at Paulstown, County Kilkenny costing £693,000 and the Kilcullen element of the Newbridge-Kilcullen by-pass project.  This latter has an overall cost estimate of some £58 million, of which about a third relates to the Kilcullen link.  Spending on the project to the end of 1992 amounted to over £32 million.  In addition, a total of £2.426 million was paid in the period for other improvement works on the route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1993 road grant allocations which I have recently notified to local authorities include a grant of £15 million for the continuation of work on the Newbridge-Kilcullen project; a further £1.67 million for construction work on the N9 route in Kildare, Carlow and Kilkenny; and £550,000 for design work on a number of <Col N="160" /> other major schemes viz Terminus Street (Waterford); Grannagh-Waterford (County Kilkenny); Moone-Timolin and Ballitore Hill (Kildare).

      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 45, 83 and 84 together.  Regulations to be made shortly by the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment will, together with appropriate administrative measures, give effect as far as possible to Council Directive 91/157/EEC.  It was envisaged that member states should transpose this Directive before 18 Sep-tember, 1992.  However, some provisions of the Directive cannot be fully implemented because of delay at EC level in drawing up certain detailed arrangements pursuant to Article 4.  A Commission Directive incorporating these arrangements is likely to come into force on 1 January, 1994 and will require further national regulations for its transposition.</P>
      <P>Measures to inform consumers of the dangers of uncontrolled disposal of spent batteries, and to ensure their separate collection with a view to recovery or disposal, will be developed in the context of the forthcoming Commission Directive.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that Waterford County Council has any proposals involving job losses among outdoor staff arising from the discretionary grant allocation of £1,599,000 which I notified recently to the Council.  While the provision is some 7 per cent less than the 1992 allocation, it still represents a substantial level of State assistance towards the maintenance and improvement of county and regional roads, particularly at a time when there is a continuing need for tight controls on public expenditure.  I should also point to the increase of over 60 per cent in the allocation to Waterford County Council in 1993 for national roads, compared with grants paid last year.  I understand that there is some scope for work to be carried out by the Council's direct labour unit within the total grant allocation of £7,161,000 for these roads.</P>

      <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government sets out measures to tackle effectively the problem of homelessness.  In so far as these measures are the concern of my Department, they are being pursued in consultation with local authorities.  In this connection, I refer to the reply to Questions Nos. 121, 122 and 123 of 16 February, 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The funding for assistance to voluntary bodies providing accommodation, including accommodation for homeless persons, under the Capital Assistance <Col N="165" /> Scheme has been increased from £11 million in 1992 to £12.5 million in 1993.  In addition, there has been an increase in 1993, compared with the corresponding 1992 expenditure, in the provision for recoupments to housing authorities of expenditure incurred by them under section 10 of the Housing Act, 1988 in contributing to voluntary bodies who accommodate homeless persons.  The expansion of the local authority house building programme to 3,500 &ldquo;starts&rdquo; this year and the Government's commitment to appropriate long term house building programme will benefit the homeless as well as other categories of housing need.</P>

    <P>Schemes under I and 2 are being examined at present and a decision regarding grant approval will be made as soon as possible.  In the case of the other schemes listed, group scheme grants and contributions from group members are unlikely to suffice to finance these schemes, which in consequence, may require a substantial contribution from the provision for public water and sanitary services schemes.  Having regard to the overall demands on the water and sanitary services programme, I cannot say when it may be possible to approve these schemes.</P>

These discussions have identified potential areas for joint action by the Union under the provisions of Article J.3 of the Treaty and have considered elements for a policy of the Union in the security field.  The first report from Foreign Ministers on the subject was endorsed at the Lisbon European Council last June and may be found at Annex I of the Conclusions of that Council, a copy of which is in the Dáil Library. A second report was agreed by Foreign Ministers in December and a copy of this has also been lodged in the Dáil Library. <Col N="171" /> The discussions have not dealt with a defence policy for the Union and have not involved personnel from the Irish Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>The investment/financial services sector is a very wide area covering many activities and institutions.</P>
      <P>Under the Central Bank Act, 1989, the Central Bank is the regulatory authority for banks and companies operating in the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC.  The Central Bank also supervises the building societies under the Building Societies Act, 1989.  Legislation in this area is the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Stock Exchange, under an Act dating from 1799, the Minister for Finance approves the rules of the Exchange and issues gilt dealer licences, which are a prerequisite for membership <Col N="172" /> of the Exchange.  However, the Government has already announced that it had decided to introduce legislation to change and update the existing regulation and supervision of the Irish Stock Exchange and its members.  This legislation is intended to replace the existing legislation, which is inadequate for supervisory purposes, and for compliance with the requirements of the EC Investment Services Directive which is expected to be adopted very shortly.  The Government also decided that the Central Bank of Ireland should be the regulatory authority in this area.</P>
    <P>Regulation in relation to the listing functions of the Exchange are a matter for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <P>The Government has also announced that responsibility for the prudential supervision of financial service intermediaries whose activities are not currently subject to regulation will be assigned to the Central Bank.  The process of preparing the complex necessary legislation giving effect to this decision is currently underway in conjunction with the Central Bank.  It is envisaged that the legislation will also deal with the transposition of the EC Directives on Investment Services and Capital Adequacy, which set out certain regulatory and supervisory requirements in this area. Arrangements to conform with these requirements will have to be in operation by the end of 1995 at the latest.</P>
    <P>Insurance services and insurance intermediaries are subject to the arrangements in the Insurance Act, 1989, and this is a matter for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied with the regulatory framework as it applies to my area of responsibility.  Legislation will be introduced to improve supervision and to allow the Central Bank supervise the Stock Exchange and financial services intermediaries.</P>

      <P>The estimated cost of the new sewage system for the Burren National Park visitor centre is £144,000.  This system has been installed.</P>
      <P>OPW does not manage a visitor centre at Glenbeigh, County Kerry.  I assume therefore the Deputy is referring to the award winning national park visitor centre at Glenveagh, County Donegal. This centre is not in a village; rather it is located at the park so that everyone and not just specialists can gain access to their heritage.  The Glenveagh centre was built in the mid-eighties and a detailed cost breakdown is not available.  The cost per square metre of the centre at present day values is £2,800.  The Burren Centre compares very favourably with this at £1,050 per square metre.</P>
      <P>The cost of monitoring and analysis of effluent at the Burren would be comparable to the costs at Killarney National Park where an elaborate treatment system at Muckross House is managed effectively.  These costs are approximately £10,000 per annum and cover daily monitoring by Office of Public Works staff, analysis by the local authority once a week and contract maintenance. These estimates include the cost of meeting all of the conditions laid down in the discharge licence of the Burren. Office of Public Works do not have available similar costs for other centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no evidence to show that there would be any savings if the centre were located in a village.  At a meeting between Clare County Council, Office of Public Works and objectors to the project last <Col N="174" /> year, it was felt that the alternative proposal of a network of smaller centres in the surrounding villages could, in fact, give rise to much more expensive sewerage treatment costs given the present capacity of the existing systems in some of the villages.  Furthermore, the recent proposal that an information office and car-park be located at the existing visitor centre site would necessitate the retention of the treatment system already installed at the site as sanitary facilities would have to be provided for visitors.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am advised that the siting of the centre conforms to accepted international standards.  I would urge Deputies who have not done so to visit the purpose built centre at Glenveagh to see how it operates and also to go and see the site of the centre for the Burren.</P>

      <P>The restoration of the Royal Canal in the area from the North Strand to Ballybough and Drumcondra has been the most difficult experienced so far on the canal.  In undertaking the removal of vast amounts of accumulated debris with very difficult access, the Office of Public Works workforce, while working in very trying circumstances, has had to bear the brunt of repeated anti-social behaviour by local youths.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The large site referred to at Clarkes Bridge is not owned by the Office of Public Works.  It was sold some years ago by CIE to Messrs.  David Allen, the advertising hoarding concern.  Despite this, in the course of their work on the canal nearby, the Office of Public Works did remove a large amount of debris from <Col N="175" /> this site.  The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible for the Office of Public Works to ensure that no loose material is dumped or transferred to this site.  Every effort is made to ensure that the works on the canal will be carried out so as to minimise any risk of debris and loose material becoming available.</P>

In order to qualify for benefit, claimants must have sufficient PRSI contributions to satisfy the statutory conditions applicable in their case.</P>
      <P>I was glad to have been able to extend the scheme to include the dependent spouses of qualified insured workers from October 1987.  Initially, however, many spouses experienced difficulty in getting necessary dental treatment because of a dispute with the Irish Dental Association.</P>
      <P>The dispute has now been resolved and all dentists on my Department's dental panel are providing treatment to all qualified persons.  Some 300,000 dependent spouses can now avail of the dental treatment under the scheme simply by arranging an appointment with their dentist.</P>

A revised explanatory leaflet on treatment benefits is currently being prepared to reflect the latest changes in the scheme. In addition, my Department has recently issued notices on dental benefit for display in all dental surgeries and in local social welfare offices around the country.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> Household waste is not at present discabl <Col N="181" /> posed of in Ireland by means of incineration. If municipal waste incineration were to be introduced by a local authority or private waste operator, any proposals would be subject to licensing either under the Air Pollution Act, 1987 or, in due course, under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992.  Emission standards specified in Council Directive 89/369/EEC on the prevention of air pollution from new municipal waste incineration plants, which are designed to ensure an effective protection of public health and the environment, would have to be met in the context of such licensing.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Chairman of CIE that when this matter first came to light he immediately initiated a detailed investigation into Iarnrod Éireann's arrangements for the issuing of tickets to agents. This investigation which was conducted by the Group's external auditors in conjunction with the CIE Internal Audit team identified a potential loss to Iarnrod Éireann of up to £250,000.</P>
      <P>In the light of the content of the External Auditors Report, the matter was then referred by the Chairman to the Garda Authorities for examination.  I understand that the Garda Síochána Fraud Squad investigation into the matter has recently been completed and that the Director of Public Prosecutions has decided not to issue proceedings in this case.</P>
      <P>However, I am advised that the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions not to issue proceedings does not alter the position as between the former agent concerned and Iarnrod Éireann which is that it is a matter for the agent and its legal advisers to decide if it wishes to pursue the matter further from a legal point of view.</P>

    <P>Intervention on my part or on the part of my Department would be entirely inappropriate and in view of the circumstances, I have no plans to do so. <Col N="191" /> Furthermore, as these are matters arising within the context of the day to day administration of larnród Éireann, I have no statutory function in relation to them.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to a recent ruling by the Supreme Court that children born abroad of foreign parents and who are residing in the State come within the scope of the Adoption Act 1988.  That Act permits in exceptional cases the adoption of children who have effectively been abandoned by their parents. The need for new legislation does not arise in the light of the Supreme Court ruling as it should in fact facilitate the adoption of some foreign children in the care of Irish residents.</P>
      <P>The Adoption Act 1991 sets out a number of mechanisms for the recognition of adoptions effected abroad in favour of Irish residents.  A central requirement for recognition is that such an adoption must comply with the terms of the definition of a foreign adoption contained in the legislation.  In cases where an adoption effected abroad in respect of an abandoned foreign child does not qualify for recognition, the Supreme Court ruling has opened up the possibility of the child being adopted under Irish law in accordance with the provisions of the 1988 Act.</P>
