      <P>It is proposed to take No. 4.  It is further proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders that:</P>
      <P>1.  In the case of the resumed Second Stage of No. 4, the following arrangements shall apply in relation to the debate: (i) The opening speech of the main spokesperson for the Fine Gael Party, the Progressive Democrats Party and the Technical Group shall not exceed one hour in each case; (ii) The speech of each other Member called on shall not exceed 20 minutes; and (iii) the Minister for Finance shall be called upon to make a speech in reply not exceeding 30 minutes.</P>
      <P>2.  Private Members' Business shall be No. 8 and the proceedings thereon shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m. today.</P>

    <Title>Finance Bill, 1993: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Since yesterday there has been a further bombshell in the form of proposed additional VAT on telephone bills &mdash; 15 per cent from 1 September and 5 per cent from 1 April 1994.  This is the latest increment of the Government's policy of high taxation and high spending which has to be paid for by the taxpayer and which will hit even old age pensioners. It is quite remarkable that the Culliton report is used as an excuse when the major element of the Culliton report, tax reform, has been totally ignored.  As the Taoiseach said at the weekend, tax reform is another quack cure for unemployment. The final nail has been put in the coffin of Culliton's tax reform proposals, <Col N="1308" /> the first was the Moriarty task force to neuter the tax reform proposals. Now we have the highest taxes on work in Europe, the highest unemployment in Europe and a payroll tax cost that is so high that it has displaced jobs.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned with the part of the Bill dealing with probate tax which is totally unjust.  It is a new tax and there is scope to increase it from 2 per cent to perhaps 5 per cent next year and to a higher figure thereafter.  The conditions regarding child dependants are not satisfactory. If a child is resident in the house and has an income of say, over £4,000 a year, he or she may be liable to pay £1,400 on a house worth £70,000, this is paper money; there is no way that somebody with that level of income could afford to pay tax.  It also means that executors of wills and families will try to avoid taking out a grant of probate or administering their estates to avoid the tax.  What they do not know is that there will now be an interest penalty of 15 per cent per year if the estate is not administered within nine months.  This means that the probate tax bill will double every six and a half years.  There is now, in effect, a tax on death.  Having taxed sickness benefit, the Government has moved on to the dead and widows and orphans.  It is quite appalling that Labour and Fianna Fáil should consider these to be well off people who can pay more tax to subsidise the bloated expenditure programmes in every Department.</P>
      <P>Deputies Davern, Kemmy and others, said there was provision in the Bill for a tax amnesty.  One of the most striking failures of this Bill is its lack of imagination. Despite the rumours there are no proposals to seek the repatriation of funds held by Irish residents in offshore accounts.  It is estimated that sums of £1 billion or £2 billion are lodged in Switzerland, the Isle of Man and the Cayman Islands.  A range of measures could be put in place to attract this money back. There could be Government gilts worth £100 with a charge of £110 or a once off tax of 10 per cent to bring the money back with no questions asked.  This could be a source of loan finance for businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1309" /> Surely, of all those who have money to invest, pension funds have a greater prudential responsibility than anybody else.  The last thing a person who has paid into a pension fund for 40 years wants to hear is that the Minister for Finance insisted that the pension fund should invest in some hare brained scheme relating to county enterprise boards and that his or her money has not materialised. Will contributory pensioners under the superannuation scheme receive less, or will contributions have to be increased if some of those investments do not materialise? I would caution the Minister to tread slowly in that regard.  If he wants to create venture capital he should try to lure some of the offshore accounts back into this country, and £100 million would be a minuscule sum in that context.  Such moneys should be either targeted at reducing the debt or for venture capital purposes, because I acknowledge the need for seed capital.  However, to jeopardise pension funds for politicised county boards would not be wise.</P>
    <P>I will be tabling a number of amendments on Committee Stage and by raising them now the Department officials might consider some of them.  The tax treatment of dividends from companies in manufacturing industry who apply for the 10 per cent corporation tax regime is at the marginal tax rate.  The tax credit is minimal and was reduced last year.  There should be some difference in the treatment of dividends for companies paying the 10 per cent rate and those paying the 40 per cent rate of corporation tax.</P>
    <P>In relation to the agricultural sector, during the general election campaign many parties acknowledged that the threshold for capital acquisitions tax in regard to gift tax and inheritance tax had not kept pace with the increases set out in the 1976 Bill.  Since 1989 we have had an indexing of the threshold and it now stands at £171,000, but it has not kept pace with the real increase in property values.  Therefore, the change in agricultural relief from 55 per cent to 75 per cent is not enough.  I ask the Minister to make good the promises made by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, <Col N="1310" /> Deputy Walsh, and other Ministers in that Department during the election campaign.  At that time there was a rumour that they were promising everything but free tractors.</P>

      <P>One of the specific commitments they made was that there would be a substantial increase in the threshold, but instead we have a modest indexation of 2 per cent or 3 per cent.  In my view, £300,000 should be the basic threshold. We now have milk quotas attached to land and many people cannot transfer their farm on to the next generation because of that.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to section 21 of the Bill in regard to stock relief.  Discussions were held with farm organisations in relation to the abolition of stock relief and the clawback arrangements. More farmers will gain than lose by the abolition of the clawback arrangements, and I acknowledge that the thrust of the Commom Agricultural Policy reforms is to reduce lifestock prices and increase the cheque in the post.  That means that there would be a clawback arrangement, so I welcome its abolition. However, new entrants to farming and young farmers in agriculture will find it exceedingly difficult to build up their stock levels with only a 25 per cent increase in the non-tradable values of stock allowed; a 50 per cent figure would be more appropriate.  This could be linked to people involved in installation aid or development programmes with Teagasc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A small anomaly which has come to my attention recently relates to motor tax.  Since the vehicle registration tax was introduced last year an anomaly has arisen in that the motor tax as opposed to the vehicle registration tax is payable to local authorities.  If a car is crashed or off the road for some other reason one still has to pay the full motor tax from the date the vehicle registration tax was <Col N="1311" /> introduced.  In other words, if I import a car on 1 February and do not use it for six months, when I go to tax it I must pay six months arrears of motor tax.  The motor taxation division of the local authority has informed me that this is an anomaly in the law which needs to be altered.  When cars are bona fide off the road &mdash; and this can be verified with the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; motor tax should not apply until the car is being used and that applies in particular to the importation of secondhand cars.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that one of the most appalling episodes in the start of the lifetime of this Government was the Digital debacle where the Ministers were outmanoeuvred by their Scottish counterparts.  At that time TDs in Galway gave various assurances, both privately and publicly, about changes in the tax treatment of redundancy payments to the Digital workers.  At present £6,000 is allowable free of tax as a capital <i>ex gratia</i> lump sum.  The change which the Minister made &mdash; which I understand to be an additional £250 per year of service &mdash; does not meet the requirements and Digital workers and those taking voluntary redundancies are disappointed.  I ask the Minister to re-examine this matter and to consider the commitments which were given, especially those given by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, in this regard.  I suggest that the figure should be raised to a threshold of at least £12,000 and that the qualification for the standard capital superannuation benefit be reduced from 20 to ten years.</P>
    <P>In regard to urban renewal schemes, I understand that the definition of buildings within a designated area varies according to classification and that there is a category of industrial building which includes hotels.  I am now told that hotels or extensions to hotels in designated areas cannot attract the full benefits.  That should be altered.  In view of the capital intensive nature and long term rate of return from investment in such hotels. Similarly, in 1988 a 100 per cent capital allowance applied to hotels, tourism <Col N="1312" /> developments, leisure centres and so on. I understand that this has been whittled down to around 4 per cent per annum. That is clearly insufficient to develop our tourism product and to promote tourism development.  I ask the Minister to examine that matter.</P>
    <P>The retention tax on professional fees is still causing major cashflow problems for those who have to pay operating costs out of net income.  At a minimum the Minister should allow the credit to be based on the current year of the actual payment of withholding tax rather than on the previous year's assessment.  By and large, incomes are increasing and the credit one gets this year would be much less than the tax one would have paid, because it is based on last year's credit. That should be altered.  During Question Time yesterday we referred to the residential property tax.  As the Minister stated, there are two reliefs, but no reliefs apply in relation to borrowings.  In other words, a person could own a valuable house and have huge borrowings on it, but no provision is made for that person. On the grounds of equity a ceiling of, say, up to £35,000 should be allowed so that the householder receives the net worth of the property.</P>

I do not believe in that.  We should encourage people to have more disposable income and to own their own homes.  I do not take a begrudger's or a bureaucrat's view in relation to such measures.</P>

The Minister of State, Deputy Browne, will also be aware that prominent members of his party are concerned about the wording in page 91 of the Bill.  Part C in particular should be re-examined because as it is worded, in order to get the relief when one is open for the summer, all machinery must be removed from the premises for the winter.  There should be some more practical and flexible arrangement.  For example, if machinery was covered and clearly not being used that should be adequate.  In other words, a certificate must be obtained from the Revenue Commissioners that these machines are not being used.</P>

      <P>Part C, section 62.  I wish to make some other specific points before I round on the Minister.  In relation to tax covenants, I am advised there is a discrimination against single parents under which they lose their single parent allowance if they avail of covenants.  The Minister should look into the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions in relation to the tax treatment of cars was a very sensitive issue last year.  No alteration has been <Col N="1314" /> made to it this year and I ask the Minister to take into account the age of a car. If a car is more than three years of age half the original market value of it should be taken into account and there should be a 50 per cent discount.  I know that the association of car sales representatives in Cork is particularly concerned that the Minister would give some relief for people who need their car on a full-time basis to earn a living.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes in the business expansion scheme.  I am slightly concerned that the increase of £1 million in the relief may mean that the money would be targeted towards developmental capital as opposed to start-up capital.  We should wait and see how that develops.  I am not against this measure but it may widen the focus of the issue.</P>
    <P>I note that the film industry is getting special concessions.  I would prefer to give them tax relief rather than setting up a £10 million film board which will not guarantee to create anything in particular other than additional public service jobs.</P>
    <P>I would wish to see also a social welfare amnesty now that we are moving towards the harmonisation of tax on social welfare and income tax and the computerisation of these.  If a person in Tallaght is working while signing on the dole it is vital that when this is traced he or she is prevented from continuing this practise.  It is very important that people move in that direction of work rather than in the direction of social welfare payments and dependency. When the technology is in place to integrate tax and social welfare systems there must be an amnesty to deal with that.</P>
    <P>I note the change in tax payment dates set out between advance corporation tax and corporation tax within six months of the accounting period.  The same provision should be made for capital gains tax returns because we now have three dates.  Advance corporation tax was within six months, corporation tax was within seven months and capital gains tax to be submitted by 1 November following the year of assessment.  They should be streamlined and one date introduced <Col N="1315" /> which I thought should be seven months. This causes confusion to people who are trying to comply with the regulation that change should be made.</P>
    <P>In relation to stamp duty, I had a request that there be advanced rulings in relation to commercial transactions, especially within companies and including restructurings, various mergers and so on where no cash value is put in terms of a transfer of a property.  It has come to my attention also that State owned companies, such as Leopardstown race course, are experiencing problems in regard to tax clearance certificates. Where they have franchised a pub, a disco or some other facility, they cannot verify that their tax affairs are totally up to date, yet they are the people who have the licence.  Where there is a State company involved there should be some flexibility.</P>

I do not believe we will make any progress on lowering the highest rate of unemployment in Europe until we accept fundamentally the thrust of Culliton and the NESC.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I would like to borrow a <Col N="1316" /> leaf from the Minister's book in respect of his presentation in the House yesterday. It was evident that the Minister felt he needed to place a certain political context on his more technical remarks that were to follow.  It seems entirely appropriate that one might begin by doing the same.</P>
    <P>I am reminded that it is now 60 years since Franklin D. Roosevelt, when the United States was in deep recession and suffering from massive unemployment, first took the oath of presidency there. He was elected on the notion of a new deal reformist programme designed to confront the problems so evident then in the United States.  So great was his zeal and his appetite for this programme that in the first 100 days in office, the Roosevelt Administration left a legacy of reform and radical change that was to become the hallmark of the man and his presidency.  He is the only person who went on to serve an historic three terms in the White House as President of the United States.  It has become fashionable since to examine US presidencies and Governments in general, on the record of their first 100 days in office.</P>
    <P>Last November Irish people thought they were voting for radical change and they expressed, through their voting preference, a strong desire to see such change.  The first 100 days of this Administration was dogged by devaluation, Digital, Mullaghmore, Greencore with ADM, Greencore without ADM, Greencore with Davys and close placees, Greencore without Davys and close placees and, most of all, was characterised through its own choice by a budget which talked about making progress but did the reverse and left the Irish public dispirited, deceived and disillusioned.</P>
    <P>The two parties in Government are now cosy with each other and are settling down to four long years in this much vaunted partnership deal.  In terms of vision, courage and appetite for change this partnership deal is no new deal.  It is a paralysed partnership that says one thing but does another, that aspires to intellectual acceptance of various changes but lacks the political conviction to <Col N="1317" /> see them through.  The Bill we are discussing is the key product of the second 100 days of this Administration.  It is, by their own lights, the most substantial yardstick by which we can legitimately measure the worth and the policy intent of this Administration since it has now had due pause for reflection and thought.</P>
    <P>The Minister may recall, although he was not in the House at the time, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs coming in here rather limply the morning after the Minister's presentation, having read the truth of the budget in the newspapers being aware that everyone saw it as a dull instrument as it has proved to be. The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs said the Government had no option because it was beset with currency problems and so on and that it was not in office very long.</P>
    <P>There has been time for reflection on the Finance Bill, and change if necessary. It now constitutes a self-made yardstick with which to judge and beat this Administration. Objectively, it is a measure of the failure to come to grips with the scale and depth of the unemployment crisis or understand some of the key elements which cause, prolong and deepen it.</P>
    <P>On the taxation agenda, this paralysed partnership is said to intellectually accept the key tenets of the Culliton tax reform philosophy.  That tax philosophy is not so complicated, because Culliton has spelt it out and the ordinary person in the street could follow its two essential tenets.  First, tax should be collected on a sufficiently broad base; and, secondly, the tax systems should be drastically simplified, with a programme of phased removal of special reliefs on a consistent basis.  That is the prescription.  Whatever the detail, the road map is very clear &mdash; broaden the base and consistently simplify the system.  By doing that it will be possible to dramatically reform the crushing, penal, disincentive, anti-work tax system that exists.  Where did the Government choose to broaden the tax base the most this year?  The answer to this question is to be found in Chapter 2, section 7 of the Finance Bill, 1993, with the imposition of a new income levy, a <Col N="1318" /> fifth tax on everyone's income that exceeds the princely sum of £173 per week, which is only two-thirds of the average industrial wage here.</P>
    <P>This tax flies in the face of Culliton, the essence of which is to broaden the base with a view to lowering taxes on work and specifically with a view to ensuring that the marginal and average tax rates fall for the ordinary worker. This paralysed partnership, which one Minister says intellectually accepts Culliton, proceeds to do the opposite to what Culliton recommends.  The Government considers it is right and proper to penalise everyone earning less than the average industrial wage by the imposition of this new employment levy.  The one let up in regard to this is for those who hold medical cards.  I am thankful that I am not running a company's pay office which must calculate who is in or out, reschedule programming and pay clerks's work and check medical card records in order to comply with this ridiculous and anti-work tax which has been introduced by way of the one per cent levy.</P>
    <P>I regard this tax as a sneaky one.  It is called a 1 per cent levy, but were the Government to choose to use the existing tax system to raise the same amount of money it would have involved imposing 2 per cent on the standard rate of tax, or twice that figure on the upper band.  That is what would have been involved if the collection of additional tax had been dealt with in the normal manner under our tax system.  Far from simplifying the tax system, this Administration has chosen to complicate it by adding this new tax.  It has masked this sneaky tax as a 1 per cent levy when its real and equivalent effect is twice that figure under our tax system.  It is a retrograde tax, undoing at a stroke some of the significant tax reforms which the Progressive Democrats were so insistent upon when in Government.  What we started is something that has at this point regrettably been interrupted and we have not had the opportunity to complete the reform as we would like.  We started to set about a consistent long term rational reform of the Irish tax system.  This is <Col N="1319" /> a retrograde step in this year's budget, because this so-called temporary levy from those people who intellectually accept Culliton is complicating the system in a most regressive way.  It is a regressive tax since it operates outside the normal system of tax free allowances, but if included, it would have mitigated its worse effects upon lower paid workers.</P>
    <P>It is a source of wry amusement to read the Programme for a Partnership Government and the wishy washy commitment it has in regard to tax reform. Its commitment to lower paid workers is such that if a person earns £173 per week or more, they are regarded as well paid and it is in order to dip into those people's pockets and extract a fifth tax on their work effort.  It is an inefficient tax because it complicates the accounting which must be done at every level for firms and employers who are compliant with the system.  Trying to compute employees tax liabilities is much more complicated than if the existing system was properly used for the tax process or the raising of Exchequer revenue.  It will be a difficult system to administer and costly for those who must comply with its requirements.  It is not a cost borne by the Government and the Government does not appear to give a damn, but that is not enough in the light of the efforts made by those who comply with the tax system and it renders the tax a failure on the test of efficiency also.  It is the single greatest measure in this year's Finance Bill of the contempt which this paralysed partnership has put in practice for the Culliton tax reform philosophy.  For the ordinary person in the street it is the simplest, most obvious and greatest measure of the phoney rhetoric of this new partnership which promised lower taxes for the less well off but which in its first year in office, after due reflection since the budget and all that has been said, is insisting that this additional tax imposition on the low paid should stand.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his Second Stage speech yesterday stood over this inequitous 1 per cent levy with the phrase that <Col N="1320" /> he was confirming the revenue dimension of the strategy of fiscal responsibility. There was a somewhat fatuous challenge as to whether his critics would urge him to throw budgetary discipline to the winds.  I am a critic of the 1 per cent levy, but I would not urge that the Minister or the Government take such a daft nonsensical and ultimately futile course of action as to throw fiscal responsibility requirements to the winds.  In the panoply of adjustment and expenditure curtailment which might be examined this 1 per cent is singularly among the most stupid and misplaced measures the Government might have chosen in terms of fulfilling its objective in regard to fiscal responsibility.</P>
    <P>I was amused to note the extent to which the Minister, his script writers and the ever busy people working on the word processers in his office have engaged in a not too subtle revisionism in respect of our recent economic experience.  Fiscal responsibility was cast in this budget as the key player in respect of the turn-around of the general economic climate and in particular in relation to interest rates.  It seems that the debacle of devaluation, which represented a total reversal by the market for both the Minister and his key advisers, is now to be written out of the emerging state of the Irish economy for the first two quarters of 1993 as if it never happened.  In so far as there has been some good news on the horizon, it has emerged precisely because the market prevailed and the Government got it wrong in regard to devaluation.</P>
    <P>To the extent that the Minister seeks to make a virtue of fiscal responsibility, he has adopted a budget target in line with the requirements and obligations of the Maastricht Treaty and the practice of every Government in this State in recent years.  The concept of fiscal responsibility is one to which virtually everyone in this House subscribes having seen the debt mountain left behind by the long dark night of fiscal irresponsibility which left our resources so depleted.</P>
    <P>The distinguishing feature of the changes in the economic climate in recent months is not, as the Minister asserts, in <Col N="1321" /> the budget or the Finance Bill, it can be explained by devaluation which was the greatest reversal forced on the Minister since he took up office.  The Minister is perfectly correct in arguing that the 1992 budget and Finance Bill made substantial improvements in the all round tax structure. The substantial tax reform introduced last year was not based on an illusion, that tax reform leads, in overall terms, to lower taxation as a proportion of national income.  It was clearly founded on the belief that our tax system lacks coherence and is in need of consistent and sustained reform.</P>
    <P>In the light of that particular experience this year's expediency is most to be regretted.  In pointing out the substantial reform made last year, the Minister has confirmed a theory which my party advanced in Government and brought through last year with the Minister's assistance and acceptance, that one needs a consistent view of how to reform the tax system.  In regard to the challenge he threw out yesterday and the challenge of the Taoiseach last weekend during the course of a party political address, I do not feel the need to explain to the Minister how tax reform does not mean lower tax for everyone in all circumstances. Why should I undertake such a burden of explanation?  I have never argued to the contrary.  When in Government my party argued that tax reform needed to be funded mostly from within the system by adjustments in the tax system itself and, where possible, by curtailments in expenditure.  The Minister knows that. Therefore, I do not feel the need to take up the burden of explaining a point which the Progressive Democrats Party has never stood for, has never made and in which it does not believe.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to ask the Minister for an explanation of some of the measures over which he is standing.  For example, both he and the Government refer to this levy as a temporary imposition.  The Minister, the Ceann Comhairle and Members know that the public are deeply cynical when Governments talk about temporary taxes.  We have seen the results of other temporary impositions <Col N="1322" /> which remained on our Statute Book for a decade and longer.  On behalf of a jaded and cynical public, I want to ask the Minister about this temporary imposition. What is unique and temporary in the budget circumstances he faced this year which will not arise next year?  I wish to anticipate some of the reasons the Minister may give although I may not necessarily accept some of them.</P>
    <P>Our currency had to be devalued earlier in the year and of course, this imposed a cost on the Exchequer.  If we believed the propaganda about devaluation in the bulletins from the bunkers in the Department of Finance &mdash; it is interesting that the Minister's name did not appear on them &mdash; which appeared to indicate, if one did not know better, that devaluation would cost us £800 million, one would say: &ldquo;God bless the Minister or any Minister stuck with framing a budget this year; he has an enormous gap to fill and, of course, he needs to introduce temporary measures to do this, even though the 10 per cent levy will raise nothing like £800 million in a full year&rdquo;. However, when we questioned the Minister after his officials had done the sums on the cost of devaluation, which was very substantial, we found that the net cost to the Exchequer, on the Department's estimate, was £15 million, less than one-tenth of the full annual revenue from this fifth tax on work.  Therefore, devaluation is not a temporary phenomenon. The figures from the Department of Finance indicate that the 1 per cent levy will raise vastly more than the net cost to the Exchequer arising from devaluation.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that this year we have the unique event of the abolition of VAT on imports at the point of entry.  As the Minister knows, section 83 of the Finance Bill proposes to add a new subsection 19 (6) to the principal VAT Act which will have the effect of substantially, and almost entirely offsetting the potential loss of revenue in the current year arising from VAT changes.  The Government would have suffered a cash flow loss this year as a result of the abolition of VAT on imports at the point of entry, but it proposes to change section 19 (6) of <Col N="1323" /> the Principal VAT Act to bring forward payments, which will give it a cash flow gain this year.  Broadly speaking, the two measures cancel out each other and are not a temporary phenomenon.</P>
    <P>The Minister may put forward another argument, for example, the fear of capital outflows through the European Single Market and the free movement of capital forced the Government to reduce the deposit interest retention tax rate for the standard rate of 27 per cent to 10 per cent, which represents a grievous loss of income to the Exchequer.  One is entitled to ask the Minister what is temporary about that measure.  This measure will not be done away with next year.  The 10 per cent DIRT rate was introduced because the Government does not want capital outflows, with free movement of capital to the European Community. This measure will last forever, unless the Minister changes it.  Barring that, we are stuck with this feature until the rate of tax changes.</P>
    <P>The three reasons given by the Minister for this temporary phenomenon were devaluation, VAT changes and the DIRT rate reductions.  None of these reasons stand up to analysis.  They do not explain why the Minister has to meet a temporary requirement this year which will not be repeated in future years.  This temporary levy has not been introduced in response to any particular or identifiable temporary budgetary problem.  It is a hamfisted, unfair example of the worst kind of expediency which lacks rhyme or coherence.  The only thing I can see which has changed significantly is that this year the Labour Party, which is meant to be the agent for change is a new ingredient.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister is indicating that that will be the temporary little arrangement to be removed from the equation; but, barring that particular formula, I cannot conceive of a sound explanation of how the Minister can say that the gap in finances to meet fiscal responsibility is explained by some temporary phenomenon this year that will not exist next year.  That is one question to which I want a clear answer.  I do not <Col N="1324" /> expect to get a very clear answer to it but I would love to know what is the temporary little phenomenon.  Perhaps it has to do with the people with whom the Minister shares Cabinet responsibility but, who can tell?</P>
    <P>I want to say this much to workers in this country.  If the Progressive Democrats were around the Cabinet table I can assure them that this incoherent, anti-work levy is something we would not stand over.  It is something that should not be argued for or stood over.  Yesterday the Minister went to some lengths to say that he was being misrepresented, that the 1 per cent income levy was not a tax on employment.  He said it was &ldquo;nothing short of misrepresentation.&rdquo;</P>

If the Minister does not understand it &mdash; I will come to this in a moment when I come to deal with tax/welfare arrangements &mdash; the combination of tax and social welfare here, when one lops off another slice of earned income, through employer and employee, it is an anti-work incentive.  The Minister is wrong.  It does impact on work.  Irrespective of the incidence of its payment, it is anti-work.  The Minister went on to say that people who talk about PRSI as a tax on work somehow misrepresent the position as well.  Very interestingly, in the course of his introductory remarks the Minister has this to say:</P>
      <P>An urgent review is to be carried out in consultation with the Department of Social Welfare of the impact on low paid manufacturing firms of the operation of the employers' PRSI system.</P>

    <P>I welcome that review at two levels.  First, because I think that the VAT changes that have been implemented &mdash; over which the Minister is standing, as he did on the VAT motion tabled in Private Members' time last week and as he has done again in his introductory remarks on this Bill &mdash; potentially will have, and <Col N="1325" /> already has had a devastating effect on elements of the Irish manufacturing system.  This is not so much a question of the additional VAT alone.  It is a bit like the straw that broke the camel's back; there is so much they can take, but they cannot take any more.  If the Minister is prepared to do something, provided it is consistent with EC rules and can be implemented, the attitude appears to be &ldquo;good on him&rdquo;.  But implicit in that is what I might describe as an intelligent acceptance that employers' PRSI on low paid employments is probably &mdash; and the Progressive Democrats would argue that it actually is &mdash; a major disincentive to employ low paid employees in the context of all the capital grants on the one side and all the taxes heaped on labour on the other.  Therefore, there is no misrepresentation. These are taxes on work and do affect the work effort, either on the part of the companies or of individual employees.  The unfortunate conclusion one is entitled to derive from all of this is that intellectual acceptance by members of this Government of any particular proposition is no guarantee that it will lead to political action through political conviction.</P>
    <P>In page 14 of a document published last week entitled <i>Employment Through Enterprise</i>, which deals with taxation, there is a paragraph which talks about the Government having two objectives to reconcile.  One is prudent budgetary and fiscal responsibility &mdash; a generality with which we all agree &mdash; and the second relates to the need for tax reform.  It says the Government must balance the two and get it right.  Of course, that is true. It says in Chapter 2:</P>
    <P>The Government recognises that the reconciliation of these two objectives will necessarily require a broadening of the tax-base across the various taxes.</P>
    <P>It is not explicit in a lot of detail but is very clear in what it says: that the Government recognises that the reconciliation of these two objectives will necessarily require a broadening of the tax base across the various taxes.  Of course, they say that they accept intellectually <Col N="1326" /> the broad thrust of the Culliton and Moriarty reports.  Then there is that rather modest but real statement of intent at the end of that chapter on taxation on page 14.</P>
    <P>In regard to what I heard yesterday from the Minister in his opening remark and in view of the derisory comments the Taoiseach made about tax reform last weekend, I want to know what they have in mind.  In fairness I have to say that the Taoiseach is prone to make odd comments of a spurious nature when let loose with Fianna Fáil audiences behind closed doors.  He has done so on more than one occasion.  It may well be that it was one of those happy occasions &mdash; I am sure our Acting Chairman, Deputy Coughlan, may have been present since it was a women's conference and may be in a position to confirm her assent to the observation.  Nonetheless, the man who leads this Government, the team leader, last weekend, in an utterly derisory comment, said that tax reform as a cure for unemployment was a quack cure.  This is from a Government that say it intellectually accepts the recommendations of the Culliton report.  Culliton says that the tax reform agenda is the single most powerful instrument in the hands of a Government to abolish the pervasive, disincentive, anti-employment, anti-jobs environment that obtains.  The team leader, off with the girls on Saturday to have a chat about whatever it was was on his mind, called this core element a quack cure.</P>
    <P>Far from being a believer in the theology of this Government's taxation, clearly the Taoiseach is an athiest and does not believe in any of this stuff under any circumstances.  Then the Minister for Finance seemed to borrow a bit of the Taoiseach's rhetorical attitude at the beginning of his remarks yesterday when he threw out a few fatuous challenges for the Opposition to explain to the Government how to govern the country. It seems to me that the Minister for Finance is a bit of an in-between, that the Minister is merely an agnostic&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;not entirely an atheist. At the end of the day what we have got, and of course what we would expect from all of this, is that we are stuck in the middle of a paralysis in this partnership, caught between those who are the believers and those who are the agnostics. We are caught between people like the Minister for Finance, who wants to play both ends against the middle, and people like the Taoiseach, the atheists, who say this is a quack cure anyway.  But of course the Government accepts what Culliton and Moriarty say and will endeavour to see it through.  What utter nonsense.  Did one ever see a potent recipe for confusion, muddle and, at the end of the day, utter paralysis?  That is why this paralysed partnership will never deliver tax reform because it does not know which way to face, does not know how to face in any direction from the very top right down the line.</P>
      <P>In the course of their tax analysis the Culliton committee concentrated in particular on the tax wedge of the average industrial wage.  This is the wedge that is driven by the taxman between what it costs an employer to hire a worker and what a worker gets to take home at the end of the week.  A good test of the intellectual acceptance by this administration of Culliton is provided by the tax wedge proposition.  I will not open up the Culliton report and quote from it again.  It does not contain many tables or charts, but the only one I can recall in respect of taxation is almost half a page in size and deals with the tax wedge.  If one intellectually believes Culliton one might suppose that, whatever else one did, one would make sure one was always pointed in a particular direction.  It is a disgrace to say that when passed this Finance Bill will, for the first time in six years, ensure that the tax wedge at the average industrial wage is worsened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the officials in the Department of Finance who are lumbered with the task of doing the sums supplied in written answers; they do an excellent job.  When I talk about the reversal of fortunes for the ordinary taxpayer brought about by <Col N="1328" /> this paralysed partnership when it comes to tax policy it is the Department of Finance figure that I cite, not my own.  For the first time in six years the position in regard to the tax wedge is getting worse, not better.</P>
    <P>For single workers who earn between £10,000 and £20,000 a year &mdash; the great majority earn sums in that range &mdash; the position in regard to the tax wedge has disimproved this year as compared to last year.  There is no point in the Minister saying that even if this is partly due to the influence of the ridiculous 1 per cent levy it will have no impact, in terms of work and people; it will and the Department's figures will bear this out.</P>
    <P>It is nothing short of brazen for the Government to say that it accepts policy packages such as those put forward by the Culliton and Moriarty review groups when it can be seen, judged by their actions which speak much louder than words and rhetoric, that it has spurned the foundations on which it is based.  It is nothing short of a national scandal, in the face of record unemployment levels, that this partnership, from the top down, does not have a clue as to where it wants to go on the most fundamental agenda which could have a pervasive influence, according to the author of the main report which these agnostics, atheists and believers say they intellectually accept.</P>
    <P>The present income tax and social welfare systems have developed separately over the years on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  They resulted in arbitrary, distorting and blatantly unjust implications for individual householders.  While the Government may say that it intellectually accepts the need to address the issue of interaction between the social welfare and income tax systems we are entitled to ask a few questions about what the Finance Bill and this year's budget do to further that objective.  Ministers of State assure this House every now and again when we discuss this matter that they are doing the sums and that when they have them done they may try to integrate the two systems which may be incremental or, as one of them has described it, &ldquo;the big bang&rdquo; but <Col N="1329" /> in the meantime all we have heard is a whimper from the budget.</P>
    <P>The statistics provided by the Department of Finance reveal that far too many families are locked into a depressing web of dependency.  Several years ago, the National Economic and Social Council produced a table in relation to the poverty trap.  It used as an example a married man with a wife and four children on different levels of income and the benefits they might receive such as family income supplement, medical card, local authority rent allowance and so on.  It asked the question, what was the net disposable income of this household as between pay and social welfare and if the family would be better off on one or the other.  I acknowledge that the two systems have developed on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and that the results of this example are not the fruit of this budget only.  However, the budget will make the position worse as compared with last year and, therefore, worse than it ought to be in regard to what is meant to be a prime objective of Government policy on taxation and social welfare.</P>
    <P>If the man in the example had an income of £8,000 he would receive a boost in that he would be entitled to receive family income supplement, local authority rent allowance and so on with the result that his disposable income would be £9,371.  That is the base line that I wish to use.  If this man, through plain good fortune, landed a much better job for which he received not £8,000 but £15,000 would that not be great news for his family?  According to the data provided by the Department of Finance this man would end up £200 worse off. Therein lies the crunch, the classic web of dependency into which so many families are locked.</P>
    <P>The budget, the Finance Bill or the Minister have not brought us to this sorry pass, but this example establishes beyond any doubt that the budget introduced by an Administration which says it cares about the low paid has made the position worse, not better, for this individual.  One is judged by what one does and not by what one says.  The statement that the <Col N="1330" /> Government intellectually accepts the Culliton report is flim-flam and does not stand up to analysis in the cold light of day.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister made great play of the fact that the Government has adopted a focused and targeted approach to the business expansion scheme and the new measures he is introducing &mdash; a series of tax incentive driven schemes.  In every budget in recent years it was said that section 23 would no longer apply in six months while the provisions in regard to urban renewal would no longer apply in three months.  Again, it has been said this year that they will no longer apply in a few months time.  The procedure seems to be to round up the usual suspects and give them a new lease of life.</P>
    <P>Some of the measures to be introduced have been welcomed.  Given that this Bill lacks a coherent long term strategy in regard to tax reform it follows that anything which would give people a lift in relation to taxation levels, which are oppressive and unacceptably high, would always be welcomed by those who are going to gain.  This tinkering with the system in the form of special tax incentive schemes is inconsistent with the claim that the Government accepts intellectually the Culliton report.</P>
    <P>The point was made in the Culliton report that there was room for a better focus on some of the existing schemes but I noted with some wry amusement as I read my newspapers last weekend that some of these measures have been welcomed and praised by the tax consultancy profession.  This came as no surprise. While Culliton praised their creative skills it was his wish that they would use these skills in a more productive and ingenious way rather than engage in tax avoidance which invariably is at a premium the more complicated the system becomes.</P>
    <P>There is a certain sense of <i>déjá vu</i> in revisiting schemes like this.  The life cycle of such schemes begins with a political fanfare in a Finance Bill, then works its way through all sorts of trick-of-the-loop measures with all sorts of debt engineering by the tax consultants of the nooks <Col N="1331" /> and crannies which the Minister's advisers never dreamed existed and, finally, with the Minister having to come back some years later to curtail or abolish the scheme.  We know that such schemes have a shelf life and we know the way they go, because we have seen it done before.</P>
    <P>Yesterday Deputy Yates criticised the Minister for the restrictive nature of the conditions attaching to many of the new so called innovatory BES type schemes being introduced this year.  I appreciate the point the Deputy was making but clearly what the Minister fears when introducing tax driven investment schemes as a means of compensating for the oppressive tax regime, is that while he may intend to give an inch, before he knows it the tax experts can drive a coach-and-four through it and he ends up having given a mile.  That is why this &ldquo;agnostic&rdquo; Minister for Finance in respect of his commitment to tax reform expressed loudly yesterday his fears &mdash; which I am sure had been expressed privately by his advisers in the Department &mdash; in the context of his tax initiative.  He spoke of keeping the operation of these new measures under close scrutiny and said that if it emerges that they are being subverted from their central purpose he will not hesitate to take such steps as may be necessary.  The French have a great phrase for that <i>plus ca change, plus c'est la même chose</i>&mdash; the more things change, the more they stay the same.  That is the feeling I get from a great many of these schemes.</P>
    <P>I can give examples &mdash; indeed I am quoting from the Department's statistics. In the financial year 1987-88 the tax foregone to the Exchequer in business expansion schemes amounted to £5.3 million. The tax was foregone in order to encourage &ldquo;focused and targeted initiatives&rdquo; and that is the language we use today, indeed.  In the following year, 1988-89, that figure more than doubled, to over £13 million.  In the year 1989-90 the tax foregone had jumped to an astounding £41.3 million.  This huge increase in tax foregone in a few short years forced a <Col N="1332" /> review and a curtailment of the scheme. The fundamental difficulty with the so called reform which the Minister reintroduces in this Bill is that he cannot tell us how much these schemes will cost the Exchequer.  There is no point asking him how much it will cost, how many jobs will emerge per pound of tax foregone and whether it will be value for money because I know the answer will be that the Minister cannot say.  It reminds me of a television games show on a Sunday afternoon &mdash; I cannot remember its name &mdash; where a blindfolded contestant who was guided by another, got the chance to shoot an arrow at a big dartboard.  In this particular games show, the Minister for Finance is the contestant and the tax consultants or the BES operators are telling the blindfolded Minister where to fire &mdash; left a bit, right a bit, up a bit or down a bit.  I do not know what the show was called but I am sure Members will know what I am talking about.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that is the Minister, has to shoot.  Perhaps he will hit the target and score a bullseye, perhaps he will miss.  Indeed who would expect much more from a blindfolded contestant? What is the difficulty of these schemes from a coherent tax strategy viewpoint. Such schemes lack transparency.  They fail from the outset to allow the Government in a planned way to cost such tax expenditure in advance into project and programme evaluation.  One little nugget in <i>Employment Through Enterprise</i> is that &ldquo;The Government have decided that they are going to cost into all the programmes and projects an evaluation of the tax expenditure in the system&rdquo;.  I do not believe it can do it in a case like this, it is simply not possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1333" /> Yesterday the Minister argued against the extension of the new schemes to non-traded services in Ireland.  His argument is that it would cause displacement which in plain English means that you rob Peter to pay Paul: existing jobs would be shunted as lower cost competitors would come in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I followed precisely the Culliton line in making changes in the BES schemes.  Culliton argues throughout his report that taxation incentives should be targeted.  He argued in favour of one scheme the Business Expansion Scheme, to be targeted at the manufacturing area.  I have followed that to the line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I have acknowledged that in such an oppressive tax system the Minister has no choice but to give some kind of relief, however, the points I am making still hold.  If he wants to follow the Culliton line let me remind him that the drift of Culliton's remarks is that we have to move away from the 19th century attitude that manufacturing is best and have a more vigorous attitude towards services.  Although this theme was not heavily developed, it will be borne out if the Minister leafs through the Culliton report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;his view is that that should be far nearer the services tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I will elaborate on the services area.  The logic of the requirement to have a 15 per cent holding, under the new scheme is that six people, perhaps more but not many more &mdash; because there are only so many fifteens in a 100 per cent &mdash; can get involved.  Unless they were redundant workers, the six or more come from existing jobs.  That is not displacement in the classic sense but it is <Col N="1334" /> not net employment creation.  I know the Minister hopes that it will generate enterprise which might in turn create jobs, but we have to wait and see, However, it is my view that without opening up the possibility of driving a coach-and-four through the services sector we have to shed the attitude that the services sector should remain the Cinderella.  It is a bad policy as a general proposition to exclude from our purview a review of that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point that interests me, in particular, is the removal of the current lifetime ceiling of £75,000 on the amount in respect of which an individual can obtain full BES relief.  This occurs in the context of the scheme being extended until the end of the financial year 1995-96, which is a full three year extension.  In effect one of the consequences of section 18, whether intended or not but as it is in the Bill it must have been intended, is that reasonably well-heeled and wealthy taxpayers could, through a variety of BES schemes, legitimately avoid paying any tax whatsoever in the next three years. In terms of tax equity this raises the most serious questions.  In terms of its philosophy on tax, I would love to hear the Labour Party's explanation for a tax process that allows the wealthiest people in the country to avoid potentially all tax for the remainder of the lifetime of this paralysed partnership through a variety of existing schemes or through new schemes over the next three years while at the same time the Labour Party Members will come into this House and defend the taking of another 1 per cent out of the basic income of people whose pay is as low as £173 per week.  An Irish millionaire might be able to put in place a set of schemes which over the next few years legitimately allows him to do away with any tax liability but if you are an unfortunate PAYE payer on £173 per week, tough luck; they will dip again into your pocket.  That is strange tax philosophy in equity terms and I would like to hear a Labour Party explanation for it.  That party claims to be a socialist party, but if that is the way they are going to look after people on low pay during <Col N="1335" /> the life of this Government it is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with what I regard as fiscal mugging which is apparent in this Finance Bill, namely, in Part VI, Chapter 1, which introduces death duty under a new name of probate tax.  In 1974 the then Coalition Government of Labour and Fine Gael, arising from their 14 point plan, published a White Paper on Capital Taxation.  That White Paper correctly concluded that death duty should be abolished and replaced by a more coherent system of capital acquisitions tax, and that advice was followed.  Today the Minister is proposing to reintroduce the old system with some modifications on top of the system which replaced it.  Far from simplifying the system, this makes it more complex and complicated.  The Minister is reintroducing, with some modifications, what was correctly considered then as being abominable.  These taxes were acknowledged as socially and psychologically bad and backward since they were levied at time of death when a family is least able to cope with additional burdens.</P>
    <P>Instead of raiding the piggy bank again, as is done under the existing system of capital acquisitions tax and which the Government could continue to do if it wanted to be intellectually committed to a simpler system, the Government chose to reintroduce the death duty.  I note with great interest that the Government looked at the threshold rate in 1974, which was £10,000, and introduced a similar threshold of liability in 1993.  There has been massive inflation in the meantime but overall there has been no ultimate change.</P>
    <P>Yesterday Deputy Yates, who hails from Wexford and is always very welcome in my constituency of Cork South-Central, raised one small matter for the Minister but one giant matter for the people involved, that is, the thriving sail making business in the Cork area.  I recently visited one of the most dynamic small enterprises which makes sails in that sector and which has a sister company in the <Col N="1336" /> UK.  The Irish production costs in terms of input are generally higher than in Britain, but because of greater efficiency in management here the output costs are generally lower.  However, VAT has now changed the balance and the sailing community can get the product cheaper from the less efficient UK sister company in Cowes.  That matter should be addressed. The consequences of reducing VAT in this sector cannot be great because it is not a big sector.  However, the consequences would be quite profound for the manufacturers involved.</P>
    <P>In summary, this Finance Bill, like the budget, marks time.  It lacks appetite for reform and it lacks the zeal one would expect from a new administration.  It protests an intellectual acceptance of one thing but practises another.  This is a Government that does not know where it is going on the tax front.  This Bill is going in the wrong direction.  It is a bad start to a paralysed partnership Government which has signalled from the top down, from its believers, through its agnostics, through its atheists on tax reform that it does not know where it is going.  That bodes bad for this country and therefore the Progressive Democrats will happily oppose this bad Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first Finance Bill from the new partnership Government. Although it was launched in somewhat unfortunate circumstances, it was much promoted before publication.  The Government was clearly stunned by the universal disappointment with which the budget was greeted.  The budget was a nondescript one, a budget for which the Minister cannot seriously entertain the claims he has made for it in his speech. We were told to wait for the next budget to really see the form of this Government. We pointed out that a great many of the 300,000 unemployed could not afford to wait for the next budget.  Recent developments in the financial sector have not improved their temper.  Then we were told to wait for the Finance Bill. We now have that Finance Bill, all 133 sections of it.  After all the trailers it is an unsurprising Bill, but at the same time a <Col N="1337" /> distinctly odd one.  In some ways it is difficult to believe that the paternity of the Bill is the same as last year's, although the Minister will undoubtedly claim he is now riding for a different stable.</P>

      <P>The Minister took a great deal of flak last year for supposedly heading in one direction, but to a considerable extent he is heading in the opposite direction this year.  In the past I have queried the usefulness of this ritual of the Finance Bill inherited from another era and from another parliament. How appropriate is it to address the problems of modern society?  I argued for multi-annual rolling income and expenditure programmes to enable more considered planning of the nation's finances. A Government with as large a majority of this one and whose term roughly coincides with EC Structural Fund programmes could afford to take a more medium term view.  The change of direction as between successive Finance Bills, authored by the same Minister, is a sound reason for repeating the argument set out at greater length in my contribution last year.</P>
      <P>It should be acknowledged, in respect of what Deputy Yates has said, that the procedures for processing the Finance Bill are more sensible this year than has been the tradition.  I am sure it will still be the case that many Deputies will be disappointed at not being given the opportunity to contribute on Second Stage, and that is to be regretted. However, if last year's experience is a reliable precedent, Committee Stage will be a great deal more satisfactory.  On Committee Stage there will be reasonable opportunity for detailed argument and I hope the Minister will continue to be responsive where reasoned amendments appear to have broad support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing exposes the confusion at the heart of public policy about job creation and investment strategies quite so well as a comparison of the Finance Bill, 1993, with its predecessor sponsored by the <Col N="1338" /> same Minister for Finance.  In the teeth of opposition from vested interests and many commentators the Minister attempted in the 1992 Act to close off some of the loopholes in the tax code, limit the exemptions, shut down some of the shelters and restrict the allowances and concessionary tax regimes.  These measures were accompanied by very modest tax reductions as distinct from tax reform.  Either those measures did not work, they have not been given enough time to work or the Minister has surrendered to his critics.  In the 1993 Bill a raft of incentives, some of them new, are introduced, together with an easing of restrictions and an increase in personal income tax, largely due to the imposition of the 1 per cent levy.  It is a distinctly odd package, internally inconsistent and reversing not only the trend of last year's Finance Act, but contradicting Culliton to whom the Government pledged allegiance in the same week that this Bill was published.  It is as if a new majority or a new consensus has won out at Cabinet, whose clarion cry is &ldquo;sure, nothing else has worked, let us give this a try&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>All of this does not amount to a very coherent assault on unemployment.  One view is that if the private sector does not respond to this new environment of incentives and reliefs, it never will.  Another view espoused by Deputy Yates is that it is not possible to impose these changes on the existing framework and that the incentives are too hedged around by qualifications and bureaucracy to work.  Either way, it is not the framework for which Culliton argued, and not the radical response one might have expected from this Government and which the gravity of our unemployment requires. It looks as if those who looked to this Government for change will be short changed.  The minimalist approach of recent years to tax reduction has been reversed in this Bill and the more difficult challenge of tax reform has been set aside entirely except for the purpose of banter between the Taoiseach and Opposition parties.</P>
    <P>In reply to the Taoiseach's request I will set out the position of Democratic <Col N="1339" /> Left in terms of what we mean by tax reform, but first I will respond to the Minister's speech yesterday, to show that his claims to have made progress on tax reform are a sham.  The Government will increase income tax by just less than 7 per cent this year when inflation will be of the order of 3 per cent.  The 7 per cent additional imposition includes the impact of PAYE, PRSI, employment and training levies and the new income levy.  If we compare this with the contents of the electoral programmes of either Fianna Fáil or the Labour Party we will see that the ordinary tax compliant citizen is entitled to feel cheated.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile the tax inspector's sector of the trade union, IMPACT has deplored the decision to reduce staff at the arrears project which brought in £36 million last year or more than £1 million per person working there.  The president of the Association of Inspectors of Taxes, Ms Mary Farrell, has called for more resources to focus in particular on the financial and property development sectors. A total of six inspectors are charged with policing the entire financial sector where, the president points out, there is a need&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash; to be out there auditing those companies both to recover lost taxes through evasion and to establish whether tax reliefs are serving the purpose intended by legislators.</P>
    <P>Having regard to what we have seen in the financial sector over recent weeks scarcely anybody could query that sensible statement by the president of the Association of Inspectors of Taxes.  If people are prepared to get up to the kind of shenanigans they have manifestly been up to, one wonders what more serious auditing of these companies would unearth.  According to the Assistant General Secretary of IMPACT, Ms Vera Hogan, tax evasion &ldquo;is continuing at a rampant pace&rdquo;.  She said that it is:</P>
    <P>&mdash; deeply worrying that evasion through concealment and/or inaccurate statements do not arise in <Col N="1340" /> accounts which are certified by highly reputable bodies.</P>
    <P>Speaking at the annual conference in March of this year, she said:</P>
    <P>This blind faith was corroborated during the beef tribunal when the Revenue Commissioners admitted that the Revenue would not have discovered the alleged evasion of PAYE tax without the work of the tribunal.  The accounts were audited and certified by a major accounting body.</P>
    <P>I am concerned with that point because this was a central allegation which I made and on which I produced documentation with regard to tax avoidance and tax evasion in that company.  I did not make any remarks about the fact that the accounts were signed off some months earlier by what Ms Hogan describes as a major accounting body.  It is a matter of some delicacy in terms of litigation still in progress that new matter ought not to be introduced into what has been adjudicated on.  At another time I intend to return to what is a very serious point raised by her in terms of how this can go on and how it is not revealed in the annual accounts certified by highly reputable bodies.</P>
    <P>Why is this one per cent levy imposed by the Minister so objectionable?  It is because there has been little or no genuine tax reform in the decade since the great tax marches.  The tax reform cry of the trade unions has been redefined by successive Governments as meaning tax reductions.  Income tax rates have come down giving the greatest benefit to the better off, but the tax take from the PAYE sector has risen substantially in absolute terms and relative to the tax take from farmers and other self-employed people.</P>
    <P>In 1980 at the height of the tax marches only one taxpayer out of every one hundred paid tax at the top rate.  Now 38 out of every one hundred do so.  The PAYE sector pays nearly 90 per cent of all income tax.  Income tax contributes nearly two-fifths of all Exchequer revenue. By contrast, companies contribute <Col N="1341" /> only 7.7 per cent and taxes on capital do not even reach 1 per cent.  The average income tax paid by PAYE people as compared to non-PAYE sectors in 1991 tell their own tale according to answers to parliamentary questions.  The average amount paid by the PAYE person was £3,565, by farmers £575 and by self-employed people £2,642.  In other words, farmers pay 16 per cent of what the PAYE person pays and self employed people pay 74 per cent of what the PAYE earner pays.  In 1991 the average PAYE worker paid 23 per cent more in tax than in 1987, more than £600 more per person. In stark contrast farmers paid 8 per cent less and other self-employed people paid less.</P>
    <P>Some of that burden must be shifted from the shoulders of the PAYE sector. That means broadening the tax base.  It means limiting, if not removing, exemptions and shelters and essentially treating all income equally.  The more tax breaks, the narrower the tax base.  Democratic Left favours the conversion of all tax rates into tax credits in the medium term so that they are of equal value of all taxpayers.  These can be phased out in favour of a fully integrated tax and social welfare system for which we have long argued and which I hope the Government will address.</P>
    <P>Section 84 based lending should be ended as Culliton recommended and tax breaks for all forms of unproductive property investment serverly restricted. A modest wealth tax should be introduced. At the height of the currency crisis the Minister railed against speculators and the Governor of the Central Bank broke cover to recommend a tax on windfall profits.  None of this has happened and it is not proffered in the Finance Bill. This Government must grasp the nettle of radical and comprehensive tax reform.  It is not something that can be achieved in a piecemeal fashion.  With 300,000 people unemployed it is one approach that has not been tried.  The Government's package in this Bill is tinkering around at the edges hoping for the best.  It is a shot in the dark.  The prospect of incentives working in the film production area does <Col N="1342" /> not necessarily mean that incentives will work in the manufacturing sector.  I welcome the particular measures introduced to encourage growth in the film production area.</P>
    <P>The system should treat all income in the same way.  That is a cardinal principle in terms of replying to the Taoiseach's challenge to the Opposition parties.  So far as my party is concerned a good tax system must strike a balance between four objectives which often conflict. First, it must be fair in the way it collects revenue, it must take similar amounts from people and corporate bodies with similar income.  Second, it must redistribute income, wealth and work.  Third, it must collect sufficient revenue for the Government to pay for things that are socially necessary.  Fourth, it must serve the economic objectives of encouraging enterprise and job creation.</P>
    <P>Successive Irish Governments have focused primarily on the last two of these objectives: raising revenue and attempting, without very much success, to encourage enterprise.  They may have genuinely believed that handing out vast sums of money to industry in tax breaks and subsidies would stimulate job creation, just as they thought that the massive public spending in the late seventies, which caused the debt problem, would kick-start the private sector.  But they were wrong on both counts.  The unforgivable thing is that they were told at the time they were wrong.  They were told they were wrong in 1980 by Telesis; they were told they were wrong in the mid-eighties by the Commission on Taxation, and again last year they were told by Culliton.  A major report commissioned by an agency of the Government, is having its recommendations ignored.</P>
    <P>The provisions in this Finance Bill fly in the face of Culliton.  What in fact has actually happened during that decade? There has been an explosion of tax incentives and schemes for big business and the rich introduced by conservative Governments.  The higher paid have been the greatest beneficiaries at the expense of the PAYE taxpayer.  These incentives <Col N="1343" /> have failed to create jobs on the required scale, or even on a small scale.  Successive Governments' policies of throwing money indiscriminately in the direction of firms and industries have been a costly disaster.  The multinationals, without any regard for any other consideration, have had the special tax regime extended to the year 2010, which means their returns are virtually tax free while exporting staggering levels of profits.  Most wealth in this country continues to be untaxed; children of the rich can inherit even more, tax free, than at the time of the tax marches.  The self-employed and farmers continue to pay comparatively little income tax.  They now constitute over 30 per cent of the labour force but still contribute only about 10 per cent of income tax revenue; and avoidance and evasion within this sector continue to be a major problem.  An army of overpaid tax consultants, which has become highly educated at the taxpayers' expense, has continued to grow and get richer.  The top rate of tax has been steadily reduced and the relative tax burden on the lower paid has not been reduced.  Taxes on the rich have actually been reduced, even though the country is in a period of fiscal crisis, and tax levels have increased slightly overall.</P>
    <P>I want to put the following quotation on the record of the House and ask the Minister if he recognises it:</P>
    <P>It was never expected and never intended by the advocates of tax reform that widening the tax base and reducing tax rates would produce a lower tax bill for everyone.  On the contrary: it was always inherent in this strategy that there would be trade-offs between, on the one hand, improvements in the mainstream income tax regime and, on the other, curtailment of reliefs which benefit limited groups or sectors.  This was common ground among the proponents of tax reform, and was explicitly stated by, for example, the Commission on Taxation. As the Commission said in its first report: &ldquo;tax reform is a collection <Col N="1344" /> of measures, each of which affects some individuals adversely and others favourably.  Those who will not benefit are those who are over favourably treated under the existing system&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have taken that quotation from the Official Report of 29 April 1992, column 2062, and the speaker was the present Minister for Finance.  At that time I indicated my support for that approach and I shall quote what I said, in case the Minister doubts I ever supported him.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and business dole, in favour of encouraging and stimulating genuine enterprise at a time when a package has been introduced by the Government which I have called the anti-Culliton report.  Whenever we get a chance to debate it I intend to put on the <Col N="1345" /> record of the House arguments which will support that point of view.  We have got a Finance Bill which heads in the opposite direction.</P>
      <P>Last year, in response to the Minister's statement in this area, I said:</P>
      <P>If that is a genuine statement of the policy approach which the Minister for Finance intends to pursue, and I hope at a more accelerated rate in the next budget, it sums up the attitude of my party to tax reform.</P>
      <P>I had hoped for a more accelerated rate in this budget, but instead of that we are heading in the opposite direction.  The Minister has reversed engines and is going in the opposite direction.  Gone are the curtailment of reliefs in many areas which, in the words of the Minister, &ldquo;benefit limited groups or sectors&rdquo; and gone are the limited tax reductions.  Instead we have a new barrage of exemptions and the imposition of a penal levy of 1 per cent, which impacts on all workers who have attained two-thirds of the average wage which will be levied on all income for anyone earning in excess of £9,000. All of this is an argument for more settled medium term planning than can be achieved in the space of one budget to another and that enables businesses to make their own plans with the certainty and confidence that the environment will not change dramatically.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that those who work in the tax avoidance industry will manage to quickly exploit the new reliefs and incentives introduced by the Minister. However, the more important question remains: what will be the permanent impact on the economy, on job creation and how long before these reliefs and incentives are modified, altered or eliminated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not shirked the Taoiseach's challenge to say where the money will come from to pay for genuine tax reform.  The level of tax paid by companies in Ireland is very low by international standards. One effect of this is that taxes on workers' incomes and spending are higher than they might otherwise be.  It is clear that Culliton was alarmed at the <i>ad hoc</i> way <Col N="1346" /> we bring in these measures.  The then Minister for Finance and present Taoiseach came into this House and extended the special 10 per cent tax regime to the multi-national sector to the year 2010 without any regard to what was going on in the revamping of industrial policy generally.  Now we are stuck with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a good story behind that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I would love to hear it because I was intrigued by it at the time. Clearly, Culliton was intrigued by it but he had to deal with it because it is now a fact and one cannot rely on undertakings given.</P>
      <P>Like Culliton, I believe that current industrial policy, particularly the level of tax breaks to Irish industry, is too expensive and far too ineffective.  Any examination since the great tax marches of 1979 and 1980 shows that the cost of tax breaks to industry has exploded.  For example, at 1992 prices the total cost of tax breaks to industry in the 11 years from 1980 to 1990 amounted to a staggering £10.3 billion; yet total job creation in the decade was only 7,000 additional in net terms.  As long ago as 1982, Telesis, in criticising the level of tax breaks, told us that they were the fastest growing part of Government assistance to industry, that they were virtually uncontrolled by Government agencies and amounted to 17 per cent of all incentives granted to industry &mdash; up from nothing six years ago. Ten years later, in 1992, tax expenditure stood at 500 per cent of all subsidies to industry and another report, the Culliton review, has given us the same basic message. Culliton said that tax breaks to industry were indiscriminate, ineffective and should be phased out and replaced by smaller grants and greater use of equity.  It pointed out that grants to industry had amounted to a staggering £1.6 billion between 1980 and 1990.  This huge amount of money was paid by the PAYE taxpayer and it cannot be said that they got value for money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting that while successive Irish Governments have felt obliged to <Col N="1347" /> preach right wing free market economics, they have simultaneously practised costly and effective intervention at great expense to the PAYE taxpayer.  The tax breaks to industry are too great and too indiscriminate.  They have also been ineffective. They feed an army of tax consultants whose brains would be better employed in productive work, adding to national wealth rather than consuming it at the expense of the PAYE taxpayer. We require an alternative tax system for the corporate sector that would meet the requirements of any good tax system &mdash; being fair, redistributive, raising revenue and encouraging productive enterprise. In particular we require reforms for the corporate sector which will increase revenue from non-productive and non-trading companies.  Such exemptions as should or might exist must be concentrated on productive investment, especially in the trading sectors.  The present business dole makes it more profitable for business people to seek tax breaks to make their business more profitable.</P>
    <P>I want also to refer to what Deputy Cox and others have argued with regard to employers' PRSI.  They are reflecting an argument that has been made by sections of business and employers that PRSI should be reduced, cut in half or eliminated altogether in certain sectors. Employers argue that effectively PRSI is a tax on jobs.  I know that this can sound convincing because there is an element of truth in it, but in fact PRSI is part of the social wage.  It pays sick pay, pensions, unemployment benefits and so on. Equally important, it is the only tax that most multinational companies pay.  In fact, many of them pay more in employers' PRSI than they do in corporation tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

      <P>We must view this question of PRSI in the total context of corporate tax.  It is the only contribution that many large companies make, first, for use of resources of the State and, second, towards the social protection of workers generally.  In addition, it must be repeated that employers' PRSI in Ireland compares favourably with our OECD trading partners.  An answer to a recent parliamentary question showed that the 12.2 per cent rate in Ireland compares to 15.4 per cent in Norway, 17.8 per cent in Germany, 30.3 per cent in Spain, 33.2 per cent in Sweden and 38 per cent in France.</P>

      <P>I want to make some remarks about the revival of the business expansion scheme in a more full throated fashion than has been the case up to now. <Col N="1349" /> In my contribution on the budget I made some remarks about the efficacy of this scheme in the light of, for example, the audit project done by the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office of its operation in Ireland.  I also recommend to the Minister the major report done by Dr. Stuart of Trinity College, which is published in <i>Irish Business and Administrative Research</i>, volume 13, 1992. Because Deputy Blaney wants to come in, I will not go over the findings of that report; but it raises serious questions about the efficacy of the BES in doing primarily what it is supposed to do.  I agree that the original concept, if it were to work effectively by directing investment into risk prone enterprises, is a good one.  However, if we go back and examine the record it is clear that we have not managed to operate the BES, nor has the UK, on whose scheme we modelled ours.  I wonder whether the tax avoidance industry will not get to work again to ensure that the very concept of the scheme is undermined and that many of these projects also benefit from grants from the IDA, as Dr. Stuart also shows.</P>
      <P>I have received many representations, as I am sure other Members of the House have, from people who are exceptionally aggrieved about the extension of liability for income tax to people on disability benefit.  This is something that people find very difficult to accept.  Spouses in my own constituency whose husbands have been long term unemployed are being severely affected, losing £25, £27, £29 per week, because the disability benefit is now subject to income tax.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to the 50-50 cashback, as I call it, the tax back scheme.  I hope the scheme works but I can see it being subjected to abuses.  The failure rate of small enterprises must be considered and there is a need for seed capital in that area, but I will deal with that in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I deplore the fact that the consumers of Ireland are being made pay for the <Col N="1350" /> more competitive environment being created for business in regard to telephone charges.  A rebalancing of the system has turned out to be no more than dipping into the pockets of consumers &mdash; in most cases the PAYE sector &mdash; who have been subsidising industry for some time.  We must create a more competiive environment in the international telecommunications zone, but it should not be at the expense of the domestic consumer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance Bill and the budget make provision for the State's housekeeping money for the year.  The Minister announces the various provisions in the budget and the Finance Bill gives effect to those provisions, particularly when taxes, excise duties and so on are being altered, new rates are being introduced or rates deleted, which is exceptional.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that the balancing of the budgets and the provisions in the various Finance Acts in recent years did not conform to the expenditure involved. The national debt is a millstone around every Government and Minister for Finance and is the result of budgeting for overexpenditure and non-provision in budgets and Finance Acts from 1972 to 1987 when we had to call a halt.  It is regrettable we did not do that sooner because I understand the total PAYE take is required at present, and has been for some time, to service the national debt which was created not for any productive purposes, but for the house-keeping of the State.</P>
      <P>I would remind Deputies that every major political party participated at some stage in various Governments &mdash; coalitions or otherwise &mdash; which created the millstone that is now the bane of our existence and the cause of our very high unemployment level.  Had we not to carry the burden that was created by the rakes progress during those years, we would be in a much happier position today and the Minister for Finance, and the Government, would be in a better position to create jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Job creation is the name of the game <Col N="1351" /> according to the Minister and the Government spokespersons since the formation of this Government.  What are we doing about that?  We are imposing more taxes and thereby creating disincentives to would-be employers to take on additional workers even when work is available.  Such is the morass of form-filling, bookkeeping and accounting that small businesses in particular avoid employing additional employees if possible. There should be some incentives to make it attractive to bring about a much needed boost to employment.  The three 1 per cent levies which have been imposed, PAYE and PRSI contributions, the normal accounting and auditing procedures and the employment of accountants are all disincentives for employers who might otherwise create an additional job.</P>
    <P>The service industries cannot be ignored but that seems to be the case in so far as assistance is concerned.  There has been much talk about incentives for the great hope for the future, that of tourism, but the service industries &mdash; the pubs, restaurants and other outlets &mdash; which cater for tourists are ignored.  Such services are asked to carry the burden without the assistance or incentives given to other sectors that provide employment. Extensions to and improvement of restaurants and pubs throughout the country has been given scant attention and no credence for moneys required if such services are to contribute, as they have in the past, to the expansion of tourism.  The Minister should consider seriously giving incentives to those businesses which are an integral part of the tourism industry and without which there would not be such an industry.</P>
    <P>The BES scheme has been extended but I deplore the fact that it no longer applies to hotels.  That was knocked on the head some time ago because apparently &mdash; it was not very evident &mdash; some people were taking undue advantage of it.  Why did it apply to hotel development in the first place?  Why was it felt that it would contribute to the development of our hotels and, in particular, to the provision <Col N="1352" /> of new hotels?  Is it true that the well-heeled in the hotel industry who had the wherewithal at their disposal were able, in the short time that the scheme was available to the hotel industry, to get on with the job and those who had the ideas but not the wherewithal to back them up were left behind and will continue to be left behind?  The benefits went to those who least needed them and the less well-off hoteliers who did not have the opportunity to develop in the short time this scheme was available are unable to compete.  I do not know how there could have been such abuses, but if there were surely it was possible to take steps to prevent them and at the same time allow the BES to apply to hotel development.</P>
    <P>The income tax code has been reformed to some extent.  We have a long way to go, nevertheless, the standard rate has been reduced from 35 per cent to 27 per cent.  The tax bands have been widened and the 48 per cent rate which now applies makes life somewhat easier and makes more sense than the rates which applied in the past.  The clothing and footwear industries suffered a set back recently when the VAT rate on their products was increased by 5 per cent. This 5 per cent may be capable of being carried in the city of Dublin and further south but it will hit very hard the traders, retailers and smaller business within communicating distance of the Border because people on the other side of the Border have the advantage of the 17.5 per cent which operates there.  While anything we import will be charged at 21 per cent, which would not be a disadvantage to our national traders, the Border counties &mdash; and there are six of those from Louth to Donegal &mdash; will bear the brunt of this tax because the problem will not be the imports but the crossing of the Border by consumers to purchase commodities that are cheaper there as a result of the 4.5 per cent differential in the VAT rate.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is doing his best to obviate any real damage to the manufacturers and I have noted with some satisfaction his recent pronouncements <Col N="1353" /> as to what he hopes to do.  I appreciate what he is trying to do but I make the point clearly that we in business in the Border counties have taken the hammer since 1981.  Unremittingly we have been badgered by differences in prices due to variations in taxes, including VAT and excise duties.  This may surprise many and I hesitate to refer to it as it is merely publicising the difference: unleaded super plus petrol in the North today is on average a gross 45 per cent per gallon less than petrol purchased this side of the Border.  If one takes into account the difference in currency which is now being charged at the pumps at 5p in the pound, at a rate of 95p to the pound sterling, and also the discount of approximately 1p off unleaded petrol there is a net difference of 29p per gallon comparing like with like.</P>
    <P>During the years since 1981 we have had beer taxes, liquor taxes and petrol taxes, among others, but the biggest attraction for the husband and the wife going shopping at the weekend has been cheaper petrol, a consideration which will attract people across the Border from distances of 30 miles at least.  While there they can fill up the petrol tank for the week as well as doing the week's shopping even though there may not be much of a saving in so far as the general shopping is concerned.  The new VAT rate on clothing here will be an additional attraction for people to cross the Border and will hurt, particularly the Border retailers and, overall, ordinary retailers also because it represents a net increase, in so far as clothing and footwear are concerned, of 5 per cent on top of 16 per cent.  That is no mean increase in the times in which we live.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to tourism which is now our main hope since the death knell for agriculture has been sounded by the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  Let us have no doubt that in so far as the western half of the country is concerned we are now witnessing the last generation of small farmers, the demise of the small farm.  There will be no successors. On what infrastructure, then, will we build rural development, including <Col N="1354" /> particularly tourism which is supposed to be the saviour of all of us in the west facing bleak times otherwise?  I do not believe we can have rural development and promote tourism if, as is happening, the small farmers are being driven off the land.  I would ask the Minister to look at that issue again because we are on our way out.  There will be all the attendant difficulties of the influx of people from the west into our bigger towns and cities, particularly Dublin.  In addition, many are leaving to join their friends who have left the country in great numbers in recent years.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is serious in regard to the development of tourism but I consider the optimism in that regard to be misplaced so far as the west and, particularly, the north-west, is concerned.  In 1953 we in Donegal purchased a site for an airport that would be capable of accommodating scheduled services but despite repeated requests since then for the go-ahead, no progress has been made on the project.  In other words, though the earliest in the queue, we are the last to be considered.  Though it is not related directly to the Finance Bill, I am asking the Minister now to consider our request for the development of an airport in Donegal, a facility which is related to the development of tourism.  I recall trying to encourage, in 1949, the late Lord Billy Butlin to buy one of our then vacated camps up in Dunree and Lenan.  They were old army camps vacated by the British in the late thirties.  After much consideration his answer was that the day we had an airport in north-west Donegal he would come in and develop that site or some other.  We have been trying to have this airport built ever since and have never succeeded despite the fact that we have a bigger catchment area than, for instance, Cork city.  I will not dwell on the matter further except to say that with the demise of the small farmer and in the absence of an airport, and of train and shipping services we cannot develop tourism in the north-west in any real sense. The possibilities are there but we must have the necessary infrastructure.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister also either <Col N="1355" /> when replying or by way of written reply, to clarify the position relating to vehicle registration tax, how it affects the import of vehicles, particularly second-hand vehicles from wherever they may come. There is much confusion in this regard and it would help if the Minister, whether by public announcement, by letter or otherwise, explained this new system. This would be to the advantage of the purchasing public and particularly those who would and could import second-hand cars from across the Border, from across the water or from Europe.  We need more information about this tax.</P>
    <P>I am amused by the new method of computing beer tax.  It is on the basis of each percentage of alcohol content in the end product. I note the Minister received the greatest possible co-operation from the brewers but in regard to retailers, is it proposed that beers which in the past had been about the same price, will now vary in price according to alcohol content by 2p, 3p or 10p?  Under the present system this would create further confusion and complicate the bookkeeping systems of publicans.  Have publicans given this new system their blessing?  If so in what way will the revised impositions on a differentiated basis impact on retail outlets?  Today, there are many different beers ranging in alcohol strength from 2½ per cent, 3 per cent to 6 per cent, strong beers of 13 per cent and very strong beers of 18 per cent which I am sure would cost more than lower strength beers.  I would like some clarification as to how differences in prices will impact on retailers, publicans and at the end of the day on customers.</P>
    <P>In regard to taxes and revenue, there is the perception that the powers of the Revenue Commissioners are beyond those which any democracy might tolerate. That matter has caused much public concern and is one on which many people are reluctant to comment.  The Revenue Commissioners have been granted powers under laws enacted in this House that would be tolerated in any democracy.  Such powers can only be <Col N="1356" /> compared with those of the totalitarian regimes that existed in the past the East European Countries.</P>
    <P>Education and training is a necessary part of our development.  It is necessary to develop the tourism and catering industries and promote our pubs and hotels.  We do not have a full complement or trained personnel to service or tourist industry and the Government expect that sector to create many jobs.  There is a great need for further training facilities in the tourist industry.  In Donegal we have been unable to obtain funding from this Government, or previous administrations, to extend the facilities in colleges for which there is a demand.  The tourism college in Killybegs has been inundated with applicants.  We have been unable to obtain funding for that college to create more places, yet money has been spent on training by other agencies as if it was going out of fashion.  We have been unable to obtain funding from any Department for tourism which shortly will be our main industry.  Letterkenny Regional Technical College was built to accommodate 540 students and it now has an enrolment of 1,600 which is expected to rise to 2,000.  The college has not been extended and students have to be accommodated in the old mental hospital.  Is this the way to treat Donegal and the north-west?  It is not and I hope somebody takes note of this.  Training is the essence of our hopes for the future and it can be provided in that college where high standards have been attained. The Milford technical and national schools are disgraceful, probably the worst in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister on the good budget he introduced last February.  The success of this budget is evidenced by the dramatic reductions in interest rates and the rate of inflation.  The bottom line for the Government is that it must do what it can to generate employment.  In order to achieve this it is necessary to have the right economic pre-conditions in place. This entails rigorous control over our public finances and a careful prioritisation <Col N="1357" /> of our resources with a view to obtaining the maximum possible return. Prudent, carefully constructed growth is the key to developing enterprise and employment.  The budget was an excellent example of such a strategy and I give it my wholehearted support.</P>
      <P>The Bill marks a significant step forward in generating much needed employment. A recent programme which responded to the Culliton report was entitled, Employment through Enterprise. That title could also act as the motto for this Bill which recognises that the true path to increased employment is through developing our indigenous enterprise.  This is reflected in a wide-ranging series of measures designed to improve the lot of Irish business and allow for a more creative commercial enterprise.  For far too long the lack of seed capital has acted as a major barrier to the development of enterprise.  Many potential enterprises have never passed the planning stage because of the lack of basic capital.  I consider this forward looking Bill goes some way to remedying the present unsatisfactory position.</P>
      <P>The Bill extends the business expansion scheme for a further three years with the removal of the previous lifetime cap for investors.  One of the restrictions which affected small companies who wished to raise capital through that scheme was the exclusion of any relief to those who own more than 30 per cent of a qualifying company.  The Bill proposes that that exemption be lifted once the total capital of the company does not exceed £150,000.  Such a move illustrates how responsive the Government is to the needs of small businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the difficulties involved in securing seed capital and for that reason I am pleased to welcome the Bill's creative new provisions in this regard. They represent a major step forward. The Bill encourages employees to move from safe jobs to set up their own businesses. This scheme allows would-be entrepreneurs to claw-back sums invested in business by way of a refund of income tax.  It will be possible to offset up to £75,000 against taxes which have <Col N="1358" /> been paid.  One of the most positive aspects of this scheme is that it will be beneficial not just to those employed but also to the unemployed, including those who have been made redundant.  It will be particularly relevant to those with taxable redundancy lump sums.  It is a very positive and welcome measure which I hope will act as a catalyst for enterprise development.</P>
    <P>Research and development is a prerequisite for forward looking and progressive businesses.  We have lagged behind in that respect in the past.  Therefore, I welcome the provision in the Bill to encourage greater investment in research and development by providing expenditure related to certain business expansion scheme activities to enable them qualify for that relief.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduces a new scheme to allow individuals dispose of a business and reinvest the proceeds in a manufacturing or other qualifying company without being liable for capital gains tax on the amount received from the sale. Liability for capital gains tax will not arise until the investment in the second company is disposed of.  I congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this excellent concept which is indicative of the positive effects which can be achieved by streamlining the present structure.  We should always be searching for ways to improve the present system.</P>
    <P>The availability of adequate equity finance, especially for start-ups and development, is crucial for Irish industry. These important new incentives introduced by the Minister mark a new beginning in this area which I hope he will build upon.  There is more to the Bill than just provisions to promote enterprise. The increase in mortgage interest relief is very much welcomed by mortgage-holders. This measure vindicates the Government's handling of the currency crisis.  The rate of mortgage interest relief is being increased to 100 per cent for the first three years, subject to the general interest ceilings.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt that our export industry is the life blood of our economy; it is the barometer on which our economic <Col N="1359" /> performance is measured.  For this reason I welcome the introduction of the zero rating on VAT for supplies to companies the bulk of whose output is exported to states outside the Community. Many companies will be able to avail of this initiative which will significantly improve the trading environment for companies which have to make VAT repayments at present.  These companies will benefit from a cash flow gain and savings in administration arising from the simplification of the systems. Such simplification is necessary in a variety of administrative areas, and I hope this is just a beginning.</P>
    <P>The farming community has had to endure its share of hardship during recent years.  I share Deputy Blaney's concern about the consequences of the Common Agricultural Policy reform measures for the farming community particular those in the west and south-west.  I am glad this Bill is not insensitive to the needs of this important community.  The Bill will bring into effect the changes in the stock relief arrangements for farmers announced on 5 April.  Under the previous stock relief scheme, farmers were allowed a tax relief in the form of a deduction from trading profits of 110 per cent of the increase in the value of any trading stock which occurred in the accounting period.  In cases where the value of the stock subsequently declined, any relief given was generally clawed back.  I am delighted that these clawback arrangements are being abolished.  This will ensure that farmers with declining stock values brought about by the recent changes in the Common Agricultural Policy will not have to suffer adverse tax consequences. The new stock relief scheme will give farmers a deduction from trading profits of 25 per cent of the increase in the value of trading stock in an accounting period and no clawback arrangement will apply. This is a very interesting development.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made in the Bill to enable a farmer on a flat-rate who purchases goods in another member state above the £32,000 threshold to register in respect of those acquisitions and to <Col N="1360" /> remain on a flat-rate in all other respects. There has been some criticism of the probate proposals, but I am relieved to note that the Bill provides for full exemption for families where there is a surviving spouse.  Bearing in mind the concern which has been expressed about it, I urge the Minister to keep this tax under review from the point of view of equity and effectiveness.</P>
    <P>I regard the Bill as positive and forward looking.  However, like all legislation, it can be improved.  In this regard I wish to put forward what I consider to be some constructive amendments.  Special tax exemptions should be given to industries which are set-up based on import substitution. An Bord Tráchtála recently published a booklet, which cost £100, containing a long list of possible companies which could fill the import substitution market.  This is a most informative booklet and I strongly recommended it to any person or organisation interested in setting-up local industries or expanding existing ones based on import substitution.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the £1.7 billion spent on the importation of potatoes, vegetables, fruit and general food products. This is a huge import bill.  It would be great if the major proportion of these goods could be produced here.  I am firmly convinced that this can be done if the will exists between the Government, social partners, entrepreneurs and the agricultural community.  We have a tremendous opportunity to cut down on our import bill and create employment in the food processing sector and the food industry generally.  There is enormous potential in this sector, and I urge the Minister to give the matter serious consideration.</P>
    <P>The horticultural industry has tremendous potential for development.  The job creation potential of this industry has not been tapped.  The climate in the south-west in particular is ideally suited to the production of horticultural produce. Pilot schemes should be set up in south Kerry and west Cork as a start in the development of this industry.  A new processing plant should be set up in Kenmare <Col N="1361" /> which is ideally suited, both geographically and economically, for the development of this industry.  I acknowledge the efforts made by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Walsh, and his Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, in this regard.  Nevertheless, there is still room for further growth which would pay great dividends in terms of job creation.</P>
    <P>Tourism is the greatest growth industry not alone in Ireland but throughout the world, and it will continue to be up to the year 2000 and beyond.  It is also our most decentralised industry &mdash; it stretches from our cities to our towns, villages and townlands.  However, we have only scratched at the surface in terms of the potential of this industry.  I am somewhat concerned at the proposal to increase the VAT on tourism accommodation from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent.  This will have an adverse effect on the owners of hotels, guesthouses, caravan and camping parks and other facilities this year due to the fact that the price list had been structured, prepared and issued in book form well in advance of the introduction of the latest budget.  Perhaps the Minister would re-examine this area about which the tourism sector is concerned.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to understand the lack of import substitution in the horticultural sector.  For example, nobody can understand why it should be necessary to import frozen chips, potatoes and vegetables, when our climate, particularly in the west and south-west, is so ideal for their growth and production. I feel strongly about this matter.  The Government must make every effort to substitute imports by having local groups organised, either on a corporate or community basis, while realising that such must be allied closely with a marketing organisation, perhaps a local or county-based one, because there is tremendous scope in that area.  I hope the Minister will devote special attention to it.</P>
    <P>While the provisions of this Finance Bill may be tough on a few sectors, they are geared for job creation.  We cannot overlook the fact that our primary responsibility in this House is to be seen <Col N="1362" /> to be taking positive steps at all times to create employment opportunities for our very large number of unemployed, particularly those in the younger age bracket.  Apart from the food and horticultural sector and tourism, undoubtedly jobs can be created through the development of service industries and small business.  I contend that an enterprise centre should be established in every town nationwide to facilitate local entrepreneurs who may want to establish local business or ventures, thereby creating employment based on indigenous resources.  In the industrial and services sector I believe that small is beautiful in that large numbers of small industries and services provide very good employment and withstand the test of time.  For example, within a local community, whenever a larger industry fails the position overall becomes disastrous, whereas, whenever a smaller type industry or business fails the impact will not be so great on a local community.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to take some positive action to expedite the planning process and appeals procedure. It is crucial that planning applications be dealt with as quickly as possible by the relevant planning authorities and planning appeals decided more speedily by An Bord Pleanála than has been the case to date, in that projects leading to the creation of jobs invariably are delayed because of the slowness of the planning appeals process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly interested in the development of the County Kerry Airport and should like to see a marketing organisation established in conjunction with this great development.  I should like the Minister to interest himself in helping local groups in the provision of such a marketing organisation and in making some grant aid available for that purpose. We must remember that marketing opportunities exist within Europe and America, particularly through the promotion of tourism, commerce and trade <Col N="1363" /> in County Kerry.  With the proposed airport located in the centre of County Kerry, I believe the future of the county will be bright provided a proper marketing structure can be developed in conjunction with the county airport.</P>

      <P>It is obvious from the provisions of this Finance Bill that tax reform has been put on the backburner once again.  Having listened to the Minister's long convoluted remarks, I wonder what will be their impact on the people I know in west Limerick employed in local industries, most of whom earn on average between £9,000 and £12,000 annually.  I wonder in particular what will be the impact of the draconian 1 per cent income levy on these people.  I question its impact on their incentive to work since many of them are already caught in the poverty trap merely by engaging in work.  I question its impact in relation to social welfare benefits, medical cards and so on.  It can clearly be seen therefore that the climate is not conducive to working and that this latest 1 per cent levy will help to exacerbate the already bad position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it ironic and strange that Ministers and various other Members on the Government side of the House can herald the provisions of this Finance Bill as creating a new dawn for jobs when they do quite the contrary.  This is an anti-jobs Bill, which I hope to prove by the following remarks.  The Minister has said that the 1 per cent levy will probably be a temporary measure.  It is obvious that at present the Minister is reacting to trade union sources, who have said they will not even discuss the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> programme unless this 1 per cent income levy is withdrawn.  Rather than perhaps conceding to such demands at the end of the year, when there will be discussions on a new <i>Programme for Economic and</i><Col N="1364" /><i>Social Progress</i> agreement, the Minister should react responsibly now, realising that ordinary workers regard this as a punitive levy on them.  I sometimes wonder whether Ministers and Government Departments, when introducing such proposals, live in Disneyland and perhaps are cocooned in their jobs and not knowing the impact of such proposals on the ordinary worker.  No doubt the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Stagg will know this well in relation to his constituents since I often heard him spearhead the cause of the factory worker and so on.  I wonder what is his reaction to this most recent levy.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that it is his objective to maximise jobs Let us examine some of the provisions of this Finance Bill in order to ascertain how very unreal is that statement of the Minister. Recently we had a motion tabled in Private Member's time in relation to VAT on the clothing and footwear industry, and there was a protest parade of 8,000 people.  We all know how vulnerable the clothing and footwear industries here are and how they must compete with imports.  Equally, we all know how difficult it is for them to survive in these circumstances.  I must say they put forward their case in a most professional manner.  Already its effect has had a considerable impact on the industry.  At present the Government appears on the one hand to be driving people out of jobs and on the other talking about introducing seed capital for budding entrepreneurs. However, we must examine the conditions attached to such aid.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker spoke of this innovative scheme, drawing people out of safe jobs and creating an entrepreneurial spirit to engage in business ventures.  Surely one of the main priorities of such business ventures should be the creation of long term jobs.  We must remember that any such proposals will have to be vetted by the Industrial Development Authority in the case of manufacturing and by Bord Fáilte in the case of tourism.  Whenever such a venture is established they will have to examine <Col N="1365" /> its impact on similar type ventures elsewhere. We must bear that stipulation in mind in view of the impact already on many sectors of indigenous industry, joinery and concrete blocks being just one instance.  The clear message is that if one wants to engage in ventures on that basis, go ahead but do not expect any grant aid from the Industrial Development Authority or SFADCo.  I wonder what impact this will have on these budding entrepreneurs, how it would encourage them to leave safe jobs to enter into such business ventures.</P>
    <P>We read in the press that the Department of Finance had reservations about the introduction of schemes of this nature.  So many caveats have been entered in relation to this scheme and the tax concessions to budding entrepreneurs, that I believe the dead hand of the Department of Finance will be evident from the very beginning.  I should like to see the provisions of that scheme availed of but I believe the conditions and restrictions attaching to it will minimise its impact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 30, 42 and 71 together.  This year's Social Welfare Act provides that students in full time education will no longer be eligible to receive unemployment assistance except in circumstances and subject to such conditions and for such periods as may be prescribed in regulations.  I propose to make regulations shortly which will exempt categories such as mature students and students participating in educational schemes for the long term unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already announced in the <Col N="1376" /> House, a new summer jobs scheme for students will be introduced this summer. The new scheme will cater for full time students who cannot get summer jobs and who are no longer eligible to receive unemployment assistance during their summer holidays by virtue of this year's Social Welfare Act.  The new regulations will also provide for students living at home who cannot get work under the new scheme and whose families are dependent on social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>The new scheme will operate for ten weeks during the period 1 July to 30 September 1993 and will allow students who would formerly have been eligible for unemployment assistance of £15 or more per week to earn up to £400 over the ten week period of the scheme.  Voluntary organisations, community groups and public bodies with suitable work will be able to participate as sponsors.  Payments under the scheme will be made to participating students by the sponsors who will in turn be reimbursed by my Department.</P>
    <P>I have discussed the new scheme with representatives of a number of voluntary organisations and the initial response has been very positive.  This initial contact will now be followed up by advertisements in relevant publications seeking applications from sponsors and students wishing to participate in the scheme.  Earlier this week, during a visit to Cork to open a public service information exhibition, I launched new information leaflets and application forms for both students and sponsors.  My Department will be undertaking a direct mail-shot of information leaflets to a wide range of voluntary organisations and community groups.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are in place within my Department to collate responses and to compile detailed lists of participating sponsors in each region.  This information will be made available to students who apply to participate in the scheme. Responsibility for approaching sponsors to secure jobs under this innovative scheme rests with the students themselves.</P>
    <P>The type of work envisaged under the <Col N="1377" /> scheme will be non-commercial in nature and will enable students to engage in a wide range of activities of enormous benefit to their own communities.  The scheme will also give sponsors an opportunity to improve and develop their own services for the good of society as a whole.  I am confident that many students and sponsors will welcome and support this initiative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister what voluntary organisations he has spoken to about the summer scheme and what commitments has he received from those organisations that they will provide the 12,000 jobs necessary to cater for the students who will be cut off?  Is the Minister aware that it is the view of many organisations that this scheme is a charade and a smokescreen for one of the most callous measures imposed on students?  This is not a works programme but a cost cutting exercise similar to one of the last acts of the Margaret Thatcher Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would be appropriate for me to mention the specific voluntary organisations here. These organisations will obviously come forward now as the scheme has been launched this week.  A number of organisations dealing with people with disabilities and with community work projects during the summer period approached me after the measure was announced in the House and I am confident that a large number of opportunities will be provided by these bodies.</P>

      <P>There are jobs available during the summer period which are not available at other times of the year and therefore they are not suitable for people seeking full time employment.  On the <Col N="1378" /> other hand there are people in the voluntary sector who would be anxious to see such a scheme running for the whole year, and I am considering that matter. There is a voluntary work option scheme in place at present which is available to people who are long term unemployed. That scheme is considered as part of a programme being developed at present. In some cases worth-while options and experience is provided &mdash; for instance, Incare, with assistance from my Department, provides 25 training places for those who assist people with disabilities, particularly people in wheelchairs.  Last Saturday another scheme was launched in the voluntary sector for respite care, again with a training element, and the Soroptomists are developing that scheme.  I agree with the Deputy that there is much scope for that kind of development and I will be very flexible in relation to proposals in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 41 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>At the end of March this year there were 4,372 carer's allowances in payment. Further carers will qualify for the allowance from July next following the increase in the payment to equal the long term rate for unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>The allowance which I introduced in November 1990 provided, for the first time, for a direct payment to be made to the carer on a means tested basis.  It is directed at people who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners with full-time care and attention and whose income falls below certain limits.  In July 1991 the allowance was extended to persons providing care for the recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance from the health boards or the recipients of an equivalent social security payment from another EC country or a country which has a bilateral social security agreement with Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question addressed by Deputy Clohessy to my colleague, the Minister <Col N="1381" /> for Health, on 4 May last refers to the issue of introducing a change in the means test applying to the carer's allowance. Any relaxation in the means test would have cost implications which could only be considered in the light of available resources and in a budgetary context.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress at this point that the fundamental reason for introducing the carer's allowance was to provide a basic income maintenance payment to be made directly to the carer.  In this regard it was always the intention that resources be directed at carers on very low incomes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's figure of 4,372 shows the level of lip service being given to these people in 1993, European Year of the Elderly.  The Minister increased the allowances but retained the barriers against qualification for these allowances.  Would the Minister not agree that there is a long overdue need for a comprehensive policy for carers and that an integrated approach should be taken by his Department and the Department of Health in this area so as to provide an incentive to keep long term sick and elderly people out of hospitals, thereby providing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I note that the Minister said that the Department of Finance is co-ordinating the development of the national plan.  In reply to a question, the Minister for Finance said that the central objective is to have a plan focused on generating sustainable employment and growth.  Since the Minister present is the Minister with responsibility, along with his junior Minister, for dealing with the 22 per cent unemployment rate and all the social ills and social exclusion that comes from this huge rate of unemployment, would he agree that it is up to his Department to put forward strong coherent policies to tackle social exclusion and that it is not enough to take the traditional approach of allowing the Department of Finance to make these decisions?

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>I have spoken at length in this House during the budget and on the Social Welfare Bill in relation to the measures introduced last year and the initiatives I have taken to review them.</P>
      <P>The following adjustments have been made: the condition for disability benefit requiring at least 13 paid PRSI contributions in a recent contribution year has been revoked for people on long term unemployment assistance and pre-retirement allowance.  This was provided for in the Social Welfare (Disability Benefit) Regulations, 1993, S.I. No. 83 of 1993. The condition for dental and optical benefits requiring at least 13 paid PRSI contributions in a recent contribution year has been revoked for people on disability benefit for more than 12 months, invalidity pension, long term unemployment assistance and pre-retirement allowance.</P>
      <P>Dental and optical benefits have been restored to pensioners affected by the change in the contribution conditions requiring five years paid contributions. Dental and optical benefits have also been restored to workers earning up to £30,000 per annum and £60,000 per annum if the worker has a dependent spouse.  The change relating to dental and optical benefits were made in the Social Welfare (Treatment Benefit) (Amendment) Regulations, 1993, S.I. No. 84 of 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The condition for entitlement to unemployment <Col N="1386" /> benefit for part-time workers has been relaxed by reducing from two days to one day the loss of employment which a part-time worker must incur in order to be regarded as having sustained a substantial loss of employment.  This was provided for in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Social Insurance Provisions) Regulations, 1993, SI No. 82 of 1993.  The amount of daily earnings disregarded in assessing earnings from casual insurable employment for unemployment assistance purposes has been substantially increased to the daily rate of unemployment assistance plus an extra £15 for each day worked.  This means that a married man with two children can now earn up to £34.42 for each day in which he works without affecting his rate of unemployment assistance for the days in which he does not work.  This was provided for in the Social Welfare (Unemployment Assistance) Regulations, 1993, SI No. 99 of 1993.</P>
    <P>As regards exceptional needs payments under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, I announced last week new arrangements to help people on social welfare incomes who get into difficulty with fuel bills.  These new arrangements will come into effect from the beginning of next month and will replace the existing guidance issued to health boards on this matter.  The new arrangements will involve the establishment of a joint code of practice which will integrate the help and advice available from the health boards and the fuel providers with a view to ensuring that clients who have problems in meeting bills receive all the assistance that is available. I intend to publish details of the code in an information leaflet jointly with the health boards and the utilities.  The leaflet will set out clearly and simply the help which is available from the health boards and the fuel providers to enable consumers to meet their fuel bills and to maintain supply.</P>
    <P>The overall effect of the initiatives I have taken as a result of my review has been to alleviate any particular difficulties identified as arising from last year's measures.  The measures still in <Col N="1387" /> force will continue to be reviewed in the light of their impact on social welfare customers and any further necessary changes will be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 39 together.  Smallholders and other self-employed people can be entitled to unemployment assistance provided they satisfy a means test.  The legislation provides for the assessment of cash income and for assessing capital. The usual procedure is to take details of the previous year's income and expenses as a reference or starting point.  The estimated net income is updated in the light of prevailing conditions and the expected position over the year ahead.  Where, for example, opportunities for self-employment are likely to be less than heretofore an adjustment is made to reflect this.  Any smallholder or self-employed person can apply for a review of the means assessment if at any point their circumstances change significantly.  If dissatisfied with an assessment it is open to them to appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office.</P>
      <P>The methods of assessment are kept under review by my Department.  The procedure in smallholder and self-employed cases is working satisfactorily in that it has the flexibility to respond to variations in their circumstances.</P>
      <P>All such people are required to sign on.  However, arrangements are being made in conjunction with the introduction of a range of payment methods to reduce the required frequency of signing. This has already commenced for some smallholders who are now required to sign only once every six months.  It is intended to reduce the frequency of signing on for most others in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Question No. 9 deals with the payment of small farmers assistance and Question No. 39 deals with the self-employed.  Can the Minister confirm that signing on requires the farmer to be available for and actively seeking work? Is that what signing on means?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is recognised that the smallholder is working a holding and <Col N="1392" /> therefore is given special treatment which does not apply to other people generally. During the past few years I increased the rate in line with urban rates.  It is a good scheme and works well.  They have to comply with the system generally but they are given special treatment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>If they were treated the same as other self-employed people they would have to give up their special position. They have been given a special position by virtue of their position on the land.  Consequently they have to sign the same as others, but the signing arrangements are being relaxed very considerably. Basically, the scheme under which they are paid is one which requires them to be available for work and seeking work and not ill.  Those are the three basic requirements of the scheme.  In their particular case they have always been given an exceptional position and that still pertains today.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, we have made some special arrangements in the partnership areas for people taking up self-employment.  The different facets of assessment are explained in the reply.  There is a simplified system by reference to traditional earnings.  However, if a self-employed person has particular difficulties there are means of addressing them.  I know Deputy Browne would like to see more flexibility in approaching problems and we will certainly look at that in the context of facilitating people at work.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a smallholders' scheme.  If the Deputy tables a question I will find out the exact legal provision. This scheme comes under general unemployment assistance.  It has operated for many years and been modified somewhat to make it more flexible.  The concept of a national valuation was discontinued and benefits are now based on a factual assessment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the scheme needs to be changed?  Farmers are being put in a &ldquo;catch 22&rdquo; situation.  They must sign on on the basis that they are available for work, yet they must earn an income from their farms by the sweat of their brows. This is unfair to farmers.  Will the Minister change the scheme and pay the farmers what they are entitled to by way of income supplement?  The Minister should forget this fiction that they are available for work.  He is making dishonest people of them by making them sign on on the basis that they are available for work.</P>

      <P>Smallholders are reviewed by the social welfare officer only in the context of their means.  It is, therefore, rather farcical that they should have to sign on.  It must be feasible to issue them with a book and have their payments regularised.  Are social welfare officers aware of the guidelines on acceptable income and expenditure under this scheme?  Will the Minister also agree that it is the computation of the value of livestock in family units that causes much hardship when estimating the income of such farmers?

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that unemployed young people are being told that they would qualify for unemployment assistance if they were to buy a mobile home and live in it beside their parents rather than living in the house with their parents; and his views on this interpretation of the existing legislation in regard to benefit of board and lodging.</Quest>

      <P>The value to a claimant of free board and lodgings occurs, in the main, in the assessment of the benefit accruing to a young person living at home and claiming unemployment assistance. It covers the value of accommodation, meals, support and maintenance as well as generally sharing in the standard of living of the household and the facilities which the household enjoys.  Because the <Col N="1396" /> value of free board and lodgings depends on the household circumstances the amount of the assessment varies.  The assessment achieves a degree of equity as between applicants in different household circumstances.</P>
      <P>The current legislation allows an element of discretionary power to be conferred on the deciding officers dealing with the varied circumstances surrounding the assessment of benefit and privilege.  In order to qualify for a payment without the assessment of board and lodgings, it must be evident that the claimant no longer enjoys the advantages accruing from the facilities of the parental home.  While the situation referred to by the Deputy has not been brought to my attention, the extent to which board and lodgings would be assessed in such circumstances is dependent on the benefit accruing to the individual.</P>
      <P>The underlying principle of relating the value of board and lodgings in any case to the income level of the household in which he or she accrues benefit is essentially a good one.</P>
      <P>I am, however, concerned that improvements in the system should be made where possible.</P>
      <P>In order to provide some measure of financial independence for unemployment assistance claimants subject to assessment of benefit and privilege, I introduced a minimum weekly payment of £5 in the 1991 budget.  In this year's Social Welfare Bill, I provided for the disregarding of long term social welfare payments in the assessment of benefit and privilege.</P>
      <P>Any further improvements will, of course, have to take account of their financial implications.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that some of these regulations are anti-family and have the practical effect of forcing children out of the family home? Would he agree that once the individual is forced out into private accommodation the subsequent cost to the State in rent allowances and supplementary welfare allowances could be much greater? Would he agree that there is a need for <Col N="1397" /> an overall study of the impact of some of the regulations on family?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is a financial one.  It has been estimated that the abolition of this clause would cost between £50 million and £53 million.  That estimate is based on 1991 figures and relates mainly to young people in the circumstances the Deputy has mentioned. It also raises the issue of making payments to an individual irrespective of the general means in a household.  In allocating money at budget time people on very low incomes are taken into account before adjustments of that sort are made. In this year's Social Welfare Act I provided that long term social welfare payments be disregarded in the assessment of benefit and privilege and that, I trust the Deputies will accept, is an important step.</P>

      <P>Am I to understand that income from unemployment assistance will be treated differently from other income of the same amount?  If that is so, does that concession on the part of the Minister not create a poverty trap?  If a family were to cease to be unemployed, not only would the person getting the job not gain very much but a son or daughter living with him might find that their unemployment assistance is reduced. This is a further example of a poverty trap being created by a measure which I accept is designed to do good.  Will the Minister agree that the cost of the £52 million he has quoted must be set against the saving in rent subsidies payable to young people, many of whom leave home and go into rented accommodation where they have to be subsidised, as Deputy Allen pointed out?  The Minister should not quote a figure of £52 million without also giving a figure for the potential savings in rent subsidies.  Will he agree that there is a case for having an overall look at the impact of the social welfare system on the family and that we should establish a commission on the family similar to the Commission on the Status of Women which has done a great deal of excellent work?</P>

      <P>Yes.  Deputy Bruton should have been here for the Social Welfare Bill if he wanted to debate that matter.  The point is, should we give benefits to anybody or relieve the position for anybody.  That is a separate question. First, the main concern for those at work is that they should have adequate wages above the social welfare levels and, second, that their net take home pay is adequate and not significantly reduced. The problem does not lie with us providing an improvement in the income of those depending on social welfare.  That is a separate issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister's earlier response, can I take it that because he dwelt mainly on the cost implications he takes on board the principle that it is illogical that young people should be paid rates of £10 or £5?  For example, a constituent of mine has two unemployed adult dependants at home <Col N="1400" /> who are being paid £10 and £5.  Surely it would be better to give them the full rate rather than encourage them to leave the bosom of their family where they receive plenty of support.  This is not a minor matter, because 91,000 people under 25 years are unemployed.  That involves a large number of families.  Would it not be sensible to consider the principle outlined in Deputy Bruton's question?  This would have to be offset against the high and rising costs of rent subsidies which must be considered also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is that all those cases are means tested.  There are two schemes in operation &mdash; a social security one depending on stamps or contributions and a means tested scheme. The means tested scheme is supported entirely by the taxpayer.  It is a question of what further taxation is available to me as Minister for Social Welfare to improve any of those payments.  I am sure the Deputy knows the position well in regard to taxation.  I have made improvements this year, but one cannot make such improvements without having additional resources and imposing additional taxes. I am sure the Deputy is aware that her party would strongly support the reduction of taxes, but we must get the income from somewhere and that is where the difficulty lies.  We have improved the position this year and we will continue to so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The total amount spent on rent supplements is approximately £20 million.  The amount that would apply to the benefit and privilege in that regard would be relatively small.  There is still a substantial amount of money available to make changes and we make those changes in the budget.  We must get our priorities right in regard to social welfare payments and there is household income in the case of benefit and privilege.  The entire social welfare system is based on the assessment of household income. <Col N="1401" /> There is a benefit from the £5 or £10 payment because it automatically makes a person eligible for social employment schemes, training schemes, FÁS schemes and so on and people are usually anxious to be eligible for such schemes.  Therefore, that payment benefits some people and the lower limit is £5 compared to 50p, 90p and £1.20 which applied not long ago.</P>

Where I come from people move in from small rural towns to Limerick city, get the full amount of unemployment assistance and pay £25 to £30 to landlords.  Surely that is a misplacement of funds.  In relation to the £5 and £10 which a person is allowed based on household income and expenditure, will he agree that it is not fairly assessed because in many cases households which are classified as middle income families are struggling with mortgages and so on?

Did the Minister consider that variant which would not involve a poverty trap but would continue, as is proper, to target extra assistance for those on low incomes whether they be from social welfare or otherwise?</P>

I tabled a question, which will not be reached now, on the integration of the tax and social welfare codes as a means of eliminating poverty traps and I should like the Minister to indicate whether any progress has been made in that regard? In relation to assessing a person for unemployment assistance, would the Minister consider having some regard for a single adult living at home with his or her parents?

The Minister said that most of those people were young, but what about people in their thirties, forties, and older, who are still treated as dependent on their parents, that must be a terrible indignity.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 45 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The means test criteria are broadly similar for all schemes although there are variations in the manner in which some of the components, principally capital and income from earnings, are assessed.  For example, the rules of means assessment <Col N="1406" /> in the case of widows, lone parents and elderly people are generally more favourable than those for other schemes.</P>
    <P>The application of a single means test for all social welfare schemes would have significant costs to the Exchequer, particularly if we were to ensure, as I believe we must, that no existing recipient suffered a reduction in payment as a result.  Similar consideration would apply in relation to changing from a gross to a net income basis of assessment.</P>
    <P>For those who are most in need, namely those with very low or no means other than social welfare, the distinction between gross and net income is not material.</P>
    <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to simplify the administrative requirements of the social welfare system and to remove anomalies.  The administrative procedures for means-testing are kept under constant review.  Increasingly desk interviewing is being used where possible to establish means and thus reduce the time taken to put claims into payment. The broader process of review of the social welfare system, including the means test, is an ongoing one.  I would like to bring about greater standardisation in the means test arrangements generally and I will be examining the scope for such standardisation within the limits of the available resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to ensuring standardisation of the system.  Would the Minister not agree that the present system is complex, confusing and at times very degrading?  I ask her to ensure that the system is both equitable and consistent.  Is the Minister's Department in contact with the health boards which distribute money from her Department?  In many cases there is inconsistency between the health boards and I can give examples of this to the Minister later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms. Burton Ms. Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms. Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputies on all sides of the House recognise that the Department is faced with the task of standardising the system of means testing to <Col N="1407" /> the greatest extent possible as resources permit.  The Department is in constant contact with the health boards in regard to the operation of various schemes administered by them, the budgets for which are supplied by the Department. Like the Deputy, I am aware that a number of people who have made claims and who have dealings with the health boards have pointed out improvements which they believe could be made in the present system.  I think both the Minister and I are on record as saying that we favour a system where people will be able to make claims under what is, effectively, a one-stop shop system where information will be available.</P>
      <P>With regard to improvements in the system, improvements in computerisation are under way in the Department at present.  There is also the general question of the provision of additional budgetary resources.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned I was referring to the adverse effect the increase in VAT on clothing and footwear has had on employment.  I am sure that prior to the devaluation of our currency the Minister was aware that many jobs had been lost in this sector. These jobs were lost mainly because the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach failed to realise the full impact of the currency crisis on Irish business at that <Col N="1461" /> time.  It took Deputy John Bruton to remind the Government of the terrible consequences for us of not devaluing our currency.  Eventually, the Government came to its senses.  I was very surprised to hear the Taoiseach say on television last Sunday evening that interest rates had tumbled down as a result of the budget.  All independent economists have said that the reduction in interest rates has been due mainly to the devaluation of our currency, which had been overvalued.  It is important to put the record straight in this respect.  The Taoiseach should have been magnanimous enough to say that devaluation had contributed to the reduction in interest rates.</P>
      <P>As I said, this is an anti-jobs budget; the VAT increases prove this.  We all know that the building industry has been in the doldrums for a considerable period of time.  This has been mainly due to a lack of new house starts, which was brought about by a stagnant economy and the cutbacks by local authorities. There has been some improvement in this area in recent times with a small increase in the number of local authority houses being built.  The difficulties in the building industry have had a knock-on effect on the other sectors in the construction industry.  It has been pointed out that the increase in the VAT rate on cement from 10 per cent to 21 per cent could have a knock-on effect on the industry as a whole and lead to further job losses.</P>
      <P>The increase in the rate of VAT on newspapers from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent seems to indicate a lack of recognition among the Government of the actual cost of newspapers and the number of English tabloids imported into this country every day.  The increase in the number of English tabloids being bought here has been mainly due to the price differential between English and Irish newspapers. The increase in the price of newspapers has meant that many people do not buy a newspaper every day.  The increase in VAT on newspapers is a retrograde and foolish step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most punitive provision in the <Col N="1462" /> recent budget was the reintroduction of estate duty, now known as probate tax. In 1974 estate duty was abolished.  In effect this is a reintroduction of death duties.  It demonstrates a huge lack of sensitivity on the part of the Government because this probate tax will affect not only farming families but small businesses also.  We are all aware that there is sufficient emotional strain on the death of a family member without adding this additional burden.  For the sake of a revenue yield of £4 million it demonstrates a remarkable lack of imagination on the part of the Government.  Since there has been evidence of economic buoyancy recently, even since the introduction of the budget, generating much more revenue for the State coffers, it behoves the Government to reconsider their position on the imposition of this tax.  We shall be tabling an amendment on Committee Stage for the withdrawal of this probate tax, which has led to an understandable hostile reaction from the farming community. Its re-introduction was a retrograde step.</P>
    <P>Another provision of this Finance Bill which will affect many businesses, especially those with VAT payments in excess of £120,000 annually, is the advance payment of one-twelfth to take place on 1 December each year.  Occurring just before Christmas, this will not be regarded as acceptable by many such business people.  In recent days we have heard of increased telephone charges which will affect the 700,000 domestic telephone users.  By the time all these increases are implemented they will be the subject of a very hostile reaction. I believe that all of these impositions combined will erode most families' income, dragging more and more people into the poverty trap.</P>
    <P>In what I have said I have endeavoured to demonstrate that this latest budget is an anti-jobs one and should not be portrayed as a barometer of increasing job numbers nationwide.  The provisions of this Finance Bill will have a disastrous effect on employment.  The Minister should realise that many of its provisions will not lead to the positive contribution <Col N="1463" /> he anticipated.  In relation to the revenue generated, there could be spin-off losses for our economy through greater numbers of people losing their jobs, which of course will also have an adverse effect on the revenue going into the State coffers.</P>
    <P>I am particularly disappointed because this Government has the largest majority in the history of the State.  I often wonder whether that is an advantage or disadvantage. It may be an advantage in that the Government appears to endeavour to accommodate a greater diversity of thinking, allowing for people with varying opinions on many matters.  We had a classic example today in the variation in thinking on the Refugee Bill, 1993, on the part of Deputy Kemmy and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Ruairí Quinn.  Deputy Kemmy told the Government to cop on to themselves and accept that Bill, but the Minister pointed in the other direction, demonstrating that it is a kind of tweedledum, tweedledee arrangement.  It was manifest also in relation to Deputy Bree's contribution on the North of Ireland, while the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs is going around trying to portray a positive image for this country and getting contradictory vibes.  At a time when the Government has such a majority in this House, when it appears we are entering a period of stability, it is indeed regrettable and unfortunate that it did not allow for such circumstances within the provisions of the Finance Bill. The Government could have been considerably more innovative in its thinking.</P>

    <P>The Finance Bill is supposed to be the engine that drives our economy for the coming year.  If this is supposed to be the driving force to meet the massive and dangerous challenges facing our society, then I predict it will prove to be a dismal failure.  Such challenges cannot be <Col N="1464" /> responded to by a Finance Bill which is like a remodelled, reconditioned engine: the core is basically the same, with the addition of a few spare parts, in many cases second-hand.  At the end of the day this Finance Bill will take almost £500 million more in additional taxation from this economy than it contributes.</P>
    <P>The frightening aspect of our current situation is that we are sitting on a powder keg.  Our society is breaking down around us.  I hope I am wrong, but I am of the strong opinion there could be a massive backlash or upheaval here.  There is a frightening aspect of all this.  Apart from repeated statements of concern, this Government appears to be &mdash; and this goes for the Labour Party in particular &mdash; settling snuggly into their ministerial portfolios, all set for four complacent years of power and enjoyment.  Yet the ground has never been more fertile for a social upheaval here.  With unemployment at 300,000, we have a Frankenstein which will wreak terrible havoc unless it is tackled purposefully.  I predict some day, probably sooner rather than later, the unemployed will take to the streets.  And who could blame them?  The day that takes place this Government and this country will be in trouble.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> both promised multi-faceted, all embracing breakthroughs on the unemployment problem.  Yet during the term of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> 40,000 additional people were added to the live register.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was launched with a similar fanfare, but unemployment continued to grow month by month until finally it reached the all time record of 300,000.  The Programme for a Partnership Government was to signal a new dawn based on what the Labour Party touted as putting trust back into Irish politics.  As we have observed over the past 100-plus days, all has changed, but nothing has changed.</P>
    <P>Following two slight reductions in the unemployment figures over the previous two months, last Friday's live register figures showed that unemployment is <Col N="1465" /> almost back up at the 300,000 mark.  The official figures from the Departments of Finance and Labour for 1993 forecast an increase of something in the region of 10,000 to 25,000 and the estimate for 1996 is of an additional 46,000 people unemployed.  In some cases whole families &mdash; mothers and fathers, sons and daughters &mdash; are queuing at unemployment exchanges and Garda barracks in every village, town and city nationwide for the £55 per week subsistence allowance. Yet the banner headlines in all the newspapers are heralding yet another scandal, this time involving what was supposed to be the jewel in the crown of the Irish semi-State sector, Irish Life. Imagine the impact of that on somebody queuing at the end of an 80 yard dole queue for £55 subsistence?  Certainly, as in so many other cases, no law was broken.</P>
    <P>One can go back over the past two years and look at the Carysfort affair &mdash; the £9.7 million voted by the Minister for Finance to the Minister for Education to bail out a friend in need, stuck, with a property he could not dispose of.  Look at the Ballsbridge Telecome Éireann affair, when high profile directors had to resign in a welter of controversy.  Look at the Greencore affairs, Mark I, the high profile resignations from that company and the £1.5 million individual payments to people who had to resign.  Look at the sacking of the former chairman of the Irish Permanent Building Society, the so-called financial creativity involved in the lead up to his departure from that society. Look at the resignation and circumstances surrounding the leader of another building society.  Look at the Greencore, Mark II, the Davy Stockbrokers saga of last week, the <i>débácle</i> and damage that ensued.  Again, look at the Irish Life affair this very week, not to mention the happenings in Dublin Castle.</P>
    <P>In the majority of these cases no law was broken.  In this country we have devised a new dictionary of terminology for white collar financial manipulation called &ldquo;working the system&rdquo;.  One hires accountants, experts, lawyers &mdash; dare I <Col N="1466" /> say, advisers?  &mdash; to find loopholes and then one goes for them.  These are the people supposed to be leaders of society. These are the people who are held up as the examples, the merchant princes, whom people are told to emulate.  These are the very people who in the <i>Green Paper on Education</i> are held up as the representatives of a new philosophy in education, the models of an enterprise culture we are supposed to emulate in order to create a new economic boom. One may well pose the question: will heads roll for what in many cases is blatant white collar crime?  They will not and do not in such cases because, unfortunately, the law does not deal with reality.  As I said, this is the reason the Government is like someone staring down the barrel of a gun.  The man at the tailend of the dole queue is bitter and angry at the Finance Bill.  He is bitter and angry because when he turns to the inside pages of the same newspaper he finds that people are hauled before the courts for what in many cases are mere trivia.</P>
    <P>This Finance Bill has failed miserably. An opportunity has been lost, given that people are receptive to new dynamism, tough and harsh economic measures. There is a new thrust and a new beginning, something much sought after, but in this regard, unfortunately, this Finance Bill has failed miserably.</P>

      <P>Last week when this Bill was presented to the House it was some what marginalised by the rather hysterical and opportunistic behaviour of certain Opposition politicians regarding the Greencore affair.  There was what one can only describe as a blatant attempt to lay the blame on the Minister for Finance when it was abundantly clear to all and sundry that the Government stockbrokers were at fault.  I hope I will be in a position in my contribution to the House today to redress in a small way this imbalance. <Col N="1467" /> This is imaginative and creative legislation which has much to contribute to the commercial wellbeing of this country. It is not without fault, what is?  Overall, however, it is most welcome legislation.  It contains many imaginative and commendable measures designed to stimulate investment and employment growth.</P>
      <P>Generating employment must be the bottom line for this and any future Government.  The engine by which we create these jobs is through the development of our own indigenous enterprise. However it has to be said that in recent years Irish entrepreneurs and would be entrepreneurs have been faced with an unnecessary number of disincentives when it came to making that crucial move to start a new business in an uncertain commercial climate.  Lack of start up capital has been of increasing concern in recent years.  There is a strong need to introduce specific incentives to enhance the availability of this funding and the Bill goes a long way towards addressing this need.</P>
      <P>The Bill extends the business expansion scheme for a further three years, with the removal of the previous lifetime cap for investors.  Most importantly, it introduces special investment accounts on which the returns are liable to tax at 10 per cent.  These accounts can be offered by life assurance companies, unit trusts and stockbrokers.  There is a requirement that a minimum percentage of the funds in these accounts should be invested in Irish equities, 40 per cent in 1993 rising to 55 per cent in 1996.  This scheme genuinely has the potential to improve the availability of equity funds to business during the next few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Securing seed capital has been a considerable barrier to many businesses in the past.  I am delighted to see that this Bill introduces a new scheme which is designed to encourage employees to move from safe employment to start their own business.  This scheme will allow the entrepreneur to claim a refund of tax paid on previous income in respect of his or her investment in a new company.  Relief <Col N="1468" /> on investments will be allowed on a retrospective basis against the income of the preceding three years up to a maximum of £25,000 income relief per year.  This will in practice allow immediate relief on investments of up to £75,000.  This scheme will be of advantage not only to those in employment but also to the unemployed, including persons made redundant.  To my mind it allows greater opportunities for those in the PAYE sector to break into business.  This is crucial. This is a positive and far reaching measure and deserves the support of every party in this House.</P>
    <P>To provide a further boost to investment and employment the Bill provides for an increase in the BES company limit from £500,000 to £1 million in respect of shares issued on or after 6 May 1993.  This is another welcome move.</P>
    <P>It has been shown that research and development is the lifeblood of forward thinking progressive business.  It is an area in which we have been deficient in the past.  For this reason I welcome the provision in the Bill under which expenditure on research and development related to certain BES activities will qualify for BES relief in its own right.  I hope that this is but the first step in establishing a proper research and development infrastructure for industry because this is something that has been lacking since the foundation of the State and not properly addressed at any stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill also introduces a new scheme to allow individuals to dispose of a business and re-invest the proceedings in a manufacturing or other qualifying company without being held to capital gains tax on the amount raised from the sale of the business.  For example, a publican might sell his business and invest the entire sum in the qualifying company.  He would not be liable to capital gains tax until such time as the investment in the second company is disposed of.  The purpose of this provision is to facilitate entrepreneurs who might wish to reinvest the proceeds from the sale of their stake in an existing company in starting up a new company in these sectors.  I welcome this concept of roll over relief.  However I <Col N="1469" /> have some reservations that the criteria might be too restrictive in that they might prohibit good job creating companies which are equally starved of cash and entrpreneurial skills but which do not qualify within the BES rules.  I urge the Minister to review the situation as the scheme progresses with a view to widening the criteria for participation.</P>
    <P>Pension funds through their investment activities can make a great contribution to the development of the economy and job creation.  There is much untapped potential in this area and I welcome the Minister's initiative in discussing these matters with the pension fund people themselves.  I wish him all the best in these endeavours and I hope he can bring them to a fruitful and positive conclusion.</P>
    <P>Last week, while discussing the new Broadcasting Bill, I made reference to the growth potential of the independent broadcasting sector.  Therefore I welcome the new measures contained in the Bill which will be of direct benefit to those Irish companies engaged in co-productions. Up to this these companies, in order to qualify for section 35 funding, had to guarantee that 75 per cent of the production work was done in Ireland. This Bill allows for the 75 per cent rule to be waived under certain conditions. The Bill also increases the ceiling for investment under section 35 for corporate investors from £600,000 to £1.05 million.  This package will provide a much needed impetus for this sector.</P>
    <P>There are in the Bill other incentives designed to promote enterprise and employment generation.  I will not go into them in detail; suffice it to say that, taken as a whole, they represent a significant shot in the arm for business.  This is reflected in the positive response the proposals have received from financial commentators and representatives of the business community.  I find it disappointing to note some of the Opposition's comments on the Bill, given that it allows for the introduction of measures for which they themselves have called. Do they not support the development of a vigorous enterprise culture in this <Col N="1470" /> country?  I regret to say that yet again they have fallen into the trap of political opportunism and opposition for the sake of opposition.  This House deserves better.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents a major step forward but, as I have said, it is not without its flaws and gaps.  I welcome the enterprise incentive proposals, but if they are to work effectively they must operate in a streamlined, non-bureaucratic context. I am concerned that this is not the case. I fear that, with the best of intentions. we may have created a bureaucratic structure which may mitigate against enterprise and employment growth.  Let me explain what I mean by this.  There is considerable scope for confusion between the county enterprise boards, the more locally based area partnership companies, the Enterprise Trust and the sub-regional review committees.  It is all very well introducing new incentives, which are always welcome, but not if they are subsequently enmeshed in a bureaucratic quagmire.  Unfortunately, that is a possibility.  Therefore I urge the Minister concerned to keep these structures under review with a view to making them as user friendly as possible.  As it stands most business people operating in the real economy would tell us that there are too many bureaucratic barriers in existence and some people give up in despair.</P>
    <P>I have always supported the concept that growth comes from the bottom up. It starts in the regions and in the localities and filters upwards to the broader national economy.  It is vital that this growth be nurtured at all times.  I urge the Minister strongly to ensure that we have a second Leader Programme.  Phase 1 of the first programme has just commenced. The forthcoming national development plan will have a vital role to play in supporting and developing much needed enterprise and employment.  I urge the Minister to ensure that enterprise development is an integral part of the plan.  We may never receive an allocation of Structural Funds of this magnitude again &mdash; it may be our last chance in that sense &mdash; and, therefore, it is vital that we receive the maximum amount <Col N="1471" /> possible.  If these funds are to be used in the most effective way we must ensure they are not wasted on unnecessary bureaucratic procedures or on non-productive schemes.</P>
    <P>My main reservation about the proposed probate tax is that the Bill does not take into account the ability of the property owner to pay this tax.  Ability to pay is an essential part of an equitable and fair tax.  In order to soften the blow, so to speak, the Minister should consider allowing for the payment of this probate tax by instalments.  The Department should carry out a review of the tax after a period to ascertain how equitable it is. There is considerable disquiet among the farming community on the equity or otherwise of this tax.</P>
    <P>I am keenly aware of the importance of tourism to our economy.  Tourism is extremely important in my constituency. It is our second biggest industry and, indeed, in my county it may well be the biggest.  It offers the most potential for growth and development.  I am disappointed, therefore, at the response in the Bill to the tourism sector.  The initiative to increase the availability of cars for short term hire through improving the fiscal environment for such cars is welcome. We need more initiatives not in an <i>ad hoc</i> but in a co-ordinated way as part of an overall strategy that befits the importance and potential of this industry.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister examine the VAT rate increase on clothing and footwear? There is a genuine fear that this may result in job losses in these sectors.  I welcome the Minister's offer of assistance to firms in the sector threatened by the application of VAT at standard rate on their domestic sales.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents a major step forward. It underlines the Government's commitment to generating employment through enterprise.  I look forward to more initiatives to tap into the underlying talent and entrepreneurship that exists, but which has remained untapped for so long.  The Bill should be welcomed by the business community, the trade unions and the unemployed for its series of positive <Col N="1472" /> measures.  I am happy to lend it my support.  I wish to share my time with Deputy O'Hanlon.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank my colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, for sharing his time with me.  I welcome this Bill and, in particular, the initiatives for job creation such as the extention of the business expansion scheme which has been advantageous to business, particularly tourism.  Tourism is a major growth area. The special savings account will be of benefit in encouraging further investment which will become available for job creation.  I welcome also the seed capital scheme.  We are all aware of people in our constituencies with entrepreneurial flair who would like to start a business but do not have sufficient capital.  That has always been the stumbling block. This change will be very popular and, in conjunction with other State supports will help people who want to start their own business and so create jobs.</P>
      <P>I welcome the stock relief provision for farmers.  I welcome also the extension of the urban renewal scheme.  That scheme should be extended to other towns such as Monaghan.  The Monaghan town centre could be refurbished under that scheme and people are prepared to undertake the work.  Will the Minister consider this request?  The Minister announced that he will monitor the impact on the clothing and footwear industries through IBEC.  Relief will come in the future, if it is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now deal with job creation and maintaining of jobs.  We are burdened with the preparation of legislation, which I accept is necessary and that creates a gap between job creation and the implementation of policies to provide employment.  While I commend those working in the public service I must ask whether rigid interpretation of the law hinders job creation or the maintaining of employment.  I shall cite a number of examples.  I am aware that a meat factory which exports directly to a Third World <Col N="1473" /> country lost a contract because it was not decided whether the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry should implement an EC directive.  That should not be the case.  I am also aware of similar cases in regard to fisheries.  I am as antipollution as any Member but we should adopt a pragmatic approach when people are spending a great deal of money installing effluent plants without infringing the law.  The fishery local authorities should take a practical view if there is no danger of a fish kill.  The same applies to environmental health legislation.</P>
    <P>We should speed up the planning process. The rigid interpretation of legislation delays planning applications and results in job losses and lost opportunities for creating jobs.  Every person who applies to the planning authority is creating a job, no matter how small or how big it is.  There should be a mechanism to ensure that the planning authorities focus on job creation as part of their brief.</P>
    <P>Third level education is a major growth area, particularly with students from the Far East.  We have a problem with the allocation of visas and this needs to be looked at in the context of developing opportunities in third level education.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of disputes involving State agencies, Government Departments and local authorities.  There should be a mechanism to settle disputes so that we can ensure the creation of the maximum number of jobs.  Will the Minister ensure that when implementing Government policy or the law all State agencies and Government Departments will focus on job creation?  As a representative of a Border constituency I compliment the Minister on his sensitivity to the needs of the Border counties. We are all aware that the economy in the Border areas was practically wrecked by Government policies in the period from 1982-87.  I compliment the Minister on ensuring that there will be no damage to the Border economy, and especially for not increasing the price of petrol.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1474" /> The Single Market needs to be monitored, although I do not see it as a threat to business in Border areas.  We will have to look at how it impacts on jobs in our areas.  The fact that cheaper goods can be brought across the Border will cost us jobs in certain areas.  We will need to monitor the situation to ensure we are competitive at all times.</P>
    <P>The Bill is positive in that it creates new initiatives for the provision of jobs and this is to be welcomed.  It is important in this regard that we improve our infra structure and that our roads are in good condition.  The Minister should ensure that the Commission permits the spending of Structural Funds on county as well as primary roads.  I wish to refer to a pilot scheme I introduced when Minister for the Environment under which the local communities worked with the local authority in the repair and refurbishment of roads.  The local county engineer told me recently that the value of the work done by the local community was 12.5 per cent of the total cost of £350,000 which I allocated for that pilot project.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and compliment the Minister on it.  It will achieve what is desired by everybody, it will lead to the creation of more jobs and a sounder economy.</P>

      <P>It appears that the Labour Party has accepted the economic philosophy of the Fianna Fáil Party in the presentation of the Finance Bill.  The Bill gives legal effect to the budget and allows the Minister for Finance to make changes arising out of provisions in the budget. This Bill warranted serious thought to create incentives and opportunities for people to use their initiative, avail of investment opportunities and create a climate for job creation.  That was necessary because the 1993 budget was a disaster in terms of job creation and creating a climate in which those with initiative, ability and opportunities could use their expertise.  It is fair to say that the Bill contains a number of welcome measures. I hope the gurus in the Department of Finance have not strangled these initiatives <Col N="1475" /> by introducing too much red tape and bureaucracy.</P>
      <P>For instance, during the recent crisis the Department of Enterprise and Employment announced a scheme to assist firms involved in manufacturing and exports.  A great number of Irish manufacturers who were in serious difficulties at that time appreciated the measure introduced and looked forward to receiving assistance.  However, even though the measure was a good one red tape prevented a great number of manufacturers from availing of assistance.  As a result many of them cut back on employment, lost export and manufacturing opportunities and, indeed, some went out of business.  I hope the seed capital measures in section 18 will not be tied up in too much red tape and strangled by bureaucracy.  It appears that there is quite an amount of money in some quarters, but the haves have no concern for the have nots except when they are being squeezed.  I hope this scheme does not become lost in the files of the Department.  The IDA should ensure that ideas put forward by manufacturers are given clearance as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The Leader programme has operated from the ground up and allows for real discussion between those with ideas and the Leader boards based around the country.  These boards sanction projects in a very short time.  Many of the ideas put forward are worthless &mdash; three out of four may be non-runners.  The Leader programme boards who vet the applications sanction many projects and provide money for them.  I hope this programme is a success and continues to create employment, particularly in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's imposition in the budget of a 1 per cent levy on employment was nothing short of disgraceful.  It is similar to measures introduced between 1973 and 1977 and between 1982 and 1987 and results from the Labour Party influence in Cabinet.  It is used as a quick method of getting money from those who are already hard pressed under <Col N="1476" /> the PAYE system.  When replying to this debate or when the Bill goes to special committee &mdash; I wish that committee every success in its work &mdash; I hope the Minister will explain how temporary the 1 per cent levy will be.  Levies were introduced years ago on a temporary basis but they lasted up to ten years.</P>
    <P>The 2 per cent probate tax is a kick in the teeth to everybody and will be resisted very strongly.  One notices when travelling to and from the Dáil signs in various counties as protesting against this tax which is a tax on death, property and even on existence.  It is a retrograde step and smacks of desperation in the Department of Finance and at Cabinet.  I am very much opposed to this tax.</P>
    <P>I hope the new seed capital programme will not become strangled in red tape and bureaucracy and that it will allow those with initiative to implement their ideas and provide employment.</P>
    <P>The changes in the urban renewal scheme are welcome.  This scheme was introduced by former Minister, John Boland, and was a thriving success in a number of towns.  It was subsequently expanded by various Ministers for the Environment.  The reduction of the occupancy period to 13 years and the closing off of the existing loopholes are welcome. I concur with the sentiments expressed by Deputies that the scheme should be extended to other towns &mdash; for example, Westport and Ballinrobe in County Mayo, two small rural towns that would be eminently suitable as designated areas under the urban renewal scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Small shopkeepers and general proprietors would be only too willing to refurbish their premises and improve their lot.  This would give an impression of economic activity and would be welcomed by everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county enterprise boards were welcomed by Fianna Fáil speakers but I am not sure that those Deputies would welcome the initiative in this Bill.  The view of local authorities is that county enterprise boards will not work.  The <Col N="1477" /> Minister of State present will obviously have different ideas, having set up the county enterprise board in Galway.  The feeling is that any ideas put forward will be taken up by the business people on those boards.  The initiative will not come as previously through the local authorities. County Councils over the years have always been willing to use their initiative.  The Acts under which county councils and local authorities are set up are flexible enough to cater for our needs in the nineties.  If revamped, county councils could cater for the role and responsibilities of the county enterprise boards.  These will not be a success because they will only add another layer of administration to prevent those with initiative from using them.</P>
    <P>I deplore the VAT increases on footwear and clothing.  The policy in this Finance Bill could be compared with the policy adopted by Marie Antoinette, who when she was in trouble said of the people &ldquo;Let them eat cake&rdquo;.  VAT on confectionery and other such luxury items has been reduced, whereas it has been increased on essential items such as clothing and footwear.  The only reason for this is that the Government are desperate for money.  A decrease of VAT on confectionery and an increase of VAT on clothing and footwear is a retrograde step which will cause a great deal of hardship to the manufacturing end of the industry and to people in general.  In a Private Members' motion on this issue it was pointed out that many manufacturing industries, from Donegal to west Kerry, have transport and economic problems and are hard pressed to maintain employment levels, their export markets and their sales.  The imposition of this VAT increase will lead to the setting up of pseudo companies in Northern Ireland and increased imports.  There will be a cashflow advantage for importers of clothing and footwear.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Telecom charges, a constituent said to me &ldquo;At least Dick Turpin wore a mask&rdquo;.  Dick Turpin stole from the rich to help the poor, but these charges steal from the poor to help the rich.  We have asked for a special debate <Col N="1478" /> in the Dáil on these charges and I hope the Government will concede that.</P>
    <P>The people in my constituency have been disenfranchised to an extent by the departure of the former Deputy Flynn, who is now in Brussels as Commissioner for Social Affairs.  All of the infrastructural activity one would normally expect is now held up pending the by-election. Three million pounds is being sought for a major sewerge scheme in Ballinrobe on the shores of Lough Mask which has a booming angling trade and an expanding tourist business.  However, sanction is not forthcoming from the Department of the Environment, probably on account of the pending by-election. That is only one of a number of areas being economically deprived as well as being disenfranchised by the Government.</P>
    <P>In terms of the open Government spoused by the Taoiseach, there is a serious need to discuss how Structural Funds are to be spent.  It is arrogant of the Taoiseach to come in here at Question Time and say that the Government will decide on how £8 billion of Structural Funds will be allocated.  In my county there is work for ten years for 1,000 men on coastal protection alone.  The ravages of the Atlantic and the storms of the last few years have created havoc in terms of the loss of sea defences and so on.  Neither county councils nor elected representatives have been given a facility to indicate the areas which they would consider priority areas for the spending of Structural Funds.  Submissions could be made on the upgrading of railway lines, the improvement of roads, piers and so on.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill will be thoroughly examined on Committee Stage and that this second run of the special finance committee will be successful.  I would like to share the last minutes of my time with Deputy Crawford.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair and also my colleague for sharing his time with me.  We have a problem similar to coastal erosion, but it concerns our roads in Cavan-Monaghan.  Huge extra <Col N="1479" /> employment could be given there if some of the EC Structural Funds was spent on it, as suggested by my colleague, Deputy O'Hanlon.  I hope some of the £8 billion Structural Funds will be used to deal with the serious road problems in Cavan and Monaghan.</P>
      <P>We have heard a lot about what the Finance Bill will do to improve employment. We must not forget the effect of the 1 per cent levy, which must be paid regardless of whether or not there is profit.  It is an overall levy on the farming community, and for the PAYE worker it is an additional burden.</P>
      <P>It was incredible that the Labour Party walked through the lobbies to support a 21 per cent rate of VAT on clothing and footwear when hundreds of jobs are continuing to be lost in that sector.</P>
      <P>In County Monaghan we are noted for mushroom production, but what have really mushroomed north of the Border are readymix groups; and this was occurring even before the 21 per cent VAT imposition, due to anomalies in the tax system.  At a time when we are talking about job creation it is incredible that the Minister has placed a further tax on the readymix sector.  If a person buys £100,000 worth of readymix concrete in Monaghan he must immediately pay 21 per cent VAT on it.  The same amount can be bought more cheaply, without the imposition of VAT, in Northern Ireland. In a difficult cashflow situation for builders this differential is causing great damage and a minimum of 100 jobs will be lost in County Monaghan alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider the whole issue of the imposition of the 21 per cent VAT rate before it is too late and perhaps he will also agree to reduce the PRSI rates.  During the election discussions the Fine Gael Party was condemned for suggesting that PRSI be halved in some sectors.  We had all hoped there would be an incentive for the transfer of land to young people.  We had hoped for an exemption from Land Registry charges but instead the Minister has introduced a probate tax.  If some young man or woman who owns property <Col N="1480" /> is unfortunate to be killed or to die of a serious illness, he or she would have had no opportunity to transfer land in the normal fashion.</P>

      <P>A death in a young family is a problem but the imposition of the probate tax will have serious implications.</P>
      <P>In regard to devaluation, it is laughable to hear the Government claim that as a result of its actions interest rates have reduced.  In the Border areas we all knew in October or November that we had to have devaluation, but they held out for months.  The Minister for Finance almost cried on television and said he was forced to devalue.  Now the Government is claiming that because of its activities the interest rates and the economy are progressing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I would like to address a number of key issues in the context of the Finance Bill, particularly unemployment and tax reform.  I welcome the establishment of the various legislative committees which will examine not only this Finance Bill but also the Estimates from the various Government Departments.  This new initiative, introduced by the Government, will go a long way towards allowing a careful teasing out of the various matters which make up the Finance Bill and the Estimates for the various Departments and will allow us to conduct business much more expeditiously than hitherto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1481" /> The Programme for a Partnership Government states:</P>
    <P>We will seek to promote a high level of economic growth that is export-led, consistent with the maintenance of low single-figure inflation, so as to create the greatest possible employment demand.</P>
    <P>We intend that the various strands of Government policy will become a coherent vehicle to secure that objective.  In terms of employment creation it is important to understand that every sustainable 1 per cent reduction in real interest rates &mdash; interest rates adjusted by the consumer price index &mdash; leads to 15,000 additional jobs.  That in itself is a major job creation facility.</P>
    <P>Given the extraordinary currency market and the background against which last year's budget was formulated, the Minister for Finance had to be careful, and relatively conservative, in framing the Exchequer borrowing requirement.  That would not have been my wish, and indeed was not the wish of the Labour Party in its manifesto before the formation of this Government.  We had intended that there should have been greater Exchequer borrowing at the initial stage of Government formation so that there would be a once off impetus for job creation because of the huge numbers unemployed.  Unfortunately, because of the high interest rates we had no alternative but to stabilise the markets.  That in itself had the consequent momentum of reducing the interest rates.  We will accept credit where credit is due in that matter.</P>
    <P>The fact that the currency was devalued by the Government is not something that we in the Labour Party regard as a mistake or some regrettable departure from the policy which was pursued to keep the Punt at a fixed rate to the Deutsche Mark.  When the crunch came we chose to protect jobs and business rather than stick with an overvalued currency. I would make the point that it reflects badly on the primary concerns and initiatives of the Maastricht Treaty &mdash; the EMS and monetary union &mdash; that <Col N="1482" /> when the crisis arose in relation to interest rates and speculation on individual members' currency, there was very little solidarity among member states.  In future we will have to ensure an integrated approach to this as well as to other matters to ensure stabilisation and prevent fluctuations as a result of which certain members had to leave the EMS and other members, such as ourselves, had to devalue their currency.</P>
    <P>Had the Bundesbank taken into account the critical European dimensions to its policy of high interest rates, it is possible that much of the pain we have to endure could have been avoided. However, interest rates are falling and the Bundesbank is now being criticised in exactly the same terms by German economists as it was by the governments of countries which took the brunt of the ERM crisis.</P>
    <P>We can at last look forward to a period, some time next year, when the pattern of positive and high interest rates, which had a profoundly negative effect on employment throughout the eighties, will be reversed.  For example, long term interest rates during the period 1980-89 averaged 5.5 per cent in the United States, 4.5 per cent in Germany, 4.7 per cent in France, and 3.4 per cent in the United Kingdom.  This appeared good, but it contrasted poorly with the period 1970-79 when real interest rates were negative for a number of years or below 2 per cent.  Despite zero interest rates in the United States for the past 18 months the United States alone cannot pull the world economy out of the recession.  In the European Community we need zero interest rates and a major public and private investment boost to the whole of the European economy.</P>
    <P>Last week I had the privilege of attending a meeting in Copenhagen organised by the Danish President in relation to the summit agenda for June.  Denmark has determined that employment will be the one issue on the agenda.  It is proposed that all member states focus on unemployment and launch an integrated policy at the same time.  That is the co-ordinated approach we should bring to bear on the <Col N="1483" /> matter.  I am confident that this time next year interest rates will be no more than 4 per cent or 5 per cent and that this will provide a basis for recovery, which, I am glad to say, the heads of Government of the seven main economies have indicated should be utilised to tackle unemployment as the major priority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of how the economy is progressing and of the stabilising influence this Government has had on it and on the currency markets. We intend to maintain it in that fashion.</P>
      <P>There has been much criticism of the 1 per cent income levy, which was introduced solely to give a clear indication to financial markets that the Government finances would not be allowed to deteriorate or that the serious debt ratio would be allowed to escalate.  Naturally, one would have wished that that levy had not been introduced and that it would not have been pitched at the low level of £9,000.  However, that is the position.</P>
      <P>I should like to bring to the attention of the public, and particularly to representatives of the media, that the accompanying memorandum to the Finance Bill states that the income levy is temporary.  Section 7 provides for the imposition in respect of the tax year 1993-94 of the temporary 1 per cent levy, to be know as &ldquo;the income levy&rdquo;, announced in the budget, according to the explanatory memorandum.  Can the public trust the Labour Party and the Government in regard to that levy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1484" />
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure they can.  The income levy introduced in the 1984 budget was retained for two financial years only and was removed again in 1986.  That is the precedent we will be following.  It is a temporary levy and it will not be continued.  The Labour Party and the Taoiseach indicated that the levy is temporary.  With the benefit of interest rates reductions fully secured by the end of this year, I will be looking to a budget in 1994 which will expand economic activity and, through the Structural Funds and other measures, give incentives to employers to take on the long term unemployed in particular.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Government which gives employment the highest priority will require tough decisions and the development of a hard consensus if it is to have any serious impact on unemployment. Every interest group in society must be prepared to make adjustments so that the reduction in unemployment gets the priority it deserves.  This will have implications for tax evasion, tax avoidance, the reinvestment of profits in productive employment and the level of pay increases which can be afforded in the public and private sectors.  It is clear from the October report of the Comptroller and Auditor General that there is a vast amount of uncollected taxes out there &mdash; £2.6 billion.  We have a duty to ensure that sufficient staff are appointed to the Revenue Commissioners to collect that money which would make an enormous contribution to the economic wealth of this nation and to reducing employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals in the Programme for Government go a long way towards creating the climate that will lead to a reduction in unemployment.  A £250 million jobs fund has been established in addition to the new forum which will give all interest groups, including the unemployed, trade unionists, the Government, farmers and the marginalised in society a voice on the issue of job creation.  We will receive £8 billion in Structural Funds which we will have to match with £4 billion.  That will mean that there will be £12 billion in Structural and <Col N="1485" /> Cohesion Funds which must be directed towards job creation.  We have the proposals to restructure the county enterprise boards and their work will be directed towards providing community employment around the country.  Those job creation measures are outside the framework of the budget.  The budget is based on principles which will facilitate their implementation.</P>
    <P>The removal of the income levy is a very small issue compared to that of unemployment.  The Programme for Government is committed to tax reform, but not the kind of reform the Progressive Democrats have in mind.  Their programme concentrated, like the Reagan reforms in the United States and the Thatcher reforms in the United Kingdom, on the reduction of marginal tax rates and on what is called the &ldquo;trickled down&rdquo; effect.  Those reforms have been tested and did not lead to sustainable higher economic growth, or result in increased employment.  They resulted in greater inequalities in income and wealth.  There is no evidence to support the contention that lower tax rates increases value-added activities in any economy.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party recognises that the burden of direct taxation on average incomes is too high but one does not need to reduce the top rate of tax to address this problem.  A sustained widening of the standard rate tax band, combined with a restructuring of PRSI to reduce the burden on the lower paid, is the correct strategy.  This also addresses the so-called &ldquo;tax wedge&rdquo; problem.</P>
    <P>The advocates of reduced employer PRSI should provide the evidence that this would stimulate increased economic activity.  I do not believe it would, unless it was incorporated in an explicit trade-off for additional recruitment of employees &mdash; and we know how hard it is to get that from the employers.  We need to get our priorities right.  We have to expand the traded goods sector of the economy and increase the retained value-added which this sector generates.  This requires the development of indigenous exporting, manufacturing and servicing <Col N="1486" /> businesses.  We have underlined that in the Programme for Government and we are introducing a new body, Forbairt, to emphasise the importance of indigenous business enterprises.  Lower personal taxation, which is not at the expense of the low paid or the unemployed, is only sustainable through creating more wealth and economic activity in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I hope the employers, trade unions and farming organisations will respond to the challenge which this country faces on unemployment.  In 1987-88 the trade unions made a major contribution to restoring confidence to the battered economy and public finances.  A devaluation in 1986, followed by reduced interest rates and wage restaint resulted in more than 40,000 jobs being created. We have a tremendous opportunity with similar economic conditions to reduce unemployment and reform the taxation system.  It is a challenge I am happy to take on, and there will be ample opportunities for all parties to make their contribution through the National Economic and Social Forum and the employment and development committee of the Oireachtas.  For the sake of the country and particularly for the sake of the unemployed it is a challenge we must not fail to meet.</P>

      <P>We have been treated to a dose of cloud cuckooland economics.  I ask Deputy Costello to reflect a little.  In what economy in recent years has he ever seen a zero real interest rate?  Who would save money in a zero real interest rate economy? Who would make money available?</P>

      <P>The Deputy ought to know, and if he does not know he should consult the Labour Party's economic guru who will tell him that there never has been a growing economy where there was not a positive interest rate, and that where there are negative or zero real interest rates, it is only because the economy is contracting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amused by Deputy Costello's statements on currency policy and on devaluation.  I know he is bound to say, quite rightly as it happens, that the 1986 currency change here had a beneficial effect.  He has to say that because his party was in Government then.  However, his colleagues in the other Government party these days do not believe that that was a positive measure.  They go to the most extraordinary lengths &mdash; and they did before the devaluation earlier this year &mdash; to say that the 1986 experience was a bad one when, in fact, we all know it was a good one.  I happen to know, because I was in touch with it at the time, what the Labour Party's stance was on the issue of the exchange rate in the period between the election and the formation of the Government.  I can tell the Deputy, because he obviously has not been told this by his mentors and gurus that they hoped, officially, at the top echelons of the Labour Party that the problem would be sorted out by Fianna <Col N="1488" /> Fáil before the Labour Party actually got into Government.  They were not concerned about that.  They had no position of principle or conviction about whether it was right to devalue the currency or whether they would wait until the crunch came and as Deputy Costello tried to pretend do the right thing for jobs.  The crunch came in this economy last September and the Fianna Fáil Party in Government at that time missed the boat. It failed to recognise that an overall realignment within the EMS should have taken place at that stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Dukes realises I am talking about the present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should read the papers.  Effectively, what we got was wide realignment within the EMS that took place in the most painful possible manner, piece by piece, between September of last year and February of this year.  That is real economics and Deputy Costello is doing himself no favours by pretending that the world is other than it really is.  That is a feature of the two parties of this Government.  They are going back over the recent economic history of this country, from last September until now, and trying to present what happened as being in some way the result of a carefully planned series of events when in fact the Government was being thrown around from pillar to post and kicked around from Billy to Jack.  The Government is now trying to pretend that that was a carefully planned policy.</P>
      <P>I was delighted to hear Deputy Costello promising that interest rates will be reduced to 4 per cent or 5 per cent this year.  If that is the case he should tell us how he will ensure that that is a real zero interest rate because inflation would need to be at 4 per cent or 5 per cent for that to happen.  I have every confidence that, in spite of the mad economic policies of this Government, it will never be able to provide us with that kind of cloud cuckooland economics and economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of the infernal script machine of this Government was Deputy <Col N="1489" /> Costello's reference to the difficulties that arose on the EMS and the fact that the Germans did not recognise the kind of solidarity that a poor alien little economy like Ireland on the periphery of Europe needs.  That is nonsense.  There is nothing wrong with the European Monetary Sytem and nothing went wrong with that system between September of last year and February of this year that could have have been fixed by Ministers for Finance who had their eye on the ball or by a Government who did not sit on its hands hoping the problem would go away and who refused to do the sensible thing and talk directly to the people in the Bundesbank.  Deputy Costello is doing his reputation no good by trotting out such lame excuses for policy and history that we have heard from the rumour factory script to which he has treated us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will turn from the fanciful pseudo-socialist economic ideas of Deputy Costello to the reality of this year's Finance Bill.  Those ideas were tried and failed.  They drove half the world into recession for 45 years.  We should forget about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year's budget has introduced new measures and I suppose they have the approval of the Deputies in the Labour Party.  A new probate tax was introduced in this year's budget.  A tax of 2 per cent will be payable on all inherited estates valued at more than £10,000 with the sole exception of the family home where it passes between spouses on death.  We are told that the yield from that will be £6 million this year and £12 million in a full year.  That is a paltry sum and small justification for a very pernicious tax.  The Minister for Finance tried to present this as part of a coherent policy on capital taxation, but it is obvious in examining the budget figures that it is no such thing. The 2 per cent probate tax, far from being a deliberate part of a coherent capital taxation policy, was what the Government needed in order to tie up the two ends when it found it could not agree <Col N="1490" /> on the expenditure measures required to resolve the budget position for this year. It is a measure of short term desperation introduced without any regard for the consequences simply to tie up £6 million in this year's budget because the Government did not want to be seen to fail.</P>
    <P>This tax is as unacceptable as the 1 per cent levy which has been imposed on income.  Of course, Deputy Costello is correct to point out that this is not the first 1 per cent levy to be introduced here. That was a bad tax.  I had the misfortune of introducing it, but I got rid of it as fast as I could.  I assure the House &mdash; I hope I am not giving away any great Cabinet secrets retrospectively &mdash; that I got rid of it much faster than the Labour Party would have wished at the time.  Deputy Costello, who I do not believe was publicly active in the Labour Party at that time, was one of the critics of that tax and he is now apologising for that.  We should tell Deputies in his position that income tax was introduced in the 1890s at six pence in the pound as a temporary measure.</P>
    <P>The probate tax is a last minute emergency measure and goes totally against the trend of what successive Governments have been trying to do in relation to capital taxation in recent years.  It is an excrescence in the system and should never have been put in place.  It is a very blunt instrument and has been described fairly as a tax on misfortune and grief.  It will constitute a major burden on families at a difficult time and nowhere will it be more intrusive than in cases where a family business is part of the assets which are passed on following a death.  That applies in particular in the agricultural sector and to other areas of family business. As the Minister of State present is aware, in a typical family business, especially a farm that is not cash rich, in order to pay this tax on the death of the principal operator &mdash; perhaps the only operator &mdash; it will be necessary to realise part of the assets, because the business will not produce the type of cashflow that would be required to pay that tax.  The Minister of State is well aware that computations show that on a 150 acre dairy <Col N="1491" /> farm the 2 per cent probate tax could amount to £10,000 or more.  One will not find £10,000 hanging around in any farmer's bank account nowadays.  In order to pay this tax people will be obliged to realise part of the productive assets of the business and this applies also to other family businesses.  This probate tax will not only tax inheritance, but it will reduce the productive capacity of the business involved.  It takes no account of the ability of the inheritors to pay; it is simply a short term expedient by the Government to get more money and will have no positive effects.</P>
    <P>I am unhappy that this new probate tax is being introduced because it is not many years ago since I was in the position of completely relieving from any taxation the transfer of property on death from one spouse to another.  A substantial part of the inspiration which led me to do that came from a member of the Labour Party who is a member of the present Government. In my usual generous fashion I went somewhat further than he suggested, but I was delighted to be able to say at last that the transfer of property between spouses on death would not be a taxable occasion.  That is now gone because only the principal private residents will escape from the clutches of the Revenue Commissioners under the provisions of this new probate tax.  That is regrettable and is a counterproductive move.  It is a bad feature being re-introduced into our capital taxation system.</P>
    <P>Of course, I have been reading about what has been taking place and various groups of people have been talking to the Minister for Finance since the budget was published.  I have been given to understand he gave an undertaking to the Irish Farmers Association that he would provide in the Finance Bill that probate tax would be taken into account as an expense against liability to capital acquisitions tax on inheritance.  But, search as I might, I cannot find any such provision in the Finance Bill.  I invite the Minister to think again and to remember that people are under the impression that he has given them this undertaking, something <Col N="1492" /> which would be a good idea in itself.  It would somewhat moderate the effect of this tax and I ask the Minister to tell us whether he intends to make such a provision on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Remaining with the subject of capital taxation, I find that the changes made in capital acquisitions tax in relation to agricultural property are grudging and inadequate.  Yes, some improvements have been made, but the thresholds are far from being indexed to the level in real terms they were at when the tax was first introduced in 1976.  This capital acquisitions tax, even with the changes proposed in this Bill, is still the most serious obstacle to early farm transfer in this country.  Minister of State Liam Hyland should particularly appreciate the irony of that, because he is defending a hopeless case these days by saying that the Government is bringing in an early retirement scheme in order to help speed up land transfers.  The measure the Government has in mind will not make much difference unless it is very substantially changed.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry should be in here telling the Minister for Finance, who seems to be unaware that there is a whole world beyond the pale where a real economy is being oppressed by this Government, that capital acquisitions tax and the thresholds at their levels remain, even after the provisions of this Bill are taken into account, the most serious obstacle to early farm transfer.</P>
    <P>A change has been made in relation to the exemption levels for gifts.  It has not been made in relation to inheritance and I wonder if the Minister for Finance could give us any coherent reason why there is now a differential in our capital acquisitions tax code between the treatment of gifts and the treatment of inheritance.  I cannot see any logic in this.  No logic was given in the budget for this.  It seems to have been a top of the head decision and I suspect that the difference has more to do with the Government's concerns to obtain revenue rather than any planning of our capital tax system.</P>
    <P>Changes are proposed in relation to stock relief on farms.  It is like the curate's <Col N="1493" /> egg, there is good and bad in it.  The new provision being proposed would allow a deduction of 25 per cent from trading profits of the increase in the value of trading stock in an accounting period. That is accompanied by the abolition of the clawback we had under the previous stock relief provision.  I would have to say &mdash; and I know the inside and outside of this question &mdash; that, all other things being equal, the abolition of the clawback is a very advantageous step; but of course in this case all other things are not equal. The Minister again will understand me when I say that the provision now included in this Finance Bill will mean, in effect, that in a period of stable stock prices 75 per cent of any increase in stock has to be financed from after tax profits. If prices are rising, then the proportion that must be financed from after tax profits is even greater.  Therefore, the measure we have before us, while it is positive on the clawback side, will not be a very substantial assistance or incentive to increasing stock numbers.</P>
    <P>If I may be a little sour for a moment, I would have to admit that perhaps that is not too important in the present situation, because one would have to travel a long day around this country and visit many farms before one would find anybody in a position to be increasing stock. Unfortunately, most farmers are now looking at the prospect of reducing stock numbers in order to comply with these daft European Community restrictions on stocking rates and this insane integrated administration and controls system that the Minister is imposing on us, including all the destocking provisions that are in place now.  It is an exception to find a farmer who is thinking of increasing stocking but this will knock totally on the head any such ideas that might be lurking around.  The Minister should re-examine that provision between now and Committee Stage in order to find a more balanced way of dealing with those few cases where there might be a prospect over the next few years of actually increasing stock.</P>
    <P>There is little in this year's budget in terms of tax reform, but I would like to <Col N="1494" /> suggest a few small measures that the Minister might consider between now and Committee Stage which I do not believe will cost a great deal of money but which will have a substantial effect on some groups of people.</P>

      <P>One group is the people who are in receipt of pensions &mdash; usually more than one pension, but small enough &mdash; who are treated in our income tax code in the same way as self-employed people are treated.  They will get a notice in November that they must make a preliminary tax payment in November equal to the estimated total liability for the tax they will have for the full year.  For people on low incomes to have to pay their full income tax liability effectively in the month of November is a major disruption. It is not that they cannot pay if it is spread out over the year, but to have to pay it in the same way that self-employed people do &mdash; in the month of November &mdash; is excessively onerous.  Of course, these people are on computer in the Revenue Commissioners offices. They are in the system, they are known and if they do not make the payment they are pursued.  Once you are in the system you will always be pursued.  They have a very strong sense of grievance, first, that they must pay their tax in a lump sum and, second, they feel &mdash; and they are probably right &mdash; that they are pursued more vigorously than other people who perhaps have much larger incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last Government and Deputy McCreevy, as Minister for Social Welfare, tried to take the first tentative steps towards integrating our tax and social welfare system.  However, they seem to have received such a bad fright from the reaction which greeted that step that they have discarded all ideas of ever trying to do this.  I regret that is the case and I urge the Minister &mdash; it will not affect this year's Finance Bill in any way &mdash; to give serious consideration to what is required in order to integrate fully our tax and social welfare systems.  Both systems would gain <Col N="1495" /> enormously from that and we would be in a far better position to deal equitably with both social welfare recipients and low income taxpayers.</P>

      <P>I would like to begin my contribution to this debate by congratulating the Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, on his handling of the Greencore Davy stockbroker debate last week.  I think it is now clear to everyone that there was no conspiracy on the part of Davys, but it must be said that their handling of the whole affair was nothing short of disastrous and in my view it was a major own goal.  We now find ourselves in the bizarre situation where a major bank owns 30 per cent of Greencore.  Of course, none of this would have happened if one month ago, when ADM were looking to buy the shares and become a partner, they were encouraged to do so.  Unfortunately, blind ideology triumphed over commonsense and Greencore lost the opportunity of much needed investment and the added bonus of being associated with a like minded company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most interesting points to come out of last week's debate on this issue was the fact that the new and much heralded Fine Gael spokesman on Finance contributed to the debate in his usual manner.  He did not offer any advice to the Government on how the affair should now be handled.  He did not offer any advice on how the Attorney General or the Stock Exchange should handle their inquiries.  What he did do was ask for the Minister's resignation. This is not what anyone would call imaginative.  What we wait for with bated breath on this side of the House is for the Opposition spokesman to come up with something constructive about any issue. Almost every day he tells anyone who <Col N="1496" /> will listen to him about the botch-up the Government is making of the economy. But when he gets an opportunity to contribute to such an important debate the best he can offer is to call for the Minister's head.  I admire the Minister for Finance for his imaginative approach in the Finance Bill and his handling of the whole Greencore affair.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill is on the whole very positive.  Again I congratulate the Minister for introducing a recognition of initiative and investment.  The overall employment package outlines such schemes as the BES, special investment accounts and the seed capital scheme, which are all part of this initiative.  The seed capital scheme is perhaps one of the most innovative schemes ever introduced in any economy.  It is very welcome, and I am sure it will be a major success. Tribute must be paid to the Department of Finance officials and to the Minister for introducing such a scheme.</P>
    <P>However, there are some less positive aspects of the Bill, particularly the probate tax, which may become another estate-death duty tax.  I am worried that future Governments may increase this tax, thereby causing major problems, especially for the farming community.  In the past any such an increase caused much hardship and necessitated the disposal of many family farms.  Taxes introduced at a low level may increase over the years and cause much hardship.  No matter what guarantees the Minister gives in regard to the probate tax being charged at 2 per cent on the value of an estate over £10,000, I would envisage the liability being increased and the value of the estate to be taxed being decreased as the years pass.  In introducing such a tax there is also the possibility that the family residence, regardless of whether there is a surviving spouse, would be brought into this new tax net in the future.</P>
    <P>We must avoid any further tax on work and initiative and declare war on bureaucracy.  In this regard it may not be too late to simplify some of the measures, including the number of bodies established to deal with the schemes.  Already, we have ample proof, if proof were <Col N="1497" /> needed, of red tape and chaos in the farming community with farmers becoming buried in paper work and having less time to farm their holdings.  I would like to compliment those Teagasc personnel who provide valuable assistance to the farming community in the compilation and completion of new forms, a task which is a nightmare for consultants and advisers as well as farmers.</P>
    <P>In the past number of years we have witnessed some underhand and sharp practices.  Sadly, but perhaps inevitably, our reaction is to set up inquiries and spend vast sums of taxpayers' money on legal and other consultancy fees.  Following those inquiries there is an enactment of even more rules and regulations, more codes of conduct and more committees. This is surely not the answer. We need a well trained, properly staffed and funded fraud squad, a body that would have the power to implement appropriate penalties when an offence is committed.  The Finance Act is only the tip of this iceberg.  We must declare war on bureaucracy.  We must support the initiative for enterprise and job creation. We must begin in earnest to tackle our penal tax system shifting the burden from its crippling effects on jobs and enterprise.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Deputy Kemmy on his recent statement where he accepts the notion of a tax amnesty in respect of &ldquo;hot&rdquo; money.  This conversion by the Deputy to modern capitalism is to be warmly welcomed but one wonders if it will last and if the Deputy will continue to support this Government, of which at times he appears to forget his party forms part.  Capitalists all over the country must be rejoicing to hear, of their new supporter, Deputy Kemmy.  We have been told that a substantial amount of money, known as &ldquo;hot&rdquo; money has been taken out of this country for investment abroad. I share the view expressed by Deputy Kemmy that this money could be brought back to Ireland and invested in State loans, bonds, etc.  for a period of five years before release.  In that way it would make a contribution to the economy. <Col N="1498" /> This idea was first courageously mooted by my colleague from South Tipperary, Deputy Davern.  Much of the money that was invested abroad was invested in good faith but it should now be brought back here and invested in Government bonds.</P>
    <P>There has been much hype in regard to the VAT increase on clothing, I would like to put this issue in context.  Fianna Fáil has always been the party committed to generating sustainable jobs and ensuring well-founded economic growth.  This necessitates firm control of our public finances.  Budget formulation must maintain a careful balance between prudence and economic growth.  The members of Fine Gael should remember that important principle.  We recall their attempts at introducing budgets were nothing short of disastrous.  In terms of VAT on clothing, we must remember we have a number of obligations since the advent of the Single Market.  Last October the EC rates directive, stated that all member states should have a single standard VAT rate which must be at least 15 per cent. Would the Deputies on the other side of the House suggest that we accept only certain aspects of our membership?  As I have stated on previous occasions, I have great sympathy for the clothing industry which is facing many difficulties.  They share those difficulties with many other sectors of Irish industry.  Such budgetary decisions are not taken lightly.  They are taken only after a very careful process of consideration.  I can understand the frustration of the Opposition Deputies. They have been languishing in Opposition for so long now that they have forgotten the responsibilities and the difficult decisions that are part and parcel of being in Government.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this Bill which I would like to refer to is the stock relief for farmers.  I must refer to the great buoyancy in Irish agriculture, something that would have been unheard of a number of years ago.  Today we have highest prices ever for milk, beef cattle, cows and sheep.  This is proof of the Government's commitment to the running of the agricultural affairs of the country and is a tribute to the efforts of <Col N="1499" /> the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Joe Walsh.</P>
    <P>The Bill implements the changes in the stock relief arrangements for farmers announced in April of this year.  The old stock relief scheme lapsed on 5 April and is not being renewed.  Under that scheme, farmers were allowed a tax relief in the form of a deduction from trading profits of 110 per cent of the increase in value of trading stock which occurred in an accounting period.  Where the value of stock subsequently declined, any relief given was generally clawed back.  Those claw back arrangements are also being abolished with effect from the same date to ensure that farmers with declining stock values, caused by recent changes in the Common Agricultural Policy, will not suffer adverse tax consequences.  A new stock relief scheme has been introduced for the two year period, 6 April 1993 to 5 April 1995.  This gives farmers a deduction from trading profits of 25 per cent of the increase in value of trading stock in an accounting period and there will be no clawback arrangement.  This will assist the herd expansion or diversification of farm enterprises.  I have some concerns regarding the adjustment of stock reliefs and its implications for young persons entering farming by way of joint venture.  However, the basic premise of joint venture is that in a period of five to seven years, the operator would build up equity in the form of livestock. Therefore, the removal of stock relief is a major disadvantage.  I would urge the Minister to consider carefully the full implications of this proposal.  Many submissions have been made by the farmers' associations and the farm apprenticeship boards, they are practical in their approach and merit some attention.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the concept of a 1 per cent levy to assist those who are unemployed, I am concerned that the levy will be a permanent measure and will in time be used, not for the creation of jobs, but to help alleviate Exchequer borrowing requirements.  The PAYE worker cannot afford to pay more levies.  I am sure no one would complain about paying a 1 per <Col N="1500" /> cent levy on income in order to help create jobs for the unemployed. However, I would like the Minister to assure us here and those outside, too, who are paying this levy, that it will be closely monitored and the returns directed towards the area for which they are intended.</P>
    <P>The matter of interest rates has to be the cause of much concern.  While there has been a substantial decrease in terms of the wholesale rate, the retail rate is not realistic.  Today, the one month rate is approximately 8 per cent while the overdraft rate is approximately 12.5 per cent.  That leaves a margin of 4.5 per cent and that is too high.  I call on the Government and on the Minister for Finance to request the banks to reduce that margin, which, while putting business at a serious disadvantage, is adding to the substantial profits of the banking institutions.  Devaluation was a great help to our economy.  Having on our doorstep, as it were, a market which takes 36 per cent of our industrial and finished goods is a great help to our economy.  We must not lose sight of that factor.</P>
    <P>I wish the Danish people well in their referendum which is to take place this weekend.  I hope it will have a success for Maastricht because if there is not a positive outcome there will be uncertainty in this economy and in the other European economies, too.  A no vote in the Danish referendum could lead to uncertainty in the financial markets and to high interest rates.  We had to deal with such problems when our currency was overvalued.  Our economy is very dependent on other economies and negative outside influences can have a very damaging and serious effect on it.</P>
    <P>I wish the Finance Bill every success. In view of the fact that it is being dealt with by a very capable Minister for Finance, I have no doubt that it will be a success.  The Minister emerged from a baptism of fire last Thursday with flying colours.  This is the first imaginative and constructive budget we have seen for a long number of years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ned <Col N="1501" /> O'Keeffe for sharing his time with me.  I, too, welcome this Bill which is different to other Finance Bills in that it has adopted a number of different approaches, all of which are geared towards the creation of employment.  At the end of the day that is what a Finance Bill should seek to achieve.</P>
      <P>In the short time available to me I wish to concentrate on two aspects of the Bill, one of which relates to research and development.  As someone who up to recently lectured in a regional college, I am very aware of the potential of people who have a high level of expertise and knowledge in this area.  These people are crying out to play a role in ensuring that research and development is given its proper place in the creation of jobs for our young people in the future.  Third level institutions which sought to promote research and development and establish links with industries within their immediate environment encountered a real difficulty.  This difficulty related to the business expansion scheme whereby one had to be trading for three to four months before one could quality for assistance.  This Bill will remove that imposition.  Industry and third level institutions now have a golden opportunity to come together, agree research and development programmes and satisfy themselves that an opportunity exists for involvement in the BES at a much earlier stage, thus ensuring that the necessary capital is available to get the various ventures up and running.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we believe that our third level institutions have the necessary expertise in this area then they should be the instrument through which we create meaningful jobs.  I regard this Bill as being of paramount importance in ensuring the initiation of research and development which will lead to meaningful, high tech, long term jobs, many of which will be indigenous and many of which will ensure that there is a correlation between the multinational companies which set up here and Irish industry.  If this is done we will at long last be getting to grips with the linkage programme we have all sought to establish.  Such a programme will enable <Col N="1502" /> local industries to manufacture the components which are so necessary for many multinational companies operating here. Our third level institutions will now have an opportunity to get involved in this area.  These institutions were crying out in the past for this opportunity and the Minister for Finance has given it to them in this Bill.  They should grab this opportunity and make use of it.</P>
    <P>The small business sector also has the potential to stimulate job creation.  The scheme whereby people can reclaim their PAYE contributions over a three year period is very interesting.  Many people working in the public sector have great ideas on how to stimulate job creation, but they have been brought up to believe that one should stay in a safe pensionable job rather than take chances by investing in enterprise.  I believe many people will avail of this scheme to invest in their solid job creation ideas.  In addition to the opportunities which exist under schemes run by FÁS and the IDA, the Minister for Finance has provided the opportunity for people to bring their job creation ideas into fruition in the knowledge that they can claim back their PAYE contributions over three years.  Many people believe that these contributions are going straight into the public coffers and are not being put to any practical use.  These contributions can now be used for productive purposes in the creation of jobs.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the concept of local communities.  I believe that we do not give the necessary recognition to the efforts of local communities.  It is very important that we harness the energy which exists within local communities. How often in the past have we seen local communities coming together to raise money for a particular project?  How many developments and community centres have been built by local communities? Unfortunately, the community development culture was absent along the line; people came together to form a community but everything stopped at that stage.  The community enterprise boards are the answer to the vacuum which exists in this area.  These boards will enable those people who know exactly <Col N="1503" /> what their communities need and the opportunities which exist in their area to avail of grants.  As a man from the Millstreet area, I do not think anyone could give a better example of the local community concept than the Millstreet community.  This year the Eurovision Song Contest will be a community-led project.  A number of people from Millstreet harnessed their energies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In terms of an instrument used to develop and rejuvenate our economy and to set down clear policy guidelines, I question where this Bill will rate in the full measure of time?  I still believe this Bill should be consigned to the shredder as it will certainly not make any contribution to the development of our economy and the creation of jobs.  Every party, every independent Member of this House, has spoken about one issue in recent years &mdash; job creation.  Elections have been fought on job creation.  Committees have been established on job creation.  Departments have been changed for job creation.  There have been massive changes effected everywhere. Yet the one instrument that could have recognised and dealt with the need to make real progress in this area, this latest budget, was not availed of for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time the Minister made his Budget Statement I had a certain sympathy for him, because the circumstances then prevailing in our economy were not very favourable.  We just had the currency crisis and the devaluation of our pound and the outlook for ordinary people &mdash; PAYE workers, mortgage holders and those with loans large or small <Col N="1504" />&mdash;was deplorable.  One felt that the Minister was endeavouring to do the best he could, given the deck of cards and the way the hand had been dealt him.  He was trying to make the best of dire circumstances.</P>
    <P>What has happened since is that, beyond eveybody's expectations &mdash; including those of the Department of Finance, the Government and the Minister himself &mdash; things have changed dramatically for the better.  Certainly, that has not come about as a result of any Government action in the recent past, or because economic conditions here have changed.  Clearly, this has arisen because of international factors changing and the decision &mdash; taken too belatedly &mdash; to devalue our currency ultimately forced on the Minister for Finance.  Let us accept the benefit of what has occurred in recent months since the Minister introduced his budget.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that this Finance Bill would have presented the Minister with a golden opportunity to effect within a very short space of time substantial alterations to his budgetary proposals since circumstances had changed so dramatically.  I would have thought that the proposals for a 1 per cent income levy, a probate tax, VAT increases on clothing and the footwear industry, could have been dramatically altered or abolished altogether.  Indeed, I would have expected that the Labour Party in particular, since this is a so-called partnership Government, would have seized that opportunity, with their six Ministers at the Cabinet table, to persuade the Minister for Finance to effect such alterations in the Finance Bill.  I believe such amendments would have been welcomed by all sides of the House.  But, more importantly, it would have been welcomed by employers, employees and the unemployed, those on the margins endeavouring to sustain a job, those seeking work and those employers who have been barely hanging on.  Clearly that opportunity was not taken.  What message does that convey to us?  It demonstrates that this Government over its lifetime will do nothing radical and will <Col N="1505" /> not be reforming or imaginative.  Certainly, it will not take risks where such may be called for, but will generally plod along, hoping that at the end of the day when its term of office will have expired at least it will not have made matters worse.  That would appear to be the objective of this Government &mdash; that it will not make matters worse and that nobody can criticise it in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>In this respect the Minister for Finance has proved himself already to be a replica of many of his predecessors who served in Coalition Governments with the Labour Party.  It appears he became a prisoner of a push by the Labour Party &mdash; from a totally different ideological viewpoint &mdash; and of weak leadership in the Taoiseach's office.  It is clear to me that in endeavouring to accommodate certain philosophies or moves in certain directions he was unable to maintain his position and undertake the action he believed fundamentally should have been taken by him as Minister for Finance.  Clearly he had not the back-up of his Taoiseach to implement the necessary changes, while bending to the needs of the Labour Party on the other side.  That crippled the previous Coalition Government involving the Labour Party in the mid-eighties and the previous Coalition Government in which the Labour Party were involved in the seventies.</P>
    <P>While the lessons and constraints on us because of European influence may not be as dramatic or devastating on our economy, certainly they will not improve our economy or the position of those who seek employment in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I listened with great interest to what Deputy Costello had to say in this Chamber about an hour ago.  Certainly he is not the same man who was a colleague of mine some short six months ago in Seanad Éireann, when he was well able to speak of his own volition in a very coherent and able manner.  It was something else to behold him here today, coming in to deliver a Government-type script the contents of which he clearly did not believe in and with which he was uncomfortable.  He said one thing I want <Col N="1506" /> to nail down here today in the context of tax reform.  More than any other party here the Progressive Democrats tried &mdash; and with considerable success, particularly during our time in Government &mdash; to bring about reform of our taxation system, in particular a reduction in the tax wedge on those at the margins.  In what appeared to be a follow-on to what the Taoiseach stated in recent weeks, Deputy Costello said that the tax reform that had taken place had not led to increased employment here.</P>
    <P>That is totally wrong.  I might recommend that the Deputy and others, including the Taoiseach, read the latest annual report of the Revenue Commissioners for 1991, in particular page 18, and refer to the graphs shown there.  One graph shows that employment growth between the years 1989 and 1991-92 was by any yardstick substantial &mdash; 1,120,000 people were employed in 1989 and the figure is now approaching 1.2 million people.  Clearly there has been sustained growth in employment during the period 1989 to end 1992.  It is extraordinary that that growth should occur at the time the Progressive Democrats were in Government, demonstrating that it was occasioned by the tax changes and the continuation of the action taken in previous years having a real effect in the marketplace.  Not only did the numbers at work increase, having been flat or on a downward trend for a considerable number of years before that, but the number of employers also rose significantly, from approximately 100,000 to 115,000 traders and employers.</P>
    <P>That improvement, given the picture that had obtained in the preceding years, was a substantial turnaround.  That was an improvement this Government should have foreseen and should have sought to continue the process which had led to those increases for the first time in many years.  One would have thought that they would have sought to continue that process in this budget and Finance Bill.  In addition, over that period the number of VAT registrations arose.  It can be clearly seen therefore that employment was growing, the number of employers <Col N="1507" /> increasing and that many aspects of our economy were improving.</P>
    <P>That leads me to question what will be the effect of the budgetary provisions and of this Finance Bill.  Since the figures are there to prove it already, I predict we will see a reduction in the numbers at work here.  We have observed already their effects on the clothing industry, with companies and retail shops closing down and jobs being lost.  I might point out that, even before the introduction of this budget, the clothing industry itself had predicted a decrease in activity in retail and manufacturing sales in the current year.  Yet, the Minister increased the rate of VAT on the industry by 30 per cent. That is appalling.  Members on the Government side of the House said that each industry has to bear the brunt but I do not know of any other indigenous industry of such importance, in terms of its potential to create employment, which had to endure such a shattering blow in the budget.  It is hard to understand the reason, given that between budget day and today the country has been crying out for changes, that these cannot be made.</P>
    <P>The point I wish to make to the Labour Party and to its colleagues in Government, the Fianna Fáil Party, is that it is wrong to suggest that the changes made during the past few years in regard to tax reform have not led to the creation of jobs.  The figures prove that they have.  I have no doubt that I and others will return to these figures in the years ahead when a different picture will have emerged for the simple reason that the Government will have moved backwards. For the first time in five years a Government has introduced a budget which will widen the tax wedge.  That will be the hallmark of this Government in developing the economy.</P>
    <P>The 2 per cent probate tax can only be described as despicable.  In the present climate, when we are experiencing difficulties in the economy, it is outrageous that such a tax should be introduced on estates valued over £10,000 without <Col N="1508" /> having any regard to the effect this will have on the people involved.  There is a presumption on the part of the Minister for Finance that somehow these people have cash reserves and substantial savings in bank or building society accounts but, as the Minister and everybody in this House should know, those who own small businesses and small farmers are struggling to survive.  The Minister seems to believe that these are easy pickings, that it is a matter of taking only small sums of money out of the estate and that this tax will not have any real effect. However, people will be forced to sell some of their assets, which they need to stay in business to pay this tax.  It will ultimately affect their ability to sustain their small businesses and employment in those businesses.</P>
    <P>Where are the majority of these small businesses and enterprises to be found? They are in rural Ireland.  We are trying to keep them away from Dublin, which is being turned into an urban monolith. In introducing this tax the Minister is attacking the fabric of the cottage industry &mdash; the small shopkeeper and small farmer.  I would like to know who dreamed up this 2 per cent tax, who had this flash of inspiration and who the genius was who saw this as an easy way to raise some extra funds to balance the books without having any regard to the impact it would have.  It is reprehensible at a time of great turmoil in a person's life, the death of a family member, that they will have to meet an unnecessary tax liability. It should never have been introduced.</P>
    <P>It is to the shame of the Minister and the two parties in Government that they have stood over the introduction of this tax.  The vast majority of Deputies on the other side of the House represent rural constituencies and they continually meet business people who are struggling to keep small towns and villages alive.  Yet, they can cynically stand over the introduction of this disgraceful tax.  This is extraordinary and I do not understand it.</P>
    <P>During the past 24 to 48 hours there has been a great discussion on the changes in telephone charges by Telecom Éireann. <Col N="1509" /> Everybody will welcome the reduction in international telephone call charges given that they were out of kilter with charges in the rest of Europe to the detriment of industry in this country. Coupled with this, local telephone call charges have been increased while rental charges are among the highest in Europe.</P>
    <P>In reference to the Culliton report, I do not accept that Governments have the right to interfere in public companies. Business cannot operate if, on the one, hand, they are told they must operate on a commercial basis and, on the other, they are issued with Government decrees.  The way to ensure fair and reasonable telephone charges is to bring monoplies to an end.  I do not believe in monopolies, be they private or public.  Is the ESB next in two months' time, to be followed by An Post?  When is Government interference in commercial semi-State companies to end?  It is both unwelcome and unwarranted.  As everybody is aware, the answer is to bring monopolies to an end and create competition in the market place.  We should let the market place and the consumer decide the value of any product or service.  We should not create artificial barriers to trade.</P>
    <P>I subscribe to the view that we should have a simplified tax system which would result in the removal of hidden benefits and tax breaks so that the person earning a wage would have the right to retain the largest possible amount of money in his pocket, would be the master of his own destiny and decide for himself what he wants to spend his money on.  It should be possible to do this if we only had the guts and the courage to do it.  Instead, we keep introducing incentives with the result that those who want to do anything need to have a firm of accountants and tax consultants to advise them.  This is not the way forward and the sooner we realise this the better.  In the long run if the consumer and the employer had spending power they would use it in such a way that jobs would be created.</P>
    <P>I have a great deal more to say but time has run out.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to highlight a number of issues contained in the Finance Bill published last Thursday.  Successive Fianna Fáil Governments have stressed their continuing commitment to creating employment.  The Minister has stated on numerous occasions that jobs are the overriding priority of the Government. We have to do whatever is required to increase employment, short and long term.  The Government is determined to take action to create more employment and this is stated clearly in the Programme for a Partnership Government. The programme also affirms our commitment to achieving a fair and just society in which job creation is central as there is no greater inequity than unemployment. This is well known to Members from their experience in the constituencies.</P>
      <P>The Finance Bill contains a special package of measures aimed at encouraging, in a focused and targeted way, investment in business and industry. Overall financial stability is the key requirement for business development, growth and job creation generally.  The availability to industry of adequate equity finance, especially in start-up and developing businesses, has become of increasing concern over the past number of years and certain specific incentives are needed to enhance that availability. Capital spending will increase by 27 per cent or by £500 million and this will provide major stimulus to the economy and to employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The combination of moneys from the Public Capital Programme, the Cohesion Fund and the additional expenditure by the Enterprise Partnership Boards is, by any standard, a very substantial stimulus to the economy and a major boost to employment.  The outlook is for an increase in the total number of jobs.  The total number at work outside agriculture <Col N="1511" /> is expected to rise by 6,000 and the labour force is expected to grow by approximately 27,000.  Having taken these figures into account, the Government introduced a number of specific taxation measures to assist the capitalisation of business and the funding of business start-ups.  Taxation is, of course, only one aspect of Government policy.  The Culliton report came out very strongly against large scale tax reliefs and exemptions. Each of the proposals in this Bill is targeted at a particular type of investor and investment so that the overall package is designed to meet the various different needs of the economy.  The business expansion scheme and the special investment accounts have the potential to make a significant contribution to improving the availability of equity funds to business over the next number of years.  The Government has renewed the BES for a further three years and in February of this year introduced special investment accounts.</P>
    <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government states that the BES would be extended to encourage productive investment that will result in job creation. In fulfilment of that commitment and in view of the employment potential of the scheme, it was renewed for another three years, up to 1996.  This is justified on the basis of maintaining the scheme's current focus on economic sectors and firms that are both high risk and offer a prospect of substantial extra output and jobs.  The lifetime cap on individual investors of £75,000 in respect of subscriptions made on or after the budget is being abolished although it is not being removed in respect of subscriptions made prior to the budget.  This will mean that BES projects can begin immediately to raise money from investors who were previously excluded by the ceiling.  The extension of the business expansion scheme and removal of the lifetime cap will provide a significant boost to business.  The business expansion scheme is designed to encourage direct personal investment in smaller companies.  To provide a further incentive to generating employment, the <Col N="1512" /> Government introduced special investment accounts from 1 February 1993 which are designed to encourage collective investment in Irish companies and to direct personal investment in publicly quoted companies.  They can be offered by life assurance companies, unit trusts and stockbrokers.  Income tax relief is currently available to an employee who invests up to £750 in new ordinary shares in his or her employing company.  The limit for this investment is being increased to £3,000 and the income tax relief allowance for these employees will double.  This is a clear indication of the Government's efforts to encourage job creation.</P>
    <P>The 1 per cent income levy which will apply for the year 1993-94 also outlines the Government's ongoing commitment to fighting the current unacceptable level of unemployment.  This levy is payable by all individuals over the age of 16 but there are specific exemptions to protect the low paid.  For example, in the case of the self-employed, exemptions will apply where income for the year is not greater than £9,000.  In the case of employees, the levy will be payable in any week where income is greater than £173 per week.  Medical card holders, including those whose income is over and above £9,000 per annum are also exempt from the levy.  All social welfare payments are exempt from the levy and will not be taken into account in determining whether an individual qualified for an income exemption from the levy.  Apart from these provisions and the improvement in the general climate for equity investment in recent months, this Bill contains a number of further specific measures to encourage investment in the economy which is of vital importance to employment potential and job creation.</P>
    <P>One of the new schemes introduced in this Bill to encourage entrepreneurs to start their own business is the seed capital scheme which allows the entrepreneur to claim a refund of tax paid on previous income in respect of his or her investment in the new company.  This matter was raised by the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party and was brought to the Minister's <Col N="1513" /> attention by various members, I am particularly glad to note he has taken this recommendation on board.  This highlights Fianna Fáil's continuing commitment to tackling the job crisis.  When the Taoiseach became leader of our party 16 months ago he emphasised that the continuing rise in the unemployment figures was one of his greatest worries and that he would do everything in his power to tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>I am pleased Fianna Fáil has been actively working to alleviate the problem of unemployment and will continue to do so.  This Bill is only one aspect where we have acted on our commitment to create jobs.</P>
    <P>It is very easy for Members who are not making the decisions to have all the answers.  I listened to Opposition Members very carefully but when they were on this side they had their opportunity to make a contribution.  We are suffering from the legacy which those on the other side of the House left us after their period in Government in the mid-1980s. We are now endeavouring to come to grips with the problems and I am confident that with the commitment of this Government we will make major inroads in solving our problems, particularly unemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Dan Wallace for sharing his time with me.  Deputy Cullen expressed concern for the people who will be subject to probate tax, particularly business people and farmers, but the reality is that the tax does not apply to those categories provided there is a lifetime transfer of the assets.  It is a tax on inheritance rather than on gifts.  I hope the proposals of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Joe Walsh, on the early retirement scheme for farmers will be acceptable to the Commission.  This will accelerate, quite properly, the transfer of farmland to young farmers.  The people who avail of that scheme, rather than being penalised with tax, will receive a State pension, something unheard of previously.  This will encourage the proper structuring of that industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1514" /> In the Fianna Fáil and Labour Programme for a Partnership Government the main emphasis, quite correctly is on creating jobs and tackling unemployment. This will be the main thrust of the programme for Government for the next four years.  While those who are without work must in the interim period have their social welfare benefits increased to take account of the cost of living increases, the correct emphasis of this year's budget is towards the development of an enterprise culture.  It is only through the development of a strong indigenous industrial force that we can generate much needed employment.  This direction must be adhered to during the lifetime of this Government regardless of what criticism may be mounted by Opposition parties.</P>
    <P>In times of hugh unemployment, which is evident not only in Ireland but throughout the European Community, would it be too much to suggest that all of us have a responsibility to be constructive and supportive of innovative measures which are designed to encourage self-help, initiative and enterprise?</P>
    <P>The main daily newspapers on the day after the news conference to announce details of the Finance Bill gave fair balance to the main proposals of the Bill. Despite Opposition Deputies rushing off press releases decrying selected tax increases as announced in the budget, the headlines in these papers referred to &ldquo;incentive aims to boost self starters&rdquo;, &ldquo;Changes in the BES scheme would help small business&rdquo;, &ldquo;A plan for clothing and footwear industries&rdquo;, &ldquo;Up to £36,000 in tax refund to boost startups&rdquo;, &ldquo;New reliefs aimed at job creation&rdquo;, &ldquo;Hoteliers happier&rdquo;, &ldquo;Boom for film makers&rdquo;, &ldquo;Jobs push on pension funds&rdquo; and &ldquo;New provisions to aid investments&rdquo;. All those headlines were taken from the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  Such headlines are not the creation of a Government press office but rather of experienced journalists and economic writers, assessing in an objective way the thrust and direction of this Government. The general consensus of experienced economic commentators is that this is an <Col N="1515" /> imaginative and commendable Finance Bill containing a range of positive measures designed to stimulate investment and employment growth.</P>
    <P>None of us can ever be happy with direct and indirect tax increases. However taxation policy cannot remain sterile, immovable and unchanging.  The people we represent have more intelligence than may be ascribed to them by Opposition spokesmen who try to cloud and divert the public's ability to realise that this Government is serious about its intentions to reward work, risk taking and entrepreneurial activities.  The focus is now directed to the indigenous Irish industries of small and medium size firms and the potential for further growth in this area.</P>
    <P>Statistics show that in the main employment levels have been maintained in Irish indigenous firms despite outside economic factors over which we had little or no control.  This fact is emphasised in the Irish service sector, which has seen a substantial increase in employment.  With the improvement of our telecommunications and communication networks with Europe and elsewhere this increase in service jobs can continue if properly fostered.  That fact is implicit in the Finance Bill in the reduction of VAT on selected service industries.</P>
    <P>Irish owned companies are increasingly establishing overseas subsidiary industries, be they manufacturing or marketing arms.  Clearly, with the advent of the Single Market, greater penetration of the European marketplace is essential if we are to have growth in productivity and manpower levels.  The proposals in the Finance Bill are in the main directed to stimulate investment in manufacturing and certain service companies.  Research and development is the foundation upon which progressive and forward looking new businesses are based.  For that reason I welcome the Bill's provision to allow for expenditure on research and development related to certain activities so that they can qualify in their own right for BES relief.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill and the measures contained <Col N="1516" /> therein are not the sole instruments available to Government to reverse the numbers unemployed and to encourage expansion in manufacturing industry and services.  The response of the Government to the Moriarty Task Force on the implementation of the Cullition report is now part of Government policy.  The many measures contained therein will not only firm up the foundations for continued economic growth but, combined with carefully selected initiatives and incentives, will restore confidence in the Irish investor and the entrepreneurs in our society to consider going it alone in the marketplace or, alternatively, availing of business expansion schemes or investing their savings. These savings can be indirectly invested through the Irish equity market for the benefit of our main quoted companies.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report pointed to an undersupply of seed capital, venture capital and development capital for small firms.  In this they saw a role for tax incentives to address the shortage of such capital and recommended the retention of the BES in that context.  In the Finance Bill the Minister not only retained the BES and made additions to it, as outlined in his Budget Statement, but he has substantially increased the attractiveness of the scheme by allowing a 100 per cent increase in the limit on the amount of BES capital that can be raised by a company and, most importantly, by relaxing the restriction whereby an individual with more than 30 per cent of the capital or voting power of the company can claim BES relief in respect of any share subscription in that company.  Such an individual can claim relief where the total share and loan capital does not exceed £150,000.  There are many Irish companies owned by individuals who have an extremely narrow shareholder base, often comprising husband and wife or children.  The new capital gains tax roll over relief to be granted to an individual who holds at least 15 per cent of the voting power, has been a full time employee or director and who disposes of his shareholding and re-invests within three years, creates flexibility in a scheme <Col N="1517" /> which in the main was dominated by management and stock broking firms and other such institutions who created new start up projects, which of course were welcomed.  The original restrictions prevented many small family owned companies of availing of this additional capital source to further expand their business.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the special financial help announced for the clothing and footwear industries.  As I stated in this House when we discussed Deputy Ivan Yates' Private Members' motion, I regret the 5 per cent VAT increase, but the Minister had clearly signalled the direction of VAT rates in his 1992 budget.  He has responded to the intensive lobbying of the retail and manufacturing operations who employ at least 24,000 people.  I stated at that time that the Minister's officials would have to look behind the statistics which were produced with a view to particularly saving our indigenous fashion sector of the clothing and footwear industries.  Clearly, within the entire fram work of the federation there are some very large players who have a competitive edge on both the English and in some instances European markets. These large firms have such momentum, efficiency and productivity levels as to make them competitive, but none of these industries are located west of the Shannon except for one large player in Donegal.  The prospects of re-employment of redundant workers in small rural communities, if they are dislocated by competitive forces, is remote.</P>
    <P>I press the Minister to consider seriously the reduction of employer's PRSI to restore competitive advantage in difficult trading times.  I am pleased to note that an urgent review is being carried out into the impact on low paid manufacturing firms of the operation of the employer's PRSI system.  I accept the Minister's bona fides in this matter, as I do his statement that this is a matter for social welfare legislation and not for the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>This industry has been under attack on several fronts not only since the introduction of the budget but rather for a <Col N="1518" /> considerable period leading up to the budget.  The announcement of the closures of Beeline Fashions of Chapelizod, Dublin 20, with the loss of 124 jobs on the day of the news conference to announce details of the Finance Bill is significant in that context.  In its statement it refers to cost structures, the impact of the currency crisis and a period of high interest rates, together with the increase on VAT on clothing, as contributing to its decision to close.  As a person with experience in that industry I feel that the inclusion of the reference to cost structures is the most telling of all, and the VAT increase introduced on 1 March may be described by some commentators as the final nail in the coffin.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, it is imperative that the review of PRSI be considered immediately together with ongoing consultations with the representatives of the industries concerned, IBEC.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement by the Minister that temporary financial assistance would be given to clothing firms which can show that their viability and employment are threatened by the budget decision to increase the VAT rate from 16 to 21 per cent.  This relief will be channelled to the industry by a similar structure to the market development fund, but of course it can only be of a temporary nature.  The criteria of the IDA in assisting technological development in this sector will have to be fleshed out so that an effective and responsible response is given to the industry.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement to bring proposals to Government for inclusion on Committee Stage of the Bill about extending the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax to the advertising income of newspapers.  The Minister might also consider extending this special relief to the independent radio stations, who in the main are not in a healthy state. This would be seen as recognition not only of the creativity that goes into the making of advertisements, treating it as a manufacturing process, but also of the very important social and competitive roles they play on our national airwaves. <Col N="1519" /> I would like to say much more but I appreciate that my time has expired.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>The failure of the Minister to respond to representations to raise the threshold for taxing redundancy payments from £6,000, which was set in 1976, to a realistic figure has caused great disappointment in Galway.  The £250 a year concession is a very inadequate response from the Government.  The loss of 780 jobs at Digital in Galway in February focused great attention on Galway.  Public representatives were all for compensating the Digital workers.  It was hinted that provision would be made in the Finance Bill to change the method of redundancy payment so as to aid any redundant worker who used his redundancy money to pay off a mortgage.  The Digital workers have been patient until now.  They conducted a solid campaign with their public representatives.  They refrained from holding demonstrations or public meetings so as not to damage the chances of attracting a substitute industry to Galway or into the Digital plant.  The lack of response from the Government, and especially from the Ministers who represent the constituency, is very disappointing.</P>
      <P>I was informed today that a public meeting will now be held in Galway by these workers on Sunday evening.  While bringing the matter to public attention might have repercussions for the replacement of the industry, they see it as being necessary and this is only occurring because of the frustration felt after expectations had been built up with regard to the Finance Bill.  Hopes have been dashed and the workers see no alternative to bringing the matter to public attention.  They are demanding an explanation for the crocodile tears shed after the announcement of the 780 redundancies in February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The workers will ask serious questions at that meeting and they will want to know if the Ministers representing the constituency were not able to get the message across at Cabinet that something positive should be done.  Expectations <Col N="1520" /> were raised with regard to the Finance Bill and the provisions in it are a huge disappointment to the Digital workers and others.  The addition of £250 per year of service to the minimum tax threshold of £6,000 is an inadequate response.  The £6,000 threshold was introduced in 1976 and an alteration now amounting to an extra £250 for every year of service will have little or no effect.  The average service of the Digital workers in Galway is ten or 11 years which will add only £2,500 extra to the threshold before their redundancy payments become taxable.</P>
    <P>I refrained from making any public statement on that matter during the discussions with the Minister.  Like others I made some private representations but I felt that a public debate at the time might not have been helpful.  Because of what has happened I will be tabling amendments to the Bill to provide more benefit for the workers.  I will be asking that the limit be increased to something of the order of £15,000 or £20,000 and that the standard capital superannuation benefit should apply after ten years rather than 20 years.  This would greatly help workers who are made redundant in any company. I am stressing Digital because when those redundancies occurred it was very big national and international news at the time.  I am doing so also because of the expectations that were raised by public representatives and members of the Government among those workers with regard to the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers on the Government side stressed the importance of employment creation.  Unemployment is one of our biggest problems.  It is a worry for parents, for children and for the Government.  The introduction of a 1 per cent income levy is nothing short of criminal at a time when everybody is trying to do something about job creation.  I am not impressed with the promise that this is only a temporary little measure.  Temporary little measures introduced before lasted ten and 12 years, and some were never removed.  The introduction of a 1 per cent income levy is an indication that the Government is only paying lip service to the idea that the creation of employment <Col N="1521" /> is one of its major tasks.  Perhaps it was introduced because in theory it is an easy means of raising finance from everybody in employment.  It is a further disincentive to work and it must be condemned.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a probate tax of 2 per cent &mdash; in other words, the reintroduction of death duties or a death tax &mdash;on an estate over the value of £10,000 is another retrograde step.  An estate valued at £10,000 in rural areas need only be a site.  The imposition of this tax poses a very serious burden for families at a vulnerable time in their lives.  It will lead to the sub-division of estates resulting in farms and houses having to be sold off to pay the probate tax.  I welcomed the abolition of death duties some years ago and I am disappointed it is being reintroduced in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section dealing with urban renewal and designated areas.  In fact, the urban renewal scheme was first introduced by a former Fine Gael Minister, Mr. John Boland.  Galway was one of the first areas to respond positively to the designated areas scheme and we rebuilt the entire city centre.  What were derelict sites is now a vibrant part of the city admired by people nationally and internationally.  As Mayor of Galway I am proud to take visitors to that area to show them what has been done.  This is one of the best examples of what can be achieved under the urban renewal scheme.  Not only did the developers redesign the whole area but they retained part of the old city and brought life back into the city centre by providing 25 per cent residential accommodation in any developments.  The townhouses being built over the shopping centre of Eyre Square are an excellent example of engineering skills and are commented upon favourably by many visitors.</P>
    <P>There is still a four acre site near the docks area which is unlikely to be developed before the designated time expires at the end of October.  It has not been developed because of title difficulties. In view of the co-operation by Galway corporation and the developers in the city centre scheme I appeal to the <Col N="1522" /> Minister to extend the time for commencement of building work in this area by one year or 18 months to allow the title of this property to be put in order. Sometimes the matter of title can prove difficult and there can be a long drawn-out process to put it in order.  As the property is owned by a semi-State body &mdash; the harbour board &mdash; it should be possible to do this.</P>
    <P>Another matter which was the subject of much comment &mdash; it was referred to by speakers on both sides of the House &mdash; was the announcement of the drastic increase in telephone charges.  This represents a cruel imposition on an old age pensioner who uses the telephone to contact neighbours or members of his or her family.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but telephone calls are not free.  The cost of calls by those people will increase.  It is ridiculous that a three minute call will cost 9.8p or whatever the new charge is to be.  One of the comforts of such people has been that they could speak at length on the telephone with members of the family in other parts of the city or to their neighbour. The increase represents a serious penalty on those people It will also be a serious imposition on families, particularly people like myself with four teenagers in the home.  After September when the cost of local calls will be increased I advise people to carefully examine their bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The imposition of a 21 per cent VAT rate on clothing has been referred to. Despite a vigorous, strong and constructive campaign by representatives of the clothing trade the Minister did not respond to them and that is regrettable. Deputy Ned O'Keefe said this increase would bring us into line with Europe where there has been a 15 per cent VAT increase.  Whoever prepared his script forgot to tell him that we are proposing to put a 21 per cent VAT rate on clothing. In other words, we are now out of line and have the highest VAT rate on clothing in Europe.  This will be counter productive. <Col N="1523" /> The Minister thinks that if last year's revenue is multiplied by a further 5 per cent or 6 per cent that that will generate a specific amount of extra revenue. There will be consumer resistance to the imposition of this tax.  Shopkeepers will not be able to absorb this VAT increase in the price of their goods because they have had to do so twice already.  They will have to do one of two things, or probably a little of both, pass on this tax to the customer or, something which is anti-employment, let people go.</P>

      <P>I did not realise my time had expired.  There is much more I wanted to say.  The imposition of 21 per cent VAT rate on clothing and footwear shows a serious disregard by the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government for job creation.  Already many in the clothing industry have been forced to lay off temporary workers and to put their permanent workers on shorter working hours.  That is a condemnation of the Government's policy on job creation.</P>

      <P>In response to Deputy McCormack, this is not the ideal Finance Bill.  I would have launched a dramatic attack on the massive unemployment problem.  Nevertheless the Minister said on 24 February that this was the first step in a five year programme and in many respects he made a fair start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome sections 18 to 20 in relation to seed capital.  My experience as a director of the Coolock Development Council where we are trying to assist about 40 young entrepreneurs, is that there is a <Col N="1524" /> massive need for start-up capital.  Under these sections people leaving employment or the unemployed will get tax relief equal to the previous three years to a maximum of £75,000.  I also welcome the extension of the BES for three years and the raising of the company limit to £1 million.</P>
    <P>I am also heartened by the fact that the Minister has included research and development activities within the scope of BES projects.  This is an area where we were quite prepared to rely on foreign investors to look after our research and development.  Unfortunately, the most innovative of them did not stay the course so now we must develop this aspect of our industry.</P>
    <P>Most of all I welcome section 19 which provides for an increase in tax relief for employees buying shares in their own company from £750 to £3,000.  I give credit for this to a member of the Opposition, Deputy John Bruton, who first introduced it in 1986.  This section could have a dramatic impact in the years ahead.  I understand that at present about 60,000 employees own shares in their own company.  I regret that, when the Irish Sugar Company &mdash; Greencore &mdash; was being privatised, more employees did not participate.  I am anxious that Aer Lingus not only will get State equity but that employees, who suffered the hardship of cutbacks in pay will find this section useful in that they could replace their losses with effective partial ownership of their own companies.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects of this Bill which as the effective leader of Dublin County Council I welcome especially the section relating to the extension of the urban general designated areas and the other urban renewal schemes in sections 24 and 29. These have particular relevance to our capital city in that there has been amazing activity in the last couple of years in refurbishing and redeveloping Dublin.  At present various companies are building some 3,500 apartments which is the highest number being built in any major European city.  Many of the Government <Col N="1525" /> initiatives culminating in these sections deserve the credit.</P>
    <P>I welcome all the provisions of section 10 and a number of other measures which improve the chances of young enterpreneurs in starting up businesses.  I particularly welcome the Minister's promises in regard to pension funds.  I regret that less than 70 per cent of investment in Irish pension funds now goes into the Irish economy.  I know the Minister is engaged in talks on this and I wish him success because clearly this huge amount of resource capital must be channelled in the direction of industry and agriculture.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a lack of probity and patriotism among the elite of our financial community.  I am disappointed that the Minister does not require the banking community, the Big Four in particular and perhaps the Irish Big Two, to make a greater contribution towards the development of Irish industry. Young business men and women are very often turned down by the banks when they come forward with ideas for new projects.  The development of the banking industry has resulted in an effective cartel with massive control of funds and massive outflows of capital.  The Big Two spent more time in the last few years developing interests in Maryland and New Hampshire in the United States than they did in this country.  The Minister should set up a third force in banking. From my own contacts in Trustee Savings Bank, ACC and ICC, I think those companies are quite willing, as is An Post, to create the kind of effective capital base which would provide real competition to the banks, particularly in relation to the funding of industry.</P>
    <P>A fundamental problem still remains in that we have not yet come to grips with the imbalance in taxation and its too narrow base, although sections 1 to 7 of the Bill will do a little this year to redress the balance.  The Labour Party and Fianna Fáil can take the credit for implementing the tremendous new increases in social welfare this year. However, the effective marginal rate of taxation of 57 per cent is too high and is a general disincentive to our population <Col N="1526" /> to work harder and longer and to take the chance of engaging in enterprise.  I ask the Minister for Finance to look at this problem in the months and years ahead and introduce the kind of legislation that will expand the base.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks we read reports about the kind of returns and salaries which have been paid to executive and non-executive directors of some of these companies. Seen against the taxation paid by the vast bulk of PAYE taxpayers, the figures quoted in the press, tax benefits, golden handshakes and so on are a scandal. The Finance Bill must address the whole area of improving the administration of our financial community.</P>
    <P>I would have welcomed a more radical Bill in the context of the imbalances in our taxation system.  The fact that the Minister has once again raised a lot of money to balance our current budget is related to the fact that our rural cousins and many of the self-employed did not contribute enough to taxation which is regettable.  However, in general I welcome the moves by the Minister for Finance this year to improve the financing of Irish industry.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Refugee Protection Bill, 1993: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that, although we are debating the Refugee Protection Bill, the attitude of the State to various refugees who come to our shores is to put them on the next plane and get them out of our jurisdiction as quickly as possible.  With the opening up of Eastern Europe and the unification of Germany hundreds of thousands of refugees have been pouring into Western Europe, half a million into Germany alone.  It would appear that the breakdown of Communism and its consequences <Col N="1527" /> was not anticipated politically or socially by the EC.</P>
      <P>The increased burdens which such movements of population create have precipitated a call for a concerted response by all European states and by the EC in particular.  So far, unfortunately, those states not directly affected by the problem have baulked at assisting their neighbours.  The result is that many states least able to cope have huge numbers of refugees within their boundaries.  In the light of the escalating problem in the former Yugoslavia alone, the EC's failure to implement a concerted and concerned immigration and asylum policy and plan for the future is short-sighted and might ultimately prejudice the stability of the entire European region.</P>
      <P>At the Edinburgh Summit in December 1990 mere platitudes were mouthed about concern for human rights, peace and the termination of armed conflicts etc.  The summit expressed its concern that &ldquo;uncontrolled immigration could be destabilising and could undermine the situation of third country nationals who have legally taken up residency in the member states&rdquo;.  However, in relation to dealing with applications for asylum, the Minister resolved, effectively, to return refugees to the first &ldquo;safe&rdquo; third country they had been able to reach.  This notion of a &ldquo;safe&rdquo; country is not only shamelessly unhumanitarian, it also fails to take into consideration the stability and resources of the &ldquo;safe&rdquo; country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the EC Ministers met recently in Budapest they resolved to crack down on the organised smuggling of illegal immigrants by organised crime, to set up special police units and mobile surveillance forces, to exchange information and to adopt a common code of border checks.  What they failed to do was to agree to the German demands for a common code on repatriation and there was absolute reluctance to share the financial burdens of the refugee crisis.  The states that are affected by this problem have been ignored by the rest of Europe. They are Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, <Col N="1528" /> Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Slovakia and, of course, Germany. It is inexcusable that Germany should have accepted 444,000 people last year compareed to 27,500 by France, 24,600 by the UK and so on.  Hungary has turned away one million people since 1991.</P>
    <P>As stated previously, the EC Commission does not have any real teeth in this area, but Commissioner Pádraig Flynn has promised to come up with some recommendations within the next six weeks.  He should take into account some of the following issues in coming to his conclusions.  The European Community has been totally impotent in the area of refugees and asylum seekers.  There has been a lack of legal basis for taking action and there is a necessity for a supplementary Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty allowing the European Court of Justice jurisdiction in this area.  A concerted campaign is required to harmonise the laws in all member states, including Ireland.  There should be promotion of the flexibility within the Dublin Convention and the Schengen Agreement to seek that Governments use their discretion in individual cases regarding repatriation or not.</P>
    <P>Exclusionary tactics such as maximum quotas, lists of safe countries and restrictions of immigrants to one application for asylum are insensitive and in many cases fly in the face of the conventions on Human Rights.  No account is taken of the financial crisis that can accrue for countries who have to cope with an influx of refugees and no account is taken of the implications for fledgeling democracies that have enough problems of their own, such as Poland and Slovakia.  There are dangers of instability in the regions, particularly in the Balkan region, which are unable to cope with the burden of refugees at present&mdash;and the prospect of a further two million refugees from the Balkan region alone does not bear thinking about.</P>
    <P>The implications for the European Community, including Ireland, are noteworthy. Until the EC decides to face the music, it cannot respond properly to the <Col N="1529" /> long term refugee problem.  Everything the EC has done up to now has been crisis management only.  Scare tactics of prophesying increased terrorism, drugs and organised crime are not substantiated and are merely a short term sop.  If the EC wants to form a European union within a region surrounded by friendly and stable neighbours it will have to discard its insular attitudes and frame sensible policies on this issue.  It must form a policy to assist and integrate immigrants or it will have to share the blame if the potential for unrest spreads.  The internal market came into force on 1 January 1993 but this will become a reality only when internal borders of the Community are removed.</P>
    <P>The Government should be offering more assistance to refugees and establishing fairer procedures for examining applications for asylum.  It should voice its objection to any attempt to create parallel conventions with bordering non-EC states towards throwing a <i>cordon sanitaire</i> around the EC, thus preventing access to any refugees.  The Government should be demanding that Commissioner Flynn recommends a concerted and humanitarian response by all EC countries and a sharing of the burden.  Above all, the Government could take a major step forward this evening by supporting Deputy Shatter's Bill.  All political parties in this House recognise that a problem exists and that this Bill addresses that problem.  Therefore, I appeal to the Government, particularly the Labour Party, who have spoken eloquently about this matter in the past, to ensure the passage of this Bill through this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that we have a Bill before us dealing with the protection of refugees and I congratulate Deputy Shatter, who has championed this issue for a long time.  I commend also Deputy Carey and Deputies from all sides who have raised this issue from time to time because they have met people seeking asylum and are aware of the problems they face.  I have been contacted frequently by Amnesty International on this matter.  I compliment <Col N="1530" /> that organisation on making this its central area of concern over the past number of years.  Last October I raised this matter in the Seanad and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, responded on that occasion also.</P>
      <P>This is a broad and complex issue and many of us will have met people seeking asylum on economic and uneconomic grounds.  This is an increasing problem in Europe as a whole.  Last week the Minister gave the figures for fleeing from persecution people seeking an economic haven combined with asylum.  In the ten year period from 1982 to 1992 the figure increased from 64,000 to 700,000 in the European Community.  Perhaps this is not a major problem here but it is certainly on our doorstep.</P>
      <P>I have had occasion to deal with heart-rending cases of foreign students and doctors whose spouses were refused visas to this country even though those doctors and students had bona fide visas.  I have met foreign nationals married to Irish citizens who are being treated as aliens. This is happening regularly.  Indeed, those who have been granted asylum are still treated as controlled aliens and must return on a yearly basis to the aliens office, it seems the Department of Justice is unwilling to cut the umbilical cord and wishes to ensure that they are controlled perpetually.</P>
      <P>In this debate we are concentrating largely on the procedures for refugees seeking asylum in non-economic circumstances. A definition is given in the legislation produced by Deputy Shatter, in the 1951 UN Convention and in the 1967 Protocol which deals specifically with the matter and defines a refugee as follows:</P>
      <P>...a person who, owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ironic that this refers to &ldquo;outside the <Col N="1531" /> country&rdquo; because when those people are in their own countries we show great consideration, charity, compassion and concern for them when they are starving or persecuted abroad in Bosnia, Somalia or elsewhere.  Our humanity and Christianity is boundless and we have a well-deserved reputation in that regard. However, institutionally as soon as one of those people seeks to set foot on this island our humanity goes out the door. In other words, it is nice to be charitable as long as those people stay abroad but if they should try to set foot on this island we treat them with the greatest suspicion and hostility.  Very often we imprison them and in almost 99 per cent of cases deport them.</P>
    <P>Amnesty International, the organisation most involved, has described the position in Ireland very succinctly in its briefing document:</P>
    <P>In Ireland asylum-seekers who make a claim upon arrival at a port of entry are interviewed, often on the same day they arrive, by an immigration officer who receives no special training in international refugee law or the special situation of asylum-seekers.  Asylum-seekers at a port of entry are not usually told of their right to legal counsel or their right to contact the UNHCR. Moreover, the decision on their case is usually made by officials in the Department of Justice on the basis of the immigration officers' notes of the interview. These officials, too, have no special knowledge of international refugee law or of conditions in the asylum-seeker's country of origin.</P>
    <P>This is particularly damning.  I have personal experience of this in at least one instance.  A Chinese citizen, Mr. Lau, was involved in the uprising in Tiananmen Square.  He was imprisoned there and tortured while in prison.</P>

      <P>This man was imprisoned and tortured and on his release he went on the run and tried to join his sisters in the United Kingdom.  However, he was detained by the immigration officers in Ireland who suspected he had a forged passport.  He was detained in Fitzgibbon Street Garda Station, which contains two special detention cells for aliens, while his nationality was being established. Arrangements were made for his deportation to Thailand without going through the proper procedures.  One of his sisters in the United Kingdom was contacted and, on the advice of a garda, she contacted a solicitor who applied for refugee status for her brother.  The man was imprisoned in Mountjoy for seven months until the High Court ordered his release.  On request I visited him in Mountjoy and I am, therefore, familiar with the case.  This poor man unfortunately broke his journey in Ireland on his way to join his family who were fleeing from torture and imprisonment in the People's Republic of China and on his way to the United Kingdom was subjected to our procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will say that the procedures have been in place since 1985 but I have experience of them not operating properly.  For example, who told this man of his right to contact a lawyer?  If the procedures were properly in place the officials should have done so.  Did anyone contact the United Nations High Commission for Refugees?  No.  Why should a person applying for asylum be held in a cell or, indeed, detained in prison for six <Col N="1533" /> to eight months?  It is no wonder that of the 62 applications for refugee status in 1990, only one was granted.  I fear that either officially we cannot be bothered to strictly implement the procedures or, which is even more sinister, we are deliberately preventing people &mdash; in an institutionalised, official fashion &mdash; from availing of them and to fully exercise their application to remain in this country. Therefore, we need legislation to implement the provisions of the 1951 UN Convention and the 1967 Protocol.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter's Bill contains the substance of what is required.  There is a clear definition in line with the UN Convention and Protocol.  The procedures are outlined which involve the Minister and the UNHCR, the right to legal advice and to be informed of same, the right to an interpreter if that is needed &mdash; and to be informed of that &mdash; and the establishment of an appeals tribunal.  Therefore, while I might disagree with aspects of Deputy Shatter's Bill, it has substance.</P>
    <P>I am on record as saying in relation to the Suicide Bill that the Government has adopted a Programme for Government which includes issues such as suicide, which should have been decriminalised years ago.  The Government should be allowed reasonable time to show its commitment to introducing and implementing this programme but if it does not, obviously legislation from other quarters must be considered.</P>
    <P>All Members are entitled to introduce a Private Members' Bill, I regard it as an enabling process to present a personal or national matter of interest.  The question remains whether we should proceed to Committee Stage of this Bill or proceed on different lines.  The Minister has already indicated he is prepared to ensure that a tribunal is established pending the response from an interdepartmental committee consisting of the Departments of Justice, Foreign Affairs and Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <P>As I said in my opening remarks there is a broader range of issues here apart from seeking asylum on humanitarian grounds.  There is the question of people seeking asylum on economic and other <Col N="1534" /> grounds.  We must have a short timescale for the introduction of suitable legislation to deal with the other problems that may arise.  A Bill of this nature should be a priority for the Government but if there is a commitment now that the legislation will be dealt with in a broader context comprising all aspects of the aliens issue, I am prepared to wait for a period to ensure the Government fulfils its commitment in the Programme for Government, namely, that we have legislation to ensure that proper procedures are in place and that everybody attempting to find a safe haven here is allowed to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I thank Deputy Costello for sharing his time with me.</P>
      <P>Recent events in Eastern Europe have made people throughout the world aware of the serious refugee problem faced by the European Community.  It is on a scale that has no precedent since the Second World War.  The most effective way to tackle a problem of this gravity is to have co-ordinated, structured action at European Community level.  The efforts of individual countries, while useful and important, are no substitute for close co-operation among member states.  The Maastricht Treaty provides for such co-operation and for this reason I hope it is ratified as soon as possible.  We are all aware that it has been subject to innumerable delays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole concept of asylum is a cornerstone of any State's humanitarian obligation to provide protection to those who are vulnerable, in fear of persecution and in urgent need of sanctuary and shelter. Asylum is a matter of close co-operation, but it cannot be stressed too strongly that emigration is a matter of State sovereignty.  The State alone decides if citizens of other states are to be admitted.  However, the map of Europe is changing and Europe needs to respond to this change urgently.  A complex problem now exists where increasing numbers of <Col N="1535" /> asylum seekers have claims which are weak or not genuine.  Those people are eroding the functioning of the current system.  This problem is further complicated by the Single Market, with no internal border control and with joint external borders are one of its aims.  In other member states asylum procedures are overburdened and strained.  The Community is faced with a complex and difficult problem and it is not one that lends itself to easy answers or solutions.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to paint an overly pessimistic picture but in order to respond to Deputy Shatter's Bill it is necessary to clearly outline the context in which any new legislative measures must function. Before considering any new legislation it is incumbent on the House to carefully consider its knock-on effects and how effectively it might work.  For this reason I welcomed the Minister's statement last week and those made by the Minister of State last night in relation to an extensive review of existing procedures and the decision to appoint a retired High Court judge to deal with an appeals procedure. With due respect to Deputy Shatter, I do not believe that introducing new legislation now will serve any useful purpose until this review takes place.  It is an absolute prerequisite that the review takes place and to forge ahead without it could in the medium term be counterproductive. Nevertheless, it must be admitted that there is much to admire in Deputy Shatter's Bill.  It is timely and can serve only to highlight the problems and serious challenges we face in this area.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the thrust and spirit of Deputy Shatter's Bill, although it is not without flaws &mdash; not even Deputy Shatter is free of those.  It is important that the aforementioned review takes place before any new legislation in this area is introduced.  It is important to stress that the Programme for a Partnership Government unambiguously outlines the Government's humanitarian commitment to refugees.  I have no doubt that this commitment will be honoured in order, as the programme says: &ldquo;to meet the highest international standards&rdquo;. <Col N="1536" /> If Deputy Shatter's Bill helps this House acquire a level of understanding and to attain this commtment, then it is most welcome and I am sure it will achieve this.</P>
    <P>I must take issue with Deputy Shatter in regard to some matters.  Statements made in the House last week on the refugee issue may have given some people the impression that there are parties here who have a monopoly on compassion. That cannot be the position, because we are all human beings.  I would like to take this opportunity to remind the House that only last year the then Government took in approximately 200 Bosnian refugees. This was a welcome and humanitarian gesture.  This Government is sensitive to its humanitarian responsibilities and will act upon them, as the programme for Government clearly outlines.  The Government will not shirk those responsibilities but will act upon them in the most effective way possible.  While Deputy Shatter's Bill is admirable, it is not effective enough for the serious task in hand.</P>
    <P>As has been stated many times from these benches, it is incorrect to suggest that there are practically no procedures governing our international obligations with regard to the processing of applications for refugee status.  The existing formal arrangements for dealing with these applications were agreed with the competent agency in the field &mdash; the United National Commission for Refugees. Every application is processed in accordance with that agreement and advice is sought on whether the applicant in question qualifies for refugee status in accordance with the 1951 United Nations Convention on the status of refugees.  I understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs is also consulted.  It is not true to suggest that Department officials are making decisions in this extremely sensitive area.  Having researched this matter I understand that every decision on refugee status is made by the Minister for Justice, who relies heavily on the advice of the UNHCR to make that decision.</P>
    <P>I would strongly suggest that a programme <Col N="1537" /> of retraining should be introduced for our officials in the front line who meet the refugees.  I would like to ensure that the officials who meet refugees at airports are well trained to deal with different cases and that they are well informed about the procedures to be followed in dealing with applications for asylum.  Emigration officials at our airports should be well versed in our obligations regarding the treatment of refugees and the delicate handling necessary in such cases.</P>
    <P>It would be incorrect also to suggest that the system as it operates in this country is particularly draconian.  Our system is in accordance with international norms.  It would undermine the system if this country were to depart from those norms.  Without wishing to appear harsh, there are many people who claim refugee satus without having any basis for doing so.  There is an onus on all Governments to ensure that those strictures are preserved.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to be wholly negative about Deputy Shatter's Bill.  The Bill is an important signpost on the way to the formulation of the Government's legislation in this area.  Its main drawback is that it is more of a sketch for future legislation than for actual legislation.</P>

In the meantime I would urge the Minister to complete her review with a view to introducing the Government's legislation as soon as possible.  The commitment in the Programme for Government is unambiguous in its intent.

      <P>No one should be in any doubt about the issue we are debating here: we are talking about the most fundamental right of all, the right of a person to live in his or her country without the <Col N="1539" /> fear of repression or persecution.  People who are subject to this type of behaviour in their countries have no option but to flee to another country.</P>
      <P>Of all countries in Europe, Ireland owes refugees a welcome and should give them an opportunity to start a new life in relative peace and prosperity.  I need not remind the House that it is not so long ago since tens of thousands of Irish citizens were forced off their land and had to emigrate to the then alien shores of America and Canada.  If only for this reason, we should have a particular affinity with those people who seek refuge in our country.</P>
      <P>I am sure that like me other Deputies have received representations on this issue from people in many parts of the country.  One can take it that the people outside this House strongly support refugees in their plight.  However, I have to say that Deputy Shatter's Bill does little or nothing to advance the plight of refugees who seek asylum here.  As has been said tonight, the Bill is seriously flawed. I understand the Bill would only succeed in making the procedures unnecessarily cumbersome and time-consuming and Deputies would agree that we should be aiming go down that road.  We should be aiming to formulate an agreed set of procedures which would be clearly set out, transparent and allow for refugee cases to be dealt with as humanely and sympathetically as possible.</P>

I understand that this appeals tribunal will be operational in the near future.  The sooner this tribunal is set up the better. I congratulate the Minister on her initiative in this regard.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the decision of the Minister to review all the procedures which apply in the determination of refugee status.  This review, which is long overdue, should be acknowledged by all Deputies.  I understand that the main aim of this review will be to ensure that our long-standing tradition of social justice is upheld in dealing with asylum applications. The Minister has announced her intention to set up an inter-departmental committee with a wide brief to examine the policy and practices followed in asylum application cases.  This important step in the right direction will ensure that from now asylum cases will be examined uder a much wider perspective, which can only be regarded as a good thing.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge Deputy Shatter's motives in bringing this Bill before the House.  However, I consider it basically flawed.  I fully support the positive measures being taken by the Government and the Minister.</P>

      <P>Democratic Left supports Deputy Shatter's Bill.  In the short period since the Bill was introduced last week we have seen an increasing public demand for support for it.  Even at this late stage a case can be made for reconsideration by the Government of its very negative position on this Bill, as expressed by the Minister for Justice last <Col N="1541" /> week.  This opposition has been very timidly justified this evening by speakers from the Government side.  The reasons put forward for opposing the Bill are more excuses for not going into the lobby to support it tonight.  For a while during Deputy Costello's speech I thought the conscience of the Labour Party was about to overwhelm him but, alas, it would appear that Deputy Costello, his party and political expediency has won out.</P>
      <P>The Minister made an extraordinary speech last week in opposing this Bill. She claimed that the proposers and supporters of it were not properly informed of the reality concerning the treatment of refugees here.  Having listened to her speech, I do not think there is anybody less informed of the realities facing refugees entering this country than the Minister. She made one of the most extraordinary misinformed speeches any Minister has made in this House for a long time.  The Minister told us that all applications &mdash; she repeated the word &ldquo;all&rdquo;&mdash; were processed in accordance with the procedures agreed with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.  She declared that there was no question of applicants being bundled out of the State at airports.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the widely publicised case of 27 Turkish Kurds who arrived at Shannon Airport on 16 November last and were bundled back onto an Aeroflot plane by 50 gardaí drafted in from local areas?  There was no question of those people being able to make any application.  That is not the only case. Amnesty International have reported that in November 1990 four Sri Lankans who arrived here on a Friday were deported the following Tuesday and that two Sri Lankans who arrived on a Tuesday were deported the following Thursday. So much for adherence to the procedures.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to state:</P>
      <P>No person has ever been detained simply as a result of making an application for political asylum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I acknowledge the kind of official doublespeak contained in that statement, <Col N="1542" /> the Minister must know of the case referred to by Deputy Costello of a Chinese student who arrived here in the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square demonstrations, and the demonstrations for democracy in China, being detained in Mountjoy Prison for seven months.  She must also know of the case of the Liberian refugee, Ben Marti Doe, whose name has become a byword for the mistreatment of refugees here, who was detained for a long time in prison.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that the Minister can be allowed by her advisers, put on the record such a misleading picture of the position regarding the treatment of refugees. Is it any wonder refugees are treated in such an appalling way?  It must also be said &mdash; and the Minister in her contribution last week acknowledged this &mdash;that the question of the treatment of refugees is something inherent in our whole attitude to the question of immigration. A number of speakers this evening referred to that fact.  For example, Deputy Costello referred to the case of doctors from overseas who come here and encounter difficulty in having their families brought in with them.  For a country that does not have what is known as an immigration problem, this country has pursued a disgraceful policy in the context of the European Community. In many respects we have been doing the dirty work of some of the larger member states of the EC faced with immigration problems.  For example, at a meeting of immigration Ministers in London in November last the Irish Government effectively vetoed an agreement on allowing family members of immigrant workers into the various countries of the European Community on the grounds that there was a question of their possible entitlement to work.  When some weeks ago I raised this matter in the House by way of parliamentary question, I was treated to the kind of double speak to which we have become accustomed here.  I was told that it had not been vetoed but that concern had been expressed.  However, the net result was the same.  The agreement was blocked because this country at that meeting pursued <Col N="1543" /> a position hostile to allowing the families of immigrant workers to enter the country.  In my opinion this was effectively doing the dirty work of larger member states of the EC who may have a bigger problem than we do in this respect.</P>

      <P>If I may be permitted I want to share my time with Deputy Sargent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be a disgrace if this Bill is voted down in the House this evening since everybody who has spoken in the debate so far has said that this is a problem we must address.  The Minister has admitted that it is a problem we must address. Every Fianna Fáil and Labour Party Member who has spoken here has said it is a problem we must address.  We are being given an opportunity to address it by means of Deputy Shatter's Bill.  The fact that it is an Opposition Bill should not be advanced as an excuse for not dealing with this problem.  There is no reason whatever for a vote this evening. None of us needs to go through the lobbies if the Government parties, the Fine Gael Party and ourselves simply agree that the Bill be approved here this evening&mdash;warts and all, because nobody is claiming it is a perfect Bill &mdash; and passed to one of the new legislative committees we established within the past two weeks.  Let the committee deal with the abscesses, warts and difficulties the various spokespersons have identified. Of course, there will be problems encountered with the Bill.  The Government introduce Bills in this House and we spend days and weeks endeavouring to tease them out and improve them. Indeed, on occasion the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, sitting across the House from me this evening, has accepted amendments from this side of the House.  There is no reason a Bill must be perfect when introduced in this House.  Let us please apply a bit of commonsense to this Bill and not have a vote on it at all this evening.  Rather let it be submitted to one of our legislative committees and deal with it in a mature manner to counter a problem that every <Col N="1544" /> speaker has agreed needs to be dealt with urgently.</P>
    <P>A number of points the Minister made in her contribution need to be addressed. For example, she attempted to give the impression that everything was fine, that no person entering this country encounters any problem with the procedures applied to them on reaching our shores or landing on our airstrips.  That is not true.  Deputy Gilmore has already indicated a number of instances where it has not been true.  I do not have sufficient time to give others, but there are plenty of examples of human beings being treated virtually like cattle when they arrive in this country.</P>
    <P>For the Minister to claim that the United Nations High Commission for Refugees is the virtual decision-maker in these cases is to mislead this House and the public.  The UNHCR is not a statutory body and does not have an office in this country.  If it is advising the Department on any particular issue it is doing so at arm's length, presumably over the telephone, on the basis of information provided by the Department of Justice. Therefore, it is not accurate to claim that the United Nations High Commission for Refugees is actually taking the decision because it is not on the ground and has never had an opportunity to speak to the actual people claiming asylum.  That is one point that needs to be nailed here this evening.</P>
    <P>The second point is that, as I understand it, there is a system of so called &ldquo;safe&rdquo; countries agreed between members of the EC.  If people from those countries apply for asylum they are refused automatically, because their countries of origin are regarded as &ldquo;safe&rdquo;. Nobody knows the criteria on which a decision was taken that such countries are safe.  Our Government has never published the relevant criteria.  It would appear to me that that constitutes a failure to be transparent, as the Minister claimed she wanted to be.</P>
    <P>In addition, the criteria to which the Minister referred, the 1985 agreed criteria, have never been published.  As I understand the position, when applicants <Col N="1545" /> in court attempt to base their case on that criteria they are informed that these criteria are not legally binding and, therefore, that their case cannot stand.  Neither have we ever been told what instructions are issued to departmental officials when dealing with cases of this kind or how they should approach them.  There is so much hidden in relation to how we deal with asylum seekers that it is absolutely essential that this Bill should be approved on Second Reading here this evening&mdash; not be killed off&mdash;so that committees of this House can examine its provisions and put in place a legally binding procedure, urgently needed to ensure that people coming to this country are treated as decent human beings, with appropriate dignity and respect.</P>
    <P>A final point I want to make before handing over to Deputy Sargent is that we must not ignore the fact that there is a major crisis of racism obtaining with the European Community.  This is a growing problem and the question of the EC developing a siege mentality is part and parcel of the present Government's reluctance to be open about how we deal with immigrants and asylum seekers.  It is a mistake to bury our heads in the sand on this issue because it is one which will not go away but which will worsen if we ignore it.  The experience in other parts of Europe has been that if one does not take active steps to create not only the legal framework to ensure that people are not discriminated against but also to provide the social framework and attitude, we shall be breeding problems for ourselves in the future.</P>
    <P>A number of years ago I was a member of a committee in the European Parliament on racism and xenophobia who made recommendations to all of the member states of the European Community on how that issue should be dealt with.  On the basis of questions I have tabled in this House, I understand that not a single recommendation of that committee has been implemented by this Government.  In fact, we are the only country that has not yet ratified the convention to ban all forms of discrimination based on race.  There is a whole range of <Col N="1546" /> issues needing to be addressed there.  Let us begin to address them this evening by giving this Bill a Second Reading, allowing Members of this House to examine it, tease it out, approve it, and to put on our Statute Books legal rights for the people who come seeking hospitality and the right to live here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Shatter, on introducing this Bill and for making an effort to drag us into the 21st century. I also wish to compliment Deputy Carey &mdash;who has left the House &mdash; who, for <Col N="1547" /> many years, played a leading role in fighting the cause of refugees refused entry at Shannon Airport.</P>
      <P>It is amazing that, on the one hand, people expressed pious platitudes and, on the other, informed us that they would not support the Bill.  Opposition Members who say they support the spirit of the Bill but that it has its flaws, are hypocritical in saying it cannot be amended on Committee Stage.  All Bills introduced in this House are amended on Committee Stage.  If there are flaws in the Bill, they can be easily corrected on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>It used to be said, in the words of Saint Augustine, &ldquo;Lord, make me pure but not just yet&rdquo;.  Now it is a question of &ldquo;Lord, give me a refugee Bill but not just yet&rdquo;. Why can the Bill not be accepted now and allowed to proceed to Committee Stage?</P>
      <P>It is appalling that people can talk about the needs of refugees and at the same time vote against the Bill.  Why should the Government introduce a Bill when the Opposition is prepared to do the work for it?  Indeed, why did the Government not introduce its own Bill years ago?  The Minister seems to think that in introducing this Bill Deputy Shatter is stepping on her corns.</P>
      <P>The Minister said Deputy Shatter would have us believe that there is a monopoly on compassion and understanding for the plight of refugees on his side of the House.  Did anyone ever hear such nonsense?  Deputy Shatter never suggested he had a monopoly on compassion and understanding but he has demonstrated by his actions that he has compassion and understanding for their plight.  In that statement the Minister showed that she was not prepared to seriously consider this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that this nation deserves the title &ldquo;Ireland of the Welcomes&rdquo; when wealthy visitors come to our shores but I am also sure that many of the refugees who have been given short shrift would not regard it in that way.  It is a pity we are in this position given that, as a nation, we have exported more of our people <Col N="1548" /> than any other country.  In John Mitchell's time people were transported, against their will, to Tasmania from where they escaped to Australia and rose to fame in the political world.  Even though they were refugees, they were accepted.</P>
    <P>Our emigrants, some of whom entered through Canada, have flooded the United States.  Our emigrants are working illegally all over the world and we are rightly prepared to defend them, if they get into trouble because we believe they should be treated fairly.  Yet, for some strange reason, we are under the impression that those who come here should not get the same reception.  I am sure after we qualify for the World Cup finals and people are refused visas to visit the United States there will be protests about the way our citizens were treated but this is only a minor detail.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with only one case in which a person was not allowed in.  One day while playing golf in the captain's prize, I received an urgent telephone call.  It transpired that a girl from the Philippines had been stopped at London Airport while on her way to Ireland to visit her relations.  When I raised the question as to why London was taking a stand in regard to people who wanted to travel to Ireland I was told that Ireland and England work hand in hand.  Ireland protects England in case people try to enter England through the back door and <i>vice versa</i>.  It is appalling that England influences the way in which we treat visitors or refugees.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter said that a young Chinese man spent seven months in jail.  The Minister in her speech tried to give the impression that nothing like that ever happens here.</P>
    <P>Chuir sé díomá orm nuair a chuala mé an Teachta Ó Cuív ag rá go bhfuil gach rud ceart in Éirinn.  Molaim an Teachta McDowell a thug fogha fiachmhar faoi agus a thaispeáin gur ráiméis a bhí á labhairt aige.  B'amhlaidh i gcás Teachtaí eile freisin.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter went on to say in his speech:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1549" /> Last November there were extraordinary scenes in Shannon Airport when a large number of Kurdish refugees were physically forced back on a plane flying to Canada.  Access to them by individuals concerned about their plight and who wished to ensure that they had access to legal help was denied by officials in Shannon and they were forced out of the country before their position could be independently clarified.</P>
    <P>I suppose the Minister is safe in saying that those people were not refused entry &mdash;they were just taken by the scruff of the neck and shoved back on a plane. Listening to some of the comments one would think that Deputy Shatter wanted to open the floodgates and allow every criminal and lunatic who wants to come here to enter.  He is merely suggesting that people should be given a fair crack of the whip, have a right of appeal and access to a translator.  It must be quite an ordeal for a stranger who cannot speak English to find himself in jail for seven months or longer; it is something he will always remember.  Deputy Shatter is asking us to be human and to show concern for those worse off than ourselves.</P>
    <P>With the exception of the Minister of State&mdash;I do not think any Minister would be as quick to accept a Bill introduced by the Opposition&mdash;I am not surprised that Fianna Fáil opposes this Bill but I cannot accept the fact that the Labour Party oppose it.  One of its members, now a Minister, used to go to South America at the drop of a hat to protect its people, for which he is to be admired, but the party is hypocritical in suggesting that a Bill will be introduced.  It should vote for the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello, who spoke a few minutes ago, earned fame for defending the rights of prisoners.  Who could be more important than a prisoner thrown into jail for seven months with no right of appeal?  How can Deputy Costello vote against this Bill when he has earned such a good name for the work he has done?</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Taking the line that a Bill from an Opposition party cannot be right is the greatest load of codswallop.  The fact that Deputy Shatter has succeeded in having two of his Bills accepted does not mean he should not be allowed to bring in a third.  The fact that he is right adds to his argument. Indeed, the Irish Refugee Council contradicts what the Minister said about people being deported against the ruling of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.  In one case a Kurdish asylum seeker who left Ireland before his deportation order could be carried out has been recognised in the United Kingdom as a refugee under the United Nations Convention.  What has pagan England got that Christian Ireland has not got?  In another documented case the applicants were refused refugee status and permission to remain in this country when the United Nations High Commission for Refugees had stated that they came within its mandate and should not be returned to their country of origin.  A deportation order was issued and two attempts were made to deport the family. Legal action had to be taken to obtain an injunction and the decision on granting asylum is currently under reconsideration in the Department of Justice.</P>

    <P>It is clearly evident that the claim that everybody is treated fairly is rubbish.  The Irish Refugee Council state further that on Wednesday, 17 February 1993 the Minister for Justice stated in the Dáil that the letter from the Department of Justice to the UNHCR of 1985 is a &ldquo;formal procedural agreement with UNHCR&rdquo; which &ldquo;has been found by the courts to be legally binding.&rdquo;  The first High Court decision which strengthens the legal status of the 1985 agreement was that of Mr. Justice O'Hanlon on 6 March 1992 <Col N="1551" /><i>Fakih and others v. the Minister for Justice.</i> The Department of Justice has lodged a notice of appeal to the Supreme Court in that case, contesting the rights of three Lebanese men who want to seek asylum in Ireland, and who have been in this country since late December 1991, to pursue their applications in accordance with that formal procedural agreement. Quite clearly we are going out of our way to oppose decisions made by the courts. I will quote one further example.  In February 1993 Mr. Justice Flood in the High Court found that the detention of a person was &ldquo;unfair, unreasonable and unjust.&rdquo;</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Let me repeat that this Bill drags us into the 21st century and shows that we have some humanity left, that we are not concerned only with what is happening far away from us where we are prepared to go to defend the downtrodden.  It gives us the opportunity to show that we think refugees who had a tough life in their own country should be allowed to remain here, if they are innocent enough to want to do so.  Those of us who believe that the refugees have got a raw deal have no choice but to vote for this Bill.  There is no point in talking about legislation at sometime in the future.  The Government has had years to bring in a Bill but it did not do so.  Deputy Shatter's Bill deserves the support of members who believe in freedom and human rights.</P>

I do not want to see people in my constituency being deported by this or any Government, as has happened in the past.  Does Deputy Shatter want this Bill <Col N="1555" /> defeated?  He is not the only person with an interest in this issue.

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the last contribution, <Col N="1557" /> it was a very sad one.  It is extraordinary that a Deputy, even a Labour Deputy would come into the House and behave in such a way.  I know what Deputy Ferris is trying to do and I will come to that later.</P>
      <P>This is a serious Bill with a serious intent.  It is not a party political measure and it is not politically or ideologically contentious.  It was designed to address a problem we all acknowledge exists and to ensure that people who seek political asylum here are treated with dignity, humanity and decency.  It was devised to ensure that people who land at our airports and other points of entry are not simply bundled back out of the State and transported to oppressive regimes from which they have come, thus placing their lives at risk.</P>
      <P>I deplore the fact that some Members have tried to cast aspersions on this Bill, suggesting we are engaging in political play-acting.  This is a legislative assembly and this measure is a serious one.  As Deputy Ferris acknowledged, when the Labour Party was in Opposition it saw fit to support two Private Members' Bills from this side of the House.  In fairness to the Progressive Democrats when that party was in Government it supported a Private Members' Bill to recognise foreign adoptions and in fairness to Fianna Fáil when it was in a minority Government and in Government with the Progressive Democrats it allowed two Private Members' Bills to go through the House.</P>
      <P>The change of atmosphere in this House is the consequence of Labour and Fianna Fáil in Government together, with a majority of 38.  This Government is intent on rolling over any legislative proposal put forward by the Opposition and on turning this House into an irrelevant debating Chamber instead of a legislative assembly.  The nonsense we have heard from Deputy Ferris is indicative of what we will, unfortunately, have to suffer in this House for the next number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill was intended to provide, by law, very basic protections for those seeking asylum.  It was intended to give statutory <Col N="1558" /> force to our international obligations under the 1951 United Nations convention on the protection of refugees and also to fill loopholes in the current procedures.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister for Justice and read her speech very carefully.  She said that all applications are currently processed in accordance with the agreement reached with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and that that has been always the case.  Other Deputies referred to that matter also, but that is simply not true.  Many people who land on our shores are bundled back on planes.  Last Tuesday evening I gave the Minister examples of such incidents, and not one Government Minister or Deputy denied that any of them took place. Indeed, Labour Deputies, who spoke somewhat more eloquently and with a great deal more knowledge than did Deputy Ferris, acknowledged that these incidents took place.</P>
    <P>The existing agreed procedures are simply not good enough.  Many of them have not been implemented there are loopholes that need to be addressed. For example, there is no procedure to guarantee that non-Government organisations such as Amnesty International and the Irish Refugee Council can become involved in determining whether a person should be given political refugee status. There is no obligation on the officials in the Department of Justice, or on the Minister, to take notice of information from either of these organisations or from any organisation, and there is no statutory appeals system.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister spoke in the House of the need for transparency &mdash; apparently acknowledging that we have some problems &mdash; and also of the need for public satisfaction with the way we operate our procedures.  On the same day, in a Dáil question I tabled I asked how many, if any, of the approximately 170 people from Bosnia we have accepted temporarily here, have applied for refugee status and whether, if they formally apply for political asylum, it would be granted.  I was told that matter was a <Col N="1559" /> secret.  Apparently, if I was told how many of the people who have come here from Bosnia seeking permanent refugee status by way of political asylum, it would endanger national security.  The same Minister came into the Dáil three hours later and acknowledged the need for transparency.</P>
    <P>Last week, commenting on this matter, the Minister wondered aloud as to whether a retired judge might be appointed to ensure existing procedures are fair &mdash; she mused that this is perhaps something we might do.  Things moved forward apace last night when the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, whom I suspect is deeply embarrassed by the Government's stance on this Bill, announced that the Minister for Justice now acknowledges the need for an appeals mechanism.  He stated that it is the Minister's intention to appoint immediately a retired judge to hear appeals.  However, he was not able to tell the House how such appeals would be dealt with, what rights the appellants would have, whether they would be legally represented, whether they would be given all the information available to the Department of Justice in the original decision-making process and would be allowed rebut it in an appeal and whether it would be a secret or a public procedure. This is something that was made up only last night and neither the Department nor the Minister can clarify what was said.  Of course we need a statutory appeals system with clear civil and legal rights attached to the person seeking to establish his right to political asylum. Such a statutory appeals system is provided for in the context of the Bill.</P>
    <P>We have also been told that an inter-departmental committee will examine the whole area.  None of us in this House was born yesterday.  It is not too long since the Minister, Deputy Quinn, and others in the Labour Party were on this side of the House.  We all know that if the Government wants to postpone addressing anything but wants to give an impression of concern, it sets up a committee.  A committee has been set <Col N="1560" /> up to consider the position of travelling families, a second to consider the position of the disabled and a third to consider the position of non-nationals seeking political status.  This is a Government governing by committee.  Every scintilla of policy allegedly contained in its programme is so vague that it has to set up committees to spend a few years trying to work out the nature of the commitment and how to implement it.</P>
    <P>Much play has been made of the Programme for Government which states:</P>
    <P>Our policy towards treatment of refugees, asylum seekers and immigrants will meet the highest international standards.  Procedures will be introduced to guarantee rights of hearings, appeal, access to legal advice and access to the courts.</P>
    <P>If the Government wants to provide all that, this Bill addresses every single one of those issues.  If it is concerned that any aspect of the Bill needs to be amended, Members of the House know, although people watching this debate may not realise it, that all Bills go through Committee and Report Stages where they are amended.  I made it very clear in my speech on this Bill &mdash; and it has been made clear on subsequent occasions&mdash; that I will be more than happy if the House does not divide tonight but accepts this Bill, completes Second Stage and goes into committee where we can take on board constructive amendments proposed by Government Members from Fianna Fáil or the Labour Party.  I do not mind taking on board amendments from any quarter if this Bill is allowed to provide the necessary protection.  That is what happens to all legislation coming through this House.  If it is recognised that there is need for reform there is no need to postpone it until a further committee examines the issue and tells us what is needed, we know what is needed.</P>
    <P>The numbers of emigrants from this country have been mentioned.  The manner in which we treat people who look for political asylum has been well described in this House.  Yesterday evening, in a very eloquent speech, <Col N="1561" /> Deputy Harney referred to the position of Marey al Gutrani who was not granted asylum and who spent some 17 months in one of our prisons.  Following an application to the High Court, Mr. Justice Flood ordered his release from prison describing his detention as unfair, unreasonable and unjust.  What Deputy Harney and I did not know when she delivered that speech &mdash; I wonder whether the Minister knows &mdash; was that last summer when this poor, unfortunate man was still in prison an attempt was made to have him transported to Libya. He was removed from one of our prisons, his hands taped behind his back and his legs taped.  He was put in a car driven by a State driver to be taken to Baldonnel airport and flown out of this country.</P>

      <P>If the dictatorship in the former Soviet Union behaved in that way we would have been outraged.  Does the Minister know about the event and that the man's removal was stopped because journalists were alerted to what was happening? If we learnt that the American authorities were treating Irish illegals the way we treat people who are seeking political asylum here, there would be riots outside the American Embassy.  The way we treat them is a disgrace.  This Bill gives us the opportunity to address the issue.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kemmy said last night that he had knowledge of what happened in Shannon with refugee applications, he talked about the urgent need for fair and just procedures and said that there was no need for this House to divide.  I agree with Deputy Kemmy.  The House is dividing only because the Government is unwilling to allow this Bill through simply because it is coming from the Opposition side of the House.  The cynicism of the Labour Party on this issue is nauseating. The Labour Party is betraying the commitments it made over the years to human and civil rights, promises to Amnesty International and to the Irish Refugee Council.  It is also betraying the party and its supporters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very enlightening to look at what <Col N="1562" /> the Labour Party said in the past about these issues.  Not long ago &mdash; 11 December 1992 &mdash; Deputy Quinn as Deputy Leader of the Labour Party corresponded with a member of Amnesty International.  Of course, the new Government had not been formed then. Deputy Quinn thanked the member of Amnesty International for his letter and good wishes and stated:</P>
    <P>I am very aware of the problem people seeking asylum have in trying to negotiate their position on our country. Over the years I have received many representations from individuals, who are still in our prisons, waiting for a decision to be taken on their applications.</P>
    <P>I enclose, for your information, copies of questions which I and other Deputies, have put down to the Minister for Justice on this matter.  If the Labour Party are part of a new Government this is one of the issues I will be spending some time working on.</P>
    <P>During the time in which the Minister will be working on it tonight, he will be working against providing protection.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; about ethics in Government.  This is an example of ethics in Government.  This is the party of change.  This is the party that wants to turn this House into a legislative assembly so that TDs work as legislators. This is an example.  When TDs on the Opposition side of the House try to engage in positive legislative politics, bringing forward reforming measures that apparently are acceptable to the Labour Party, the Labour Party vote against them because they come from the Opposition.  That is an example of ethics in Government.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party also believe strongly in freedom of information.  Does it believe that information regarding the number of people from Bosnia who sought political asylum &mdash; and whether the Government will grant it &mdash; should be a national secret.  Is that an example of freedom of information in action?  The tragedy is that this Bill has widespread support outside the House.  If the Labour Party was on this side of the House it would support this Bill.  It is being opposed simply because it was produced by an Opposition Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have now reached the stage in this House where it is not a question of change, we are now truly back to the future.  In the early days of this Government <Col N="1564" /> we have reached the position where it is an exercise in futility for any Member on this side of the House to bring forward positive legislative proposals to effect reform and change, regardless of whether they are politically contentious, because this Government intends to use its majority of 38 to vote against any Bill introduced on this side of the House. That is not the way we should be have as parliamentarians.  We are undermining this House as a legislative assembly, the cosmetic exercise of forming committees to make it look as if we have a reformed Dáil while not allowing Members of this House to act as legislators is something to which the general public will rapidly cotton on.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will say after this debate that it looked for a compromise but did not get it.  A compromise is not on offer because the compromise the Labour Party wants is for Fine Gael to drop this Bill.</P>
    <P>I thank all the Members of the Opposition parties on this side of the House who supported the Bill, namely, Democratic Left, the Progressive Democrats and the Green Party.  They with my colleagues in the Fine Gael Party very eloquently set out the reasons for the Bill. Let us have a compromise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for permitting me to raise this matter on the Adjournment. What we got yesterday from the Minister for Communications were not just changes in telephone charges but a mini-budget or, at least, phase two of the 1993 budget.  If this Government was true to its claim to openness these increases in telephone charges would have been announced here on budget day along with the 1 per cent income levy, the increase in VAT on clothing and the increase in hospital charges.  The Minister's attempts since then to represent as pro-consumer these changes in telephone charges which quadruple the cost of local calls&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true.  These changes will take £60 million out of the pockets of domestic consumers and disguise increases in VAT.  They are a deliberate attempt to pull the wool over the public's eyes, but it is not working and it is downright dishonest.</P>
      <P>The day when the telephone was considered a luxury is long gone.  In the modern world, it is a necessity.  Telephone ownership and use has grown steadily because Telecom Éireann has conducted an extensive advertising campaign urging people to get telephones and promoting their greater use.  However, those people who are now &ldquo;making that call&rdquo; are finding that in a couple of months' time they will be charged four times as much.</P>
      <P>In 1991 the total number of Telecom Éireann's customers increased by 7 per cent to almost £1 million and more than two-thirds of all households now have a telephone.  People do not always have discretion as to when they use the telephone. Many domestic calls must be made during normal business hours and these will now cost more.  As I pointed out yesterday, the pensioner wanting to contact the Department of Social Welfare, a parent wanting to telephone the school, a family wanting to talk to their doctor cannot leave these calls until after 6 o'clock in the evening or until the weekend, nor can the length of the call always be determined by the caller.  How many of us have made calls to firms or, indeed, to Government Departments, to be left holding on for interminable periods and then passed from section to section before the query can be dealt with?  Very few queries indeed will be dealt with within the period of three minutes.</P>
      <P>Much play has been made by the Minister of the reduction in charges for some calls.  The fact that a call to Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia or Taiwan is now going to be 51 per cent cheaper will be of little comfort to a widow living on her own who will now find the cost of a 15 minute chat with her friend or relative on the other side of the city jumping by an incredible 400 per cent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The imposition of an additional 10 per cent VAT rate is particularly severe and will wipe out any potential savings that may arise from some of the charges.  The VAT will apply not just to charges but also to line and equipment. I do not know what the average domestic telephone bill is, but I imagine that £60 or £70 for a two month period would <Col N="1569" /> be fairly typical.  The VAT increase will mean that a person with an average bill of £70 will have to find an additional £42 per year.  A person paying the full rate of tax would have to earn another £80 gross per year to cover the extra VAT alone.</P>
      <P>I accept that international charges are higher than the norm and that this has created problems for firms who trade on the international market and who have their headquarters abroad.  However, domestic consumers should not have to pick up the tab for providing lower charges for business.  For many decades the PAYE sector has had to subsidise tax breaks for the business and commercial sectors by paying crippling rates of income tax on wages and salaries.  Now it seems that domestic telephone users are being asked to provide a similar subsidy for communication charges for the business sector.</P>
      <P>It should also be realised that the main beneficiaries of the new charge structure will be the largest businesses.  The big increase in peaktime charges will create severe problems for many small businesses who rely heavily on the telephone, who would be making largely local calls and who must make them during the working day.  The reduced charges for international calls may make the larger firms more competitive; but will that be of any value if it puts smaller firms out of business?</P>
      <P>Finally, unlike Fine Gael, I do not believe that Telecom workers should be made the scapegoats for these new charges.  The workforce have made great sacrifices to turn Telecom around.  An annual loss of around £80 million has been transformed into annual profits of £80 million.  The waiting time for connections has been cut.  All of this has been achieved against a background of significant reductions in the workforce.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister has got the message loud and clear in the course of the day.  He should now respond to the widespread demand from the public to reverse the appalling decision he made yesterday to place such an intolerable burden on the shoulders of domestic telephone users.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to explain the revised telephone tariffs approved and announced by me yesterday.  I would like to say at the outset that the new tariff is not and will not result in sky high telephone bills for ordinary residential users.  The average bill after VAT will go up by only 4 per cent.  It is not a massive rake-off of the residential customers to subsidise industry&mdash;the average business bill will come down by 8 per cent &mdash; and it is not to bolster inefficiency in Telecom; Telecom will lose £15 million in revenue.</P>
      <P>This is about creating and protecting jobs; it is about becoming competitive and efficient; it is about reinforcing fairness and equality as between different user groups; above all, it is intended to give users more choice, more opportunity and more control to customers over their bills and costs.  Finally, it is to encourage the best use by all our citizens of a very costly investment in the national telephone system, an investment of £1,500 million.</P>
      <P>If we do not change our tariffs to meet today's conditions events will overtake us and cause severe damage.  This is apparent from what is happening in other countries. The savings that ensued to the national network operators as a result of economies in the transmission of international calls were not passed on to those making international calls but were in part used to subsidise local calls.  Deregulation, particularly in the US and Britain, has meant that operators were compelled to cut their charges to compete in a liberalised market.  The United Kingdom now has the lowest international charges in Europe, but this has lead to charges for local calls in the UK being levied at a rate of 17 pence for three minutes and being charged for at the rate of 57 seconds per unit by British Telecom and at six seconds by Mercury Communications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Liberalisation and modern technology are now making their effects known in Ireland and the effects are that Telecom Éireann's share of international traffic fell from the 50-50 share, which one <Col N="1571" /> would expect, to 40 per cent, and in the case of traffic between Ireland and Australia the Telecom Éireann share is only 30 per cent.  The loss of revenue to Telecom Éireann is currently running at £15 million cumulative per year.  Put simply, this means that in year one Telecom Éireann lost £15 million in revenue, in year two it lost £30 million and so on.</P>
    <P>This is obviously a situation which could not be allowed to continue.  If it were, we might rapidly come to a stage where there would be insufficient revenue from international calls to subsidise local calls, which would then have to increase.  This would not be in the interests of the consumer, Telecom Éireann or the nation.  Quite simply we have to act before this occurs.</P>
    <P>With the co-operation of Telecom Éireann, my Department has provided a package that protects the revenues of the company, provides international call charges that are competitive universally and close to those charged by British Telecom, which are the cheapest in Europe.  This has been done in a manner which will have the minimum adverse impact on subscriber's bills.  The average domestic subscriber will have an increase of 4 to 5 per cent on the bill &mdash; £3 per bill, £20 per year or 37 pence per week &mdash; without any alteration in the calling patterns to reduce costs.</P>
    <P>At this stage I would refer to some ill informed criticisms which have been made of the package.  Let me put the record straight.  Based on the accurate data at my disposal, almost 80 per cent of all local calls will be unaffected by the timing restrictions; more than 72 per cent of local calls made at peak periods will be unaffected; more than 97 per cent of local calls made at off peak periods will be unaffected; and the cost of all these calls is reduced to 9.5 pence basic tariff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Telecom Éireann has the technology in its itemised billing programme to allow it examine the bills of <Col N="1572" /> different categories of customer.  At my request various types of bills for the month of December 1992 were examined in detail and the average effect on each type of bill produced if the subscriber did not later his or her calling pattern in any way.  This examination confirmed that different categories of customer's bills did not show dramatic changes for residential users, small businesses or old age pensioners.</P>
      <P>Some of the media comments today give the impression that there will be outrageously high increases in bills, figures as high as 400 per cent have been headlined.  If this were likely to be the case does this House think that I and the Government would stand for it?  This is, of course, not the truth by any stretch of the imagination.  I have had a detailed and thorough examination carried out of the actual bills of various categories of customers to see what effect the new tariff would have on actual bills.  I am satisfied that the outcome will be within reason &mdash; some up, some down, but by moderate amounts.</P>
      <P>I can, of course, understand that people could have genuine misgivings about the impact of these changes on their telephone bills.  My concern, and indeed input into the changes proposed by Telecom, was to address such worries. The underlying facts about the pattern of telephone calls are a surprise to most people.  The facts, based on accurate recording of all telephone traffic, show quite clearly that consumers need not be unduly worried; in fact, with a small change in usage, most can reduce their own bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to assure all telephone users that the exaggerated stories put about based on highly selective situations do not present a true or accurate picture.  For example, it is true that the cost of a 15 minute peak call will increase from 11.17 pence to nearly 50 pence. That is for one call in 25.  The proponents of such stories do not tell the public that the cost of 20 out of the 25 calls will be reduced from 11.17 pence to 9.5 pence. The savings on this will almost wipe out <Col N="1573" /> the extra cost of the one call which is being highlighted.  That is the reason there will not be a grossly exaggerated increase for even those customers who make only local calls and do not benefit from substantial reductions in trunk and international calls.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>For those customers who make even a moderate number of trunk or international calls there are likely to be overall cost reductions.  Most customers do so at one time or another.  It may be a surprise to most people that, for example, of old age pensioners, who are perceived to be low users of the phone, 80 per cent make trunk and international calls.  They will benefit from the reductions in those categories leading to only minor changes in their overall bill.</P>
      <P>The wrong and misleading impression has been given by Deputy Gilmore again tonight that residential customers will be asked to pay £60 million to subsidise industry.  That is so far from the truth as to be ludicrous.  Residents will benefit from reduction of £21 million in international calls and £14 million in trunk calls including the new weekend specials, a total benefit of £35 million.</P>
      <P>They will pay, based on unchanged calling patterns, an extra £18 million on long duration local calls and not £33 million as put about, and £30 million in VAT now to be passed on by Telecom.  The overall net increase in bills is therefore £13 million for that category of customer, not £60 million, a net increase of under 4 per cent.  This is before any exercise of the choice and incentives now open to them to cut costs.  It is a discretion of customers to eliminate that 4 per cent increase by using the new incentives in the tariff system to shift a reasonable proportion of less essential calls from peak to off peak time.  I believe the vast majority of customers will seize that new opportunity not only to eliminate the small increase but, in fact, to reduce their bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During my discussions with Telecom Éireann I was very anxious to ensure that <Col N="1574" /> helplines such as the Samaritans will be able to continue to provide their services without clients having to worry about telephone charges.  I can advise Deputies that emergency calls to the Samaritans will continue to be made through contacting the Telecom Éireann operator.  I have also asked Telecom Éireann to enter into discussions with operators of other helpline type services with a view to ensuring that essential work is not disrupted and I want to see that free-phone numbers for such helplines are placed in the ordinary telephone directory rather than confining them to the Golden Pages in common with other free-phone services.  As the package approved by me yesterday will not come into effect until 1 September I will ensure that there will be no disruption of essential helplines under the new arrangement.</P>

      <P>While on the subject of helplines I would like to say that I welcome a news report on last evening's RTE news which stated that a spokesperson for the Childline helpline had welcomed the new tariffs as they would reduce the helpline's telephone bill without interfering in any way with the service provided.</P>
      <P>Much has been made of the fact that the time allowed for local calls has been reduced to three minutes.  I have shown that our local call charges are extremely favourable compared with those applying in the UK and Ireland will, after the implementation of this package, still have the seventh cheapest local call charges in Europe, based on a three minute call, while at the same time having competitive international call charges.</P>
      <P>The principle that those who use a facility must pay according to their usage must be applied to telecommunications charges as in other areas of business.  That is why I refused to allow an increase in connection or rental charges as it is not related to use.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Last weekend a story was published in our newspapers which made it clear that a victim of sexual assault over a number of years was being harassed by way of letters coming out of the prison system from the person who had been prosecuted and convicted for sexual assault and sexual abuse.  It is grossly unacceptable that persons convicted of sexual offences should be free to send threatening and intimidating letters to their victims while imprisoned and that no action is taken by the prison authorities, even when such letters are first seen by them.</P>
      <P>Rule 63 under the Prisons Act, states: &ldquo;If the contents are objectionable&rdquo;&mdash; that is the contents of a letter &mdash;&ldquo;it shall not be forwarded or the objectionable part shall be reased according to discretion&rdquo;. That rule applies to the censorship system that operates within our prisons in regard to correspondence being sent by prisoners while imprisoned.</P>
      <P>It seems that that rule has now been watered down to the effect that if correspondence is sent out of our prisons which details matters that might affect the security of the prison, the prison authorities will interfere in that correspondence, but if that correspondence contains other matter that is objectionable, nothing is done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Minister is familiar with the nature of the correspondence which received widespread publicity.  I do not wish to detain the House by repeating what was contained in it but suffice to say that the correspondence was objectionable on its face.  One of the letters that came out of the prison and which was delivered to the home of this victim of sexual abuse for many years had the <Col N="1576" /> prison stamp on it.  It had been examined by the prison censors and had gone through the system.  The letter should have immediately resulted in bells of alarm being rung in the mind of the person reading it.  It was clearly a letter that could do nothing but cause distress and upset to the recipient having regard to the background relating to that prisoner's sentence.  I find it difficult to understand why that letter was let out of our prison system.</P>
    <P>The State has a duty to ensure that all necessary protection is given to the victims of sexual assault and indeed other crimes.  Immediate steps should be taken by the Minister to ensure that no further correspondence comes out of our prisons such as the letters recently received by the incest victim from Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>We need legislation which will make it a criminal offence for any person convicted of a crime to send threatening, intimidating or harassing communications to either the victim of their offence or to persons who gave evidence at their trial.  In dealing with the area of sexual offenders I do not believe either of those two remedies are of themselves sufficient.  It is correct to say that the Whitaker report recommended that we bring to an end the censorship of correspondence coming out of our prisons. Perhaps the theory as opposed to the realities of life have impinged on us in this area with regard to that recommendation in the light of what took place and what was publicised over the weekend in this case.</P>
    <P>The problem with sexual offenders sentenced to terms of imprisonment is that too frequently they do not understand the enormity of their behaviour, they do not understand or comprehend the impact it has had on their victim and they do not understand the fear their victim still has of them following their sentence to imprisonment.  Too many victims of sexual offences who give evidence in court and find that the people they have given evidence against are convicted continue to live in fear of what will happen when the person sentenced to the term of imprisonment is released from <Col N="1577" /> prison.  That fear can be greatly exacerbated by the type of correspondence sent in this case.</P>
    <P>The great failure of the Government is that it did not provide a proper, coherent, comprehensive treatment system for sexual offenders.  The pilot scheme in Arbour Hill Prison was effectively shut down by the Minister's predecessor almost two years ago.  When I raised that matter in this House one year ago I was told by the then Minister for Justice that a committee was being formed to examine the matter to see what could be done.  As I understand it to this day we do not have a proper treatment system for sexual offenders, a system which ensures services are available so that the person convicted learns to understand the enormity of their behaviour, its impact on their victim and ensures that on release from prison they are not a threat either to previous victims or to other people.</P>
    <P>The Minister should tell us this evening what she is doing in this regard other than forming committees.  If we are to ensure that future correspondence of this nature, and other behaviour that gives rise to alarm on the part of victims, does not occur it is essential we have a comprehensive treatment system within our prison service.  In the context not just of sexual crimes but also other violent crimes it is also important that we have legislative change which creates a new criminal offence also in this area.</P>
    <P>The State must act so that those who commit crimes such as the crime in this case cannot continue even while in prison to make the lives of their victims a misery. The Minister has a duty to ensure that that is the case.  I hope she will be able to tell us this evening of specific action being taken as opposed to the deliberations of any committee that may have been formed or which might be formed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn) Máire Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the long standing practice of the Department of Justice not to comment on the circumstances of individual prisoners.  I propose, therefore, to confine my remarks as far as possible to <Col N="1578" /> censorship of correspondence within prisons generally.</P>
      <P>Censorship of letters to or from prisoners is provided for in the Rules for the Government of Prisons, 1947.  Rule 59 (1) states:</P>
      <P>Communications between prisoners and their relatives or respectable friends by visits and letter may be allowed ... subject to restrictions imposed for the maintenance of discipline and order in the prisons.</P>
      <P>Rule 63 states:</P>
      <P>Every letter to or from a prisoner shall be read by the Governor or other responsible officer deputed by the Governor and initialled by him, and if the contents are objectionable, it shall not be forwarded, or the objectionable part shall be erased, according to discretion ...</P>
      <P>The power given in Rule 63 is wide and is certainly sufficient to confiscate correspondence which clearly would cause distress to the recipient.  The reality is, however, that censoring officers may be expected to have regard primarily to the maintenance of discipline and order in prisons and to the tendency in recent years to move away from strict censorship. In the open centres and training unit, for example, censorship is not normally part of the regime.  Moreover, the Whitaker report, as Deputy Shatter rightly states, recommended at paragraph 7.23: &ldquo;that as a general rule prisoners' mail should not be screened and-or censored except where, in the judgment of the Prison Governor, this is essential to good order and security&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a case where discipline and order in the prison is not compromised and where the intended recipient is a close relative of the sender, a censoring officer is presented with the difficult choice of censoring the letter even though a close relative is involved, or allowing the letter to issue on the basis either that the recipient does not have to read it or that the recipient would be free to tell the governor that further letters of that kind should be stopped.  Having said all of that &mdash; and <Col N="1579" /> again without commenting on the circumstances of any particular case &mdash; I think it is evident that the widespread unease which responsible people have voiced in recent days concerning the issue of threatening letters by prisoners to their victims needs to be addressed and I propose to do that.</P>
    <P>This is by no means an easy matter to deal with because one has to have regard not only to the rights of victims but also to the rights of offenders to communicate with people on the outside.  It is necessary also to take account of the reality that the manner in which some offenders communicate might be considered by people of different background to be threatening or offensive where neither threat nor offence is intended.</P>
    <P>Complex issues arise also, for example, where the offender and his victim have a family and the offender communicates with their children in a manner which while not in any way intimidating to the children may still be quite distressing to the victim.</P>
    <P>While it is not possible to cover all the situations that may arise by introducing a single rule of practice, I have decided that straight away we should provide that victims in sexual abuse cases should have the option of saying whether they wish to receive correspondence from the offender.</P>
    <P>That option, on its own, however, might prove a little too stark in certain cases because correspondence from the offender can contain a mixture of threat, which the victim clearly does not wish to receive, and other information they might need to know.  I would, therefore, envisage that victims might also be given the option of having correspondence from the offender forwarded, with the offender's permission, to a friend nominated by the victim who could keep her informed of matters of which she might need to know.  These arrangements will be put in place quickly.  In the meantime I should say that the flow of correspondence from offender to victim in the case which gave rise to this debate has been stopped.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1580" /> With regard to telephone calls from prisoners to people on the outside, the position is that all such calls are made in the presence of senior staff in the prison who place the call and check that the intended recipient is prepared to talk to the prisoner.  In other words, there is already a degree of protection in this regard.</P>
    <P>Having looked at this situation carefully over the past few days I would have to say that while the changes I have just announced should certainly improve matters, there is no way of guaranteeing absolutely that people who have been victims will never come to know of threats that may be made by offenders. Threats can be conveyed in the course of visits or through third parties such as ex-prisoners. It is necessary to bear in mind too that it is by no means inevitable that knowledge of threats would be detrimental to the longer term interests of a victim.  It could be very important in a case where an offender is coming to the end of his sentence that his victim should know of any threats he may have made while in custody.  In any case where a victim does become aware of the expressed intentions of an offender, it is, of course, vitally important that the Garda be informed so that they can take the necessary precautions when the offender is about to be released.</P>
    <P>I hope that the arrangements I am putting in place, a Cheann Comhairle, will allay the public unease which has been expressed on this issue.  In the course of what I have said, however, I have made no bones about the fact that there are no simple solutions, because I think it is important that the House and the public should know of the difficulties involved.</P>
    <P>One final point I would like to make is that I am extremely conscious of the difficulties which the process of censoring letters can pose for prison staff, who already have a tough job on their hands. Over the past few days I have become aware of the detailed circumstances of the particular case which gave rise to public unease and I can say that nobody in possession of all the details could reasonably suggest that the prison staff <Col N="1581" /> concerned had failed to perform their duties properly.  I hope that the new arrangements I have put in place will be of assistance not only to victims but to prison staff also in dealing with these difficult situations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Deasy.  I intend no disrespect to the Ministers present but I am disappointed there is no representative from the Department of Finance here. However, I hope the Minister will convey my important comments to the relevant people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economic wellbeing of the south-east is dependent on what happens in the next round of Structural Funds.  In the past few years, among the seven regions, the south-east received the worst treatment in terms of the spend per region.  It was substantially lower for the south-east than for the other regions.  There is no economic basis for that.  It cannot occur in the next round of Structural Funds. It will be unacceptable.  There is deep concern among the industrial and commercial communities and the public in Waterford city and county and throughout the south-east region in this regard. Two projects have been put forward for a number of years that are crucial to the development of the south-east.  One of those is the construction of a second river crossing in Waterford.  The city cannot survive and the economic area cannot develop if that infrastructure is not put in place.  The Minister is aware that the premier European lo-lo port is being created in Waterford at present.  It is vital that the necessary infrastructure to meet the requirements of the load for that port is put in place.  Otherwise the economic position of Waterford and its status as capital of the south-east will deteriorate. That structure is supported by all counties in the south-east and is recognised in the sub regional review committee's submission on the national plan as a vital infrastructural development to service the south-east.  The road network in the <Col N="1582" /> south-east is a national carrying route. The Euro-route through Waterford carries goods from all over Ireland to this port.  Without this infrastructure the port will not develop at the rate it should.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware of numerous reports in regard to the lack of third level facilities in the south-east.  Numerous meetings have taken place with the Department of Education in regard to a university to be located in Waterford. If we do not receive funding for those infrastructural developments there will be a deterioration in the economic wellbeing to the detriment of Waterford city and county and the south-east as a whole.  It is time that the south-east was fully recognised and re-established as a crucial entity in the national economic development of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Cullen for allowing me to share his time.  It is regrettable that the Minister for Finance and his junior Minister are not here.  I hope our views will be conveyed to the Minister and his senior officials.  The people of Waterford feel strongly about the neglect of recent years in regard to the allocation of Structural Funds.  They regard their city, <i>urbs intacta,</i> as the forgotten city. What we are asking tonight is not exceptional. We are asking for a fair share of Structural Funds, no more and no less. In the last allocation there was a huge imbalance and the south-east were allocated much less proportionately than other regions of the country.  Our greatest concern is that the infrastructure in Waterford be raised to the same level as other parts of the country, whether Cork, Limerick or Galway.  We want to see the road from Dublin to Waterford brought up to a reasonable standard.  The last 30 miles stretch of the road from Gowran in County Kilkenny to Waterford city is a disgrace.  Little or not work has been carried out on that road, the N9, for the past 40 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The railway line from Dublin to Waterford also needs to be upgraded.  At present the fastest train trip from Waterford to Dublin takes two hours and 25 minutes.  A comparable trip on the Dublin-Cork <Col N="1583" /> line takes over an hour less.  I believe it would be possible to reduce the train journey from Dublin to Waterford by one hour if the standard of the line was sufficiently good, which is not the case at present.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Cullen said, a second bridge over the River Suir in Waterford city is urgently required.  The proposals in this regard have been with the Department of the Environment and the Department of Finance for approximately seven years.  I should like to see these proposals implemented.  Waterford city will be strangled with traffic if the present bridge has to cater for the heavy, industrialised traffic which comes from Rosslare and Belview Port.</P>
    <P>We demand proper infrastructural facilities for Waterford.  If we have the necessary infrastructure we will look after ourselves from there on in.  As I said, we are not looking for any special treatment; all we want is a fair crack of the whip.  We also need funds for the completion of the ring road in Waterford. The Dunmore approach into the city is strangled by traffic due to the fact that the road system, which is only partially completed, is inadequate.  It is a disgrace that the entire road cannot be completed. While I would not say that the money spent to date has been wasted, it has not been maximised as it should have been and it will not be maximised in the proper way until the ring road is completed.</P>

      <P>At the outset I wish to apologise on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, who is unable to attend in the House to reply to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current Community Support Framework for EC Structural Funds will expire at the end of 1993.  The preparation of a new national development plan, which will form the basis of negotiation with the EC Commission on the next Community Support Framework for the post-1993 period, is under way.  Considerable work has been undertaken to <Col N="1584" /> date both within Government Department and State agencies and by the many other groups and organisations with an interest in this area.</P>
    <P>In May 1992 the seven sub-regional review committees set up to review implementation of the Structural Funds were formally invited to make submissions containing their views on the content and strategy of the next plan, CSF and operational programmes in so far as they would affect each sub-region. Funding was provided to the committees to employ consultants to assist in the preparation of their submissions and to hold briefing seminars to which interested groups in the sub-region were invited.  The review committees forwarded their submission to the Department of Finance in October and November of last year.  These submissions are being examined by the Department and have also been circulated to other relevant Departments so that they can be taken fully into account in the planning work under way.</P>
    <P>The south-east submissions set out a development strategy to build on the subregion's strength and address its disadvantages with a view to ensuring the best contribution towards sustainable employment and growth.  The submissions draw particular attention to deficiencies in the areas of transport, communications and sanitary services infrastructure.  Specific projects mentioned, such as the high level bridge, have been referred to the relevant Ministers for consideration in drawing up sectoral proposals.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Finance with particular responsibility for the National Development Plan met the different committees, including the South-East Committee, to discuss their submissions.  In the light of the large demands in relation to funds likely to be available, the committees were asked to identify their key priorities.  The additional submission from the south-east on these priorities has now been received and it includes particular priorities in relation to infrastructure and makes specific reference to the needs of <Col N="1585" /> Waterford city, including the high level bridge.</P>
    <P>In addition to the submissions from the sub-regional review committees there are other inputs into the planning process. Government Departments were asked to prepare proposals in relation to their various sectors.  In May 1992 the social partner organisations represented on the Central Review Committee were invited to make submissions on their views on the content and strategy of the next plan, community support framework and operational programmes.  The Chambers of Commerce of Ireland and the Council for the Status of Women were also invited to make submissions.  Submissions have been received and are being examined in detail in the various Departments concerned with a view to taking them into account in the preparation of the plan.</P>
    <P>A number of other organisations have made submissions on their views in relation to the content of the next plan and/or have met departmental officials to discuss their views.  A group of consultants led by the ESRI were engaged in early October to carry out an evaluation of the CSF 1989-93 and to make recommendations for strategies and priorities for the next national development plan.  Discussions are ongoing with the EC Commission on the strategic choices and priorities as perceived by them and on the strengthening of material in relation to evaluation and indicators.</P>
    <P>We have agreed with Northern Ireland that a joint co-operative approach should be incorporated in both our plans.  The Department of Finance and the Northern Ireland Department of Finance and personnel have held a number of meetings to discuss how this concept can best be advanced.  Other relevant Departments North and South have been in contact with each other in order to identify where their proposals contain complementary elements or elements which can be implemented on a joint basis.  These interdepartmental contacts are continuing.</P>
    <P>In the light of the various consultations and inputs the Government is now preparing <Col N="1586" /> the draft national development plan with a view to finalising its work around the end of June.  The central objective of the Government will be the creation of sustainable employment and growth.  In this context the Government is very anxious that the measures chosen will tackle the particular problem of long term unemployment.  In selecting the strategies that best meet these objectives the focus will have to be on the long term return to the economy from the investments included and on getting the best value for money possible.</P>
    <P>The demands for the funds from the various Departments amount to more than double any likely funds available. If one adds the demands from various groups, it is clear that very difficult choices will have to be made in choosing the optimal mix of investments for inclusion in the final plan.  In finalising the plan the Government will seek to ensure balanced regional development. The needs of Waterford and the south-east, as set out in detail in the sub-regional committee's submission, along with the needs of other areas throughout the country, will be fully taken into account.</P>

I was fortunate enough to be given permission by the Ceann Comhairle to raise this matter on the Adjournment last night, but within minutes of the debate I was requested to withdraw the matter on the basis that there had been some mix-up within the Department of Health and I was given an assurance that the Minister would be present in the House tonight to reply to the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not casting any reflection on the Minister of State at the Department of Justice.  This matter is the <Col N="1587" /> responsibility of the Minister for Health and he should be in the House to reply to it.</P>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  Of all the various types of mental handicap, autism is probably one of the most unfortunate and difficult handicaps.  Thankfully, it is not a common condition.  Approximately four or five per ten thousand of the population suffer from autism and three to four times more boys suffer from the condition than girls.  Autism is an extremely complex syndrome where all functions are impaired.  The autistic person is generally healthy and attractive, but with little or no speech, withdrawn, apathetic and unresponsive.  An autistic person generally shows a very strong resistance to change, a disinterest in people and surroundings and a great interest in inanimate objects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many mentally handicapped people are happy in themselves, but unfortunately this is not the case with autistic people.  These people experience considerable sleeping difficulties, are interested in little or no play, and have repetitive movements such as rocking, head banging and spinning.  They are extremely hyperactive and subject to very great fears.  These fears may be irrational, but they are very real to the sufferers.  They have very poor, if any, eye contact, are extremely unpredictable and their behaviour is destructive.  They are afraid of emotion and are very prone to hitting out at themselves and others if not managed properly.  They are a danger to themselves and others and create severe pressure for all around them. These people feel a tremendous sense of isolation.  That in itself is a formidable chronicle of the behaviour of the classic autistic.  Autistics need a very specific, structured lifestyle where boundaries are set, where every little thing is predictable and happens in sequence and, therefore, their world is ordered and makes sense to them.  Unless they get this type of specific programme and routine the consequences are catastrophic for the parents <Col N="1588" /> who are prisoners in their own home, for the other children in the family whose physical well-being is definitely in danger and for the autistic person whose behavioural problems will be unleashed in full unless they are properly catered for.</P>
    <P>Caleb Pratt will be 18 on 26 June next. He no longer attends school at St. Brid's, Castlebar, because the school could not cope with him; he wrecked the place.  I exonerate the school from any blame, indeed the opposite is the case, it did a marvellous job with limited resources.  At present Caleb is in crisis at St. Eithne's Home in Foxford.</P>
    <P>Even if Caleb could return to school, officially he becomes a school leaver on 26 June when he will be 18.  Literally, there is nothing for Caleb beyond this respite or crisis management after 14 May.  This is because the Western Care Association, which offers a range of excellent services to 400 people with mental handicap in County Mayo, has a budget shortfall of £412,000 in 1993.  The immediate result, according to the Western Care Association, is that there will be a serious cutback giving rise to severe hardship for clients and parents and the loss of approximately 30 jobs.  This vital respite-crisis arrangement that Caleb now enjoys will go on or soon after 14 May.  This arrangement is only possible through the Western Care Association's finite funding arrangement.  It has had to borrow and get further into debt to provide this crisis relief service.</P>
    <P>In blunt terms, we are talking about money.  The Western Care Association receives the bulk of its money from the Western Health Board which is funded by the Department of Health.  The Western Health Board is working with a £2.5 million shortfall in what it requires to hold even acute hospital services at 1992 levels.  In such situations the vulnerable, the weak and minorities are the first to be caught in the crush.</P>
    <P>If Caleb is returned to his family the pressure, trauma and domestic situation will be intolerable.  These parents and the parents of other autistics in County Mayo have a fundamental, moral, social and <Col N="1589" /> constitutional right to a proper level of service in accordance with the needs of their children.  If the proven and successful care and service is withdrawn from Caleb and from the other autistics in a similar situation then the State will be guilty of gross negligence in relation to its obligations to these children, teenagers and adults.</P>
    <P>Caleb is classically autistic: he has a high IQ, no speech and excellent comprehension. He has catastrophic behavioural problems and is given to regular bouts of tantrums.  He is unable to function except in the Foxford centre where the system suits him and where his needs are catered for in a very specific environment.  Away from Foxford he is violent, destructive, wrecks, breaks, roars and screams continually.  I know his family and that this situation, as the House will appreciate, makes them feel under siege.  It is under such severe pressure that, in the words of the parents, &ldquo;we can no longer continue to cope&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister provide an adequate level of humane care for Caleb and his colleagues?  I am pleading that an ongoing day or residential specialised placement in a specific location where a proper structured programme and environment will prevail, such as in Foxford, will not be provided on an <i>ad hoc</i>, temporary or short term basis but on a proper structured and definite footing in the appropriate proven environment.  I want the anxiety lifted from the shoulders of these parents and the constitutional rights of their children guaranteed.  I am asking for an adequate level of service, nothing more, nothing less, to be provided and for money to be made available, I hope by way of announcement tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I apologise to Deputy Higgins and the House for the absence of the Minister for Health who was called away unexpectedly and who asked me to stand in for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Higgins said, it is a question of money.  Today, I received a deputation from the Association of Parents and <Col N="1590" /> Friends of Mentally Handicapped Children in the Mid-Western Health Board area.  Therefore, the Deputy should not imagine for one moment that these problems are confined to his own health board area.  Indeed, the statistics show that apart from one other area fewer places are needed in his health board area than in any other health board area in the country.  The provision of services for people with a mental handicap or autism in County Mayo is in the first instance a matter for the Western Health Board and it is also a matter for the board to determine the level of funding required for the maintenance of those services. Services for people with autism in County Mayo are provided by the Western Care Association with financial assistance from the Western Health Board.</P>
    <P>The child in question was until recently attending St. Brid's special school in Castlebar and was due to finish school in June.  For various reasons he was unable to attend school in recent weeks and has been provided with respite care, as required, at the Western Care Association's centre in Foxford, County Mayo.</P>
    <P>Crisis relief is regarded as an essential element of services for people with a mental handicap or autism and every effort is made to ensure that the needs of families in emergencies are met.  There are facilities for day care at the Western Care Association in addition to respite care and day care facilities at Arus Attracta, Swinford, County Mayo.  The facilities at Arus Attracta have been offered as an option to the family in question.</P>
    <P>A discussion paper on the care of persons with autism has been prepared by my Department and circulated for comment to the health boards and organisations and individuals with an interest in autism, including the Western Care Association.  My Department is awaiting a response to the paper which will form the basis for the preparation of a national policy on autism.  A development plan for the provision of services specifically for children and adults with autism has also been prepared by the association and <Col N="1591" /> is being examined by the Western Health Board.</P>
    <P>I would also like to point out that the Western Care Association is a voluntary agency and responsibilty for funding under section 65 of the Health Act, 1953, rests with the Western Health Board.  I was acutely aware from an early date of the funding difficulties of Western Care and I have taken up this specific issue with the chairman and chief executive <Col N="1592" /> officer of the board.  My understanding is that discussions are ongoing between the board and the association but I have been given an assurance by the chief executive officer of the board that no existing mental handicap service will be reduced or discontinued.  I hope that there will be an early resolution of this problem.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 13 May 1993.</P>

      <P>The one-stop-shop concept is a service providing customers with ready local access to the full range of social welfare services.  During my years as Minister for Social Welfare I have taken steps whenever I could to advance this development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have initiated a series of changes forming the basis for one-stop-shops. This series of changes is fully supported by the Programme for a Partnership <Col N="1408" /> Government.  My objective is a modern, co-ordinated, well-administered service at local level evolving into a comprehensive local service.</P>
    <P>A vital prerequisite for this comprehensive service is an office improvement programme.  Significant investment has been made in improving social welfare premises over the past few years and very good new local offices are coming on stream.  I will be opening a new office in Kilkenny in a few weeks time.  Other new offices are under construction and future developments are under consideration. These offices address the needs of both customers and staff and will facilitate the changes I have in mind. Many of the new offices are located in Government office complexes.  In these a broad range of State services, including training and job placement, are very conveniently situated beside each other.</P>
    <P>One of my main priorities as Minister for Social Welfare is to introduce a pro-active, work supportive programme providing a range of opportunities for unemployed people.  In this regard I would like to inform Deputies that I have received the go ahead from the Government for a major new initiative which will help identify local opportunities and new outlets for unemployed people who want to improve their skills, avail of options to participate in their community's activities and gain work experience.  I propose to appoint a jobs facilitator in each of my Department's main offices (50).  The jobs facilitator will be charged with the responsibility of seeking out new options for unemployed people through voluntary organisations which provide services for people with disabilities and need assistance with their work; community enterprise and local development projects, particularly those promoting our indigenous resources and local enterprise business projects which can provide practical experience for people.</P>
    <P>Another important feature to which I am giving emphasis is the question of accessibility for the physically challenged. I have appointed officers in each region who will give attention to this.</P>
    <P>There is already close co-operation <Col N="1409" /> between my Department and FÁS and I will be ensuring that this develops further. Computer display units giving details of FÁS placement opportunities are in a number of my Department's offices on a pilot basis.  This summer I am launching a jobs opportunity scheme for third-level students using the regional structure I established in 1991.  This scheme will provide financial support for sponsors in the public and voluntary sectors who give work to third-level students during the summer.</P>
    <P>My Department already operates modern computer technology.  Further development and extension of this technology is critical to the development of the Department's one-stop-shop services. All the large local offices, with one exception, are computerised.  This means that over 60 per cent of unemployed cases are now managed using new systems. Computers also support all pension, child benefit and disability benefit claim processing. Recently, I set the end of 1994 as the target for completion of the remaining offices.  New computer facilities coming on stream next year will include, for the first time, facilities supporting supplementary welfare allowance payments.  This will allow both the Department and the health boards to provide a more co-ordinated service.</P>
    <P>My Department is changing the service for unemployed people and is introducing a variety of new ways of paying entitlements.  This major change includes a special development programme in An Post offering customers pay-methods best suited to their situation.  Unemployed people are now paid by way of cheques, electronic fund transfers, books of pension-type orders and postal drafts. These changes enable less frequent signing for unemployment payments, e.g. fortnightly, monthly or at other intervals. Automated facilities in post offices also provide a household budget option allowing customers to pay certain bills directly.</P>
    <P>The significance of the new payment arrangements is that the local offices can now evolve more rapidly to the one-stop-shop model offering a full range of services. Some offices already have in-house <Col N="1410" /> interview facilities for customers so that many claims can be processed on-the-spot.</P>
    <P>It is worth mentioning that in parallel with the service changes, I am also improving the control systems to ensure that the schemes are not abused.  The provision of an enhanced localised service requires a matching improvement in the capability and capacity to prevent abuse and to detect fraud.</P>

      <P>Discussions are taking place between officials of my Department and the Southern Health Board with a view to putting arrangements in place to have rent and mortgage supplements paid to social welfare clients at local offices.  Progress on these arrangements will be monitored closely by my Department with a view to considering extension of any arrangements which prove to be successful to other local offices of my Department.</P>
      <P>In order to minimise inconvenience for clients who must attend at health centres for payment of rent or mortgage supplements, monthly payment has been introduced, where possible, by health boards.  In a number of areas, rent or mortgage payments are posted to clients. These initiatives, which continue to be developed, have reduced significantly the frequency of attendance at health centres for the clients involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is also currently designing a new computerised system which will integrate all short term payments including supplementary welfare allowance.  This new system will enable multiple payments, such as those referred <Col N="1411" /> to by the Deputy, to be made to recipients. It will be introduced on a pilot basis in late 1994.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme operated by my Department was introduced in 1967 with the aim of encouraging elderly people to remain active in the community. The scope of the scheme was broadened to include incapacitated people in 1977 when it was extended to recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance.</P>
      <P>I recognised that many disabled person's maintenance allowance recipients, especially those suffering from mental handicap, were not getting any real benefit from having free travel passes because they were unable to travel alone. Accordingly, I introduced in 1990 a companion pass for the benefit of disabled person's maintenance allowance recipients who were certified to be unable to travel alone.  The companion pass is a special version of the free travel pass which enables a companion to travel free with the pass-holder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I introduced a further improvement in the 1991 budget whereby disabled person's maintenance allowance recipients entering residential care would retain their companion pass notwithstanding the fact that they had ceased to be disabled person's maintenance allowance recipients.  Furthermore, the 1992 budget provided for the restoration of free travel passes to persons in residential care who had been disabled person's maintenance allowance recipients before going into care and who had been obliged under the old rules to give up their passes.  The effect of these measures is that free travel <Col N="1412" /> passes are now retained by those in residential care who had been entitled to them when they were in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance.</P>
    <P>I recently extended, with effect from June 1, the free travel companion pass to include people on invalidity pensions who are confined to wheelchairs.</P>
    <P>Any further extension of the free travel scheme to accommodate additional groups would have financial implications and could only be considered in the light of available resources.  I will consider the category of persons referred to by the Deputy in the context of any further extension of the free travel scheme which may arise in the future.</P>

      <P>Free travel under my Department's scheme is available to all people in the State who are 66 years and over and to certain incapacitated people who <Col N="1413" /> are in receipt of a social welfare type payment in respect of their incapacity. The free travel pass issued under the scheme is normally valid only in respect of the pass-holder.  However, in the case of a married couple, where one partner qualifies for a free travel pass the other partner may travel free when accompanying the pass-holder.</P>
      <P>In 1990 I introduced the free travel companion pass which is aimed primarily at incapacitated people who are unable to travel alone and who would otherwise be unable to benefit under the free travel scheme.  The companion pass is a special version of the free travel pass which enables a companion to travel free with the pass-holder.  In such cases the companion may be any one who is over 16 years of age.</P>
      <P>Free travel companion passes are available to people in receipt of blind pension from my Department or a disabled person's maintenance allowance from the health board.  Companion passes are also available to people who were in receipt of such payments but who had to give them up because they are now in receipt of old age pensions or because they are now in residential care.  Consequently, incapacitated single people in that category already benefit from the companion pass.  As I announced last month, companion passes will also be available from next month to people who are in receipt of invalidity pensions and who are wheelchair-bound.</P>
      <P>Any further extension of the companion pass to groups not already covered would have financial implications which could only be considered in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 19, 31, 36, 50 and 53 together which are all identical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1415" /> I have seen the report in question, and I was particularly pleased to note its finding that two-thirds of respondent firms expect to either maintain current employment levels or take on additional staff in 1993.  Given that the survey was undertaken in January 1993, a particularly turbulent time for business, this is a very positive response on the issue of employment.</P>
    <P>The replies in relation to PRSI need to be seen in context.  Firms were asked to rank in order of preference which, if any, of a number of measures would allow them to recruit additional staff.  The options included reduced PAYE and PRSI, and employment subsidies.  Many firms left this question unanswered or commented that these changes would be of little relevance, given the weakness of domestic and international markets and the volatility of interest rates.  Since the time of the survey, there have been distinct signs of improvement in the economy and, in particular, a fall in interest rates.  This will be of considerable help to firms' job creation efforts.</P>
    <P>In relation to employers' PRSI, I must point out that any reduction would be very expensive.  Each percentage point reduction would cost £85 million annually. Any such reduction would, therefore, need to be carefully considered. It is by no means certain that such a reduction would lead to a net increase in employment.  While the firms who got the benefit of the reduction might increase their employment, the funds needed to pay social welfare payments would then have to be found elsewhere in the economy, and that could have the effect of reducing employment elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, a PRSI reduction would not necessarily be well targeted on those firms experiencing difficulties in retaining or creating jobs; some of the expenditure could go on increased profits, rather than increased employment.</P>
    <P>I will continue to keep the situation under review.  Any reduction in PRSI could only be examined in a budgetary context.  Furthermore, given the financial implications of such a move, a change <Col N="1416" /> could only be considered if it were clear that, overall, there would be a tangible and beneficial effect on employment.</P>

      <P>I have always given a high priority to the quality of service provided by my Department.  Improved service includes the elimination of unnecessary delays in dealing with customers claims. In 1991, I established a regional management structure in my Department giving an improved and localised service to customers.  Our services now incorporate the one-stop-shop concept.  The main local offices deal with an increasing range of the Department's services with inquiries and claims being dealt with more promptly and efficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant progress has been made in improving the time taken to deal with claims for unemployment payments.  The average time to investigate claims to unemployment assistance has been <Col N="1417" /> reduced in the past year by 66 per cent to eight working days.  This very substantial improvement was achieved by the new arrangements for means testing which the 1991 reorganisation permitted.  Many unemployed people are now means tested the day they make their application allowing many decisions to be made very quickly.</P>
    <P>The average time taken to deal with claims to unemployment benefit has also been reduced; in this case by 14 per cent to six working days, including the normal waiting period at the start of each claim. These averages include cases where difficulties arise in obtaining PRSI records or where there is a need to obtain information from other agencies.  Failures by employers to operate the PRSI system properly are frequent causes of delay. The ongoing intensive programme of visits to employers is proving useful in solving this problem.</P>
    <P>In general, where repeat claims are made after short periods of employment, decisions are made very quickly if the means testing or other inquiries were completed on the earlier claim.  The Deputy's question may imply that he is aware of particular delays.  If this is the situation, I would welcome information on such cases and I will have the delays investigated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A review of their entitlement was recently initiated to determine whether they continued to satisfy the statutory <Col N="1418" /> conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking employment.</P>
    <P>Non-nationals, including citizens of EC member states, are required to register with the registration officer (Garda) of the Department of Justice.  Deciding officers take the view that unregistered non-nationals are not freely available to accept offers of employment in this country.</P>

      <P>Employers PRSI is paid at the rate of 12.2 per cent of earnings, subject to a ceiling of £21,300.  In the vast majority of cases an employer would incur no additional PRSI costs by employing two job sharers instead of one full-time employee.  Additional costs would only arise in the case of highly-paid employees, that is, those with incomes above the PRSI ceiling.  For posts at these earnings levels, employers are likely to be more concerned about the quality of the contributions of the individual <Col N="1419" /> employee or employees, rather than administrative overheads.</P>
      <P>Any change in the PRSI ceiling for job-sharers would have budgetary implications, and could also lead to demands for similar treatment from other workers, such as part-time workers.</P>

      <P>The statutory criteria regarding the payment of arrears to married women in respect of the period of delay in implementing EC Directive 79/7 on equal treatment, from December 1984 until May and November 1986, are contained in the European Communities (Social Welfare) Regulations, 1992 (S.I. No. 152 of 1992).</P>
      <P>These regulations, which were brought into force on 18 June, 1992, entitle married women affected by the delay in implementing the directive to the higher personal rate of disability benefit, unemployment benefit, invalidity pension and occupational injuries benefit and to the extended duration of unemployment benefit.  The regulations also entitle married women to dependency increases in the form of a household supplement and to unemployment assistance.  There is no provision in the regulations for the payment of the alleviating payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to ensure that married women affected by the equal treatment provisions were aware of their entitlements under the retrospective legislation, my Department identified all potential <Col N="1420" /> claimants and issued personalised claim forms to those concerned.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>Equal treatment of men and women under the social security system has been provided for in legislation in accordance with the terms of the EC Directive in this matter.</P>
      <P>The main area not covered by the EC Directive is that of survivors' pensions. In the 1989 Social Welfare Act I extended the widow's (non-contributory) pension scheme to cover widowers with dependent children.  Prior to that there had been no specific schemes for widowers. This was expanded in the 1990 Social Welfare Act by the introduction of the lone parents allowance which made provision for the various categories of lone parents including both widowers and separated and deserted fathers.</P>
      <P>The social insurance schemes for widowers and deserted wives do not apply to men.  The cost of extending to widowers and deserted husbands the present social insurance arrangements for widows and deserted wives estimated to be in the region of £50 million in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of extending social insurance cover to widowers also arises for consideration in the context of proposals <Col N="1421" /> published in 1987 by the EC Commission for the adoption of a further directive aimed at extending the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women to the remaining areas of social security including pensions.  The EC is continuing its examination of these proposals.</P>
    <P>The question of social insurance cover for people in these situations is one of the issues being examined by the national pensions board in the context of its proposals for a new national pensions system.  I expect to receive the board's report shortly and the matter will then be given further consideration in the context of the recommendations contained therein.</P>
    <P>As far as the application of the legislation is concerned, care is taken to ensure that administrative guidelines and practice do not involve discrimination in the treatment of men and women.  With regard to information leaflets issued by the Department and the drafting of legislation, there is a policy of ensuring that all publications are of a non-sexist nature. Care is taken to monitor the language and art work used as part of an ongoing policy by the Department as leaflets are updated on a regular basis.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>if he will consider reducing to 55 years the qualifying age for widows and widowers who live alone or with qualified children for entitlement to pension fringe benefits, that is, free electricity allowance, living alone allowance, where appropriate, free telephone rental allowance and the free public transport travel allowance.</Quest>

      <P>The free schemes to which the Deputy refers are available, subject to certain conditions, to people aged 66 years and over and to incapacitated people in receipt of social welfare type payments in respect of their incapacity. The question of extending those schemes to certain categories of persons aged 55 <Col N="1422" /> years and over would give rise to additional expenditure and, therefore, would be one for consideration in a budgetary context.</P>
      <P>I should mention that the current annual cost of the schemes mentioned by the Deputy is about £94 million.  The additional cost of extending those schemes to persons who are 55 years and over, who are receiving a widow's pension or lone parent's allowance from my Department and who are either living alone or with exempted persons is estimated to be of the order of £8.4 million a year.</P>

      <P>The estimated cost incurred to date by my Department on decentralisation projects in Sligo, Leterkenny and Longford is £3,296,000.  The breakdown of this figure is set out in a tabular statement which will be made available to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>As regards payments to staff for relocation, personnel who move under the programme do so on a voluntary basis. When staff are being canvassed, it is made clear to potential applicants that under the arrangements which apply to all Departments, removal expenses are not payable.  However, volunteers in provincial locations who come to Dublin for necessary training in advance of relocation are paid a special <i>ex gratia</i> allowance in respect of their additional expenses while serving in Dublin in accordance with agreed rates and time limits.  As can be seen from the following table the total amount involved to date is only £78,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1423" /> The decentralisation programmes of my Department to Sligo and Letterkenny have been very successful, bringing a much needed boost to the economies of the two towns and reversing past trends which saw the outflow of much of the local population to seek work in the Civil Service in Dublin.  I have visited these <Col N="1424" /> centres and I have been very impressed by the air of efficiency and well being among the staff &mdash; a staff who are generally closer to home and who are making a significant contribution to their local economies.  I am confident that the move to Longford due to take place later this year will be equally successful.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 37 together.  One of the qualifying conditions for the lone parent's allowance is that the claimant has the main care and charge of the children. This is consistent with the underlying function of the scheme which is to meet the needs of people who have the responsibility of rearing children without the support of a spouse or partner.</P>
      <P>The existence of a joint custody order does not necessarily preclude a person from qualifying for lone parent's allowance.</P>
      <P>In the event that one of the parents has the main care and charge of a child, that person can, subject to the other qualifying conditions attached to the scheme, qualify for the allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In cases of joint custody orders where the <Col N="1425" /> child resides equally with both parents however, neither parent can qualify for the allowance because they share responsibility for rearing the child and cannot therefore be regarded as a lone parent.</P>
    <P>The aspect of the existing provisions is currently under review within my Department and the possibility of entitling one of the parents in joint custody situations where the child resides equally with both parents to lone parent's allowance, for example by allowing the parents elect which of them should be regarded for the purposes of the scheme as having the main care and charge of the child, is being examined in this context.</P>
    <P>There are other income support payments available for parents who do not come within the scope of the lone parent's allowance scheme such as unemployment assistance, or if they are not available for work, supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>In relation to child benefit, entitlement to payment is governed by regulations which confer entitlement on the mother in the first instance.  There are no provisions for sharing of child benefit between parents and my Department has never provided for this on an administrative basis.</P>

      <P>All applicants for unemployment payments are required to attend at a local office of the department and sign the unemployed register.  Where the local office is more than 6 miles away applicants sign at their local Garda station.  The signing process serves as a point of contact between the Department and the claimant, it facilitates identification, the prevention of abuse and provides an opportunity for determining whether each claimant continues to satisfy the conditions of entitlement.</P>
      <P>In recent years the frequency of attendance at local offices and Garda signing centres has been considerably relaxed for many claimants in conjunction with the introduction of alternative methods of payment.  Many claimants are now required to sign the live register once a month and some even less frequently.</P>
      <P>This has come about following the introduction of alternative methods of payment for the unemployed.  Some are required to sign the live register only once every six months.  The process of paying otherwise than by cash at local offices is being extended to all areas and as it proceeds the frequency of attendance will be reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1428" /> Until the new arrangements are fully established in all areas, there will be a continuing need for some weekly signing at local offices and at the nearest Garda stations for those who reside more than 6 miles from the nearest local office.  As further developments take place this feature will be kept under continuing review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>My Department operates a scheme of grants for locally-based women's groups, involved in programmes of self-help and personal development and a scheme of grants to voluntary organisations, working with disadvantaged groups or in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Grants under the latter scheme are generally for projects of a once-off nature and for projects that are unable to obtain assistance under grant schemes operated by other statutory agencies, including the health boards who are the main providers of financial assistance to voluntary social services organisations.  I might mention that, in keeping with the commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, a review of this scheme was <Col N="1429" /> undertaken by my Department which now enables grants to be made, in very exceptional circumstances, for ongoing expenses or running costs, other than wages or salaries.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the recommendations made by the Second Commission on the Status of Women in their recent report that funding under the scheme of grants for locally-based women's groups be made available on a multi-annual as well as a once-off basis and that the scheme be expanded to apply to groups including disadvantaged men as well as women.  My recent announcement that four women's projects funded by my Department are being included in the community development programme meets that recommendation in the case of three larger, more established projects.  Projects in the community development programme are given a three year funding commitment.  In relation to the latter recommendation, my view is that there is a continuing need for a scheme specifically aimed at women's self-help and personal development groups.  Projects in which men are involved benefit under other supports for voluntary activity operated by my Department, such as the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations and the community development programme.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, I am bringing forward proposals for a White Paper and charter for voluntary activity which will set out a framework for partnerships between the State and voluntary bodies and develop a cohesive strategy for supporting voluntary activity.  An inter-departmental task force has been set up under the chairmanship of my Department, to put together detailed proposals for the content of the White Paper and charter.  Issues such as multi-annual funding for voluntary organisations and the need for review and perhaps modification of existing schemes of support for voluntary activity are being examined in that context.  It is expected that the task force will complete its work by the end of June 1993.</P>
    <P>I have already substantially met another of the commission's recommendations <Col N="1430" /> that the funding for the women's grants scheme be increased to £1 million.  The funding made available by my Department this year for women's groups under various headings comes to £970,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>The Commission on the Status of Women was of the view that adult dependants of social welfare recipients, the vast bulk of whom are married women, should be given recognition in their own right and that the term &ldquo;adult dependent&rdquo; in present legislation should be replaced.  I am considering at present how this recommendation could be given effect and the implications of doing so.</P>
      <P>The concept of dependency exists within the social welfare system for historical reasons.  Old age pensions were first introduced as far back as 1911, and the unemployment assistance scheme dates from 1933.  At that time, the family structure of a breadwinner husband with dependent wife and children was the norm, and the social welfare schemes were framed accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Establishing a system of solely individual rights and payments would clearly represent a significant departure from the existing social welfare system.  It could, for example, result in people with low <Col N="1431" /> personal incomes but benefiting from a high family income overall becoming entiled to means-tested payments.  This would have significant cost implications for the taxpayer.  In terms of insurance payments, a system of individual rights could effectively result in lower payments for some people who do not have complete insurance records in their own right but who currently qualify for full adult dependant allowances.  Separate payments to all qualified partners would have considerable costs.  At present separate payments are arranged on request for people with difficult family situations.</P>
    <P>My Department is examining all the implications of the commission's recommendation in relation to the status of married women working in the home with a view to formulating an action plan to address the issues raised for these women in the context of the future development of the social welfare system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>There were four main recommendations in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.  These were: improved child income support, a broadening of the social insurance base, improvement in the delivery of service and improvement in basic payments. Considerable progress has been made in all four areas since the commission reported in 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the area of child income support, the number of child dependant rates has <Col N="1433" /> been streamlined from 36 in 1987 to three at present.  The minimum child dependant allowance will be £12.80 with effect from next July, as compared with £6 in 1987.  This year's budget provided for a substantial increase in child benefit payments to £20 for the first three children and £23 for the fourth and each subsequent child.  Under the Programme for a Partnership Government, the Government is committed to increasing child benefit still further over time, following integration of the tax and social welfare systems.  A new grant of £200 for mothers on the birth of twins will also be introduced in July.  In addition, the family income supplement will be improved, so that most families on FIS will be £12 per week better off from July.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Social Welfare also recommended a broadening of the social insurance base.  With effect from April 1988, I extended social insurance cover for pensions to the self-employed, including farmers.  In 1991, I extended full social insurance cover to part-time workers earning £25 or more per week. This year these part-time workers are becoming eligible for unemployment benefit, disability benefit and maternity benefit for the first time, representing a substantial improvement in their employment conditions.</P>
    <P>The major and ongoing improvements which I have made in the quality, efficiency and delivery of social welfare services are in line with recommendations made by the commission in this area.  I have set up eight regional management centres throughout the country and local offices are being converted into one stop shops for all social welfare services in these areas.  This amounts to a major and fundamental reorganisation in the way these services are administered and delivered and is resulting in a more local customer-oriented service.</P>
    <P>In recent years, social welfare payments have more than kept pace with inflation.  All lòng term social welfare rates now exceed the Commission on Social Welfare's priority rate which is £58.20 in 1993 terms.  The new weekly <Col N="1434" /> rate for long term payments will be at least £59.20 with effect from July.  The carer's allowance will also increase to the long term rate from July.  Short-term payments will be increased to a new personal weekly rate of £55.60.</P>
    <P>The exceptionally difficult budgetary circumstances earlier this year did not allow the Government to achieve in full the priority rates proposed by the commission. This will be achieved in the context of further growth in the economy. However, the Government is committed, under the Programme for a Partnership Government, to at least maintain the real value of social welfare payments and to protect the incomes of pensioners.  I will continue to keep payment levels under review and to implement the commission's recommendations in this area as resources permit.</P>

      <P>The pre-retirement allowance scheme, which was introduced in March 1990, enabled long term unemployed people, aged 60 or over, who did not intend to take up employment, to sign off the live register and continue to receive the equivalent of their unemployment payment by means of pension order book.  The qualifying age was lowered to 58 years in April 1991 and was further reduced to 55 years from May 1992.  The single woman's allowance scheme was integrated with the pre-retirement allowance scheme with effect from November last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Estimated spending increases on the pre-retirement allowance scheme this year may be attributed mainly to the fact that the full year effect of the changes made to the scheme in 1992 will only <Col N="1435" /> begin to impact on expenditure during 1993.</P>
    <P>There are no plans at present to reduce the qualifying age for participation in the scheme below its present level of 55 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>Invalidity pension is a long term payment intended for people who are permanently incapable of work by virtue of illness or disability.  The experience of my Department has been that it can take some time to establish whether or not a condition is permanent.  For this reason, invalidity pension has not been payable until the claimant has been continuously incapable of work for at least a year.</P>
      <P>Situations can, however, arise where an illness could be regarded as permanent, even if the person concerned had not been ill for a full year.  I am, therefore, revising the regulations to allow for award of invalidity pension in exceptional cases, without waiting 12 months, where it is clear that the incapacity for work is of such a nature that the person is likely to be incapable of work for life.  The new regulation will come into effect shortly.</P>

However, the main purpose of the advisory group is to review all aspects of the operation of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme with a view to achieving consistency in the operation of the scheme across all boards.  This task involves an examination of all guidelines currently in use in the administration of the scheme with the objective of producing updated and comprehensive guidance for health boards.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned with the possible effects of the social welfare system on incentives to take up employment. The matter is kept constantly under review in my Department, with a <Col N="1437" /> view to reducing such effects within the limits of available resources.</P>
      <P>Family income supplement is available to low-paid workers with children to ensure that they are not worse off by taking up or remaining in low-paid employment.  The income received by way of family income supplement is not taken into account by the health boards for medical card purposes.  I have improved and extended the family income supplement scheme substantially over recent years.  This year, as a result of improvements I introduced in the context of the budget, most families in receipt of FIS will be £12 per week better off.  Over 7,000 families benefited under the FIS scheme in 1992.</P>
      <P>In this year's budget, I provided a further incentive to take up employment by substantially raising the daily and weekly limits on the amount an individual can earn before there is a reduction in his or her unemployment assistance payment.</P>
      <P>Measures are being taken to improve the incentives available to the long term unemployed and other social welfare groups under the new area-based strategy provided for in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  Unemployed persons in the 12 designated pilot areas under the programme are allowed to take up self-employment while continuing to receive an allowance equivalent to their unemployment payments.  This allowance will continue for up to 12 months. The person will also retain his or her secondary benefits during this period. People who opt for paid employment, while they will not receive an allowance on the same basis as the self-employed, will also retain their secondary benefits for 12 months subject to an upper income limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cut-off limits to which the Deputy is referring apply to the free fuel allowance, the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance and the medical card.  Of these, only the free fuel allowance is automatically withdrawn once a social welfare recipient takes up employment. The back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance and the medical card are <Col N="1438" /> income related and need not be lost even if a person takes up employment, once the family income remains below the appropriate threshold.  In addition, the spouse of a social welfare recipient can earn up to £55 per week from employment or self-employment without affecting the recipient's payment or entitlement to secondary benefits.  Any changes to the existing arrangements would have expenditure implications and could be considered only in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The responsibility for making and amending rent schemes for local authority dwellings was devolved to local authorities in August, 1986 as part of a programme for devolving a wider range of functions to local authorities.  Guidelines issued by the Minister for the Environment at that time required the local authorities to ensure that differential rent schemes adopted by them were based on <Col N="1440" /> certain broad principles.  One of these is that rent payable should be related to income and a smaller proportion of income should be required from low income households.  A further requirement was that provision should be made for lower rents in exceptional cases where payment of the normal rent would give rise to hardship.</P>
      <P>These guidelines are designed to ensure that tenants on very low incomes do not suffer hardship, by allowing the local authority to fix the rent payable to match a tenant's circumstances.</P>
      <P>In view of the discretion of the local authorities in this regard, my Department has asked health boards to advise tenants, who seek assistance with rent arrears, to consult the housing department of their local authority for advice on how to deal with the matter.</P>
      <P>I recently launched a new household budgeting scheme for social welfare customers on a trial basis in the Dublin area. Legislation has already been put in place to allow for voluntary deductions from social welfare payments.  This new payment option will help social welfare clients to put aside as set amount towards regular bills such as rent so that the prospect of falling into arrears will be reduced.  It will be available, initially, to all persons in receipt of unemployment payments at six Dublin local offices who are paid by postdraft.  The organisations that have agreed to participate in the deduction scheme include two local authorities in the Dublin area.  It is hoped that, once the initial phase works satisfactorily, it will be extended on a gradual basis to all Dublin local offices.  Discussions will then commence with other local authorities for its extension throughout the country.</P>

      <P>The purpose of family income supplement is to provide cash support for employees on low earnings with families and thereby preserve the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances in which they might be only marginally better off than if they were claiming unemployment or disability benefits.  The level of cash support is determined by a set percentage of the difference between the actual gross weekly income and the specified amount for each family size. Since the scheme's inception in September 1984, there has been a steady increase in the number of families in receipt of family income supplement. Last year the number of family income supplement recipients reached 7,735 families, providing for 26,764 children. This increased level of take-up reflects the major improvements which I have made to the scheme in recent years.</P>
      <P>These changes include a substantial increase in the income limits for eligibility, a reduction of the hours-of-work qualification from 24 to 20 hours, an increase in the number of qualifying children in a family from five to eight, the abolition of the maximum rate of payment and the implementation of a minimum £5 weekly payment for all recipients while the common fear among potential family income supplement claimants that they risk losing the medical card has been removed.  In this year's budget, I have increased the income limits by a further £20 so that the weekly rate for a one-child family is £175 and £314 for a family with eight children.</P>
      <P>The family income supplement regulations allow a claimant to nominate her or his spouse as an agent for the collection of the weekly payment.  My primary concern is to further improve the take-up of the scheme in any way I can.  I am considering in this context, and in the context of the policy objectives of the scheme as I have outlined them, the proposal made by the Council for the Status of Women that family incomes supplement should be paid to the primary care giver.</P>

      <P>It is presumed that the Deputy is referring <Col N="1443" /> to the list of tax defaulters published by the Revenue Commissioners under the provisions of section 23, Finance Act, 1983.</P>
      <P>Section 23, Finance Act, 1983 provides that the Revenue Commissioners shall, in relation to any year or any part of a year, compile a list of the names, addresses and occupations or descriptions of every person &mdash; (a) on whom a fine or other penalty was imposed by a court, or; (b) in whose case the Revenue Commissioners refrained from initiating legal proceedings but instead accepted a settlement involving payment of the tax liability, together with interest and penalties, where the settlement was not reached as a result of a complete voluntary disclosure by the taxpayer and where the total settlement exceeded £10,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are authorised to publish the list of tax defaulters in their annual report and in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> Such publication normally takes place in the spring or early summer.  Section 23, <Col N="1444" /> Finance Act, 1983 was amended by the provisions of section 240, Finance Act, 1992 in order to provide for the publication of multiple lists in a year.  The activation of this provision is currently under consideration.</P>
    <P>The legislation does not provide for the advertisement of the list of tax defaulters in the national newspapers. However I understand that the national newspapers republish parts of the list after its initial appearance in the Revenue Commissioners' Annual Report and <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>

      <P>The current operation of family income supplement, FIS, is based on a payment which is reviewed every 52 weeks.  This rule is considered to be in the best interests of providing a stable and continuous income to low earning workers with families while maintaining the administrative simplicity of the scheme.</P>
      <P>A proposal to shorten the review period for family income supplement to allow for the speedier inclusion of newly qualified dependants in the assessment process would have the effect of enabling people to claim in respect of new dependants but would also disqualify recipients whose number of dependants has reduced.</P>
      <P>In addition, the impact of a shorter review period and the more frequent means testing which this would involve could adversely affect the level of take-up of the scheme.</P>

There is no such restriction in the case of bicycles.  During the course of their work, Garda drivers may be expected to encounter very different driving situations from those experienced by ordinary civilian drivers.  It is necessary, therefore, in the interests of safety for all concerned, to ensure that all members who drive officially have no vision defects of the type in question.</P>

This committee comprises officials from my Department and representatives of the Irish Insurance Federation, the Irish Brokers' Association and the Insurance Intermediary Compliance Bureau, which bureau is the regulatory agent of the insurers.</P>
    <P>Where an insurance intermediary fails to satisfy the regulatory authority, either the Irish Brokers' Association or the Insurance Intermediaries Compliance Bureau, of compliance with regulatory obligations, agency appointments which enable him-her to act as an insurance intermediary, are terminated by insurers.</P>
    <P>My Department receives complaints-queries on a daily basis about the cost, availability and marketing of insurance. However, where the substance of these complaints-queries does not constitute breaches of the Insurance Acts, including the 1989 Act, the question of prosecution does not arise.</P>
    <P>To date, following identification of possible breaches of the 1989 Act and examinations by authorised officers of my Department, reports on two former insurance intermediaries have been forwarded to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration as to prosecution.  Decisions on prosecutions of such cases are a matter for that office.</P>

      <P>The strike commenced at the company's head office in Dublin on 15 April in a dispute over the allocation of collection areas to the company's collection agents.  Negotiations involving a number of conciliation conferences were held under the <Col N="1450" /> Labour Relations Commission.  On basis of these discussions settlement proposals emerged which were accepted by both sides and normal working has resumed.</P>

      <P>The person referred to never held a milk quota as he was not involved in milk production in 1983 which was the reference year for the establishment of a milk quota under EC Regulations.  His application for a SLOM quota in June 1989 was invalid because he did not participate in the non-marketing of milk scheme or the dairy herd conversion scheme.</P>
