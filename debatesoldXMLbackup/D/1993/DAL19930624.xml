      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I object.  I want to say something about the way the Government programme managers are mismanaging the business of this House. Two or three weeks ago we had no business and the House had to break up prematurely.  Now a Government who want to make it a crime under the Social Charter for people to work 48 hours a week wants the staff of this House to come in here at 9 a.m. and not leave until 2 a.m. the following morning because it cannot manage its own business properly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to this issue of putting through legislation so that Deputies cannot table amendments properly because there is not sufficient time, is it the case that the Government intend not just to do this with this Bill but with legislation to give a tax write-off for tax cheats, to commit Irish troops to almost certain death in Somalia&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to explain the reasons for my opposition.  The reasons are that this is part of a pattern of a Government which is willing to spend £20 million on running this House but is preventing the House from doing its business properly because it cannot manage its business.</P>

      <P>On the Industrial Development Bill, 1993, Committee Stage, there are 38 amendments, many of them tabled by the Minister.  There is no possible way in which 38 amendments on a Bill of this importance could be discussed within three hours.  It is entirely wrong that this Bill should be guillotined in this way.  In addition, I might say in regard to the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 1993, the Minister for Justice, when replying last evening on Second Stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In relation to the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Bill, 1993, may I point out that there are 18 amendments tabled to this Bill, many of a substantial nature, yet only three-quarters of an hour is being provided to deal with them.  The attempt to deal with the Report and Final Stages of this Bill within such a short period of time is simply not good enough.  In relation to the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill, 1993, we have gained an extra&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not asking you, Sir, to deal with item No. 15.  I simply want to complete my point in that an extra hour is being allowed for item No. 15, but it still affords us only one hour and 50 minutes.  I am proposing, in relation to item No. 14, that the matter relating to statements on the EC Summit held in Copenhagen be deferred until tomorrow, that the resultant extra time gained be shared between the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Bill, 1993, and the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill, 1993 &mdash; an extra half hour at least to be devoted to the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Bill, 1993, and an extra hour to the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill, 1993.  That would be a fair way to deal with them.  Statements on the recent EC Summit could be taken tomorrow morning without any great difficulty in that no vote is required on statements. Therefore, the Government <Col N="2072" /> backbenchers would not be required to attend.</P>

      <P>This House agreed to set up committees to take the Committee Stage of Bills without time pressure so that we, who are expensively paid by the taxpayer, can do our job properly.  This Government which has so mismanaged business is now attempting to deny Members the opportunity to do their work.  I object to the taking of this Bill in this fashion.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If Members do not want me to comment, that is fine, I will sit down and will not comment.  I might remind the House that the Government put in 15 speakers on Second Stage of this Bill to only three from the Opposition.  If that is any indication of the seriousness with which they approach the debate on the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Bill, 1993, I suggest adequate time is being allocated today to finish that Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill, 1993, I was asked yesterday to consider allowing more time for that debate.  We have done so and have doubled the time for Committee Stage.  I think it is most unlikely we would reach agreement for tomorrow; I predict the same arguments would be advanced tomorrow.  However, if all parties want us to consider the possibility of allowing one and a half hours in the morning for statements on the EC Summit, I am prepared to let the Whips talk about it, but <Col N="2073" /> I do not think it is likely to find agreement among the parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach to explain why there is this fuss about rushing the Committee Stages of these Bills through the House?  Why are these Committee Stages not being dealt with by the Select Committees set up under the reform procedures?  In relation to the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Bill, 1993, I recall a reply given by the Taoiseach to Deputy Flaherty a week ago to the effect that the Committee Stage of this Bill would be dealt with by the Select Committee on Social Affairs.  Why is it being jackbooted through the Dáil within this short period of time?  Will the Taoiseach say, in relation to those three Bills, why they are not being referred to Select Committees?</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, arising from the Taoiseach's comment about the Whips discussing the matter of allocating time to statements on the recent EC Summit tomorrow morning, may I say that it was made perfectly clear to us, at the Whips' meeting yesterday, that that could not happen because of <Col N="2074" /> engagements that you yourself, Sir, and the Tánaiste have?  We can understand and appreciate that.  But I have to say it was made perfectly clear to the Government that the business for today is but a forerunner of the method of proceeding for the next two weeks.  We consider this to be a gross abuse of the guillotine facility that operates in the House &mdash; to put through more detailed and heavy legislation within the next two weeks than has gone through this House within the past four months.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I am not too clear about precisely what the Taoiseach is offering in relation to my suggestion that statements on the recent EC Summit be deferred and that the additional time be shared between the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Bill, 1993, and the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill, 1993.  Is he saying that, if agreement can be found on deferring those statements, that time will be shared between those two Bills?  If that is the case, it does not have to be tomorrow morning; it could be Tuesday evening or Wednesday morning.  The statements on the Summit will not lead to the conclusions of the Summit being changed.</P>

      <P>This Bill proposes to change major aspects of our criminal law. The whole purpose of Committee Stage is to allow detailed amendments to be put forward by all sides of the House and for the Minister to listen to what the Opposition and his or her backbenchers have to say and, if necessary, make changes.  This process is destroyed if there is a time limit.  In matters of this importance I appeal to the Government not to have any time limit on Committee Stages and if there is a problem to refer the Committee Stages to a special committee of the House.</P>

Yesterday we were offered 50 minutes, less than an hour, to deal with the Committee Stage of one of the most important pieces of social legislation the Dáil has ever had to deal with.  The Taoiseach has doubled the time available for this debate.  It is derisory to talk about dealing with the Committee and Remaining Stages of this Bill in approximately one hour and fifty minutes.  We offered the Taoiseach a way out on this matter but he refused to accept it.  In agreeing this proposal &mdash; it is clear that the Taoiseach will not agree to any reasoning by Members on this side of the House &mdash; the scheduling of the amendments should at <Col N="2079" /> the very least permit a debate on the sections dealing with homosexuality and prostitution.

      <P>I wish to ask one question on item No. 15, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill, 1993.  Will the Taoiseach give me a clear answer as to why this Bill is not referred to one of the Dáil select committees?  In response to an earlier question I raised the Taoiseach said that the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Bill had been dealt with in the House but I have been told that of the 21 amendments only five were disposed of.  Why is the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill, 1993 not being referred to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security for full examination? Has the absence in America of Deputy Davern a bearing on the Taoiseach's wish to have it dealt with before he returns?  Why can we not have an adequate debate on this Bill on committee?</P>

      <P>Let us give credit where credit is due.  The Taoiseach is correct in saying they brought in more substantial reform than any Government and I think it is the first time that throughout the term we have managed to do our business with 120 Deputies.  That is the major reform that has been introduced.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach consider it in order for us to give the go-ahead when seven of the ten Bills that we will consider between now and the end of the session have not yet been published?  I do not think that is understood by the public. Seven of the ten Bills have not yet been published and the Taoiseach told us at Question Time seven weeks ago that he was absolutely satisfied with the ability of the parliamentary draftsman's office to furnish this House with legislation.  We have been reduced to scouring around and poaching legislation from another House and now we are anxious to secure a Bill we have not even read.</P>

Even at this late stage will the Taoiseach consider sending the Committee Stage of this Bill to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security?  The reason I ask is that I am unaware of any other business for that committee to conduct in the near future. This select committee has not processed the Committee Stage of any Bill yet, the purpose for which it was set up.

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), line 27, to delete &ldquo;Forfás or either Agency&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Forbairt and Industrial Development Agency (Ireland)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage, there was a unanimous view on this side of the House on the need for FÁS.  Nothing the Minister said &mdash; and nothing I have read in relation to the restructuring of these State agencies &mdash; leads me to believe that we need to have a super organisation such as Forfás over Forbairt and the Industrial Development Agency (Ireland).  The Minister's reasons for setting up this agency are to create what he terms a linkage between <Col N="2093" /> the two agencies.  Forbairt is rightly being established to look after the development of indigenous industry, for which there is a clear need but the IDA do not seem to have the capacity to do that; there is no clear section within the IDA to assist indigenous industries.  The creation of Forbairt is, therefore, essential as is the creation of the second agency, Industrial Development Agency (Ireland), to look after overseas mobile investment potential.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that there is a need for another organisation straddling these two agencies to achieve the communication levels that would obviously be necessary where there is overlapping between the two agencies.  That presupposes that the two boards would not have the capacity or the wit to liaise with each other and create the very linkage about which the Minister is so concerned.  It is clearly possible to do this within the new structures without the need for the superstructure of Forfás.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill the powers will be vested in Forfás and the other two agencies will, therefore, be subservient to it. This amounts to an unnecessary extra layer of bureaucracy which will inevitably slow down the decision-making process. The linkages necessary to deal with overlapping could be handled laterally.  I see no need to create another structure over these two agencies.  I do not believe it would contribute fundamentally to the operation of Forbairt or the Industrial Development Agency (Ireland).  On the contrary, it would create another layer of bureaucracy and force the agencies to look over their shoulder at Forfás in an unnecessary and burdensome way.</P>
    <P>I welcome much of what is in the Bill. My fundamental disagreement is on the question of Forfás.  If Forfás was removed from the equation the Minister would achieve all his aims, the recommendations of Culliton, Telesis and others.  The Minister is aware that we are overburdened with structures, committees etc., resulting in the slowing down of the decision-making process.  We seem to constantly drive ourselves up <Col N="2094" /><i>culs-de-sac</i> and Forfás is contributing to the creation of another.</P>
    <P>Nothing the Minister said will persuade me that the obvious overlapping between the two new agencies requires the creation of a convoluted structure.  The two boards would have the wit to form a sub-committee either at board level or among the executives since it is through the executives that the day to day operations of the agencies will be conducted. In this way assistance could be offered by one agency to the other by, for example, introducing particular clients whose needs go beyond the remit of one agency. The Minister said nothing to illustrate the need to create Forfás as the link between these agencies.  He spoke at great length in nice and well thought out flowery language, he used all the right clichés and modern buzz words, some of which need to be further considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>They obviously made me think about what the Minister was trying to say but when the jargon is stripped away, I still do not believe there is a need for the creation of Forfás.  I ask the Minister to take the views of the Opposition on board because I am genuinely worried about this extra layer of bureaucracy, this idea that somebody needs to be minding the shop.  If we are confident that the chief executives appointed to these boards are dynamic and capable of achieving the goals that must be set, there is no need for Forfás.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The driving responsibility for policy formulation must be taken back by the Department of Enterprise and Employment. I think this is something to which the Minister subscribes and I welcome that.  If the Department is to play the central role I consider it should play in respect of policy development and <Col N="2095" /> implementation, not just by way of recommendations but in the form of real action on the ground, I do not see why Forfás should be in control of the two agencies.  Another barrier is being put up between the Minister's Department and the two primary agencies, Forbairt and IDA, by those agencies having to operate through Forfás.  Surely it would be better for the Department to get the message across to those agencies firsthand and set clear guidelines for their development.</P>
    <P>The position will develop that the Department will end up constantly dealing with Forfás rather than dealing directly with Forbairt and the IDA.  That would be regrettable.  I do not believe that such a role should be assigned to Forfás; the Department should be responsible for policy in respect of the agencies.  If the Department is changing its attitude and taking a more up-front role in those developments, then it is clearly unnecessary for the Department to have another agency straddling both the domestic market agency and the international agency.  I do not see the need for that.  What role will Forfás have other than a bridging one between the two agencies?</P>
    <P>This Bill provides that the authority and control that existed within the IDA is to be vested in Forfás and Forfás will be the primary body.  However, the primary body does not have a specific role, whereas specific roles will be assigned to Forbairt and the IDA.  Clearly, Forbairt and the IDA will be subservient to Forfás, and that is regrettable.  It is regrettable and unnecessary that another board and another chief executive will be appointed.  The chief executives of both Forbairt and the IDA would have a much better working relationship, a clearer understanding of each other's role and greater ability to do their jobs without having a third chief executive in control over both of them.  I do not believe it is right or necessary to create Forfás, which will have control over Forbairt and the IDA.  I ask the Minister to reconsider his decision in this regard and remove Forfás <Col N="2096" /> from the equation by accepting the amendments tabled by various Members of the House.  I ask him to vest authority in Forbairt and the Industrial Development Authority (Ireland).</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult for the Minister to respond until he has heard the contributions.  I will make a brief contribution.  I support the amendments to remove Forfás.  Forfás was not recommended by Culliton or Moriarty.  Neither of those groups supported the idea of Forfás.  This notion of Forfás appears to have been introduced by the previous Government in an effort, as Deputy Rabbitte said yesterday, to square a conflict between the super agency idea and the need to separate the agencies and assign one the function of dealing with foreign trade and the other the function of dealing with indigenous industry.  This Government appears to have endorsed that approach.  The Labour Party did not succeed in getting the Government to cop itself on.  The reality is that the functions of Forfás are virtually inseparable from what a reasonable Minister would be doing if he was setting about his task in a meaningful way.  They relate to advising on policy and on co-ordination and encouraging development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister and his public servants <Col N="2097" /> had a hold of industrial policy they would not need a body like Forfás to advise them.  Culliton wanted simplification and consolidation and that ran through his report.  Under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> everyone signed on to this reorganisation and simplification but the Government did not do anything about it.  The tragedy today is that this Minister does not know what he wants to do in regard to industrial strategy or what changes he wants to make.  But he is determined that those vehicles whose establishment have been negotiated in some dark room between different partners must be the vehicles to provide for further development in those areas.  The old saying that a camel is a horse designed by a committee rings true in this case. We have produced a camel with Forfás as the hump on the back of the two other agencies and that is not what was called for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what has been said.  People expected that when legislation in regard to the Culliton report was provided it would bring some hope in respect of making some impact on the unemployment issue.  I would remind the House that Culliton was a report of 105 pages.  The amount of the report that was taken up with agencies was effectively a page and a half between pages 81 and 83.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, at that point in the dialogue.  The problem is that we have not seen the colour of the Government's money on the recommendations that feature from pages 1 to 81 and from pages 83 to 105.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to ask us to give agreement to an <i>ad hoc</i> approach to industrial policy which the present Minister denounced when he was on this side of the House.  We have had several <i>ad hoc</i> measures brought before this House. We have had the abolition of a number <Col N="2098" /> of agencies before this without any consideration as to how they fitted into the overall scheme of things.  For example, during the considerations of the Oireachtas Committee on Employment last year the question of venture capital became a major issue.  While we were discussing it in one room, the Government was in here abolishing NADCORP, the only existing State agency that offered anything in that area.</P>
      <P>The former Minister for Finance and present Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, came before this House and extended the tax regime for the manufacturing sector to the year 2010 without any regard to anything else that was happening on the revamp of industrial policy.  I understand from the Minister for Finance that there is a story behind how that happened and clearly there was no agreement on it. However, the facts are that this was done and we are now stuck with its implications. We might look at the situation differently if we had had the opportunity, but it is not possible to go back on a contract entered into.  Similarly, without us hearing from this Minister where he stands on any of the major issues on industrial policy, he is asking us to trust him and to give agreement to this panoply of State agencies being put in place.  That is unreasonable.  For a Government who said that employment was its major priority this is the first legislation of any consequence that purports to deal with it.  All this legislation does is deal with the question of the rationalisation of agencies.</P>
      <P>On the amendments before the House, it is clear that Forfás is the product of compromise.  It is unnecessary, it is wasteful and it is adding bureaucratic tiers where Culliton's thrust was to simplify, make more effective and more efficient. It runs counter to the very thrust of Culliton while the rhetoric of the Minister and the Government is that they are implementing Culliton.  What Culliton actually said was:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Industrial firms are integrated business entities.  Their different functional <Col N="2099" /> areas operate together in a cohesive way.  State support for the functional activities of firms whether in technology, marketing, training or finance should reflect the reality and be provided as an integrated package.</P>
    <P>What does Culliton recommend?  He recommends:</P>
    <P>...that all grant-giving and advisory supports of a functional nature provided by IDA, and Eolas be brought together within one agency.</P>
    <P>That was his recommendation but that is not what the Minister is putting before us.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to another aspect of Culliton, namely, trade promotion.  The report states:</P>
    <P>The primary function of An Bord Tráchtála under the proposed new development agency for indigenous industry will be trade promotion.</P>
    <P>An Bord Tráchtála is not under the control of this development agency.  It reports to a different Minister, even though it was recommended that the focus of the Department of Industry and Commerce be changed so that it would be targeted at a developmental policy role in the area of industrial strategy. What we have done is assigned a new responsibility to a Minister in order to make his role relevant and thereby causing An Bord Tráchtála to report to him. This represents a mish-mash that is the hallmark of compromise between the two parties in Government.  The Taoiseach apparently is a man &mdash; I do not know whether Deputy Molloy will contribute to this section &mdash; who does not like to change his mind even when the world is screaming at him that he is wrong.  He persisted in this matter and what we now have, unfortunately, is more bureaucratic, more wasteful and less efficient and effective than what we had previously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to be brief.  I wish to begin my contribution with some honest statements of fact.  Yes, it is a <Col N="2100" /> compromise.  It is not exactly what Mr. Culliton recommended and, yes, it is not exactly what Dr. Moriarty and his task force recommended.  They were not elected, do not have responsibility in this House and they did not negotiate the Programme for Government.  I make no apology for compromising in terms of the design of an organisation. My intellectual and professional training as an architect was to constantly put down, evaluate and change until such time as the original concept matched the practical; reality that could work.</P>
      <P>Quite frankly &mdash; and I am conscious of speaking to experienced Deputies in this House, some of whom have held Executive office &mdash; I have previous experience in this regard, being the person who originally designed FÁS, at that stage known as NITA.  Deputy Molloy was in Opposition at that time and he will recall the long procrastinated debate that took place when there was a suggestion that CERT would be included in FÁS.  Fortunately for CERT, I was wrong and it was right and it was not eaten up by FÁS. However, for 18 months after FÁS was established it was a staff bureaucratic nightmare in which the wars continued between those people who were on the permanent payroll of the organisation to the detriment of the customer.  Quite frankly, for as long as I am a Minister in this House I will not repeat that experience. I say that without any apology to anybody and having regard to the fact that I must take some responsibility for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make no apology when I say that this is a compromise from the original position.  To repeat what I quoted in this House yesterday, and I would earnestly refer Members to read the contribution in full &mdash; I do not think it is available yet &mdash; when it is printed.  In the Seanad, Senator Joe Lee, who has written a seminal work on the failure of Irish Government industrial policy over an extended period of time, stated clearly in respect of the design recommendations in the Culliton report that where Culliton was particularly apposite in its recommendations and where the value of its <Col N="2101" /> insights were particularly worthwhile was in relation to the matters of which it had direct experience.  Where it was less apposite and less wise was in those areas where it has no experience.</P>
    <P>Mr. Jim Culliton has been a successful industrialist and entrepreneur but what if politicians in this House told him that the entire structure of, say, Cement Roadstone Holdings, should be exclusively incorporated in one single holding with no holding company and no separate trading companies?  If one examined the company register for Cement Roadstone Holdings, and Deputy Bruton was once an employee of that extensive organisation, I suspect that one would find a myriad of separate holding companies and separate niche companies for this or that factor.</P>
    <P>If one is a customer coming through the companies office it may seem like a bureaucratic maze but the customers do not come through the companies offices and the industrialists who will obtain assistance from the agency structure that we are now designing are not required to go through Committee Stage of parliamentary debates.  The customers knocking on the door looking for the products of Cement Roadstone Holdings, essentially blocks, bricks and cement, are at the end of a different process.  I tried to make this point yesterday. What we are doing in this legislation is ensuring that the recommendations of Culliton and Moriarty are implemented as effectively and efficiently as possible.  I believe the structures we have now put in place, including Forfás, achieve that objective and I will spell out the reasons why I believe that to be the case.</P>
    <P>First, I have not inherited a compromise to which I was not a party.  As the House is aware, I was a member of the negotiating committee with the three Fianna Fáil Ministers at that time and the three Labour Party Members, in which we debated the compromise structure between what was an interminable and deadlocked debate &mdash; Deputy Molloy may wish to comment on this &mdash; between the advocates of the super-agency, who <Col N="2102" /> had support in the Department of Finance on the one hand, and the advocates of the total separation of the two, who had much support from the point of view of clarity.  As Deputy Rabbitte rightly said, I was one of those.  When we heard the arguments as to why the super-agency idea had some merit, we came up with the concept of Forfás.  I wish to outline the benefits of that as I see them as against the experience which, having been in office previously, I wish to avoid.</P>
    <P>I apologise to the House that we are not having as long a debate as I and other Deputies would have wished.  However, once this legislation is put in place we can move quickly to establish IDA Ireland, which is the easiest of the three organisations to establish because its tasks and locations are virtually self-described without anyone working for that organisation having to make a decision as to whether they will work for Forbairt or for IDA.  They will not have to wonder what will happen to their terms of contract and service or their pension plan, all of which are matters which we in this House or, if we were employees or trade union representatives, would want to know.  Until such time as we had clear answers to those questions we would refuse to co-operate to agree to the transfer. That potential time bomb of industrial relations and worry is dealt with by vesting overnight in the holding company of Forfás, the personnel contracts and related matters to Forfás.</P>
    <P>If we were to divide the two, as is proposed, into two separate organisations we would have to go down through the personnel structure of the entire organisation of IDA as it is and Eolas as it is.  Before actually bringing in regulations to give effect to the launch of the two organisations, we in the Department of Enterprise and Employment, in conjunction with the Department of Finance, and in consultation with the unions, would have to clarify those facts before we could make any move.  That is not acceptable to me, hence, reason number one in support of Forfás.</P>
    <P>The second reason for Forfás is that the IDA is an enormous owner of land <Col N="2103" /> and property.  It owns vast amounts of land of differing values, in different locations.  It is the owner of buildings.  It is the owner, albeit far too small as we know from our debate yesterday, of approximately 6 per cent of the equity in a number of companies, whatever way one wishes to characterise it.  Some of those companies are Irish and some are foreign, some are Irish going foreign and some are foreign going Irish, or mixtures of the two.  If, as suggested, there is no need for Forfás, how would the entire portfolio of land and property be dealt with?  Questions would arise such as what was the last valuation, when would one get a valuation, how would land be assigned, which land is best suited for domestic indigenous industry, what corner of the industrial estate in Waterford is best suited for investment of a foreign company, or should it be reserved for domestic industry, when would that decision be made and until the decision is made should the two companies not be divided? Must we wait another three or four months for valuations on properties before specific land banks are assigned to Forbairt and IDA Ireland and they receive their portfolio of loans, equity and so on?  A commencement order would have to be made to stop me and the Department from establishing the clear operation of those two companies.</P>
    <P>That is simply not acceptable to me and I am not prepared to do that.  By having the vehicle of Forfás once this Bill becomes law, we can vest all these matters in that agency without any ambiguity or difficulty.  Then, over time, as determined by the Department in conjunction with Forfás, IDA Ireland and Forbairt, we can decide what makes sense in terms of land banks and property. If we get it wrong the first time &mdash; heaven knows we are not brilliant at always getting it right &mdash; and if an American or Japanese company wanted to set up in a corner of land which we originally thought would be better suited for indigenous domestic industry, the land would not have to be transferred back again, we would not have to go <Col N="2104" /> through the whole rigmarole again.  The very thing we are looking for &mdash; flexibility &mdash; would be there without need for regulations, transfers or legal opinions and without the Department of Finance being concerned whether we are getting value and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments suggest there is no need for Forfás, that present structures can already carry out that work.  That is the case, but quite frankly I am not going to spend the next 18 months adjudicating between land banks, pension funds and so on.  Nor am I going to tie up the time of the Department of Finance, trade unions, staff associations and, most importantly, my Department in making those decisions.  That is the basic set of reasons on which I could elaborate but in the interests of time I will not do so.  I have gone into detail on the implications of this matter and I have not even begun to touch on the nightmare that is potentially vested in Eolas and all its related activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the fact that State Departments are obliged to operate under certain constraints, and rightly so, the flexibility that would exist in terms of a semi-State company such as Forfás is essential if, as Minister responsible, I am to have in place the two essential components of industrial agency organisations required in order to implement industrial policy.  Deputy Cullen outlined reasons why Forfás is not necessary, but I would argue very much to the contrary. If I thought the Deputy was right and that I should compromise I would say so &mdash; I have no problem in saying things like that.  From my professional and organisational experience I believe that in <Col N="2105" /> terms of speed this is the proper procedure to follow.  Deputy Cullen mentioned the difficulties experienced with FÁS.  At first we did not get that organisation right, but it is now coming right. FÁS was set up in 1987-88 and as someone who was intimately involved in that agency and who has responsibility for it, I am not going to make the same mistake again.  I have learned from the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am shocked at the reasons given by the Minister.  It sums up what is the driving force in all of this.  Not once did he mention jobs or the setting up of companies to create jobs.  It is clear from what the Minister has stated that he is trying to fit a structure to suit an administrative position which in his belief would cause problems.  In other words, he has not decided that the need for such an organisation is driven by its commercial intent, by its opportunities and what it should be doing in the marketplace. One reason given by the Minister related to administrative difficulties in terms of staff.  I would not belittle the fears and concerns of people involved in the agency, but to state that as one reason for the setting up of Forfás is extraordinary.</P>
      <P>Companies operate in this country, internationally and all over the world, on a day-to-day basis and real commercial decisions have to be taken which involve enormous administrative difficulties, changes and so on.  Of course, it takes time to get these right, but to suggest that one of the main reasons for a fundamental change of direction in terms of the operation of our State agencies in creating and sustaining jobs, that is the setting up of Forfás, is to overcome a myriad of difficulties is unacceptable.  I have no doubt that difficulties existed in regard to FÁS, but surely the Departments, unions and staff involved have learned from those difficulties.  We should be capable of dealing with the mistakes made in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to Cement Roadstone, but to compare such a company, which is in the market to make a profit with State agencies is a load of <Col N="2106" /> hogwash.  In the main these companies set up holding or subsidiary companies for tax reasons, they are not set up as the driving force of the company.  It is not right to compare structures such as that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister agreed that Forfás is being set up because the present structures are unable to deal with these matters.  He also referred to land and asked how would it be divided.  Obviously difficulties will arise, but conveyancing is carried on hour by hour, minute by minute by small shopkeepers, purchasers of small houses and people involved in major land deals and commercial enterprises, and these people seem to be able to solve the difficulties with a degree of knowledge and intent to achieve an end. I do not accept the arguments made by the Minister.  Since I came into this House I have listened intently to the Minister's many worthwhile contributions and I do not believe that he subscribes to this view.  The Minister is right in that there is compromise involved here.  This compromise will not create jobs.  It is a compromise to fit political desires and to create a structure that satisfies many people in both parties in Government and in-house political difficulties in the State agencies.  I do not accept that. When we were in Government we would not compromise and that was one of the reasons that contributed to the break-up of the last Government.  We could not see the reason, other than a political self-centred one, the Taoiseach wanted to pursue this line.  It was not recommended by Culliton.  It is not practical.  It is not the engine room required.  Even on the basis of what the Minister said Forfás is being created for all the wrong reasons.</P>

      <P>It has convinced me that reorganisation of the kind we are undertaking will be a total waste.  The Minister has convinced me that what was wrong with industrial policy was to be found in the failure in policy-making. The Minister, his predecessors and the Department have failed to get a handle on what they wanted to do and the Minister has come here today again without any idea of what he wants to do.</P>
      <P>The Minister talked about land and reorganisation of staff but his thinking seems to be driven by his desire, above all, for peace within his extended empire of these bodies and not the great war against unemployment.  Is this body the vehicle to wage war against unemployment? For the Minister to suggest that staff might fall out with each other or that we might have land in Wicklow more suitable to another industry is pathetic.  The Minister drew an analogy with Cement Roadstone and suggested that Mr. Culliton did not have experience. No company would force its customers to go to Wicklow for stone chips, to Drogheda for pebbles and somewhere else for cement.</P>
      <P>The Minister proposes to leave An Bord Tráchtála on one limb, Bord Bia on another and that there will be a split between foreign and domestic industry with Forfás sitting on top.  That is illogical and the parallel to private companies is misleading.  Customers should be able to get their package in an integrated way from one place.  Customers will not worry about the reorganising of the structures. The energy being put into reorganising is wasteful.  We must be able to deliver the sort of support companies need and that means that we must think out policy terms and consider why indigenous industries failed.  There has not been any real discussion of that in the Minister's defence of Forfás.  If we had IDA Ireland, Forbairt and Forfás and Culliton was asked to examine that structure he would say it was ludicrous and that we should have a single integrated one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the development of industry the distinction between overseas and Irish owned is out of date.  The main priority <Col N="2108" /> of policy today is to achieve linkages and cluster development which makes that distinction less relevant.  We need strong companies based in Ireland regardless of who owns them.  The Minister has recognised that in the case of the food sector, the one sector where there has been a reasonable degree of indigenous development perhaps not of the model sort but there is at least development. The Minister recognised that splitting and creating umbrellas over splits is irrelevant in that area.  I am not convinced by the Minister's argument and, like Deputy Cullen, I feel that the fact that the Minister is pointing to such matters like staff and land problems indicates that the Minister is not entirely convinced either.</P>

      <P>I am appalled at the Minister's justification.  I cannot believe that the Minister has told the House that the reason we will have this super agency is because of our belief that we cannot manage staff or land banks.  It is extraordinary to create a new industrial vehicle and a complex web of agencies such as we have before us for that reason. I am beginning to believe that the Minister is right and that I ought to get a hold of this Monsieur Pascale and read about this fit and split, because it would appear to be the key to why we have this explanation. It is a post rationalisation by the Minister and his staff of why the Taoiseach got this idea into his head in the first place.  I presume the Taoiseach only got this idea into his head because he saw it as a way of getting the Progressive Democrats off his back.  The Taoiseach was looking for a number of excuses at the time to jettison the Progressive Democrats, as the rear of a rocket is jettisoned on a journey into space.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach was looking for that excuse for a long time and he did not seem to be succesful.  It is very disappointing that the new Minister can take it on board.  Deputy Bruton referred to &ldquo;waging war on unemployment&rdquo;.  It <Col N="2109" /> seems that this Minister is afraid to wage war on the IDA not to mention on unemployment. If we cannot cope with the challenge of personnel in the IDA I am not so sure that we can cope with the challenge of the jobs crisis.</P>
      <P>Whatever about The Workers' Party, I have been mesmerised for some time by the failure of the Minister's party to go for the ministry for Finance.  I do not know why, when it was on offer, the Labour Party did not want the ministry for Finance if they had serious convictions about their policies, and that they were bringing something different to Government.  What makes avoiding Finance difficult to understand is that the Labour Party wanted the ministry for Enterprise and Employment.  I cannot understand that rationalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The story was that the party would avoid the unpleasant decisions, that the Leader of the party would go into Iveagh House and nothing would attach to him in terms of economic problems.  Then, the next most senior person in the Labour Party took the Ministry for Enterprise and Employment.  That is a very onerous responsibility and there is bound to be a day of reckoning.  It is on this that the success of the Labour Party in Government hinges, not on how many troops we send to Somalia or decisions in the artistic or equality world, important as they might be.  This is the critical area and having gone for this portfolio, it is incumbent on the Minister to explain to the House how he will wage this war on unemployment.  What we have here is an agency which was set up for reasons of administrative convenience.  The two reasons the Minister advanced are ability to handle the staffing position and the land bank.  While I agree that these areas are complex they do not constitute a sufficiently good reason to devise a new vehicle for an attack on unemployment. It should be motivated by policy considerations, not by whether we will have an industrial relations wrangle with the staff in the Industrial Development Authority, technical, legal or administrative hitches about the disposal of a land bank or the apportionment of a land <Col N="2110" /> bank between the two agencies concerned.</P>
    <P>Cogent arguments must be advanced for constructing this new super agency. One could take a different view and say that we are not constructing a new super agency, that this is the old IDA, the old force for power within the industrial agencies, the real focus for power which will be headed by the existing chief executive of the IDA and that the other two agencies will be subordinate.  It is not good enough simply to say we are doing it to avoid a difficult personnel wrangle or problems with the land bank because, at the end of the day, existing jobs in the IDA will be protected.  If an assurance is given to the Industrial Development Authority staff that their position is to be protected, it should be possible to negotiate the rest.</P>
    <P>The Minister, for very good reasons which I understand, does not want to provoke any disquiet, anxiety or concern among the staff of the Industrial Development Authority but what is at stake is the effectiveness with which we can mount the assault on unemployment. The Minister did not refrain from provoking anxiety among Aer Lingus staff, people will lose their jobs, because, as the Minister sees it, there are good reasons for protecting the future of the airline.  However, although Aer Lingus is, unquestionably, of central importance, it is not as important as the totality of our industrial performance on this island, to use one of the Minister's facourite phrases.  Anxiety and/or concern about staff reaction within the Industrial Development Authority is not a sufficient reason to create an entirely new agency. The Minister said this is an enabling Bill, that it is important to show progress and to get it through before the summer recess.  He also said the complex administrative problems to which rationalisation gives rise, is a good reason to establish a new agency.  I am appalled at that contention.  For a Government that puts unemployment as <Col N="2111" /> its first priority, that is a very feeble response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me try to respond&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have risen three times already.  I think the Minister will agree, as my name was mentioned by two of the four speakers so far, that it is incumbent on me to contribute a few words to this debate.  I listened to this debate with immense interest, particularly to hear what justification the Minister, a member of the Labour Party, would advance for the proposals to establish three separate organisations.</P>
      <P>Since the Culliton report was published in effect three different Governments have dealt with this issue, the difference in those Governments can be explained. For example, under the leadership of former Deputy Charles Haughey, the Government comprised Fianna Fáil and my party.  When Deputy Albert Reynolds became Taoiseach, there were major changes of personnel within the Cabinet and then the general election in November led to the formation of the present Government comprising Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>The Culliton report was welcomed in the media and by Members of this House in all parties, particularly within the Government parties.  The Government issued a statement accepting the Culliton report and stated it would dedicate all its efforts to the implementation of its major recommendations.  It was accepted by the Government that, because of the major changes proposed in relation to the existing Industrial Development Authority structure and the tradition in the Civil Service or State sector to defend what they have, that there would be an attempt by the senior management in the Industrial Development Authority to resist those changes.  The then Government, led by Deputy Haughey was determined to implement the proposals, as recommended by Culliton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, is the only Minister who retained his portfolio throughout the change in <Col N="2112" /> Government and he accepted the Culliton report in regard to the division of the IDA into an organisation to attract foreign industries and setting up a separate organisation to develop indigenous industry.  He has not changed his position but when one sees the way he has twisted and turned and changed his beliefs, as expressed publicly, in regard to these proposals, one wonders what principles apply to decision-making processes in Departments under his control.  As expected, the IDA mounted its campaign behind closed doors to seek to influence the Government.  It did not influence the then Government under the leadership of the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, or under the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley. There was no indication that the Minister for Finance would bend.  However, when there was a change of Taoiseach, there was a major change in the proposals brought before the Cabinet and the public, as reported in all newspapers.  I am not giving away any Cabinet secrets on this; the new Taoiseach who assumed office brought new Ministers with him and proposed that the present situation in the IDA should be maintained.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, is on record as supporting the Culliton report, as then proposed, he admitted that in this House.  I will be interested to hear his justification for changing his position. Obviously, because of the Programme for Government the Minister agreed, the Labour Party had to make a major compromise in its position in accepting the Taoiseach's line that Forfás, as it is now called, would be the new super body and that in effect, the IDA would continue with two subsidiary bodies, one of which would deal with attracting foreign industry and the other with the promotion of indigenous industry.</P>
    <P>Therefore, instead of achieving the objective of Culliton &mdash; under which we would have two dynamic organisations in healthy competition with each other, one out on the world stage seeking to attract foreign investment here, the other, if you like, competing with it but with the same <Col N="2113" /> objective, of helping to create jobs by promoting the development of indigenous industry &mdash; the IDA has nobbled the whole idea and succeeded in getting the two parties in Government to agree to it. Having been in office I know that in Government Departments, semi-State bodies or any other organisation set up under the umbrella of the State, there is a huge reluctance to accept any change or to relinquish any area of responsibility. It is their doctrine.  Those who achieve position of authority in the Civil Service or in State bodies feel that they must defend their realm on behalf of everybody who works in their organisation.</P>
    <P>While one would have expected senior executives of the IDA to launch a campaign to preserve the <i>status quo,</i> what is surprising is that they have succeeded. Their objective to preserve the <i>status quo</i> within the State structure is totally separate from the objective to create employment.  The strong message in the Culliton report was that there was a need for change if we were to get up off our knees and succeed in creating the number of new jobs required to eat into our horrendous unemployment figures.  It is tragic that such a dynamic and far-seeing report is being nobbled in this way and that it will be ineffective.</P>
    <P>The Minister has claimed that he is implementing the Culliton report, but this is just a charade.  He is not implementing the report but doing the exact opposite to what it stated was essential if we were to make reasonable progress in creating employment.  It is a source of despair that senior Government Ministers can be nobbled so easily and directed away from sincerly held beliefs. They endorsed this major report when it was produced by eminent people.  It was acclaimed as one of the finest reports ever published.  They gave us some hope that at last something realistic might be done to create employment.  We will not succeed in creating large numbers of new jobs unless there is major change.  This means taking steps and being progressive.</P>
    <P>This is a step backwards towards the malaise identified by people such as <Col N="2114" /> Senator Joe Lee, to whom the Minister referred earlier, and others who have studied what has happened in the State since it was founded.  We are never going to break free from those shackles if we pay heed to the vested interests, but that is what the Minister is doing.  I sat in the House this morning to hear what justification he would put forward in proposing that we should have this umbrella organisation and two subsidiaries, one of which would attract foreign industry while the other would promote indigenous industry.  The reasons the Minister has given are astonishing and pathetic. He said that because the IDA has a large land bank he would have a major difficulty in deciding on the way it should be allocated as between foreign and indigenous industry.  That is a minor detail and could be easily resolved by giving instructions to the people involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no justification in putting that forward as a reason for setting up Forfás &mdash; I do not know what this word means; it is a bastardisation that does not come off the tongue too easily &mdash; which is going to be another quango and allow us to be influenced by those who do not want to see any changes made, who are looking after their own interests rather than trying to create structures to give us some hope of creating employment, in particular for our young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another reason the Minister put forward was that he would have difficulty in allocating staff between the two organisations. Therefore his solution is to create three organisations.  The Minister would have no difficulty in allocating staff between the two organisations.  Indeed it was not proposed that we should set up a private organisation and remove staff from the semi-State sector; they would be retained in that sector and given new opportunities to gain promotion to new managerial positions.  They would have welcomed that opportunity.  This would be a simple administrative arrangement <Col N="2115" /> and would not cause any trauma in trade union or staff circles.</P>
    <P>The Minister has his priorities wrong. He is using the administrative difficulties he foresaw as a reason to retain the old IDA, which will now be known as Forfás and have two subsidiaries.  I am astonished and I am sure people outside the House will despair at our ability to succeed in tackling our major unemployment problem by establishing two dynamic industrial promotion agencies, one of which would concentrate on the promotion of indigenous industry while the other would scour the world stage to attract foreign investment to create employment here.</P>
    <P>While the IDA has had some success in attracting foreign investment, it has not had success in developing indigenous industry.  I come from a town which has benefited from the work of the IDA. While it has attracted a number of foreign industries, it does not have a successful record in developing indigenous industry in Galway.  We have had successes and tragedies.  We had 20 years of success at Digital, but when the time came the international board made a decision which has affected us very badly with the result that we are going to lose 1,200 to 1,300 jobs at that plant.  That is the risk one takes.  There is a need therefore to ensure that we minimise the risk by developing indigenous industry.  This is what the Culliton report recommended.</P>
    <P>The Minister has however turned this report on its head.  He can shake his head, make flowery speeches and sound sincere; but the reality is that he is moving in the opposite direction.  It must be a source of embarrassment for the gentleman concerned, who has now moved on to other things, to see the way in which the thrust of the major report he produced is being twisted and turned by those in Government.  I can only come to the conclusion that the only reason the Minister is making this compromise against his better judgment &mdash; he described it as such on the part of the Labour Party &mdash; is that he wishes to keep <Col N="2116" /> himself and his party in office, but that is not a very good reason.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to respond to a number of the points that have been made.  Let us start at the beginning.  The Culliton Review Group produced a report which contained over 60 recommendations one of which was that we should restructure the agencies involved to ensure clarity and avoid confusion. Second, the report stated that, even if we were to do all the other things, at best between 10,000 and 15,000 jobs would be created in the industrial sector.  If one uses a multiplier of one, one and a half or two perhaps we are talking about 20,000 jobs.  The report also stated &mdash; it should be remembered that there was more than one person on the review committee &mdash; that while this in itself would not resolve our major unemployment problem, nevertheless it was essential and necessary that we do this.</P>
      <P>When the Culliton report was published I was the Labour Party spokesperson on Finance.  I welcomed the thrust of the report and its recommendations, one of which was, as I said, that we should restructure the agencies involved.  Under this Bill these agencies will be restructured. As Deputy Rabbitte said, it is enabling legislation.</P>
      <P>I am the Minister responsible and it looks as if I will have about four years to deal with the hard edge, as was described by Deputy Rabbitte, of the problem.  I do not want to waste precious time &mdash; even though I do not like this phrase, it is the one that was used by Deputy Bruton &mdash; in managing an empire.  I want to maximise the available resources so that I can, to use another phrase the Deputy used, go to war on the real enemy, which is the outrageous level of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rightly or wrongly, I have to make decisions and I have decided from the point of view of industry, that there must be clarity in availing of the services provided by the State.  In ensuring clarity for the citizen, as customer and entrepreneur, there is a requirement for the kind of structure that we propose to <Col N="2117" /> establish.  While it may appear complicated from this side of the counter this does not mean, as in the case of Roadstone Cement Holdings, that it is going to be complicated, obscure or bureaucratic from the other side of the counter.  Let me explain the reasons.</P>
    <P>First &mdash; I think we would all agree on this &mdash; IDA Ireland, the most successful component, will be the easiest component to establish and construct. Deputy Molloy referred to simple administration arrangements for dealing with staff, etc.  That may be his perception, but from my experience, I do not think simple administrative arrangements are adequate for staff in the public service who want to see the small print in legislation. Unless the small print can be referred to then the arrangements are no longer simple.  This mechanism gives us the most simple administrative arrangement through the vehicle of Forfás.  Likewise, in regard to land, pensions and many other matters, it is the most simple administrative arrangement.</P>
    <P>This is not the justification for Forfás, and if I misled the House by giving that impression I want to correct it now. There is a more fundamental reason for setting up Forfás.  The IDA has been successful in the international field but it has, by everybody's admission, not been successful in the domestic field, except in respect of one body, the IDA itself. Senator Lee's book indicates that the IDA ran rings around successive departmental secretaries and, dare I say it in the presence of Deputy Molloy, respected senior politicians.  It ran rings around Kildare Street to such an extent that, as Senator Lee states in his book, effective industrial&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, I hope I have both the humility and wisdom to learn from the mistakes of others and not to repeat them.  According to Senator Lee, the rot started in 1969 when the Act was introduced.  I was in Cabinet for four years between 1983-87 and witnessed the <Col N="2118" /> nonsenical row which took place over the National Development Corporation. I viewed from the outside the different points put forward about a super agency and two separate agencies.  The only winner in that argument was the permanent establishment which will never have to deal with unemployment.  I make no apology for deciding that I would not get involved in that kind of game &mdash; one would have to be up all day and all night to play it.  The people who play this game do not have a constituency to worry about or anything else on their agenda.</P>
      <P>On a policy level, Forfás will &mdash; Deputy Bruton's legitimate point about policy &mdash; be independent of the operational work of IDA Ireland, advise and help in the development of policy with the Department. Policy, and industrial policy, recommended in the Culliton report and its analysis by Senator Lee &mdash; he articulated this again in the Seanad &mdash; will be a matter for the Department of Enterprise and Employment, where it has not effectively been for the past ten to 15 years for a variety of reasons.  I want to do this as quickly and as effectively as possible with a team which has all the hallmarks of humanity, in other words, people who are like the rest of us &mdash; some brilliant, some turned on, some turned off, some tired and some burned out.  What else is new?  I am not going to waste time trying to put in place an extraordinary structure.</P>
      <P>I want to put this matter into context. I came into a new Department with a new Secretary on 12 January last.  This Department has buildings in three locations.  Using the telephone system we could not even communicate internally not to mention with other Departments. The organisational structure of the Department was tired to say the least. Even though the building had been cleaned up on the outside, it had all the hallmarks on the inside of an organisational structure locked in the sixties.  I think Deputy O'Malley will concur with those points.</P>

      <P>On 4 May last the Government published its decisions &mdash; not the consequences of its rows &mdash; on how it would implement the recommendations of the Moriarty task force.  These decisions, which are outlined in the document, <i>Employment Through Enterprise,</i> will be very difficult to implement.  All of us have, in some way, hidden behind the recommendations of the Culliton report. Deputy Rabbitte referred to them as, &ldquo;a kind of mantra&rdquo;.  It is time to implement the recommendations.  In terms of the support provided by the State to indigenous industry as distinct from foreign industry, the Culliton report recommended the need for clarity and for science and technology, financial support, marketing, etc. to be taken together.  One way of doing this was to merge An Bord Tráchtála, Eolas and the IDA into one group and then divide them into two separate agencies.  The Culliton report did not outline precisely how this should be done.  Rather it recommended that these things should be delivered with clarity.</P>

I do not know of any design process or structure where the sketch design, to use an architectural phrase, has not had to be transformed when one reached the nuts and bolts stage, so to speak.  I was given the job of dealing with the nuts and bolts stage of this issue and I am convinced, having regard to the time frame, the resources available, and, dare I say it, the legacy which came with this matter that Forfás is the best interactive structure to co-ordinate the activities of the Departments of Tourism and Trade, Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Enterprise and Employment and ensure <Col N="2121" /> a link between the various agencies in the delivery to Irish entrepreneurs and industrialists of the support they need. That is the net point; it is the final test. This structure will be tested against one criterion, that is, does it meet the needs of Irish industry and deliver clarity, effectiveness and speed in terms of the support Irish industry needs if it is to develop. That is the ultimate test.  Given the constraints I outlined and the legacy I inherited, this structure &mdash; I may be wrong, but I will take responsibility &mdash; offers me the best prospect of dealing with our unemployment problem.  I will be happy to come to the House in two or three years and show how this structure has stood the test of time.</P>
      <P>The balance which will be retained within Forfás, in terms of moving resources from one agency to another and moving emphasis, will cover some of the policy issues referred to by Deputies Molloy and Bruton, for example, the linkages between foreign and domestic companies.  Forfás will enable us to respond to those moving linkages in a way that is different from the division right down the middle between exclusively foreign and exclusively indigenous industries, which is part of the thrust of the original recommendation in the Culliton report, with which I did not agree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to say a few words after the Minister.  What we have just heard is an incredible performance, a purported justification for what he is doing &mdash; for doing the very opposite to what Culliton recommended, what I wanted to do and what he himself when he sat in the Opposition benches less than a year ago agreed with me should be done.  Instead of being open and honest and telling us why he is doing what he is doing, he attempts to justify himself in the most peculiar and extraordinary fashion.  The justification is inadequate and, if I may say so, incompetent. I can criticise the Minister for those deficiencies in his arguments but what I do not accept is his description of the Department he inherited.  He <Col N="2122" /> described it as tired, disorganised and used a whole lot of other words which I was so amazed to hear that I did not write them down but which I will read with some interest.</P>
      <P>I can only assume from what the Minister has said that that is the reason a young, active and able Secretary of the Department of Industry and Commerce is no longer there.  I think that is deplorable. If ever there was a man who was not tired and who had clearly shown he could reorganise that Department and bring the policy aspect back into dominance, it was the former Secretary.  He did it during the 12 months in which he and I were there, but he has now departed from the Department and has moved into a very minor Department.  If I am not mistaken, that man is still in his thirties and that is an indication of his alleged tiredness. Frankly, I think that was deplorable. If the present Minister knew the work that was put into the Culliton committee and the support that was given to it and subsequently the work that was done in my efforts to have it implemented &mdash; unhappily, unsuccessfully &mdash; by an Assistant Secretary, not the Assistant Secretary who is in this House at present, he would agree that it was absolutely outstanding.  The dedication and vision they brought to their work and the enthusiasm they had for what they were doing, and their absolute acceptance of why it was being done and the need to do it was quite outstanding.  They had a willingness to make very major organisational and other changes in the Department as were made, and anyone can see the changes that were made, during the year 1991-92. The Minister is reading the situation very wrongly and very unfairly.  He described the problems he inherited, but I do no think he was even aware of what he inherited because the Secretary went on the first or second day.</P>

      <P>I do not know how long he was there, but he certainly did not remain there very long.  He may have <Col N="2123" /> remained a week, I do not know.  I wonder if the Minister had any opportunity to realise the potential of his staff and the degree of change that the Department had already gone through in the previous 12 months.</P>
      <P>All of this is some kind of attempted justification for what he is doing, because he is attempting to justify the fact that he is doing the very opposite of what he said to me in this House repeatedly, and not just once, since the publication of the Culliton report in January 1992.  That report was discussed in the course of the debate on the Industrial Development Bill, during the debate on the Estimates and was raised repeatedly in parliamentary questions.  The Minister is seeking to justify what he, I, Culliton and the Department of Industry and Commerce know will not work.  To my mind the arguments he makes are just ridiculous. One of the many thrusts running through Culliton is that we should reduce significantly the number of extraneous bodies and that the main policy function should be resumed by the Department. That was being accomplished right throughout 1992, and very successfully so.</P>

      <P>Where previously we had one body we will now have three, as well as the additional layer between the line of bodies, Forbairt and IDA Ireland and the Department.  That layer comprised of Forfás is a nonsense and has been set up for reasons that have nothing to do with out efforts to try to conquer unemployment or to attack unemployment but for all kinds of personal and political reasons, some of which are related to me personally and perhaps would never be there if I had not happened to be the Minister during the past year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly, this is abundantly <Col N="2124" /> ridiculous.  There are subtle little provisions in the Bill &mdash; one would need to know the whole background to realise the significance of them &mdash; which make it clear that Forfás and not the two line agencies will be the dominant organisation and that the proposal to appoint the senior man to it, which has not been denied, is clearly an indication of that. That is entirely wrong.  It will not work. It is a great pity that at this time, when we have the awful problem of over 300,000 of our people unemployed, we have inflicted on us a mish-mash of institutions which everyone agrees makes no sense.  This mish-mash has been inflicted on us for invalid reasons to do with personality politics and institutional welfare. Frankly, that is not good enough. The Minister was very critical of the IDA's ability to run rings around Kildare Street; but, if they did that in the past, they can certainly celebrate the Industrial Development Bill, 1993 as their greatest triumph ever.  If the Minister feels this is liable to happen he would do much better to take any such institutional challenge head on rather than try to hide behind another layer of bureaucracy in which he seeks to insulate himself from the IDA.  That is not the way to go about it.  If the Minister wants to take them on he simply takes them on face to face and does not create a further layer that will complicate the whole situation much more.  In so far as Forbairt and Forfás are concerned, it was clearly intended in the draft legislation I circulated last year that An Bord Tráchtála would be included.  It makes absolutely no sense that it is not included, and the reasons are set out very clearly in Culliton.  It was also intended that the industrial training part of FÁS would be included for very compelling reasons as set out in Culliton.  That is not happening either.  These are going to remain in existence.  We find that three of the major component parts of the development of Irish industry are now reporting to three different Departments, the Departments of Enterprise and Employment, Tourism and Trade &mdash; to which an Bord Tráchtála is gone &mdash; and Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  If <Col N="2125" /> ever there was a recipe for disaster that is it.  Anyone who has ever looked at the matter objectively from the outside or experienced it objectively on the inside knows that too.  That will not work.  On top of all these things, the 36 county enterprise boards &mdash; established by this Bill &mdash; which nobody ever recommended and which were never approved or examined by the last Government were lobbed on to the Cabinet table one day in the form of a press release&mdash;&mdash;</P>

These county enterprise boards are heaped onto all the bodies being created by this Bill.  That is not the end, we are told we will have Bord Bia.

The debate has taken a sad turn when it revolves around organisations frustrating the Minister, and about burnt out and tired people.  It has brought the debate to the lowest level.  It is sad that we did not have an opportunity to debate the role of An Bord Tráchtála and so many other matters we wanted to debate. Even the Minister stayed up overnight to prepare 11 amendments on which there will be no debate.  It is a very poor reflection on the way we do business.</P>

      <P>It is regrettable that the media have absented themselves from this debate.  For once, a debate on a Bill has exposed the shallowness of the response to what is our greatest problem in society, the problem of 300,000 people unemployed.  They had looked to this much promised measure &mdash; which received the greatest hype that has surrounded any Bill brought before this House &mdash; in terms of industrial policy <Col N="2127" /> and what we have is a new plethora of agencies based on the fact that the Minister, apparently, is reluctant to take on the personnel and other managerial implications.  The mission statement of Culliton &mdash; and this is a suitable note on which to leave the debate &mdash; states:</P>
      <P>We need a spirit of self-reliance, (a determination to take charge of our own future).</P>
      <P>It would appear that the responsible Minister is reluctant to even take charge of his own Department and the agencies that report to him.  We simply cannot have a situation where the major industrial agency, the IDA&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.  &mdash;Where a respondent to a claim for redress under the Unfair Dismissals Acts disputes that the claimant was an employee of the respondent, it shall be conclusive proof that the claimant was an employee of the respondent if it is shown to the satisfaction of the Tribunal that the respondent was responsible at law for deduction of the tax and social insurance contributions of the claimant.&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>It is shameful we have so little time that I am anxious not to take up too much time with this amendment, though I consider it important.  I would like to think we would get to the amendment regarding dismissal for pregnancy-related reasons, which is the major defect in this Bill.  It is important that we get around to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a nutshell, this amendment relates to the fact that the Act defines a contract of employment as a contract of service, and where there is a dispute about the <Col N="2131" /> contract the onus is on the claimant to establish his status under the Bill.  Having regard to the fact that there has been great fragmentation of the workforce, this is a factor that is coming more and more into play.  I would like to hear the Minister's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 1 of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, contains definitions of what for the purposes of the Act are to be meant by &ldquo;contract of employment&rdquo;, &ldquo;employee&rdquo; and &ldquo;employer&rdquo;.  In cases of dispute these are matters for the tribunal to decide.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, Deputy Rabbitte referred to being aware of contracts being devised expressly for the purposes of circumventing the terms of the Unfair Dismissals Act.  In this context I would draw the Deputy's attention to the provisions of section 13 of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977.  That section expressly provides that a provision in an agreement &mdash; whether a contract of employment or not &mdash; shall be void in so far as it purports to exclude or limit the application of, or is inconsistent with, any provision of the Act.  Accordingly, any contract including as an express condition that the terms of the Unfair Dismissals Act do not apply will simply not work as that provision will, in point of fact, be null and void.</P>
      <P>In regard to contracts for services, to which the Deputy referred, it is not intended that this Bill would extend to persons engaged under such contracts the protection of unfair dismissals legislation. For the purpose of labour protection legislation generally, eligibility of persons depends on their employment status.  The scope of such legislation generally extends to persons who are engaged under a contract of service or apprenticeship and who otherwise fulfil the eligibility requirements of the legislation concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a rule, persons engaged under a contract for services would fall outside the scope of labour protection legislation. In cases of dispute or doubt, determination <Col N="2132" /> as to whether any individual falls within the scope of labour protection legislation would be a matter for the relevant adjudicative authority, for example, rights commissioner, tribunal or the courts.  In this connection the nature of the contract between the parties would be a central consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte's amendment could, as was pointed out by Deputy McDowell on Committee Stage, have the undesired effect of including within the scope of the Act groups of persons whom the Deputy would not intend &mdash; for example, directors of limited liability companies &mdash; or could confuse the employment relationship which exists with other employees, for instance, teachers.</P>
    <P>The extension of the scope of the legislation to include contracts for services would involve a fundamental change in the purpose of labour protection legislation, a change which is not envisaged among the purposes of this Bill.  Therefore, I do not intend to accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be willing to countenance the appalling vista of directors coming under the provisions of this Act if I thought it would give protection to the tens of thousands of workers who find themselves excluded for the reasons I have explained.  I do not accept that section 13 of the old Act gives this protection. There is a grey area.  I adduced some of the authorities the last day.  Mary Redmond has written extensively on this subject.  I referred to the remarks of Lord Wedderburn.  There is an issue here, but because of the importance of what I mentioned earlier I am not pressing it.</P>

There is an issue of concern to employees here and the way I proposed to deal with it would not have involved associated difficulties.  It would have been simply a matter for the Department of Social Welfare to adjudicate on.  I hope we will have a chance of coming back to this matter at some stage in the future.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  the substitution of `nine months&rdquo; for `one year's' in paragraph (a)  of subsection (1),&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On the last occasion the Minister made the not unreasonable point that whether the required period to be eligible for the protection of the Act is nine months or 12 months, it can be obviated by an employer who is so minded.  In other words, if the threshold were nine months, contracts could be formulated to last eight months and so on.  I accept that is a weakness in what I am seeking to do.</P>
      <P>The Minister when replying may wish to refer to the effects of what she proposes in amendment No. 4.  That amendment might address more comprehensively the problem I am seeking to cover here.  The problem to which I refer is that of people not having the protection of the Act because they may not have the requisite service.  Work procedures have been deliberately constructed so that this is the case.  The Minister's amendment No. 4 seems to go some way towards addressing this problem.</P>

      <P>The points I put forward on Tuesday remain the points at issue.  No matter what cut-off period is decided in respect of the number of months some employers will circumvent the legislation in place.  Such employers would work ahead of whatever time limit was set in this regard.  Deputy Rabbitte has admitted that this is the position.  I have no new argument or point to put forward on amendment No. 2.  I reiterate what I said the other day.  There is a provision in the 1977 Act to which I <Col N="2134" /> referred the other day.  That provision allows the Minister of the day to change by order the length of the service requirement. It is not necessary for a change in relation to service requirement to be dealt with in the Dáil; it can be dealt with by ministerial order.  If during the course of my time in this job it seems the provision in regard to this matter should be changed, it can be changed.</P>

      <P>The average probation period for employees is three months; in some cases it may be six months.

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) in paragraph (a) of subsection (2), by the insertion after `fixed term' of the following:</P>
      <P>`save where the Tribunal decides that the purpose of the contract was to circumvent the terms of this Act,', and&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an important amendment.  I am not sure if I have properly constructed it. It is designed to deal with a phenomenon that is now widespread.  Employers now take professional advice in regard to contracts and deliberately design contracts to ensure that the requisite 12 months' service is not clocked up by employees, who nonetheless remain in their employment or are re-engaged immediately after a break of service.  In other words, 11 month contracts are widely used so that the protection of the Act is not afforded to the employees.  Re-engaging people in employment after a period of one week, three weeks or a month is a widespread phenomenon.  Notwithstanding the exemptions in that section of the Principal Act, where the purpose of a contract <Col N="2135" /> is manifestly to provide the employer with an avoidance of liability under the Act, this amendment seeks to provide that the tribunal should have power in that case to decide, &mdash; even though the claimant may not have 12 months' service &mdash; that they are entitled to redress under the Act.  Where the contract is manifestly for the proposed of avoiding protection of the Act being afforded to the employee, the tribunal can decide that seized of the facts and circumstances and notwithstanding the 12 months threshold requirement, an employee appealing to the tribunal is entitled to be heard and to an adjudication and, if that is successful, to an award.  The employee is entitled to that if the employer is considered to have deliberately constructed the contract so as to remove protection that the employee could otherwise reasonably have expected.</P>

      <P>Credit must be given to Deputy McDowell for pointing out what would have been a very substantial loophole in the legislation.  This Minister's amendment achieves what Deputy Rabbitte is seeking to do in his amendment. It is a welcome improvement.  Many employees will be grateful for this provision. The re-employment of staff may be a major area of abuse.  It would have been a major oversight if this matter had not been spotted.  I commend Deputy McDowell and welcome the Minister's response.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am overcome by all this niceness.  Deputy Rabbitte's amendment No. 3 sparked off issues relating to amendment No. 4.  Deputy Rabbitte's amendment provides for amending section 2 (2) (a) of the 1977 Act.  That paragraph refers only to such fixed term contracts as were made before 16 September 1976 and would not have much practical application now.  However, that might be just a drafting slip.  I am sympathetic to Deputy Rabbitte's idea.  Last Tuesday I said I would consider this matter again.  The central thrust of the arguments put forward by Deputies MacDowell, Rabbitte and Flaherty has struck a chord with me.  We have all encountered cases in our constituencies of people having been let go on contracts. Abuses are being perpetrated in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my view that Deputy Rabbitte's amendment is addressed by section 3 of the Bill.  The section amends section 2 (2) of the 1977 Act by inserting a proviso excluding from that subsection coverage by the Act of certain fixed terms and fixed purpose contracts of employment.  The proviso will allow a rights commissioner, the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Circuit Court to examine any second or subsequent fixed term of fixed purpose contract of employment and to take a view as to whether the fixed nature of the contract was wholly or partly for or connected with that.  Accordingly, the amendment proposed by Deputy Rabbitte is not necessary in this context. Amendment No. 4 aims at tackling a similar evasion type problem in regard to <Col N="2137" /> ordinary contracts of employment, that is, not fixed term contracts.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that one can make an evaluation between the merits of the Minister's amendment and mine.  If the expert advice is that the Minister's amendment is more comprehensive or safer, I am happy to withdraw my amendment. I do not think it is correct that my amendment relates to the position obtaining before the 16th day of September 1976.  That is in section 2 (a) of the previous Act.</P>

It is entirely appropriate to give credit to Deputy McDowell for suggesting the remedy but I will not concede that he spotted the loophole.  I spotted the loophole and only because, as the Minister said, people frequently ask me whether they have a remedy under the Act.  They do not because the contract puts them outside its scope.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) the insertion of the following subsection after subsection (4):</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2138" /> `(5) Notwithstanding subsection (4) of this section, the dismissal (not being a dismissal referred to in the proviso (inserted by the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Act, 1993) to subsection (2) of this section) of an employee followed by his re-employment by the same employer not later than 26 weeks after the dismissal shall not operate to break the continuity of service of the employee with the employer if the dismissal was wholly or partly for or was connected with the purpose of the avoidance of liability under this Act.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide that a rights commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal should have the discretion to consider whether the dismissal of an employee by an employer, followed by the re-employment of the employee within 26 weeks of the dismissal, was used for the purpose of avoiding obligations under unfair dismissals legislation and where it is so decided it shall not operate to break the continuity of service of the employee.</P>
    <P>This amendment will provide a remedy for certain employees who find themselves in a situation where their employer persistently breaks their service by dismissal after 11 or 11½ months of successive contracts so as to prevent them gaining the 12 months service necessary to qualify for protection under the Unfair Dismissals Act.  When this legislation is passed, it will be possible for such cases to be brough before a rights commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
    <P>The fact that this problem was highlighted indicates the value of a Committee Stage debate and the expertise &mdash; which I freely admit &mdash; of Members with a constituency and professional background who have a receptive ear.  My attention was engaged because the point raised brought to mind immediately cases I have dealt with.  Deputy Cullen was unable to be present due to business commitments but he was ably represented by Deputy McDowell.  We had a heated <Col N="2139" /> debate in his absence and this amendment is the result of those exchanges. Some think that Bills when introduced are perfect and do not need to be amended but we should be always prepared to consider amendments.  That is not to say that I will accept more amendments.

      <P>These issues were discussed extensively on Committee Stage when we indicated our dissatisfaction that the Minister was unwilling to include such a provision in the Bill.  While it is against the law to dismiss a woman for any condition associated with a pregnancy, many ways are being found around this.  Women are being dismissed as a result of conditions relating to pregnancy.  The Minister said she would rather postpone a decision on this issue for a further 18 months until the EC Directive is introduced and becomes the responsibility of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  This Bill will require amendment at that time.  The Bill should be amended now and this protection given to women immediately.</P>

      <P>The European amendment has been accepted by us and legislation to take account of it is in the course of preparation.</P>
      <P>While it is the role of the Opposition to put forward their point of view on any issue it is my duty also to express my view.  We have embraced wholeheartedly the Social Charter on which discussions are taking place.  One of my predecessors &mdash; Deputy Cowen or Deputy Bertie Ahern &mdash; were in office when the directive on pregnancy was accepted.  Last month in Brussels we spent a long day and a night discussing the 48 hour week. The intentions of this country &mdash; supported by all Members &mdash; towards the Social Charter are clear and no one can say that any one party is more thorough about this issue than another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislation will be required to implement the terms of the EC Directive as outlined in the Programme for Government.  It is hoped to introduce the legislation by October 1994 and it will go beyond the amendments tabled by the Deputies.  The 1977 Act caters for women deemed to have been dismissed due to their pregnancy.  If a woman was dismissed in such circumstances the three remedies open to the Employment <Col N="2141" /> Appeals Tribunal are reinstatement, re-engagement or payment of compensation.</P>
    <P>This issue was not raised strongly either on Second or Committee Stage but there was a long debate in the Seanad on why so many employees here were awarded monetary compensation by the tribunal.  It did not rule in favour of reinstatement or re-engagement.  It was felt that this had something to do with the size of the towns and villages where people worked and the difficulty people would have getting on with others if they were reinstated.</P>
    <P>That should not be the case but it was. I do not know if the fault is due to our personalities, not being able to cross the bridges.  I do not know the ratio of monetary compensation awards to reinstatement or re-engagement but there were monetary compensation awards.  Most of the compensation involved the payment of two years salary but those cases are rare.</P>
    <P>The directive proposes, for example, that the woman should retain her job. There will be, by law, the need for a risk assessment when a woman indicates she is pregnant and requests, because of her pregnancy, particular care in her job.  It is correct that she should and where a risk assessment reveals a possible danger to the health or safety of a pregnant woman, that woman must be transferred to alternative duties.  If the firm has no alternative duty for the woman, special <Col N="2142" /> maternity leave, to be paid for by the employer and-or the State, will be granted, under that directive.  It is strongly in favour of the interests of women that we do not proceed in a piecemeal fashion in very important legislation for women, dealing with very important safeguards for women's well-being and health as well as for their jobs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan) Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed to maintaining and expanding the Irish registered merchant fleet in order to maximise the job opportunities in the shipping sector, to improve services available to customers and to ensure the highest standards of safety.</P>
      <P>In line with that commitment, an overall review of shipping policy has been initiated with a view to identifying the strategies necessary to achieve improved competitiveness, operating standards and modernisation of the Irish merchant fleet.  Consideration is being given in particular to ways in which the regulatory and fiscal climate for the shipping sector can be enhanced in order to support those objectives.  The review is being undertaken in close consultation with the industry.  In that context, the Department is currently examining a number of proposals put forward recently by the Irish Chamber of Shipping for fiscal and operational incentives to support the sector's continued development.  Further discussions will take place with the Irish Chamber of Shipping shortly with a view to developing the substantive case for such support.</P>
      <P>The review is also being conducted in the context of efforts at Community level to identify positive measures which would enable Community fleets to compete more effectively while at the same time ensuring against distortions of competition between member states.  We will continue to support efforts to arrest the decline in Community fleets through the introduction of harmonised support measures on a Community-wide basis, while maintaining high standards of quality, reliability and safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am determined to ensure the continued viability and growth of the Irish <Col N="2146" /> shipping industry to service the needs of Irish importers and exporters as well as a revenue earner in its own right.  The fact that, as the Deputy points out, 20 per cent only of Irish trade is carried in Irish ships serves to underline the potential which exists for Irish-based shipping activity.  Additional Irish ships operating competitively in the short sea routes to mainland Europe could pick up a significant proportion of that business, with consequent benefits in terms of balance of payments and seagoing employment.</P>
    <P>The provision of high quality access transport services to and from Ireland is, of course, critical if we are to overcome the competitive disadvantages resulting from our island status and peripheral location.  The case for redressing this imbalance through the provision of EC funding for access transport has been vigorously pursued with the Commission. The Commission's continued difficulties with the Irish case for assistance for mobile assets is, frankly, quite disappointing. But the Government remains satisfied that the case is fully justified for practical measures to offset the unique disadvantages faced by this country. Accordingly, we will continue to press for EC support for access transport services.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, the present review of shipping policy is examining the case for fiscal and other incentives to assist the industry including the specific measures referred to by the Deputy.  Decisions as to the nature and scope of changes which might be sought under the Finance Act will depend on the outcome of that review process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State say whether moneys will be made available from the Cohesion Funds for our shipping industry?  In addition, can he explain why the business expansion scheme was withdrawn from this industry, particularly at a time when further investment was badly needed for expansion and replacement?  Furthermore, is he aware of the high costs involved?  I understand that the cost of replacing a ferry is something like £100 million, whereas it is £8 million in the case of a <Col N="2147" /> container ship.  While I appreciate that a review committee has been set up &mdash; which is the way this Government appears to deal with all problems, through committees and reviews &mdash; I am seeking action here.  Would the Minister of State agree that it has been proven that there is a possibility of 2,000 jobs being created over the next six years within this industry?  This would be one tangible way of demonstrating that we are positive in our thinking and are doing something positive about the unemployment position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree fully with the Deputy that there is potential for job creation in this area.  Indeed, that is the reason the Government has taken such a firm stand, particularly with its European counterparts, and has pressed its case for funding for mobile assets very forcibly and shall continue to do so.  Indeed, the way to do so is to discuss the matter, in consultation with the Irish Chamber of Shipping, so that we can put forward a case that is unanswerable in Europe. Hopefully we will get the requisite funding so that we can realise what we consider to be a great need for this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>As I asked in my question, will the Minister say whether he will seek changes in the Finance Acts since these are actions we can take ourselves? We can change Finance Acts to make leasing capital available for shipping activities, to increase capital allowances from 15 per cent to 50 per cent and reinstate the business expansion scheme for the shipping industry.  Would he agree that these are things over which we have control without having to go to Europe? Will the Minister of State say whether his Government will give a commitment that these changes in the Finance Acts will be effected as soon as possible?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 14 together.  A contract for the provision of a medium-range helicopter search and rescue service based at Shannon was placed by the Department of the Marine in June 1991 following a decision by the Government. This contract expires at the end of 1996 and is, I understand, operating in a satisfactory manner.</P>
      <P>The Government also decided in 1991 that the operation of a medium-range helicopter service by the Air Corps from 1997 should be fully examined and costed.  An interim report in this matter was received recently and is at present being examined by this Department. Consultation will, of course, take place with the Department of the Marine on the report.  It is not the practice to publish reports of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This must be one of the greatest scandals of all times, particularly of a time when we are talking about cutbacks and not being able to recruit people <Col N="2149" /> into the Air Corps or the Defence Forces. While commending the provision of that important service the reality is that a report has been presented to Government showing clearly that, had the Air Corps been allowed to purchase two medium-range helicopters over a period of 20 years, they could have operated that service for a figure of £3 million annually, whereas the contract given to the firm in question costs £5 million, an increase of £2 million annually over a five-year period as a result of mismanagement of this service.  Bearing in mind particularly that the Government was reviewing the overall position and seeking a report, would the Minister of State say why a five-year contract period was agreed, which was an exceptionally long one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>If everything Deputy Barrett said was true it would be a scandal. However, to rely on specifically leaked information to the newspapers is not a very good way of taking decisions or assessing what was the actual position. I do not accept any of the figures the Deputy has quoted, which were quoted in a newspaper article.  I might add that the Government decision was that the contract would run until the end of 1996 and, in the meantime, a review and full report would be compiled.  That report has now been compiled and is being studied carefully in the Department.  The decisions will be based on the facts rather than on specific leaked information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister of State is contradicting the newspaper reports what are the accurate figures?  Surely, the newspapers did not pull these figures out of the sky.  They must be based on some facts and the public are entitled to know how public money is being spent.  I would like to ask the Minister of State a direct question.  Does the report show that the Air Corps over a period of 20 years, could <Col N="2150" /> run this service more cheaply and what is the reason a five year contract was awarded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>It was decided that a contract should be placed.  As the Deputy will recall, this matter was the source of great controversy at the time and a decision had to be taken.  Because some people felt that the Air Corps rather than a private service should be used the Government decided to carry out a study and evaluate the cost that would be involved.  That study is ongoing.  I am sure that the report to which the Deputy is referring appeared in the <i>Irish Independent</i> among other newspapers but the statements made in that report are not correct.</P>

      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself that Ireland's fishery interests were taken into consideration by the EC before the recent EC agreements with Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia were signed; if in view of the fact that the EC is presently examining a request from Russia for a bilateral fisheries agreement, he will give the implications this proposed agreement with Russia could have on fishing grounds off our west coast which is the only place the Community can offer access to Russian fishing vessels; and the steps, if any, he intends to take to safeguard Irish fishing rights in that area.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to assure the Deputy that Irish fishery interests were given full consideration before the conclusion of fishing agreements between the EC and Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.</P>
      <P>In relation to a potential fisheries agreement between the EC and the Russian Federation, the European Commission presented its proposal for a new negotiating mandate at the March Fisheries Council of Ministers meeting.  The Deputy is correct is supposing that if the Commission's proposal for a new mandate was adopted in its present format by the Council any agreement which might ensue could allow Russian vessels access to the Irish zone of the north-east Atlantic. However, I would emphasise that this is merely the beginning of the discussions on this matter and I can confirm that our difficulties, on control, conservation, fleet management and balance grounds, with the possibility of Russian vessels fishing in our zone, have been voiced at the Community's external fisheries working group in the period since March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2152" /> The Commission's proposal for a new negotiating mandate is due to be considered in detail for the first time by the Fisheries Council of Ministers at its meeting today in Luxembourg.  I wish to assure the House that the interests of the Irish fishing industry in this matter, not only in relation to access to waters, but also as regards stock allocations and market access will be articulated at the Council.</P>
    <P>I should add that Ireland, both directly and as a member of the Community, is anxious to do everything possible to develop good relations with the Russian Federation and to facilitate its economic development, including the development of its fishing industry.  It would, however, be unreasonable to expect that, if this should be proposed, we could support Community development proposals for the Russian fishing industry which would operate to the disadvantage of the Irish fishing industry.  Any development of fishing activity to which Ireland would be party would have to address our disadvantaged position in our own waters. I am not satisfied that the mandate the Commission is seeking is consistent with that basic position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister of State say what benefits will accrue to Ireland, as a member of the European Community, under these agreements with Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia which were signed recently?  So far as I am aware, the only benefits that will accrue are reciprocal fishing rights.  Can the Minister State say what Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia have to offer in terms of reciprocal fishing rights and joint venture projects?  If those countries gain access to our one fishing block off our west and north-west coast this will have serious implications for our trawlers in terms of the catch landed.  The Minister of State has to realise that a substantial number of European Community fishing vessels are already operating in that zone. Indeed, 70 of those vessels are tied up at Castletownbere, Kinsale and Dunmore in protest against the EC fishing laws.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 9, 16, 28 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Defence intends to visit Somalia within the next few days in order to assess at first hand the situation in the region.  He will be assisted in evaluating operational conditions by the Assistant Chief of Staff and the Officer Commanding the proposed transport unit.  He will report to the House on the matter on his return.</P>
      <P>All necessary resources will be provided for the members of the Permanent Defence Forces, who will participate in the United Nations mission in Somalia, subject to the appropriate legislation being enacted and the approval by the Dáil of the necessary resolution.  I wish to state categorically that there is no basis whatever for the allegation about inadequacy of resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The military authorities have carried out a detailed assessment of the requirements for the proposed transport contingent. The equipment being supplied to the contingent is in accordance with this assessment in all respects.  The resources being provided include transport vehicles, a weather-haven self-contained camp unit costing some £360,000, <Col N="2155" /> weapons and signals and medical equipment.</P>
    <P>The Government decision to provide a transport company to UNOSOM II remains unchanged.  Conditions on the ground are being kept under close and continuing review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to state that no allegation is made in my question with regard to resources; I am not the source of the allegation.  May I ask the Minister of State if he would indicate to the House what precise role UNOSOM plays in Somalia and what the rules of engagement are for United Nations' troops given, if the Government decision is maintained, that our troops will be posted there?  Is it true that the mandate of UNOSOM is so vague that the troops on the ground find it extremely difficult to intepret what they should be doing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the point by Deputy De Rossa in the first part of his supplementary.  I did not mean to point a finger at him for making the allegations. I think he knows the allegations to which I referred and I am happy to acknowledge that the Deputy made no such allegations.</P>
      <P>The Irish personnel in UNOSOM will be going to Somalia as a transport company. That is their primary function. According to the mandate, the mission is an international body established for the performance of duties of a police character, that is, for peace enforcement rather than peace keeping, as was previously the case.  The legislation relating to the mandate of the force will be general in nature.</P>

      <P>Even though the United Nations mission is peace enforcement, which is completely different from the missions in which Irish troops have been engaged to date, anyone who attacks UNOSOM is unlikely to make a distinction between a transport contingent and a contingent of heavily armed troops.  The Irish personnel in the transport <Col N="2156" /> company are likely to be casualties in circumstances in which UNOSOM decides to launch an assault in a particular area or against one of the gangs operating in Somalia.  The fact that they will be transport troops will not lessen the risks for them.  I have no doubt that the Irish troops are as brave as any other troops, but we need clarity on those precise risks.  Will the Minister outline the rules of engagement for UNOSOM in Somalia?  On what basis will the mission decide to make an assault?  Who will be in charge of the mission?  Is there a clear line of responsibility as to who makes the decisions?  What role will the Irish authorities have in the making of any such decisions?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the latter part of the Deputy's question, the normal procedure will apply &mdash; the full mission will be looked after by a commander-in-chief or a commanding officer.  The normal military structures will apply and the decisions will be made on that basis. This mission will not be different from a UNIFIL mission from the point of view of structures and order.  The difference is that this is a peace enforcement rather than a peace keeping mission.  The Irish transport company will have the capacity to defend itself against attack by local gangs.  It will have a sufficient supply of trained personnel and weapons for that purpose.  The transport company will be based in secure camps, will be escorted on all the movements it undertakes and, as it will be part of the overall force, will be privy to information and military intelligence.  As the Deputy correctly said, there will be risks involved &mdash; the transport company will have to go into areas where action may have to be taken.  The same applies to missions in Lebanon. Unfortunately one of our soldiers on a peace keeping mission in Lebanon was shot last year.  I accept that the risks will probably be higher in Somalia.  I give the Deputy a categoric assurance that every precaution will be taken to ensure the safety of Irish troops.</P>

      <P>My point is wider <Col N="2157" /> than simply the safety of Irish troops.  If Irish troops take an aggressive stance as part of a mission which is pursuing an aggressive intent, obviously there will be very serious risks.  Why has the Government decided to make a radical change in the role of our Defence Forces and the role of this country in international conflicts whereby we now propose to embark on a peace enforcement, as distinct from a peace keeping, mission? Given the size of our country, the size of our Defence Forces and our traditional policy in relation to international conflicts, will the Minister agree that it would be better for us to retain an honourable role as a peace keeper in the world under the auspices of the United Nations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief.  The UN is not going to Somalia with an aggressive intent; it does not have a mandate for aggression.  The mandate is designed in such a way that the UN force will be in a position to respond if it is subjected to aggression by local gangs, etc.  It is not fair to give the impression that the UN is going into Somalia with an aggressive intent.  This point needs to be underlined.</P>
      <P>The House will have an opportunity, under the legislation which will be introduced next week and the resolution which will be introduced the week after, to discuss the change in the role of our Defence Forces.  When we became a member of the UN we accepted its Charter. The UN has decided that this mission should be a peace enforcement mission. The House will have the opportunity to decide whether to agree to this change.</P>

      <P>The surveillance aircraft contact the Navy when they want particular action taken.  The surveillance operation covers all our areas of responsibility. The aircraft which was delivered in June 1991 has completed 258 maritime missions, which involved 1,252 hours surveillance flying.  It has recorded sightings of 3,584 fishing vessels.  That gives an idea of the work of one aircraft; but with the extra capacity, we will be able to cover much more.</P>

It is the Government's intention, subject to budgetary constraints, that whatever extra resources can be made available to the Navy will be made available.  It is no secret that the State benefits from fines for illegal fishing.  We would all like to see the fishery protection service expanded.</P>

    <P>At present there are about 11,000 names on lists of those who wish to join the Permanent Defence Force.  Down through the years the establishment figures have never been realised.  They are <Col N="2162" /> notional figures and have no relevance to actual current requirements.  The important figures in this respect are the strength figures, which are maintained at a sufficiently high level to enable the military authorities to carry out their allotted tasks at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, a radical overhaul of the structures and systems of the Defence Forces is to be carried out under the aegis of the efficiency audit group.  The first step in that exercise is a review of the roles of the Defence Forces and this is being actively pursued in consultation with the relevant interests, including the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.</P>
    <P>It is clear from studies already undertaken that there are serious imbalances in the distribution and deployment of military personnel with the result that disproportionate numbers are employed on administration and clerical duties, in the running of stores, on cooking and mess duties and on maintenance work. The review which is being undertaken should result in the much more efficient use of the vast resources involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the information provided.  I understand from the report of the PDFORRA Conference that recruitment ceased about three years ago.  The figures provided by the Minister indicate that current figures are about 5,000 under the establishment figure.  Recruitment is necessary in order to reduce the average age of the Defence Forces, which is quite high.  How soon does he think recruitment can commence?  I presume it can only commence when the review of the structures etc. and the roles has been completed.</P>

Details of all the recruitment to the Permanent Defence Force in 1992 are as follows: 50 Naval Service recruits, 32 <Col N="2163" /> Army apprentices, 30 Air Corps apprentices, 15 Army cadetships, eight Air Corps cadetships, six Naval Service cadetships, four Naval Service apprentices and two medical officers.  Department of Defence sanction is being sought for the recruitment of 36 Army apprentices and 30 Air Corps apprentices during 1993.</P>

      <P>From the figures I have given we will try to meet specific requirements and recruit accordingly.  General recruitment of sizeable numbers is subject to budget constraints and would be considered in the light of the review.  It would be my intention and that of the Minister to ensure that there would be no loss of personnel overall during the current year &mdash; in other words, that we would recruit in order to keep numbers at present levels.  We will have to review the situation when the efficiency audit group report becomes available.  Unfortunately, I am not in a position to indicate how soon that report will be made available but I can assure the Deputy it is receiving particular attention and is progressing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that some people see the Department of Defence as an easy target for expenditure cuts without thinking the issue through.  Would the Minister agree that we are getting into a very dangerous position in the Defence Forces because of the age profile and particularly in the light of our accepting extra responsibility on UN missions?  Would he agree in relation to peace enforcement that the UN have recommended that anybody who takes on that role should do so on a voluntary basis?  Many of the members of the Defence Forces are married with children and are perhaps hesitant to get involved in peace enforcement.  Is he satisfied that the numbers in aid of the civil power on Border duty are adequate <Col N="2164" /> and that members are not expected to serve long hours of duty over and above what would normally be expected of them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of later questions deal with some of these points.  The age profile is not at its optimum at present because of the lack of recruitment during the past number of years.  It would be desirable to have a slightly lower age profile; but, having said that, what you lose in youth and vigour you may gain in experience.  The change in the Defence (Amendment) Act will allow those currently serving to serve abroad on a voluntary basis.  In regard to those on Border duty, I am informed that at present the Defence Forces have sufficient numbers to carry out the duties required.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.  Before they are assigned to the Military Information Technology Section officers are required to have appropriate academic qualifications in computing.  Up to now these qualifications have usually been <Col N="2165" /> obtained by one of the following methods: a primary degree course at University College, Galway (UCG) under the scheme of third level education for newly commissioned officers followed by a one year post-graduate diploma course in computer science at University College, Cork (UCC); and a degree course in computer applications at Dublin City University (DCU) under the scheme of third level education for newly commissioned officers.</P>
      <P>At present the fees for a general degree course at UCG are £1,450 a year while the fees for the computer applications course are £1,834 a year.  Since the 1990-91 academic year there are no fees payable in respect of the diploma course at UCC.  For all courses the cost of books and other incidental expenses are borne by the Department and officers continue to be paid their normal pay while undergoing a course.</P>
      <P>The remuneration and conditions of service of personnel of the Permanent Defence Force come within the scope of the recently established conciliation and arbitration scheme for the force.  Any proposal to change the conditions of service of personnel employed in the information technology area would come within the ambit of the scheme.</P>

      <P>The proposed UN school will be contained within the existing infrastructure of the Military College and for that reason would entail very little extra cost.  It is basically to complement our peacekeeping training needs. At present there is a need for a central institution to study and devise the training programmes, to conduct and specifically design peacekeeping training, to study the operational implications of various UN mandates and analyse the training required to ensure that our troops in peacekeeping operations are properly prepared to fulfil the requirements of the specific mandate.  That is basically what would be involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it intended to make this school available to members of Defence Forces outside this country?  The original intention of the then Deputy Taylor-Quinn, who proposed the setting up of such a school, was that in view of the important role Ireland played in the past and will play in the future on UN missions and the experience we have gained in that regard, we should pass on that experience <Col N="2167" /> to others.  There is no reason we cannot develop that concept and provide adequate training for members of the Defence Forces from various parts of the world.  I refer the Minister to a document published by Boutros Boutros Ghali in which he pointed out that it was necessary to train troops in peace enforcement before taking on that important role.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy in relation to allowing members of Defence Forces from other countries to participate in this school.  There is no objection in principle to that.  In fact, we have much to offer other countries in regard to showing the way in relation to peace keeping skills, that has been recognised by the fact that our Defence Forces received a Nobel prize for peace keeping.  I assure the Deputy that there will be no problem in regard to that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35, 38, 42, 50 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased to have the opportunity in replying to a number of questions from Deputies relating to the Marine Institute, to re-emphasise the high priority which is being given to developing our national marine research capability.  I am also committed to ensuring that the institute, which will have the central role in meeting this challenge, is brought fully into operation as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Good incremental progress has been made since the appointment of the board some eight months ago and I am hopeful that outstanding matters can be advanced fairly quickly to enable the institute to become a full working reality without further delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strong commitment to strengthening the national marine research capability <Col N="2169" /> is reflected in the significant research funding provision in the Department Votes in 1992 and 1993 in addition to the grant-in-aid of £160,000 provided for the immediate setting-up costs of the institute this year.</P>
    <P>The gross funding provision of £2.896 million for marine research and development in 1993 reflects the marine research measures being funded under Ireland's STRIDE operational programme as well as the ongoing marine research programmes of the fisheries research centre. It recognises the development potential of the marine research area as well as the acknowledged need to apply additional resources to secure and develop that potential.  This significant level of funding is in the process of being transferred to the Marine Institute and will provide a solid basis for the work of the institute in co-ordinating and executing marine research priorities.</P>
    <P>We are also seeking to underpin the present level of investment in marine research facilities and programmes with further support from EC Structural Funds over the next six years.  In that regard I take this opportunity to thank the board of the institute for its constructive advice and input into the preparation of proposals as part of the national development plan.  I am confident that these funding proposals for the marine research area will stimulate additional development and related job creation in the marine sector.  In the meantime, I understand that the board is pressing ahead with a review and audit of national marine research capacity and priorities.  This review will be critical in determining the content of programmes to be undertaken in the immediate years ahead.</P>
    <P>The appointment of a chief executive and the transfer of staff to the institute will be critical steps forward in bringing it into full and effective operation.  Following recent ministerial approval of the terms and conditions which will apply to the appointment of a chief executive, I understand that the board intends to begin the process of recruitment shortly. Discussions are continuing with <Col N="2170" /> employee organisations in relation to the terms and conditions of employment for staff who move from the fisheries research centre to the institute.  I am committed to ensuring that all genuine concerns are met in a spirit of consensus and goodwill which will enable a smooth and successful transfer as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>We have an excellent and committed board which is working hard to place the institute on a solid foundation from the start and is already proceeding to deliver on its remit to advise on, co-ordinate and focus the national marine research effort. The institute's first annual report can be expected on completion of its first full year of operation, towards the end of 1993 and I assure the Deputies that the report will be made publicly available.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am very pleased to announce that this week I appointed Mr. Matt Murphy, Director of Sherkin Island research station, to be a member of the board of the institute.  Mr. Murphy has an unrivalled record in pressing the importance of marine research in national terms and I know he will bring enthusiasm and commitment to the work of the institute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be cordial relations between all aspects of the <Col N="2171" /> aquaculture sector and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  I have no objection to that and I am sure neither will the institute.  The thrust of the institute is to create an atmosphere in which fishing can become an important part of our economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>When exactly will the chief executive officer be appointed?  This matter has been ongoing for a long time. Will the Minister agree that it is a pointless exercise appointing an institute if there is no chief executive officer to run and manage it?  Will the Minister also agree it is essential that the institute be up and running as soon as possible as this country has lost enough to date because of a lack of proper development of our fisheries industry?</P>

      <P>The terms have been agreed and a person will be appointed shortly.  Of course, I agree that moneys invested in research are important. I have no objection to what the Deputy outlined.  We have fallen behind on research, particularly in the fisheries area, that is one of the reasons for setting up the institute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's expectation in regard to condial relations between the new institute and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and hope that will be the case.  What I want to find out is what working relationship there will be, given that the institute will be engaged in research, not for the sake of research, but presumably for the purpose of ensuring the protection of species and providing for the commercial exploitation of our fish industry.  Clearly since the remit of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara is to promote the consumption of fish both internationally and at home, there is a need not <Col N="2172" /> just for a cordial relationship but for a close relationship between the institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  Will the Minister indicate whether there will be a structured relationship rather than simply a cordial one?</P>
      <P>Finally, I would put it to the Minister that the major obstacle to the development of our aquaculture industry is the conflicting claims about the effects of fish farming.  It is essential that these conflicting claims be resolved and steps taken to ensure that our fish farming industry can grow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the greatest confidence that the board members will look at all aspects of activity the institute takes on.  That is one of the reasons I appointed Mr. Matt Murphy who will bring enthusiasm to the board.  Professor Maire Mulcahy, Chairperson of the board, is also an excellent person in her own right and a valuable person to have on that board.  I have the greatest confidence that aquaculture will be a major priority of the board in any future research into that area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan) Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can advise the Deputy that at the Council of Ministers meeting in Luxembourg on 8 June last I fully ventilated our concerns and objectives for priority action to improve maritime safety and prevent marine pollution.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to report that the Council unanimously endorsed a resolution outlining priority measures for a Community action programme which, when implemented should significantly contribute to the prevention of marine pollution around the Community coastlines. I am particularly gratified that measures which, at the Transport Council meeting last March, I identified as requiring immediate action have been earmarked for priority action.  These include the introduction of ship traffic control systems at Community and national level, additional port state control measures, including strengthened inspections and comprehensive reporting systems to cover vessels transiting along Community coasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most notably, however, the Community action programme highlights as a priority the urgent identification of environmentally sensitive areas and the adoption of measures for their protection. In this context I have informed EC colleagues that Ireland is pressing ahead with specific proposals to protect our coastline from potentially hazardous marine accidents.  Such avoidance measures are, for me, the immediate national priority.  I will shortly be bringing to the Commission and to the International Maritime Organisation detailed proposals which will require transiting tankers and other ships carrying dangerous cargoes to avoid vulnerable areas of the Irish coastline at distances ranging from at least 20 miles.  We have developed our proposals within the spirit of existing international guidelines and with full regard to the need to ensure that such measures are introduced and co-ordinated on a Community-wide basis.  I will, therefore, be urging the Commission <Col N="2174" /> to advance its work in this area at all possible speed.  In the meantime, I am confident of a favourable and constructive response from the Commission and the IMO to our proposals to protect the Irish coastline.</P>
    <P>In addition to the preventive measures which I have outlined, I am keeping under review our state of readiness for effective intervention in the event of a marine casualty.  The Irish Marine Emergency Service has responsibility for the co-ordination, at national level, of the Marine Counter Pollution Response and Safety of Life at Sea.  In addition to its own direct capabilities, IMES can call on a wide range of State and private services to supplement its resources in the event of a marine emergency.  The deployment of resources is as critical as the level of resources available.  Exercises to test national response procedures for marine emergencies, including communications exercise and simulated in-port exercise have been undertaken and further exercises are planned.  IMES has also been closely involved in recent major simulated marine pollution exercises undertaken by oil companies in Dublin Bay and off Tusker which involved all relevant agencies and authorities. In addition there are marine pollution response procedures in place at EC level under which the Community Task Force may be called on to assist with expertise and equipment in combating pollution threats in Irish waters.</P>
    <P>The Irish Marine Emergency Service as constituted provides a significant response capability in the event of a marine emergency both with regard to saving life and protecting the environment. That capability is, as I have said, under constant review.  I would stress again, however, the importance I attach to preventive measures and early warning systems to ensure that the risks of a major marine casualty around our coasts are minimised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Minister for his long reply.  I am delighted to hear him say he recognises that prevention is better than cure.  Will he and <Col N="2175" /> his Department lead the charge against those who have scant regard for the environment and our fishing industry when it comes to polluting, to dumping at sea, to oil companies transporting oil.  Unfortunately, there have been some casualties and it would appear to the layman that these tankers are becoming increasingly bigger and that fewer people are employed on them.  This should not be entirely about profit.  Those who are involved in the ownership of these tankers can well afford to have adequate staffing.  It is in that area that I would ask the Minister, at EC level, to raise this matter of staffing on board ships of a particular size carrying certain substances, a factor which must have a bearing on the number of casualties now happening at sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about this matter and intend going to Brussels to see Commissioner Matutes to outline our view on this issue because, as the Deputy has rightly pointed out, there are tankers plying the seas at present that are obsolete and, in fact, dangerous.  It is with this in mind that we see a 20 mile limit as the safety net for tankers transiting our waters.  I, and I am sure the Deputy, would not want to wake up some morning to the nightmare of a tanker aground off the Stag's Head or Mizen Head.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me ask the Minister to take up the issue of the flags of convenience problem which is really the most serious aspect in regard to contol of pollution.  In the vast majority of instances it is the ships over which the EC have no control, those sailing under flags of convenience, which cause pollution and, indeed, have crews which are not fully trained and that are exploited to an appalling degree in terms of conditions, wages etc.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I share the Deputy's concern about this issue.  At the last European Council meeting I took up this very matter with the Commission and <Col N="2176" /> outlined our views on it.  I felt it was necessary to put down a marker that we would not accept such exploitation.  The Deputy can be assured that the issue will be raised again at our next meeting on transport and safety.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan) Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland is uniquely situated to exploit the rich fishing waters of the North East Atlantic, where we have valuable quotas of both pelagic and demersal species. Fleet policy has accordingly developed along a two-pronged model.  One of these has encouraged the emergence of a powerful and efficient pelagic sector with an emphasis on ensuring bulk supplies of quality herring and mackerel to processors based primarily in the North West.  The other targets demersal stocks, particularly along the west coast where Ireland has traditionally underutilised its quota allocations.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the special whitefish scheme, introduced in 1992, skippers were encouraged to bring in specialised deepwater vessels which would target stocks of high value whitefish.  Seventeen of these vessels have now entered the fleet with a further three expected before the end of 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2177" /> I would also remind the Deputy that the campaign to modernise the Irish fleet received a major boost in April when the commission published its decisions on grant aid for the fleet.  Community funding of £1.3 million was secured for 23 modernisation projects, underpinning a total investment of around £4 million making this the most successful Irish grant aid tranche for a number of years. The next round will be made in October next and I will be pushing strongly at that point for further funding for modernisations.</P>
    <P>Utilisation of pelagic quotas, has remained steady at, or close to, 100 per cent over the last five years and, with the new whitefish capacity coming onstream, utilisation of west coast demersal quotas is expected to increase significantly.</P>
    <P>I would, however, sound a somewhat cautionary note in reminding the Deputy that Irish fleet development is circumscribed by the multiannual guidance programme for the fleet for the period 1993-96.  Although Ireland recorded a considerable success in the negotiations on this programme at Community level and although the programme does provide for some expansion in the Irish fleet over the next few years, nonetheless, the fleet targets set in the programme must be met, with obvious implications for fleet development in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Turning now to markets, Ireland is a net exporter of fisheries products and exports are growing strongly year to year. Over the five year period from 1987 to 1991 the value of these exports has grown from £124 million to £175 million. However, there is always room for improvement and we are continuing the search for new markets abroad, particularly for pelagic species.</P>
    <P>Many of the new markets identified are for processed fish products.  In this context I am happy to inform the Deputy that Ireland currently has in place a very successful programme for the development of fish processing with aid from the European Community.  Over the past three years over £25 million has been invested in projects in the processing sector with aid of over £11 million from <Col N="2178" /> the Community.  Almost 60 projects have been assisted and this will result in the creation of in excess of 500 new jobs and will serve to protect the long term viability of another 750 full and part-time jobs in the sector.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister is only six or seven months in office and is doing his best.  Would he agree that the potential of the Irish fishing industry has been totally neglected by successive Governments?  It is appalling that Ireland has 16 per cent of EC waters, 5 per cent of quotas and that we are behind other countries in regard to investment in our fishing industry.  Would the Minister agree that our vessels are inadequate to compete with what is happening in regard to fleet development in other countries? Our marketing and processing is behind that of other countries.  Emphasis has been placed on investment in agriculture for many years.  Would the Minister agree that the figure of approximately £145 million in respect of fish exports is tiny in comparison to agricultural exports?  Yet, we are an island nation with 16 per cent of EC waters.  Would he also agree that unless resources are invested in our fishing industry, and soundings in this regard are made in Brussels, we will continue to be treated as second class citizens and others will continue to fish in our waters?</P>

I am aware of the fight there is to get to the position we should be in and which we should have been in a long time ago.  Neglect may be a strong word to use in regard to the fishing industry, but the regulations were operating against this country.  The Minister is in Luxembourg putting down a marker for this country to ensure that we cannot be put into a disadvantaged position with regard to any other country in the EC.  I agree with the Deputy that the fishing industry has been the poor relation here in comparison with the agricultural sector.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that for the Irish fishing industry to realise its full potential the fishing fleet would need to have access to all our fishing waters?  Would the Minister recognise that there are certain areas of our coast inaccessible to Irish fishing vessels, particularly those which have been licensed in the last few years?  The Minister did not refer in his reply to the 17 to 20 licences that have been issued.  Does the Minister see dangers ahead with the accession of Spain and Portugal to our fishing grounds?  I understand that negotiations are continuing in this regard. Does he consider that there will be dangers to the future of the Irish fishing fleet if the Spanish and Portuguese are given unlimited access to our fishing waters?</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy in that I do see dangers ahead.  I see major dangers for the fishing industry. In 1996 the Spanish and Portuguese will have access up to the 12 mile limit and they will be able to enter those waters with their fleets.  This matter is being negotiated at present in Europe by the Minister.  Unfortunately, the area the Deputy has outlined is banned from the Irish fishing fleet and that is why the licences were granted in the first instance. I concur with what the Deputy has said. There is stormy weather ahead for the Irish fishing industry in 1996 because of the treaty which will allow the Spanish and Portuguese access up to the 12 mile limit.  That is something we will have to closely monitor.  We will have to introduce the conservation priority we consider will be necessary so that we might obtain some derogation to ensure fair competition.</P>

Many entrepreneurs in areas of the industry have an individualist approach in that they spend much time keeping what they have and are not concerned about the broader interests of the industry.  Some means must be found to bring these disparate groups and agencies together to enable the industry reach its potential and to pursue the development of the industry.</P>
      <P>BIM has the responsibility for selling what we produce.  There is a clear link between the amount of money they can spend on marketing and the sales of Irish products.  Its marketing budget is extremely small compared to the potential market that exists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1a:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `brothel' shall not include the bona fide home of a prostitute unless the premises are used by any other prostitute for the purpose of prostitution;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to amend the definition of the term &ldquo;brothel&rdquo;. There is no definition supplied in the Statute, for very good reason.  I accept there is much case law as to what does and does not constitute a brothel and it would probably be foolish at this stage to attempt a comprehensive definition. As with the elephant, it is easier to recognise than to define it.  Therefore, we should not attempt a definition of &ldquo;brothel&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In relation to the definition of &ldquo;brothel&rdquo; one area should be excluded from it, the home of a prostitute.  If prostitution is not illegal &mdash; and I understand it is not &mdash; the home of a prostitute should not be capable of being invaded under the provisions set out in the latter portion of the Minister's proposed Bill.  It seems to me and to Deputy Harney that it is fair in these circumstances to exclude from the term &ldquo;brothel&rdquo; the bona fide home of a prostitute.  We have provided a means of preventing that from being abused by saying in the amendment &ldquo;unless the premises are used by any other prostitute for the purpose of prostitution&rdquo;. The place where a prostitute lives should not be defined as a home.</P>
      <P>The other reason it is of significance to accept an amendment of this kind is that section 10 (2) of the Bill provides that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any proceedings for an offence, <Col N="2252" /> ...which is living on the earnings of prostitution,</P>
    <P>it shall be presumed, unless the contrary is shown, that a person who lives with or is habitually in the company of a prostitute was at the time of the alleged offence living on the earnings of that prostitute from prostitution and was aiding and abetting such prostitution.</P>
    <P>Prostitutes who have families and liaisons are adversely affected by the terms of section 10 (1) and (2).  They deserve at least the same rights as the rest of us in relation to the privacy of their own home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy rightly states &ldquo;brothel&rdquo; is a common law term and means a place resorted to by persons of both sexes for the purpose of prostitution. There must be at least two women or men plying their trade as prostitutes in the place.  If two persons are using the premises for prostitution, the place is a brothel and it is immaterial that one of them is the occupier.  Therefore, the home of a prostitute is not a brothel unless another person is also using the premises for prostitution.  The amendment is unnecessary and would confuse the situation.  Therefore, I regret I cannot accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not make a meal of this but it is declaratory of the common law, as I understand it.  It says that &ldquo;brothel&rdquo; does not include somebody's home unless it is being used by another prostitute for the purposes of prostitution.  I do not see why the Minister cannot accept the amendment but it is useful to have it stated in this House by her that the basis on which this Bill is being put through is that the term &ldquo;brothel&rdquo; will never mean the single home of a single prostitute operating on her own.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was impressed with Deputy Harney's speech yesterday on this issue.  I have some difficulty with this matter of prostitution.  About two months ago a Sunday paper reported that <Col N="2253" /> a female prostitute in Dublin had AIDS, but there was no further discussion on the matter.  It was stated as if it was the most natural thing in the world.  It caused me great personal distress that no action was taken in that regard because AIDS is like a time bomb in our midst.</P>
      <P>I spoke privately to the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, and expressed my concern about the matter, the implications of which are horrendous not only for people who have sex with the prostitute concerned but also for the families involved and for the country as a whole. It is necessary that the Ministers for Health and Justice come together and discuss the matter not only with the medical profession but also with the Garda and social workers.  This aspect of the Bill, although well meaning, is a little too restrictive and its implications could do more harm than good.  As Deputy Harney said, it is necessary to sympathetically consider prostitution and the reason it occurs.  Perhaps a study group could be set up to consider the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest Deputy Kemmy suggest that I head such a study group, I am not as great an expert in this area as he might think.  I am happy with the Minister's clarification of this matter.  It is important that prostitution carried on in the home of a prostitute is not deemed illegal and that the provisions of this Bill do not apply in those circumstances.  I welcome the provision that a prostitute operating in such circumstances cannot be taken before the courts and fined or imprisoned.  As I said last night, prostitution is a major social problem.  In the main, those who engage in prostitution are vulnerable, desperate women, none of whom is proud of what she does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two different categories of prostitute: one is the higher class prostitute to whom Deputy Gilmore referred, who is kept in a house or luxury apartment by a well-off businessman.  Such a person could not be classified as a prostitute. However, the category of prostitute who operates on the streets, soliciting and importuning, will continue <Col N="2254" /> to face the penalties and provisions of this legislation.</P>
    <P>All of us wish to ensure that prostitution is eliminated from public streets, not just because of the nuisance factor and the degrading way in which women parade themselves in these areas, many of them on the south side of Dublin city, but because it causes offence and annoyance to innocent passers-by.  It is important that public streets and highways are not used for prostitution.  I welcome the fact that the common law definition of brothel does not include the home of a prostitute unless at least one other prostitute is operating as a prostitute there.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to take up the limited time for this debate.  I look forward to hearing the arguments in favour of raising the age limit to 18 years.  I am disappointed the first amendment was ruled out of order.  I welcome the Minister's earlier comments &mdash; I did not hear them but there was a very favourable reaction from those who did &mdash; and also her response of last night to the comments made by me and others in this area.  It is interesting that it is a woman Minister who is taking this progressive, liberal, decisive and courageous approach to this issue.  Many men, if they were in her position would dither, be ambivalent and say that the matter would be reviewed and legislation introduced some months later.  The Minister has acted quickly and decisively overnight in coming forward with her amendments which will be dealt with later.</P>
    <P>If we are to seek to lessen the incidence of prostitution &mdash; it is unrealistic to think it will be eliminated &mdash; we must know who engage in it.  I referred last evening to a survey carried out in Dublin which showed that, in the main, those who resorted to prostitution were people who had been subjected in childhood to sexual or physical abuse, people who had a poor standard of education, low self-esteem and who had come from a poor socio-economic background.</P>
    <P>If we are to help these desperate women to find an alternative way of life we need to take an integrated approach that is very much based on welfare, education <Col N="2255" /> and rehabilitation.  Many prostitutes in Dublin who were surveyed by the Rape Crisis Centre said if there was a drop-in centre with accommodation facilities there would be an alternative way of life for them because many of them who are sent out by their husbands or pimps are too frightened not to engage in prostitution.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we are correcting a major anomaly in legislation whereby the problem of homosexuality was swept under the carpet as if it did not exist.  As the law rendered it a criminal offence we assumed it did not exist.  To criminalise a practice such as prostitution will not eliminate it.  We must stop sweeping it under the carpet and bring it into the open, with proper controls, regulations and legislation.  Prostitution is the ultimate exploitation of very vulnerable women.  It needs to be dealt with in the context of further legislation or perhaps in the context of Deputy Gilmore's good amendment, which I support, which proposes the setting up of a task force to look into this problem.  I do not have all the answers as to how this whole area may be properly controlled and regulated.  We need to deal with this major social problem, particularly in Dublin city.  We cannot rely on our courts, Garda and prisons to deal with difficult social issues such as prostitution, drug addiction and such matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's response to the comments made last night on Second Stage.  I welcome the amendments she has tabled, one of which provides that the question of imprisonment for conviction of prostitution would not arise until the third offence.  That is a progressive measure which indicates that the Minister has taken on board the comments that prostitution cannot be dealt with simply by criminalisation, charging people in courts and having them put in prison.  We know from experience that just as in other areas of criminal law there is a revolving door syndrome in the case of prostitution in that people who are <Col N="2256" /> sent to prison are soon back out on the streets again.</P>
      <P>I tabled an amendment, which has been ruled out of order, in which I propose that the Minister establish a task force to address the issue of prostitution. This is a matter that cannot be simply dealt with either by decriminalising it or by having it criminalised and saying that irrespective of how lenient the penalties may be, it is illegal.  This is very much an area of exploitation, mainly of women, that has gone undocumented and largely unresearched.  It is interesting that only one submission was made to the Second Commission on the Status of Women on the issue of prostitution, and that was made by a religious order.  Very little is known apart from anecdotal evidence and information about the lives, circumstances and problems of prostitutes.</P>
      <P>The Second Commission on the Status of Women recommended that an integrated approach be taken to this matter, involving a number of Government Departments and various agencies including health boards and voluntary bodies who work with prostitutes.  The amendment which I tabled and which was ruled out of order &mdash; I hope the Minister will respond to it &mdash; proposed that a task force be established which would draw people from health services, voluntary organisations and the Garda Síochána who would consider in a practical way what needs to be done to help those women who want to get off the game, to identify at an early stage vulnerable people who become involved in prostitution and to attempt to steer them away from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not simply a question of decriminalising prostitution.  I heard some comments on the radio today to the effect that it would be fine if prostitution was decriminalised because then men who wanted to go to prostitutes could do so legally.  Prostitution is a form of exploitation and it should be dealt with on that basis.  It should be addressed comprehensively. Even though the amendment has been ruled out of order, now that the Minister has responded positively to suggestions made last night <Col N="2257" /> about the issue of imprisoning prostitutes, I would urge the Minister to establish a task force to address the problem of prostitution in its wider context, to seek to address its causes and seek to help those people who want to get out of prostitution to get out of it, and to try to prevent people becoming involved in it. We need a wider approach than the legalistic approach provided for in the Bill before us.</P>

    <P>(3)  Without prejudice to the general provisions of subsection (1) where in a prosecution for an offence under that subsection it is proved that the premises advertised is or was a brothel, or that the service advertised is or was prostitution, it shall be presumed unless the contrary is shown that the publisher was so aware at the time of publication.</P>
    <P>(4)  A person shall be deemed to be a publisher for the purposes of subsection (1) if he publishes, or is knowningly connected with the publication of, or appears to the Court to be in effective control, either alone or with others of, the publication, and where any publication is done by a body corporate, the body corporate, and any director or officer or employee thereof who is aware of the publication, shall be deemed to be a publisher.</P>
    <P>(5)  A person who commits an offence under subsection (1) of this section shall be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or a fine of £10,000 or both.</P>
    <P>(6)  In this Section, `publication' includes broadcast and cognate words shall be construed accordingly.&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>This amendment relates to the prohibition <Col N="2259" /> of advertising of prostitution. The terms of it are to make it an offence for a person who, being the publisher of any book, newspaper, magazine, leaflet, or other publication, distributes such a document if it contains advertisements which give rise to the reasonable inference that a premises advertised is a brothel or the service advertised is prostitution. The proposal goes on to provide that it shall be a defence for a publisher to show that he was not aware that he was advertising a brothel or prostitution services.  He must have reasonable grounds for believing that the advertisement related to some other lawful purpose.  Where it is proved that the premises is a brothel or that a service is a prostitution service, the onus should effectively be put on the editor or publisher in these circumstances to show that he was not aware of that fact.  The fourth proviso is that a person shall be deemed to be a publisher if he has a decision making role in relation to the publication in question.  The fifth subsection is to put in place a punishment and to make it an indictable offence to publish such matters.</P>
    <P>Without wanting to be sensationalist I mentioned last night that the current edition of <i>In Dublin</i> magazine, which costs £1.50, has three pages of advertisements for brothels.  A good deal of thought obviously went into the design of these sophisticated advertisements and they could not be regarded as being classified advertisements.  A considerable amount of money must be paid for the publication of these advertisements.  I do not want to be unduly prudish or puritan but if we are about to amend our laws to punish prostitutes and pimps, what about the journalistic pimps who take large sums of money to advertise brothels in this manner?  What about the people who are deriving a direct profit from the operation of brothels in Dublin?  There are 21 advertisements on those three pages.  I imagine there are thousands of pounds spent on advertising each week in that magazine.  Doubtless there are other places in Ireland where similar advertisements <Col N="2260" /> are now appearing, although I do not know of any.  If that is the case it seems that we are engaging in so much hypocrisy if we start posturing as being against the pimp while doing nothing about this.  It is not a recent phenomenon. It has been going on for years and we have done nothing to suppress those who are exploiting brothels to subsidise magazines.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate how many prosecutions have been launched on foot of advertisements in <i>In Dublin?</i> I admire the magazine.  I do not want to be too hard on it as it is a good magazine, but how many prosecutions have been launched on foot of those advertisements? Is the Minister aware that instead of advertising the premises the advertisers have now moved to a slightly different ploy by using mobile telephone numbers to immunise themselves from direct raids by the police.  I presume that if it is possible for a customer to find out where to go, it should not be beyond the capacity of the Garda to locate these places.  Will the Minister indicate the attitude of the Department and the Garda to publication of these advertisements, whether it is criminal under existing law, in which case it appears that existing law is inadequate, and what does the Minister propose to do about journalistic pimping or pimping on a commercial scale of this kind?</P>

      <P>I endorse what Deputy McDowell said.  The real criminals in prostitution are those who make huge financial gains from it.  Neither do I wish to be sensational.  It is not always fair to blame the media.  Deputy Browne wanted to muzzle the media in relation to coursing last night, but I would not like to suggest that we should muzzle the media in relation to these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advertisements referred to are extremely offensive to women.  Many of the advertisements refer to services for 24 hours a day, seven days a week and all major credit cards are accepted.  They now have a service covering Limerick and Cork.  One of them says, &ldquo;All girls stunning, versatile and friendly&rdquo;.  I find <Col N="2261" /> these advertisements extremely offensive to women.  If we are to deal with prostitution realistically and fairly we have to deal with it in the context of the kind of amendment we are proposing here.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago I had reason to be in Budapest at a weekend conference.  In my hotel room I read a small pamphlet about Budapest.  It contained between eight and 12 advertisements in relation to these kinds of facilities.  I remember being quite shocked that there were so many of them, not realising until last evening &mdash; I do not read <i>In Dublin</i>&mdash; that the magazines and newspapers also here carry such advertisements.  I do not know whether it is that I am getting old, or conservative in my old age, but I do not buy the magazine <i>In Dublin</i> and I was not aware until last evening that there were so many of these facilities in Dublin.  I was absolutely shocked when Deputy Michael McDowell brought in this magazine and I counted 21 such places, some pretending they are luxury health studios open 24 hours a day.  I do not want to give them more publicity by reading out other descriptions of what they do.  But I must say that, as a woman, I find it extremely offensive.  I wonder why it is the case that these places never seem to be raided by the Garda Síochána. They cannot be difficult to locate.  Even though they do not give any addresses, with the exception of one case, they give telephone numbers, so I do not think the Garda Síochána would find it very difficult to locate them.  I wonder why it is that magazines feel so free to publish these advertisements, are not afraid that they will be prosecuted in any way or made to account for the origin of these advertisements, or who are the people who place them.</P>
    <P>The posit of this amendment is put very clearly, ensuring that nobody avoids responsibility but rather ensuring that those responsible for encouraging or promoting prostitution, for making money out of it, either by organising it or advertising it, will have the full rigours of the law applied to them, that is if we are to deal realistically with what is a dreadful social problem of exploitation of women <Col N="2262" /> in a very fundamental, basic and horrible way.</P>
    <P>I should be very glad if the Minister could tell us whether it is the intention of her Department to speak to the Garda Síochána in relation to these advertisements or, if they appear in other magazines of which I am not aware, confirm that the same rigours of the law will be applied to them.  If these advertisements can be carried so freely in this city it must be a question of the Garda turning the blind eye, part of this attitude, &ldquo;we will make it illegal but we will not enforce the law,&rdquo; and laws that are not enforced are laws that are not respected.  It would be very hypocritical of us to pass legislation but not enforce its provisions in this very difficult area. Would the Minister say, if it is not a case of lack of will on the part of the Garda Síochána to enforce the law, is it the case that the law is not adequate to deal with the publication, advertising and promotion of prostitution?</P>

      <P>We must deal with a number of amendments within a very limited time so I shall not delay the House except to say that I support the general thrust of this amendment.  As a matter of interest, I do not know how its provisions fit in with the right to information other Members regularly advocate in this House.  But I would say this, it is more than aiding and abetting a pimp to have these types of advertisements placed.  As a legislature, it is time we faced up to the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On one occasion I happened to be talking to a man who was conducting his legitimate business on a weekday evening in Deputy Michael McDowell's constituency who told me that, outside his premises on a Saturday morning, one could not park a car because of the number of men coming to and going from two brothels adjacent to his business. That was some months ago and I do not know whether that position still obtains. The other problem is in urban areas.  One can discover this type of activity going on there.  While, as a later amendment of mine states, I am not for imprisoning <Col N="2263" /> prostitutes or imposing draconian fines on them &mdash; particularly since it might leave them open to extortion, blackmail or worse &mdash; nonetheless, people who live off immoral earnings, who are pimps, or who are aiding and abetting pimps, should suffer penalties under the provisions of this Bill.  I support the general thrust of this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, want to support this amendment.  <i>In Dublin</i> is a very fine magazine.  Most people buy it to read what gigs are on, some people may buy it to read the advertisements, but Deputy McDowell must have been the first person to have bought it to use it as a visual aid in a Dáil debate.  Mind you, <i>In Dublin</i> is not the only publication that carries advertisements of this kind.  We see them also in the &ldquo;Ooh, isn't it awful&rdquo; style of publication which, on one page will have an article saying it is terrible, on the next page carry a full technicolour picture of a semi-naked woman and, on another page, carry advertisements of the kind about which Deputy McDowell has spoken.  What it reflects is a double standard in relation to prostitution because what this Bill is addressing essentially is prostitution on the streets.  It clearly talks about somebody soliciting on the street who can be moved on by a garda and, if they do not move on, can be taken in and so on.  It deals with the question of brothels and of pimps.  But the kind of people who will use their credit card, or the kind of arrangement in which the credit card would become involved is not your traditional type of brothel or your traditional type of prostitution arrangement.  We are talking here about the classier end of the business which, by and large, has not met with the force of the law in the same way as has the more down market end of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned last evening that there needs to be a degree of consistency in how the question of prostitution is dealt with.  I very much agree with the amendment. If we are dealing with prostitution in the way proposed in this Bill, if we are dealing wih brothels, people who control <Col N="2264" /> prostitutes and so on, then clearly it is nonsense to allow circumstances to prevail in which publications effectively can advertise services of prostitues without any penalty being imposed on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot claim to be uninitiated in reading magazines because, travelling back and forth from Limerick on the train, I am an inveterate reader of magazines dealing with politics and current affairs.  Therefore, I read the magazine referred to regularly.  I might remind Deputy Harney that over the past ten to 15 years a growing number of those advertisements has appeared in magazines here, like other cities worldwide, where such activities take place.  It is difficult to define a brothel.  For example, it can masquerade under the guise of a massage parlour, or other things, for example, a prostitute can pose as a model.  All of those euphemisms are used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I understand the tenor of Deputy McDowell's amendment and that his intentions are good, I must warn him that the cure could be worse than the disease.  To draw a somewhat ridiculous analogy, if one banned funerals one could not prevent people from dying.  Therefore, if one banned prostitution, that would not deter people from engaging in sex with prostitutes.  However, I know the Deputy's intent, he is entitled to attempt to render such activity seedy, down at heel and sleezy.  The Deputy spoke about journalistic/publishing pimps.  However, I must point out that the other side of the story is also true, there have been very honourable journalists who have taken up the other side of the story.  For example, June Levine in her book, <i>Lyn.</i> If Members want to learn about the brutality, horrors of street prostitution they should read that book in which it is depicted in a searing, terrible way.  Anybody who reads that book will readily appreciate the violence, intimidation, horror, suffering, illness, even the deaths of prostitutes, sometimes through violence.  They will learn all about life on the streets where a lot of money changes hands.  Much of the time <Col N="2265" /> the prostitutes do not receive that money, it is taken from them by these people who play on them.</P>
    <P>Certainly these advertisements constitute a growing industry in Dublin, perhaps in other places too, probably in the provinces; I would not deny that.  Indeed, that growth industry has been not only in the numbers of brothels and massage parlours but in their accompanying advertisements published in the magazines we have spoken about.  However, to ban them entirely would not put an end to prostitution.  We would be fooling ourselves if we were to believe that.</P>
    <P>I would say to the Minister that perhaps that is why this debate has gone off on a tangent she did not foresee when the Bill was framed.  Indeed, the Bill is very timely in that she will readily perceive from our concern in this area that things are far from right, that prostitution and its accompanying violence must be tackled within our society sooner or later. Indeed, Deputy McDowell's reference to this growth of advertisements and Deputy Harney's comment that they are offensive to women should be taken on board.  That is also why I commend the idea of establishing a task force or study group to advise the Minister in this regard.  It is not something with which we can deal conclusively today under the provisions of this Bill.  The Bill was not framed to tackle the problem in its entirety.  If you like, it is a good byproduct of the debate.  A full scale study of the problem is necessary, advancing informed opinion and information so that we can debate the issue further and ensure that we get the balance right in this regard.  I understand what Deputy McDowell says but driving people off the streets may merely lead to the phenomenon obtaining in other countries, that of call girls of a different variety, to perhaps upmarket prostitutes, services and facilities. While that might be an improvement in driving people off the streets it certainly will not put an end to prostitution in our society.</P>

She deserves the praise of this House for the manner in which she has dealt with that issue.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable, however, that the issue of prostitution is also being dealt with in this Bill, that we have to deal with it in such a restricted debate and that it is being used to camouflage the very forthright and straightforward way the Minister is dealing with the other issues. Nevertheless, we are now confronted by a Bill that seeks to address the issue of prostitution, of people loitering in the streets, and kerb crawling.  In this regard I find the reference to motor vehicles somewhat amusing.  It seems that it will be all right to kerb crawl on one's bicycle but not in one's vehicle.</P>

      <P>Because these provisions are contained in the legislation this amendment has been tabled by the Progressive Democrats in the names of Deputies McDowell and Harney.  I am sorry Deputy Kemmy has left the House because his suggestion on this issue is mindboggling.  He wants a committee or commission to investigate the matter but I wonder what field trips they would engage in in trying to assess how we should deal with these issues on an empirical basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say that I do not have any experience in this area but it seems &mdash; this is the reason we need more time to discuss the issue &mdash; somewhat odd that this legislation will create a number of new offences in the area of prostitution, some of which I would support, but will continue to allow certain specified publications <Col N="2267" /> to assume the title of &ldquo;printing pimps&rdquo; and, under the guise of respectability, advertise a variety of facilities which can be availed of by the general public and which are coded under the term of massage parlour or a variety of other terms even though everyone knows what they relate to.  Indeed, it is a cause of concern, given that some of these establishments are unlawful under the current law, that there have been so few prosecutions in this area.</P>
    <P>If a Martian was to land on this island and wanted to know what facilities were available he would only have to pick up certain magazines to discover where they were located and the likely product that would be offered within a couple of hours of his arrival.  It seems that the Garda Síochána are not all that committed to the enforcement of the law in this area. That is the reason I wonder why it is proposed to provide a more draconian law in addressing a form of conduct which I do not in any way approve of but which gives rise to broader social questions which need to be addressed.</P>

      <P>I ask the Deputy to make his contribution relevant to the matter in hand.  We are talking here specifically about the prohibition of advertisements in relation to prostitution. The Deputy is tending to make a Second Stage speech.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The prohibition of advertisements that Deputy McDowell is seeking to provide for would make sense in the overall context of the legislation.  It is odd that this should be exempt when so many other activities will not be exempt from criminal prosecution under the legislation.  Publications may complain that they innocently inserted advertisements without understanding the consequences or what they related to and it seems the defence provided for more than adequately caters for this.  On the basis that Deputy Kemmy is a member of the Government parties I find his contribution difficult to fathom and I do not know what he has in mind in suggesting, if <Col N="2268" /> advertising is not going to be prohibited, that a commission or committee should look into this matter or whether what he said reflects the Minister's thoughts.</P>
      <P>This Bill contains some extremely complex and far-reaching provisions which relate to issues other than the issue that must be addressed arising out of the judgment of the European Court on Human Rights.  It is only right therefore that we should have reasonable time to explore the extent to which the law should be consistent in this area and affect those who benefit financially from a form of human conduct in respect of which the legislation seeks to provide far greater penalties.  The question must be asked why should publications be granted an exemption?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to bear in mind, when she comes to reply to the points I have raised, the provisions of section 11 which states that a landlord who, knowingly allows his premises to be used as a brothel, can, on indictment, be fined £10,000 or sent to jail for five years, or both.  I cannot see how it is right that we should hit a landlord with a massive penalty and allow well-to-do businessmen to publish magazines which have just as crucial a role to play in the area of prostitution by advertising premises and bringing people to the landlord's premises in the first place.</P>
      <P>When reference was being made earlier to a commission of inquiry or a task force I was reminded of what Mr. Gladstone used say whenever he was found in the company of the ladies of the street in London.  He claimed that he was there on a personal mission to reform them.  Deputy Shatter sounded like him a few moments ago.</P>

As I thoroughly agreed with what Deputy Harney had to say on Second Stage I am perplexed by the amendment which has been tabled because I would have thought that she would follow through and advocate that prostitution be legalised and that brothels <Col N="2269" /> be licensed.  It is difficult to reconcile what she had to say on Second Stage and what is contained in the amendment. That is the line we should follow.</P>
      <P>It is ridiculous that this section dealing with prostitution has been included in a Bill which seeks to decriminalise homosexuality; they are two separate subjects. However, as it is contained in the Bill I should make the point that prostitution should be legalised, that brothels should be licensed and that there should be none of this soul-searching.  After all, it is the oldest profession in the world, older than politics itself, and we do not want to find that Members of the Oireachtas were discovered emerging from such awful premises if they are illegal.  We would like to see Members of the House of the Oireachtas doing so within the law.</P>

I would not support any attempt to increase the fines or to have fines at all.</P>
      <P>The Minister should look again at this section.  We are not facing up to the problem. It is the typical Irish solution to an Irish problem &mdash; to pretend it does not exist.  Of course this problem exists, and will continue to exist, increasing the penalties will not eliminate it.  This is a cowardly approach to a very human and real problem.  I use the word &ldquo;problem&rdquo; advisedly.  This practice is part of human nature and it will continue.  This legislation serves no purpose other than to make us look even more ridiculous than at present in the eyes of the world.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment which follows logically from the legislation before us.  We should not accept the premise that it is somehow natural for a woman to sell her body to <Col N="2270" /> a man.  It would be a misdirected liberal step to decriminalise prostitution, which is exploitative of all women, not just prostitutes.  I reject the notion that this activity is part of human nature and will continue.  All legislation in this area, including this Bill, should be motivated by a desire to eliminate this activity, dissuade people from participating in it and kill the customer base over a certain period.  If there was an equalisation of the penalties and stigma of prostitutes and their customers, the customer base would be considerably reduced in the short to medium term.  We should continue to work towards the abolition of prostitution, which is exploitative in the extreme sense of all women, not just prostitutes.</P>
      <P>I closely associate prostitution with the terrible crimes of rape, child abuse and incest.  All these crimes are part of the same activity, that is, the exploitation of women by men.  I support this amendment which follows logically from the provisions on prostitution in the Bill.  It is accepted by all the people working in the field that prostitutes are socially disadvantaged.  Even if these women are not economically disadvantaged, they are disadvantaged through drug addiction and alcohol abuse.  Even &ldquo;upmarket tarts&rdquo;, as they are called, are victims of this disadvantage.  I get very wary when I hear men saying that prostitutes should be legally entitled to sell their services. This endorses the premise that a woman can sell her body to a man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing this legislation.  I, too, regret that prostitution, a broad social problem, is being dealt with in a Bill which proposes to decriminalise homosexual acts between consenting adults over 17 years. I should like to have more time to discuss prostitution, which warrants a healthy debate in this House.  The feminist movement is divided on whether prostitution should be decriminalised.  I do not think this issue is getting the good intellectual debate it warrants in this House.  It is being dealt with by way of knee-jerk reaction.  Many of the old clichés, for example, &ldquo;the oldest profession in the <Col N="2271" /> world&rdquo;, have been used in the debate to describe prostitution.  We should bear in mind that prostitution is also the oldest crime against women.</P>

      <P>I vehemently disagree with the views expressed by Deputy Deasy.  I would not like Members of the Oireachtas to be seen emerging from a brothel, legal or illegal.  With regard to Deputy Shatter's confusion about Deputy Kemmy's comments, I wish to point out that Deputy Kemmy was commenting on a matter to which we all referred during the debate last night, the Second Report of the Commission on the Status of Women which puts forward strong recommendations on prostitution and the measures which should be taken by the Government.  As Deputy Shatter is aware, the Government has accepted that report.  I indicated last night that there is a reference in the report to three specific Departments &mdash; Education, Health and Justice, which are working together in the formulation of an integrated approach to this issue.  This is a larger issue which will be dealt with separately; it is primarily a health issue.</P>
      <P>I am not sure that prohibiting the advertising of brothels is the best way of controlling those premises.  When brothels advertise their services the Garda authorities are aware of what is going on and are in a position to take action when evidence is obtained.  Deputy McDowell and Deputy Harney asked for information in regard to the number of prosecutions of brothel owners.  While I do not know the exact number there have been several successful prosecutions against brothel keepers in recent months. Instead of driving brothels underground by prohibiting advertising by them, with the consequent repercussions of this for the health of prostitutes and their clients, I would prefer to leave this aspect of the law alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the type of problems with prostitution rings, which operate through a mobile telephone system, to which Deputy Harney referred.  One of these rings got considerable publicity in <Col N="2272" /> my city a number of months ago when the Garda, through successfully intercepting the calls, were able to establish from where the ring was run, crack down on it and bring prosecutions.  I should like to have discussions with the Garda about this issue &mdash; it has not yet been possible. If necessary, I might be able to introduce an amendment in the public order legislation to cover the aspect about which Deputy Harney is concerned.</P>
    <P>The whole area of the policing of sexual offences is very difficult.  As Deputies are aware, the policing of this area has been handicapped by a lack of up-to-date legislation.  Issues such as the low level of fines, the difficulty in obtaining evidence and securing convictions and the fact that only the prostitute, and not the client, can be prosecuted have caused difficulties.  I am addressing only a very small number of issues in the area of prostitution in this Bill.  I am primarily doing this on the basis that, as we all agree, women should be free from harassment and, if possible, the existing penalty structures should be rationalised.  As I made clear last night, it is not my intention to make any substantive changes in the laws on prostitution in this Bill.  It would be better to deal with this issue by going down the road recommended by the Commission on the Status of women.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Deputy Harney say that she does not read the magazine <i>In Dublin.</i> I do not read this magazine either.  As Deputy McDowell was the only Deputy who indicated that he read the magazine I was inclined to think that people only read it as they got older.  However, Deputy Gilmore shattered that theory.  I have now decided that maybe women do not read that type of magazine.  The road suggested in this amendment would be a difficult one to travel and I regret that I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I will not detain the House much longer.  The Minister has explained her reasoning &mdash; if it can be dignified with that term &mdash; for not accepting this amendment.  I cannot understand how the Minister can say she is afraid of <Col N="2273" /> driving brothels underground and at the same time propose that the running of a brothel should be a crime punished by five years in jail.  One cannot have it both ways, one cannot say it is a crime to run a brothel, that we will put people in jail when they are caught and at the same time say one does not want to drive brothels underground.  Running a brothel is either a criminal offence or it is not.  I agree to some extent with Deputy Deasy's point that there is a fundamental matter at issue here.  However, I do not agree with his proposed solution to the problem.</P>
      <P>The Minister is not being either reasonable or logical in saying that the Garda Síochána consider these advertisements useful to find out what is going on.  If they are useful in that regard it can only be that the people who run the brothels know that the gardaí will not close them down.  If placing an advertisement in <i>In Dublin</i> led to an instant raid, one can rest assured that there would not be very many advertisements.</P>
      <P>There is a problem of logic that the Minister is not coping with.  I am not trying to be holier than thou or puritanical but if the landlord or landlady who allows his or her premises to be used as a brothel is liable to be jailed for five years and the man or woman who is running a brothel can go to jail for five years, it seems strange that the management of <i>In Dublin</i> magazine can get a blessing from the Minister today to carry on advertising them.  I find that very strange indeed.  The management of this magazine is better known to the Minister's party than to mine but I cannot think of any circumstances in which it is logical or right to allow them to carry on advertising as this is helping the Garda to stop the problem.  If that were true the brothel owners would not be advertising. I am at a loss to understand the policy being advocated by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this type of advertising is to continue the Minister might take expert advice in her Department about a case I read about in Kings Inns on the law of conspiracy and the production of the Lady's Directory.  If two people agree to publish this magazine <Col N="2274" /> and if the printer and the editor agree &mdash; Deputy Shatter would agree with me on this &mdash; to print this magazine or if a person agrees to place an advertisement and a person agrees to print it, that is a conspiracy at common law at present.  In the Lady's Directory case it was proven in England that there was no offence of actually publishing a list of ladies who were available for escort purposes, nonetheless the people who agreed to the printing and publication of it were found by the English courts to be parties to an unlawful conspiracy.</P>
    <P>The law of conspiracy is always unsatisfactory but if the management of this magazine are part of a conspiracy, then perhaps that might be investigated but it might be more to the point for the Minister to accept an amendment of the kind I am suggesting and say it is a crime to publish an advertisement for a brothel just as much as it is a crime to allow premises to be used as a brothel.  Will the Minister withdraw what I consider to be an illogcial proposition that these advertisements are helpful to the gardaí?  If they are helpful to the Garda in the sense that they stop prostitution, all I can say is that it is like turkeys voting for an early Christmas to advertise in <i>In Dublin</i> magazine.  I do not believe that is true. The reality is that for some reason there is an unwillingness to implement the law in relation to brothels and therefore section 11 is, as I said last night &mdash; and I am not saying so in an offensive way &mdash; a counterweight to the moral majority, especially in the Fianna Fáil Party to make them think that the Minister is getting tough on sex crimes, when in fact she is not.</P>
    <P>The Minister's attitude to this amendment shows that brothels will continue in Dublin, and nothing effective will be done about them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very disappointed with the Minister's response and it confirms the view I have that it is believed if we turn a blind eye the problem will go away.  When me enact legislation we have to be consistent in implementing and enforcing it.  I share the Minister's view <Col N="2275" /> that by making something illegal we may drive those responsible underground. That is the reason I do not wish to see prostitutes or prostitution criminalised.</P>
      <P>It is not illegal to pay money for sex here; it was not under existing law and it will not be the case after this becomes law.  Prostitution itself is not illegal and it never was.  I do not think a great many people understand that, but it is a fact. What is illegal is to solicit or importune in public or to have a brothel.  It is not illegal for a prostitute in her own house to be paid for sex and that will not be an offence after this becomes law either.  We need to recognise that.  Deputy Deasy seems to think that there is some contradiction between what I said yesterday and what I am suggesting now.  I do not want to see prostitution criminalised in any sense.</P>
      <P>I do not think the criminal prosecution process is the way to deal with prostitution. It is a huge social problem, not just for the prostitutes who in the main are vulnerable and exploited although I accept there is an upper class prostitute who might not be regarded as vulnerable in the socio-economic sense.  Any woman who sells her body for sex has to be vulnerable and desperate whether she comes from a low socio-economic background or not.  It is a desperate social problem and it is also a desperate problem from those clients who use the services of prostitutes, many of whom are married men.  Members may read an account of prostitutes lives in a survey from which I wish to quote.  I do not want to read it into the record because I do not want a headline in tomorrow's paper to the effect: &ldquo;Harney says Mr. X, Y and Z professional gentlemen is using prostitutes&rdquo;.  All the leading and influential groups in our society seem to use the services of prostitutes, if we are to believe what the prostitutes tell us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it very interesting that some groups here had been willing to take cases against the Rape Crisis Centre and the Well Woman Centre for selling condoms but never took a case against the brothels. They seem to be prepared to accept <Col N="2276" /> that 21 advertisements for this service appeared in <i>In Dublin.</i> It shocked me that so many advertise but this shows the scale and extent of prostitution.  I feel very strongly that it is the vulnerable women who are on the street in certain parts of Dublin who will be caught under the provisions of this Bill and were caught under the provisions of the existing legislation. The people who seek these kinds of facilities, that are not legal at present will not come under the eye of the law because the Minister is going to turn a blind eye to them.  I do not think any Minister for Justice could advocate that something that is illegal should be advertised. That is a recipe for disaster and is a very bad precedent.  It will continue to allow us to sweep this huge social issue under the carpet.  However, it will not go away.  It will not stop prostitutes being beaten up and victimised.  I do not believe that prostitution or prostitutes should be stigmatised.  I do not think that is right or appropriate.  We have to approach this on a human rights basis, even if we thoroughly disapprove of what people do.  We have to respect them and see them as equal.</P>
    <P>The essential reason for this Bill is to deal with homosexuality.  Perhaps we will get another opportunity in the Select Committee on Legislation and Security to carry out a comprehensive examination of this huge social issue.  We need to have consistent and realistic laws that deal in a very fair and reasonable way with this problem.</P>
    <P>My concern is that those who promote prostitution and make money from it are those who should be criminalised if we are to have criminal prosecutions.  They will continue to escape if we continue to take the attitude that it is all right to have these advertisements.  I do not like disagreeing with my colleague, Deputy McDowell, but to be fair to the Minister I do not think her reasoning is based on any connection that the management of <i>In Dublin</i> have with the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>If members of parties are connected to certain promotions others read all types of conspiracy into it.  To avoid the possibility of a conspiracy perhaps the brothel owners should also run the magazine because as I understand it it takes two people to have a conspiracy. If the brothel owners are producing the magazine there cannot be any conspiracy prosecutions and that might overcome that technicality.  I am not a lawyer and I bow to the expertise of Deputy McDowell on this.  Will the Minister establish a working group drawn from the voluntary bodies and Government Departments to look at prostitution and make recommendations for change in this area?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to respond to one or two points the Minister made as well as a matter which Deputy McDowell raised.  Deputy McDowell made the point that if we do not adopt this provision people who publish advertisements of this nature may be committing a criminal offence.  I agree with the view expressed by Deputy Harney to the extent that people who exploit women, promote prostitution and live off the earnings of women, many of whom are victims of our society, are the people to whom the law should be directed.  That is how I view this matter.  That is why I find it extraordinary that the issue of these advertisements is not addressed in the Bill, while regretting the fact that the Bill is addressing this issue at all because this topic was for another day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Minister's response to me, I am well aware of what the Commission on the Status of Women recommend.  It is sad that we are rushing into the particular aspects of this Bill without implementing the recommendations on the Commission on the Status of Women without consistently taking into account the concerns they express.  Unless I missed something it did not appear to me that Deputy Kemmy dwelt on the Commission on the Status of Women, but rather the need for a new task force, forum or committee to investigate something <Col N="2278" /> further.  That was my understanding of this contribution.</P>
    <P>In the context of Deputy McDowell's amendment, at least we would know what the law is in regard to advertising the services of prostitutes or the availability of brothels.  It sets out a clear set of provisions which state the circumstances in which a prosecution can ensue and sets out the defences.  Deputy McDowell postulated that if this amendment was not accepted that perhaps a conspiracy charge would lay against the publishers of such publications, and referred to an English law case.</P>
    <P>I should like to bring to the attention of the House a more interesting and more immediate Irish law case which sets out the path although it may not clearly indicate the sentence.  It is a corollary of the point made by Deputy McDowell.  As everyone knows bigamy is a criminal offence just as under this legislation there will be particular offences.  I recall an Irish law case in the mid-sixties which I am sure Deputy McDowell will remember &mdash; there was a similar case in the fifties &mdash; in which a priest married a couple in circumstances where the Church did not recognise the validity of the first marriage of one of the spouses, which had taken place in a registry office. The second marriage took place in Church.  The priest had the honour of being one of the few priests in this country to be convicted of bigamy as an accessory before the fact.  Rather than being sentenced to seven years penal servitude, a sentence which could have been imposed on him, he was given a suspended sentence.  Before the Ceann Comhairle calls me back and tells me I am irrelevant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>If we enact into law the offences provided for under this legislation and if I were a publisher and tomorrow morning published a magazine which advertised the addresses and services of brothels, I would be an accessory before the fact to the offences that would <Col N="2279" /> be committed.  It would seem to me that a prosecution would ensue in the same way as the hapless priest was prosecuted. A phrase which is becoming worn by its usage, an Irish solution to an Irish problem, was mentioned earlier.  As a country we are in the rather odd position where thousands of couples have been remarried in Church, following Church annulments, in circumstances where their marriages are bigamous.  The priests officiating at those marriages are equally open to prosecution as was the priest in the sixties and could be convicted of bigamy, yet we turn a blind eye.  In the absence of Deputy McDowell's amendment it is equally intended that a blind eye be turned in this context.</P>
      <P>I am not sure whether these particular issues should have had a place in the main intent of this legislation.  If are to be consistent it would be only right that an amendment on these lines be included in this Bill.  If it is not to be in the form of Deputy McDowell's amendment perhaps the Minister would consider having another look at it in the context of the Seanad dealing with the Bill.  To say that such advertisements would drive all the brothels underground is odd in view of the fact that the provisions in the legislation create a series of offences in relation to brothels and make it an offence for a landlord to let a premises with the knowledge that such premises, or part thereof would be used as a brothel.  Deputy McDowell referred to Gladstone but I suppose we should not bring too many English politicians into all of this.  The section in relation to landlords might have caused certain discomfort to the poor, hapless ex-Chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain, Mr. Norman Lamont.  It would seem to me that the amendment would equally cause him concern if he had advertised&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The reference to the ex-Chancellor is now an historical one, at <Col N="2280" /> least politically.  It is odd to make it an offence for a landlord to let a premises to be used as a brothel, for the lessor of a premises to allow their premises to be used as a brothel, for both those matters to be deemed to create criminal offences and yet for it not to be a criminal offence to advertise the address of the brothel and for a magazine to earn money as a result.  As somebody who is often accused of being combative in this House and on occasions causing discomfort to Ministers, I can assure the Minister that I am not going to suggest that members of her own party have any more interest in this facility or magazine than have the members of any other party.  I am not suggesting that there is any conspiracy for her excluding it.</P>
      <P>I see no reason that magazines which are effectively exploiting women, their bodies and their circumstances, to make money for themselves to keep their magazines afloat should be left free to advertise the availability of these types of services.  That is offensive, unnecessary, exploitive and should be as much against the law as a landlord knowingly making his premises available for use as a brothel.  If we are to tackle this issue we should tackle the exploiters and not necessarily further criminalise women who are the victims of the activities in which they are engaging.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Harney that it is extraordinary that people who had been so quick to take various organisations to court over the supply of information have been so slow to take up this issue.  I recall within the last year, that the <i>Guardian</i> newspaper was impounded at Customs and not allowed in here because it contained an advertisement for the Marie Stokes clinic.  Student unions were taken to court and are still liable to pay large sums in legal costs because they published information in student guides and student magazines.  Even in Dublin city and county publications such as <i>Every Women,</i> which deals with women's health matters, were taken off the shelves of public libraries because it was deemed <Col N="2281" /> not to be in accord with some standard of public morality.  Here we have a situation where it is possible to advertise prostitution services in publications which the Minister is prepared to defend.</P>
      <P>I was surprised the Minister did not accept the amendment; in fact, I was taken aback by her rejection of it.  Perhaps she is somewhat disorientated because all the support and praise for the Bill is coming from the opposite side of the House and opposition to it is coming from behind her.  What she said on this Bill defies logic.  On the one hand she stated that to run a brothel is illegal, but on the other to advertise such a brothel is not to be illegal from the point of view of the publication and that in some way it will be part of Garda strategy in tracking down brothels to have the proprietors brought before the courts.  If one were to extend that logic one could foresee advertisements appearing in newspapers for quantities of a stimulating white powdery substance, or an enterprising entrepreneur in the Minister's constituency might wish to advertise quantities of a clear white liquid which is 100 per cent proof.</P>

      <P>This issue has been ignored in the past and, as Deputies Michael McDowell and Frances Fitzgerald are aware, it is a serious problem in Dublin South-East.  The majority of brothels advertised in <i>In Dublin</i> are located in our constituency.  This is a major concern for residents who live near them and many people will welcome much of what is contained in this Bill.  I am constantly plagued by people, especially women, who are sick and tired of being stopped on their way home at night and approached by men in cars.  I agree with the idea behind what Deputies McDowell and Harney are trying to do in their amendment in regard to advertisements in the <i>In Dublin</i> magazine. <Col N="2282" /> However, the people who advertise their premises in that magazine could change the advertisement to a personal one, as they do in other countries.  Such people do not stay in the same place for long. They move constantly from one building to another and use mobile telephones. They drive the residents of an apartment block crazy for about six months and when they come under pressure they move out, but still use the same telephone number.  It will be difficult to put a stop to their practices.  In my constituency the Garda are constantly following such people.  In fact, a brothel was set up next door to one of the police stations in my constituency and it took the Garda nine months to have the place closed down, following much pressure from the residents of the apartment block involved. This is not a simple matter to resolve. I agree with the Deputies' views and I welcome the fact that the Minister proposes to deal with this matter in a public order Bill.  However, as I stated already such people will place a personal advertisement in the magazine and move on.</P>

In the majority of cases it is women who are stopped by men while entering their apartment blocks late at night.  This can be a terrifying and an annoying experience for them.  Therefore, I do not believe the Deputies' amendment will achieve what it sets out to do.  However, the Minister must examine the issue because it is a serious problem in my constituency.</P>

      <P>When I spoke on Second Stage last night I indicated to the Minister that it was unfortunate she had added these sections to a Bill dealing with homosexuality and I am sure she understands now why some Deputies hold that view.  There is a need for a separate debate on the issue of prostitution.  We <Col N="2283" /> need to examine the reasons why women get involved in it because, by and large, it is mostly women who are involved in prostitution.  We must also examine why people use prostitution.  However, I am glad we are having this debate today but I hope we will have another opportunity to debate the subject.  Prostitution is somewhat like the horrific crime of incest.  Many people here will not accept that prostitutes are working in this city, in Galway and other cities and towns around the country and that respectable men who are pillars of society use the services provided by brothels.  Regardless of whether it is euphemistically called a full body massage or whatever, it is still a form of prostitution.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that the one submission to the report of the Second Commission for the Status of Women was not from any of the groups who demand rights for the protection of women, children and the family, but from an order of religious sisters who provide support in a low key practical manner over a long period for women involved in prostitution. That submission urged the adoption of strategies which would recognise the dignity of all women, irrespective of their conditions, based on women's right to choice, self-determination, non-stigmatisation and non-victimisation.  Those religious sisters obviously recognise the difficulties of women forced into prostitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that a percentage of women working the streets and brothels here are from across the water, but some women are forced into that type of lifestyle because their husbands have abandoned them and left them to care for the children. Some of the saddest interviews I have seen on television or heard on radio were from young deserted or battered mothers with small children and no means of income who find that the only way they can make money to rear their children is by selling their bodies.  It is a sad indictment on our society that Irish women have to get involved in prostitution and the people who use such services are even a sadder indictment on our <Col N="2284" /> society.  Deputy Shatter correctly stated that to make a particular service illegal and not make the advertising of it illegal is contradictory.</P>

      <P>I accept that running a brothel is illegal and advertising it does not appear to be illegal.  When the Minister stated that the Garda found such advertisements useful, I assume she meant that they found them useful to bring prosecutions but they are not.  That begs the question in regard to what other reason the Garda find them useful.  I do not wish to impugn the character of any member of the Garda Síochána, but the Minister might follow that line of reasoning through in her reply and tell us why the Garda find it useful to have a copy of <i>In Dublin</i> on a desk of every Garda station.  I have no doubt it makes interesting reading and the atmosphere in Garda stations can be dull from time to time.  I am being somewhat facetious, but I would like the Minister to explain why the Garda find those advertisements useful and why the Minister believes such advertisements should be allowed to continue. Is the bringing of prosecutions the only reason?</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that the people who get involved in prostitution are frequently the victims of child sexual abuse.  The Law Reform Commission consultation paper on child sexual abuse states that reports on drug abusers, juvenile offenders, adolescent runaways, prostitutes and adults with sexual dysfunctions show that a high proportion of those troubled individuals were sexually victimised as children.  As a result they have grown up with warped ideas about their sexuality and frequently &mdash; it is amost a death wish &mdash; they find themselves in that type of lifestyle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with the issue of prostitution, providing the kind of services about which Deputy Harney spoke and recommended in the Commission's report, including an integrated approach involving the Departments of Health, <Col N="2285" /> Education, Social Welfare and Justice, interested voluntary organisations and people like those religious sisters, we must look at what drives women into prostitution.  Deputy Deasy made the case that people seem to want this service and that it would be better if it came out in the open and brothels made legal.  I would rather see society get to the stage where we do not need prostitution, where we do not have people whose sexual needs cannot be answered without going to prostitutes, without using all sorts of relief agencies, if I can call them that in a general way, to satisfy their sexual needs.  I wish we had reached that stage of maturity.  We cannot separate the kind of prostitution in this city &mdash; and, indeed, in the country &mdash; from the kind of society where there is an acceptance that it is all right for men to abandon their wives leaving them with children to rear with no acceptance of their responsibility.  The Minister should find it easy to accept this amendment because there is logic in moving from saying that the services advertised are illegal to saying that the very act of advertising them should be illegal.  This is all the more reason a mechanism should be found for putting some of these sections of the Bill down for further discussion at the appropriate committee.</P>
    <P>I was not here when Committee Stage started as I was involved in another meeting but I have not yet heard the Minister give any good compelling reason for including this in the Bill.  I have not been lobbied.  I have all these other letters about homosexuality from Dublin South Political Awareness and the Canadian Intelligence Unit, whoever they may be, but I have had no letters and not a single representation asking for legislation on prostitution.  Perhaps the Minister might enlighten us as to whether the door of the Department is being beaten down by people who want this legislation.  If it is, then I will accept that there is a case for it.  However, the Commission on the Status of Women received one submission and it was a caring, compassionate submission looking for recognition of the wrong done to those <Col N="2286" /> women and a realisation of the services they require to assist them to break away from this kind of lifestyle.  We all know of the stories around the city.  I will finish by reminding people in this House of the kind of life that some prostitutes lead.  I am sure many Deputies have read the book entitled <i>Lyn &mdash; A Story of Prostitution</i> which deals with the lives of Dublin prostitutes and conveys the horror and, the risk of violence minute by minute of the lifestyle they have chosen.  She says:</P>
    <P>My jaws would clench and I would take a deep breath as I took up my position on the path.  Then I would look to my left, then to my right across the road.  Is that someone hiding in the garden over there?  Who is that in the parked car?  Are there two or three men in it?  Then I would turn and peer into the bushes along the banks of the canal and say to myself &ldquo;looks okay. Oh, did that bush move?  What is that noise?  Could have swore I saw someone lurking behind that tree&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Imagine living one's working life all the time feeling like that, feeling that kind of fear and yet in some way finding oneself trapped and not able to get out.  We talk about the poverty trap.  Some women are stuck in the prostitution trap and I hope we will have a chance again to have a debate like this where all Members of the House will be able to talk openly about this subject so that it will not continue to be seen by society as something like incest with people amazed at the number of cases as if, somehow, it has only started.  We must accept that it has existed in society for a long time.</P>

      <P>I had a landmark birthday a few weeks ago and one of the gifts I received, which I have not yet investigated, is a free aromatherapy massage with the Bach flower remedies. I hope I am not in for any major surprise.</P>
      <P>I repeat what I said last night.  The first time I was aware of the extent of the proposals in this Bill was when we considered it in some detail at the parliamentary party meeting yesterday. Deputy Nora Owen made a very valid point.  All parties have a policy in relation to homosexuality.  It has been top of the political agenda for some time.  I, for one, confess to being a virtual innocent, an ignoramous in relation to this issue and not in a position to contribute in the way I would like.  For example, I was not aware that the act of selling one's body was not illegal but that various associated activities are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the Minister decided to include it in this legislation.  I repeat the request I made last night, that <Col N="2288" /> these areas should be deferred so that they can be given due consideration in the Select Committee on Legislation and Security because huge issues arise here. I have looked at most of the report of the Commission on the Status of Women but I did not read the part on prostitution with particular attention.  If I had been aware that this debate was imminent and that such substantial changes were proposed I would have made it my business to be informed in this area.  Deputy McDowell's amendment, even though it is sensible in many ways, is pretty draconian because if one happens to be the lowly employee in a publishing company and the company publishes one of these, one would be deemed to be a publisher and therefore, subject to all the penalties.</P>
    <P>Amendments to the Bill have only been available in the last hour or two. This is no way to deal with an issue of such seriousness and do justice to it. While some of the Minister's proposals are valid, particularly in relation to the nuisance of kerb crawling, none of them is being given due attention here today. Most of them will not be reached.  It is not the way to do justice to a very serious issue.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider her decision to press ahead with these today, she should defer them to the committee on legislation during the summer months.</P>
    <P>Unlike others, I believe the legislation on homosexuality should proceed.  A commitment has been given and this obligation must be met.  Regarding the other issue, time should be taken to consider it fully and to provide adequate legislation in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to make a statement on the European Council which I attended with the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring in Copenhagen on 21 and 22 June 1993, where the Minister of State for European Affairs, Deputy Kitt, was also in attendance.  I shall deal also with my meeting with the British Prime Minister in London on 16 June.</P>
      <P>The European Council was a valuable meeting, which had the unacceptably high level of unemployment for the first time at the top of its agenda.  This issue dominated the meeting, a source of considerable satisfaction to me, as I had been pressing for this as a top priority since the Birmingham European Council, as many of my predecessors did before me. I was the first to recognise that the reason for our success was largely because other member states are now experiencing the same serious problem of unemployment that we have faced for years.</P>
      <P>Commission assessments put before us in Copenhagen indicated that the outlook for the Community economy has deteriorated since its previous assessment in February last.  Economic activity is more depressed, and the recovery which had been projected for the end of this year was not expected &mdash; unless new action was taken &mdash; to take hold until mid-1994. This implied that unemployment could reach 12 per cent on average across the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The forecasts also showed that the Irish economy is faring better than most of its partners, even in the face of these difficult circumstances.  Ireland is the only member state to have maintained significant positive growth throughout the recession.  The Commission foresees a 2.25 per cent growth in GDP for Ireland this year.  This contrasts with the expected decline of 0.5 per cent across the Community at large.  The Government feel that a somewhat higher rate is achievable, but even on the Commission forecast our growth will be the fastest in the EC.  Taking account of the mid-May <Col N="2294" /> outturn showing a rise of less than 1 per cent inflation in Ireland this year is now forecast to be under 2 per cent, the second lowest in the EC.  Similarly, the Commission's forecast of our balance of payments surplus this year is 4.75 per cent of GDP, following the record £1.5 billion surplus last year, which is second only to Luxembourg.  For the EC as a whole, the general Government deficit is expected to be 6.25 per cent of GDP: Ireland, with a forecast of about 3 per cent is one of the lowest, again apart from Luxembourg.  Across the Community, employment is forecast to fall by 1.75 per cent whereas for Ireland the assessment is for no change.</P>
    <P>We can take some satisfaction from these various indices of better performance as a vindication of Government policies and our successful social partnership, as far as they go.  But we can afford no complacency in the face of our grim level of unemployment, the second worst in the EC after Spain.  Our situation reflects the strong national growth in the labour force and the return of earlier emigrants occasioned by economic recession elsewhere.  But we have to recognise that it is also heavily affected by the reality that even the excellent economic growth we have had has not delivered additional jobs in the numbers we would have expected in the past, despite the 45,000 net new jobs created between 1987 and 1990.</P>
    <P>Growth has become less job-intensive. This is true across Europe.  It is a phenomenon that loomed large in the discussions in Copenhagen.  There, we had from Commission President Delors a penetrating analysis of this experience and of the competitive situation of the European economy.</P>
    <P>In our Conclusions, we aimed to restore confidence through implementation of a clear strategy &mdash; combining short, medium, and long term measures &mdash; to restore sustainable growth, restore the competitiveness of European industry, and reduce unemployment.</P>
    <P>The short term measures agreed are primarily directed at boosting economic growth, but also focus on getting more <Col N="2295" /> jobs out of growth.  We decided to build on the Edinburgh Growth Initiative.  This was not of adequate dimensions or impact, but it is estimated to have added 0.6 per cent to the EC growth rate and to have boosted employment by 450,000. In their planning for their 1994 budgets, each member state is to give particular importance to promoting investment, including bringing public investment forward in time, taking account of the multiplier effect of concerted action across the Single Market.  In Ireland in 1993, we have a record size Public Capital Programme of £2.4 billion.  At the Community level, we invited the European Investment Bank to increase to 8 billion ECU &mdash; about IR£6.5 billion &mdash; the temporary loan facility of 5 billion ECU agreed at Edinburgh and to extend it beyond 1994.  Of the increase, 2 billion is for trans-European networks and 1 billion for small and medium sized enterprises &mdash; SMEs.  We asked the ECOFIN Council to examine how the element for SMEs could benefit from interest subsidies to a maximum of 3 per cent linked to job creation.  This could be of considerable benefit to SMEs in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We agreed on the importance of creating the budgetary and economic conditions for rapidly bringing down interest rates in Europe.  This is what the Government have done in Ireland, and Deputies will have noted that the improved conditions have allowed the Central Bank to recently make its twelfth reduction to benchmark rates since the competitive devaluation.  Rates are not on a downward trend throughout the EC. and indeed interbank rates in Ireland and France have recently moved below German rates.  It is claimed, with what justification the future will tell, that the French franc will now share in the anchor role previously held by the Deutschmark. Key interbank rates here, now below 7 per cent are at their lowest level since the late 1970s.  Mortgage rates are in the range 6.5 per cent to 9 per cent and consumers now have much greater choice, because of increased competition between mortgage providers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2296" /> The European Council also called upon the Community institutions to adopt the revised Regulations on the Structural Funds by the end of July, so as to allow proceed the 160 billion ECU programme of investment and structural policy measures to be financed by these funds.  On the funds, the Compenhagen Conclusions include the following very important statement.</P>
    <P>The legal texts as well as the practical implementation should fully respect the agreement reached on the Delors II package in Edinburgh.</P>
    <P>Against the background of the inclusion of that sentence in the conclusions, I took the opportunity to have a brief discussion with President Delors.  Taking account of that, of an earlier meeting between him and the Tánaiste, and also of the Copenhagen Conclusions, I came away with a firm expectation that the Edinburgh agreements will be faithfully reflected in the allocations.  President Delors commented very favourably on Ireland's use of the funds to date, which has helped raise our average GDP per head relative to the Community from 60 per cent in 1985 to 75 per cent in 1993.</P>
    <P>Regarding short-term action, the European Council agreed that the ECOFIN Council would examine a Commission proposal aimed at helping member states to boost investment ahead of schedule. They would be able to draw this year on a five billion ECU &ldquo;bridging facility&rdquo;, with the loans repayable out of the new round of Structural Funds and from the Cohesion Fund, when these flow from early 1994.</P>
    <P>There is a pro-employment bias in these short term measures, but we recognised that they would need to be complemented by structural measures to tackle deeper causes affecting Europe's comparative record in job creation; and by labour market measures specifically focused on the unemployed.  The meeting accepted my proposal that, for these measures, there should be heavy concentration on tackling the unacceptably high unemployment, including the long term unemployed, young people, and <Col N="2297" /> those most affected by social exclusion. In the course of an exchange of ideas on such measures, I told my colleagues that the Government here are proposing, as part of the national plan under preparation, a major programme aimed at these groups, in order to put to more active use, focused on jobs, money now spent on social welfare support for the same people, while out of jobs.  These moneys and matching EC money would thus be mobilised to provide a total of 30,000 jobs, in such areas as community development, voluntary organisations, and preservation and enhancement of the environment.</P>
    <P>I gave a fuller outline of what is envisaged in my speech yesterday in launching the new National Economic and Social Forum, the birth of which I would like to welcome in the House.  In developing the programme the Government drew substantially on the very valuable work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment, which I commend here today.  That work will now be carried forward in the NESF.  I particularly welcome the fact that all sides in this House are participating in the Forum.</P>
    <P>Having discussed the outline of a medium term plan presented by President Delors &mdash; which is annexed to the Presidency Conclusions which have been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; the European Council invited the Commission to present for the next summit in December a White Paper on a medium term strategy, after taking on board views and comments to be supplied by all member state Governments by 1 September next on the proposals made by President Delors.  These proposals included: raising the percentage of EC GNP devoted to research, development and innovation from 2 per cent to 3 per cent; a major programme of investment in transport and telecommunications infrastructure, at a rate of 30 billion ECU a year; creation of a &ldquo;European information infrastructure&rdquo; embracing telecoms, computers, fibre optics etc., at a rate of 5-8 billion ECU a year; and more active policies towards the labour market with much more <Col N="2298" /> resources devoted to helping people get jobs and training.</P>
    <P>There was no widespread support for the idea of dismantling Europe's long-established social support systems.  The Government certainly do not, and would not, support any such approach.  But there was interest and there is a need to facilitate more flexible arrangements for the world of work &mdash; for example, in job sharing and job rotation &mdash; which we will discuss with the social partners.  There was also interest in the idea of shifting some of the taxation on labour more towards the consumption of scarce energy and other natural resources, ideas reflected in our conclusions.</P>
    <P>I shall arrange for an Irish contribution to the Commission's White Paper.  Our input will be based on the National Development Plan and on preparation for the next <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> A key part of such a programme, if agreed, must be a coherent action plan consisting of measures drawn across the various areas underpinning employment.  These will include education, taxation, local enterprise effort, encouragement to start up business, the financing of business development and measures specifically tailored to develop individual jobs across all sectors, particularly the services sector, where we need to concentrate much more effort in future.</P>
    <P>At Copenhagen there was also recognition that a comprehensive, durable and balanced agreement in the GATT Uruguay Round would give a major impetus to trade and to growth.  The Copenhagen meeting underlined the need for the Community to play an active part while preserving the European identity throughout the negotiations.  We also stressed that it was essential to relaunch the multilateral process in Geneva as soon as possible on all topics, including agriculture.  This is in line with the position I set out here recently which I also put before my colleagues in Copenhagen. We want an agreement, but it must be balanced and equitable, and cannot unduly impact on one or two countries.</P>
    <P>All in all, on the key economic issues <Col N="2299" /> this was a workmanlike summit which took some useful decisions and initiatives that will have impact in the near term and which also agreed to work towards early adoption of a jobs-focused strategy to tackle more deep-seated structural problems inhibiting employment creation.</P>
    <P>The meeting also dealt with many other subjects, including political issues of profound importance for the Community, the European continent and the world as a whole, especially the tragic conflict in the former Yugoslavia.  These will be dealt with in the concluding statement on behalf of the Tánaiste.</P>
    <P>It was agreed that current enlargement, to include Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden, should go ahead at the beginning of 1995 on the basis of the guidelines laid down by the Lisbon and Edinburgh European Councils.  It will be recalled that the former of these decided that this enlargement is possible on the basis of the institutional provisions contained in the Maastricht Treaty and attached declarations, that is to say, without any fundamental institutional changes. The criteria on which the more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe might join some time in the future is set out.</P>
    <P>I met the British Prime Minister in London on 16 June to review Anglo-Irish relations, issues relating to the European Community in the run-up to the European Council Meeting in Copenhagen, and other matters of mutual concern to our two countries, in accordance with our agreement to hold half-yearly meetings. I was accompanied by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dick Spring, and the Minister for Justice, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn.  The Prime Minister was accompanied by the Foreign Secretary, Mr. Douglas Hurd, M.P., and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, M.P.</P>
    <P>The Prime Minister and I reaffirmed the determination of our two Governments to continue to co-operate closely on Anglo-Irish relations and to build on <Col N="2300" /> our joint commitment to the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  We noted the extensive co-operation which exists between North and South on economic and security matters, and we welcomed the full programme of work being carried out in the Anglo-Irish Conference in that regard. We deplored the acts of terrorism which have led to deaths and injury.  We pledged to sustain and improve security co-operation on both sides to ensure that violence is counteracted and the perpetrators brought to justice.  An acknowledged very high level of security co-operation has yielded significant successes in the recent past.  Both Governments are totally at one in our resolve that the political destiny of Northern Ireland will not be determined by the use of violence as a means to achieve political objectives, something it has failed to do over the past 25 years.  There is an overwhelming commitment to the political process across virtually all political persuasions on these islands, which must now be accepted and acted upon by everyone.</P>
    <P>The Prime Minister and I reviewed the prospects for a resumption of the Northern Ireland talks process, the objective of both Governments.  The Programme for a Partnership Government committed the Government to work for an early resumption of political dialogue, with the aim that all of the relationships involved will be addressed in a spirit of openness and innovation.  The Government are ready to discuss every issue and to incorporate all agreed changes in the context of an overall settlement.  Consistent with the agreed basis for the talks as set out in the 26 March 1991 statement, the Prime Minister and I agreed on the need to comprehensively address all aspects of the key relationships involved in a manner which would accommodate the rights and identities of the two main traditions on this island.  Both Governments are determined to do everything possible to bring this objective to fruition.  It is of paramount importance that all parties to the process now proceed with renewed commitment and vigour to achieve the political progress <Col N="2301" /> which is so widely desired by the peoples of both islands.</P>
    <P>The Prime Minister and I agreed that the most immediate objective must be the creation of a durable and meaningful peace so that future generations may be spared the violence which has been inflicted upon the people of Northern Ireland over the past 25 years.  As the Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, emphasised at our news conference:</P>
    <P>That is a shared wish not just between the Taoiseach and with me, that is a shared wish I think amongst the overwhelming majority of people in both parts of the island of Ireland.</P>
    <P>A political accommodation within the three-relationships framework is necessary to the laying of firm foundations for a lasting peace.  The Programme for Government commits us to seek any necessary endorsement in a referendum for an agreed package, which achieves a balanced accommodation of the differing positions of the two main traditions on constitutional issues.  Our position, as set out in the programme is a generous recognition of what is realistically viable in this area.  The Government's policy approach is based upon the reality that a durable settlement requires the establishment of political arrangements to which each tradition can give unequivocal allegiance.  It is this objective which guides us in our search for political progress.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Anglo-Irish Agreement of course will continue to operate fully, unless and until it is transcended by new agreed arrangements.  At our meeting the Prime Minister and I called on the constitutional political parties in Northern Ireland to join with us in the search for progress with a view to achieving a lasting settlement.  We agreed to remain in close contact regarding political developments in Northern Ireland and to meet again in Dublin in the latter part of the year.  There will also be continued contact at official and ministerial level to ensure maximum understanding between both Governments in matters <Col N="2302" /> which are for decision by the two Governments.</P>
    <P>The meeting also covered European Community issues arising in the context of the European Council Meeting in Copenhagen, including unemployment, enlargement, GATT, subsidiarity and foreign policy matters affecting Bosnia, Somalia and Sudan.</P>
    <P>I have had placed in the Dáil Library the joint communique issued following the meeting.</P>

      <P>It is right that job creation was at the top of the agenda at the summit but it would be fair to say that the conclusions reached were limp. In his speech the Taoiseach seemed to draw solace from the fact that all over Europe economic growth has become less job intensive; in other words, economic prosperity does not lead to the creation of more jobs.  The Taoiseach seems to feel that because we are no worse than anyone else in Europe we do not have much to worry about.  However, he seems to ignore the fact that in the United States and Japan three times as many extra jobs have been created with the same growth rate as in Europe. Therefore, something is seriously wrong in relation to the way the European economy works.  I see no evidence in the communiqué after the summit or in the Taoiseach's speech today of any realisation of the glaring fact that something is fundamentally wrong with the European economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach mentioned his £8 billion; one would think that the only European issue of any consequence discussed by Irish Ministers was whether we would get £8 billion, £7.5 billion or £8.5 billion, as if the decimal point would make much difference.  If the Taoiseach can get £9 billion, more power to him, but he seems to be convinced that the amount of money we get will determine the number of jobs we will create, this is a fallacy.  As we have seen in other European countries and indeed here, extra money, extra growth, does not lead to extra jobs; all it leads to is a wider division between those <Col N="2303" /> who have jobs and what they earn and those who do not.</P>
    <P>It has been shown that if an extra $100 is invested in the economy in the United States $80 is used to create extra jobs while the remaining $20 is used to create higher incomes for those at work. However, in Europe and Ireland, on the other hand, if an extra £100 is invested in the economy £80 goes towards higher wages and salaries for those already at work and only £20 towards the creation of new jobs for those currently unemployed. That is the fundamental problem in the Irish and European economies and that is the issue that should have been addressed at the summit.  Clearly, it was not addressed.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Taoiseach used a particular phrase in his speech.  He said that Ireland will make a contribution to the White Paper on Employment using as its source the National Development Plan, which as far as I can see will be more of the same: more infrastructural projects and more training, so-called work and FÁS schemes.  Plainly, these have not solved the problem.  Therefore we are wasting our time going back to the same well for more water.</P>
    <P>There has not been a fundamental analysis at European level of the way in which the labour market works.  What is it that differentiates our country and the rest of Europe from the rest of the world and how is it that we, in Ireland and Europe, can spend more money and fail to create jobs while they can spend more money and create jobs?</P>
    <P>Recently, the National Economic and Social Council commissioned a report on this issue written by a gentleman called Professor Lars Mjoset.  His central conclusion was that there is a lack of innovation in Ireland.  I do not think he looked at the whole picture because he ignored the way in which the labour market operates.  However, let us assume he is right, that the central problem is the lack of innovation &mdash; what has been the Government's response?  In one of the few economy measures in regard to public spending they cut grants for new <Col N="2304" /> research and development projects in industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a clear indication that the Government did not read or understand the need for innovation in the economy.  There is no point in commissioning reports if one is not going to read them.  I hope that this report commissioned by the NESC on unemployment receives a better audience.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach used another interesting phrase during the course of his remarks.  He proceeded to pat himself on the back for the fall in interest rates although he with the Minister for Finance, did everything possible to ensure that this did not happen by resisting the advice given to him by this side of the House that the Irish pound should have been devalued within the EMS.  He said that, if we were to devalue the pound within the EMS, interest rates would not fall and claimed that those who were advocating devaluation, in particular myself, were unpatriotic but eventually he was forced by the markets to take our advice.  Were his prophecies, that interest rates would not fall, fulfilled?  Of course not, interest rates fell, the only reason they fell, that house prices are now going up and confidence has increased in the economy is that the policy of the Government was overturned by the markets.  The Government had to adopt the economic policy advocated by Fine Gael and to abandon its own policies.  It was forced by the markets to take Fine Gael's advice and devalue the pound with the result that interest rates are falling and confidence in the economy is increasing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The summit highlights the fact that the philosophy of &ldquo;muddling through&rdquo;, the philosophy of this Government when it comes to taking action, has spread to Europe.  It is clear that the Council and the Commision took no decisions to relaunch the European Community following the completion of the Maastricht Treaty process.  Chancellor Kohl called for a summit as soon as the Maastricht Treaty has been ratified but there is no <Col N="2305" /> sign that this will take place or of any clear intention on the part of the leaders who gathered in Copenhagen to relaunch the European Community following the completion of the difficult process of ratifying the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>The Community has failed to show leadership even though there is a need to radically overhaul its institutions to take account of the agreed enlargement.  The Taoiseach and other leaders are fooling themselves if they think it will be possible to operate an enlarged European Community, including the Nordic countries and Austria, with the existing institutions; yet, to judge from the Taoiseach's remarks nothing will be done about this and we will continue with the existing institutions.  Europe will sink even deeper in a sea of paper and simultaneous translation where no one will understand what anyone else is saying and where the attention span of people at meetings will get shorter and shorter as meetings last longer and longer. Unless the issue of institutions is tackled the community will be incapable of dealing with its business because of its failure to deal with the institutional problems.</P>
    <P>I note that the Taoiseach is not listening to me as he is talking to the Minister sitting beside him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I welcome the conclusions of the summit relating to drug trafficking.  It is important to highlight the importance of organised international crime in undermining the concept of the Single Market.  If the Single <Col N="2306" /> Market becomes a playground for the drug barons it will be undermined.  No member state should do anything which would facilitate the laundering of the illgotten gains of those involved in drugs or other international crime.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of this year we, as a State, have had an EC obligation to make money laundering illegal.  We have failed to fulfil that international obligation. We agreed to do that in 1991 and we have been under notice since then that we would have to introduce a ban on money laundering.  We are now in direct breach of EC directives by failing, since 1 January, to outlaw money laundering. Yet this Government, which will not outlaw money laundering &mdash; it says it is too difficult and wants to put it off &mdash; is proceeding to give a tax incentive to money laundering by offering a 15 per cent tax for illgotten gains which may be brought into the Irish economy.  In other words, instead of outlawing money laundering, which the EC requires us to do, the Government is proposing to give a tax incentive to money laundering.  This shows that the Government has the mentality of the mafia.  It wants to grab money wherever it can get it, by whatever means it can get it, and it does not care whether it creates a situation through that tax incentive for illgotten gains which undermines the anti-crime war of all its European partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the points made by the Taoiseach about relaunching talks in Northern Ireland and moving towards peace.  However, I should like to ask about the Government's relations with Provisional Sinn Féin.  Would the Taoiseach now be willing to depart from the policy of his predecessors that there should be no contact with Provisional Sinn Féin?  Would the Taoiseach be willing to attend a social function and meet Mr. Adams?  Would the Minister for Enterprise and Employment be willing to attend a social function and meet Mr. Adams?  This is not now clear.  The position under all previous Governments was clear.  When the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, and I were members of a previous Coalition <Col N="2307" /> Government, we would not meet a county council delegation from, say, Galway if it contained a member of an organisation which supported the use of murder as a means of achieving its political ends.</P>
    <P>It now appears that a person who acts on the advice of the Government has been willing to meet in a social setting, acknowledge in a social way and show recognition for the leading representative of an organisation which supports the use of murder on both sides of the Border.  I speak as a member of a party, one of whose members was murdered by the IRA while I was a Member of this House. I do not believe anyone representing me, whether in Government or in Áras an Uachtarán, should meet with members of Provisional Sinn Féin until it renounces its support for violence.  I want to know where the Taoiseach stands on this issue.  Would he be willing to meet Mr. Adams?  Would the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, be willing to meet Mr. Adams? Would the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs be willing to meet Mr. Adams?  If they are willing to do so, they most certainly do not have my support.  I want to know the Government's policy on contact with Sinn Féin and the UDA. Does it believe that it should have contact with those organisations as long as they continue to support violence?</P>
    <P>Until such time as we know where we stand on this issue there is no basis for progress.  We cannot hope for a cessation of the campaign of violence until those who support that campaign know that they will not be allowed in from the cold until they withdraw their support for Provisional or Loyalist violence.  Nobody representing this State &mdash; both the Government and the President represent this State &mdash; should have anything to do socially or otherwise, with an organisation, which supports the murder of Irish people.  It is very important that there be no further ambiguity about this matter.  I hope that the Minister for Enterprise and Employment in his reply to the debate will make a clear and unambiguous <Col N="2308" /> statement that he and the Taoiseach would not meet Mr. Adams and that they would not advise anybody to meet Mr. Adams.  I should like to hear that clearly from the Minister for Enterprise and Employment on behalf of the Government.</P>
    <P>I was interested by the phrase &mdash; repeated by the Taoiseach almost like a mantra in his remarks about Northern Ireland &mdash; that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  This is a useful phrase if one is talking about the Constitution or some elaborate integrated structure &mdash; for example, one side of a bridge cannot be put in place until the other side is in place.  It would be a great mistake if by adopting the position that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, we stopped all progress on Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The important conclusion I draw from the Opsahl report is that we have to be prepared to take many little steps while waiting to take the one big leap.  There are many small things that could be done to build up trust between the two communities which should be done straight away without waiting for everything to be agreed.  For example, progress could be made in the area of policing, giving the Ombudsman responsibility for police complaints, and specific de-escalatory measures could be taken by the security forces to reduce the level of violence, even if it is not stopped completely.  Progress can also be made in the area of integrated education &mdash; I think only 1 per cent of students in Northern Ireland attend multi-denominational schools &mdash; and in developing integrated housing. We should seek to make progress on those specific areas immediately.  Instead of using the fact that we cannot put this great elaborate structure of a totally integrated settlement in place as an excuse for doing nothing, the Government should be utilising every mechanism at its disposal, whether through the Anglo-Irish Conference or bilateral contacts with all of the political parties, including the Unionists in Northern Ireland, to have those little steps taken.  This will, to use diplomatic jargon, lead to confidence-building <Col N="2309" /> measures which may create the conditions in which the bigger deal can be put together.  My advice to the Taoiseach is that we should not wait for the big deal and do nothing in the meantime.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise publicly with the Taoiseach a matter I raised privately with him before he met the British Prime Minister. I asked the Taoiseach privately to raise with the Prime Minister the position of John Mathews, whose family &mdash; some of whom I only met yesterday &mdash; are extremely worried about him, believe the evidence upon which he is being held on remand is scimpy to say the least and sincerely believe that he has no contact whatever with violence.  They are very conscious that on, I think, 10 July &mdash; I do not know the precise date &mdash; the Attorney General in Britain will make a decision whether he has a case to answer. My understanding is that in the normal course of events the Attorney General does not look at these cases; he accepts the advice at a lower level and the case either goes to trial or it does not.  I asked the Taoiseach to raise this matter specifically with the Prime Minister, to ask the Prime Minister to ask the Attorney General to look at this case personally.  This was not to prejudice his decision.  I asked that the Attorney General would look at this case himself and not delegate it to somebody else.  Given that I do not make that many requests to the Taoiseach, I am disappointed that the Taoiseach did not refer to this case in his remarks.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This summit on jobs was like so many other summits on jobs in this jurisdiction &mdash; much talk and no action; much tokenism and no analysis; no depth of <Col N="2310" /> understanding of the true nature of unemployment and no willingness to change the way in which the entire tax and social systems, not just of Ireland but of all European countries, act as a disincentive to the creation of jobs and to the taking-up of employment.  Until Europe as a whole and Ireland in particular is willing to tackle the way in which the tax and social welfare systems imprison people in unemployment, we will not make any progress.  The Taoiseach and the other European leaders stand condemned for shying away from the facts as far as unemployment is concerned. They are not facing up to the fact that other parts of the world have a better job creation record than we have in Europe and until that is tackled properly &mdash; I regard the Copenhagen Summit as a complete disappointment &mdash; not just Ireland but the rest of Europe will be in a position where its political leaders are, by omission, allowing 17 million Europeans to remain without a job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>While the conclusions of the Community summit in Copenhagen of 21 and 22 June are extensive, ranging from the problems of unemployment to the Maastricht single market agenda, from GATT to enlargement and relations with Central and Eastern Europe and the Yugoslav crisis, I propose to concentrate my remarks on two key issues: possible Community responses to the unemployment problem and the appalling Bosnian tragedy and I will then deal with Northern Ireland in whatever time is left at my disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that at long last the European Community has brought unemployment to the forefront of its overall agenda.  No doubt one of the reasons for this is the growing unemployment crisis across the Community, with some 17 million people now out of work in the 12 member states.  I also believe that this welcome departure is in part a response to the criticism flowing from the Maastricht Treaty upheavals, that the Community institutions, and in particular the Commission, were out of touch with the concerns of ordinary Community <Col N="2311" /> citizens and were obsessed with grandiose institutional plans for the Single Market and economic and monetary convergence.</P>
    <P>I note that the European Council has proposed a special White Paper on unemployment to be presented as a medium-term strategy for its next summit at Brussels in December next and that member states are invited to submit proposals to the Commission before 1 September next, which might be included in this initiative.  Of course, whatever submission Ireland makes has to be in the context of an acceptance that our unemployment level of 20 per cent approximately is perhaps the worst in the Community and, therefore, any prescription we offer must be one that we are willing to apply in our own economy in the first instance.</P>
    <P>The scale of the Community wide jobs crisis now besetting the Community, and afflicting even its four economic giants &mdash; Germany, France, Italy and Britain &mdash; is demonstrated by the fact that over the past two years over five million jobs have been lost in the EC.  Moreover, informed Community experts believe that a growth rate of 3 per cent will be necessary in order to stop the present crisis worsening further.  However, in the current year it is expected that for the first time since the seventies the Community will actually experience negative growth.</P>
    <P>It is also quite obvious from all the key economic indicators that growth in the Community will be extremely sluggish for the next year or two.  Therefore unemployment is set not to ease, but will continue to worsen over the next two to three years at least.  In that context, the eight point plan which seeks to address the unemployment problem and which was tabled at the summit by President Delors, entitled <i>Entering the 21st Century,</i> sets out some laudable principles in relation to such issues as economic and monetary union, increased co-operation in the field of research and development, developing efficient transport and telecom-communications networks, urging educational change as a lifelong pursuit and <Col N="2312" /> posing some interesting labour market initiatives, particularly in the field of taxation.</P>
    <P>Of particular interest from an Irish perspective is President Delors' suggestion that every member of the workforce must be given when he terms &ldquo;a job, activity or useful training&rdquo; and also his suggestion that excessive taxes on labour could be reduced by taxing what he terms &ldquo;scarce natural resources&rdquo;, or what are generally referred to as eco-taxes.  The reference to a possible &ldquo;activity&rdquo; for the unemployed is generally taken as a reference to social employment being provided by the State for the unemployed.  Certainly here in Ireland, given the scale of our unemployment crisis, it is quite clear that notwithstanding whatever level of economic growth and recovery we achieve, we will continue into the medium-term, at least, with very serious levels of unemployment. In that context the Progressive Democrats Party supports the formulation and implementation of a national community employment scheme to offer the long term unemployed, initially on a voluntary basis, at least part time employment and training.</P>
    <P>The other Delors proposal to tackle excessive tax on work is interesting for a number of reasons from an Irish perspective. Firstly, we should be careful about such a proposal, given that here in Ireland, we already have very high taxes on energy sources, for instance, and we must be very careful lest any tax changes might further damage our competitiveness. But it is interesting to see a renewed focus at EC level on the problem of wage costs, and this is a very familiar priority of the Progressive Democrats. My party has consistently argued that we cannot be serious about tackling unemployment, and we will not make serious inroads in doing so, as long as we tax employment so punitively.  This trend, of course, was further exacerbated by the present Government in this year's budget.  We now have the bizarre situation, for instance, where it costs an employer £2.59 to give a worker an additional £1 take home pay at the average industrial wage, and the fact that a <Col N="2313" /> worker earning £15,000 gross per annum, who is married with four children, is worse off in net terms than if he earned only £8,000 gross.</P>
    <P>Clearly, though, this is not a uniquely Irish disease.  An interesting article in today's <i>Financial Times,</i> reflecting on the new priority being accorded by the Community to the problem of unemployment, begins as follows:</P>
    <P>A middle ranking manager in a Belgian company on a gross salary of 100,000 Belgian Francs a month will cost his/her employer about 250,000 Belgian Francs a month, and will receive a take-home pay of only about 50,000 Belgian Francs.  To dismiss the same manager will cost the employer about three times the employee's annual salary.</P>
    <P>This focusing on the excessive burden of payroll taxes on work at a Community level is nothing new to this country, or certainly to the Progressive Democrats. Indeed, I will be extremely interested to see what kind of submission the Government will make to the Commission in its preparation of its White Paper on employment initiatives, which is to be submitted by 1 September next.</P>
    <P>In the context of the next round of Structural Funds covering the period from 1994-98, I do hope that we are successful in securing the much talked about and much vaunted £8 billion allocation. While not minimising for one moment the vital national importance to us of these Structural Funds, it is essential that Ireland also addresses the larger questions facing the Community.  The bottom line so far as this country is concerned is that our bread and butter is exporting to the European Single Market, and the stronger and more effective that market is, the better for this country.</P>
    <P>This week the European Council and President Delors obviously endorse the necessity to resume the completion of a single currency and economic convergence. The reality, however, is that the Community is on a path of divergence. On the key convergence criteria of the borrowings-GDP ratio, the Community <Col N="2314" /> is currently seriously adrift and is immersed in a serious economic downturn. Moreover the paradox is that if the Community seeks to speedily resume the path to economic convergence, it could actually exacerbate the underlying economic recession, resulting in even lower growth and higher unemployment.</P>
    <P>Turning briefly to the summit's conclusion in relation to the GATT negotiations, it is fine in principle to have the Council underline how important it is to relaunch the multilateral process in Geneva as soon as possible on all issues, including agriculture, and to seek to conclude a &ldquo;comprehensive, durable and balanced agreement before the end of the year&rdquo;.  That mandate for the Commission is fine so far as it goes.  But how do we square it with last week's major bilateral deal between Germany and the United States on telecommunications which was an enormous breach of this week's European Community mandate to the Commission? Furthermore the proposed deadline of the end of this year raises the question of what is the bottom-line that our Government will be seeking by way of rebalancing of the agricultural package negotiated at Blair House, Washington, last November.</P>
    <P>The enormous capacity of the European Community, and in particular the Commission, for high-blown rhetoric which scarcely accords with reality is sadly nowhere better mirrored than in the summit's conclusions in relation to Bosnia.</P>
    <P>While nobody could disagree with the Council's conclusions urging a negotiated settlement based on the Vance/Owen peace plan &mdash; even though that seems to be abandoned &mdash; and the need to respect the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia-Hercegovina and to ensure the protection of human rights and the rights of minorities, and the inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by force, the reality on the ground is a mockery of all these fine-sounding propositions.  The reality is that the collective failure of the European Community, including this country as a member state, in their response to the Bosnian crisis is shameful.  Here is a country <Col N="2315" /> witnessing genocide on an unprecedented level in post-war Europe. Millions of people have been driven out of their homeland and an estimated 250,000 people have died in the campaign of genocide which has been waged over the past two years.</P>
    <P>The European Community recognition of the independence of Bosnia-Hercegovina, and its admission into the United Nations, implies moral obligations to that country.  In particular it means that the Moslem people of Bosnia-Herzegovina should not be butchered, hunted from their homes and have their entire way of life destroyed.  This week's Copenhagen Summit urges the speedy implementation of the United Nations Security Council resolutions in relation to so-called safe areas.  Of course this term is a further mockery, given the day-to-day bombardment and massacres occurring in places like Gorazde.</P>
    <P>The present situation is a shame on the United Nations, the European Community and on Ireland as a member state of that Community.  The bottom line reality so far is that force pays, that fundamental human rights do not matter, and that the so-called civilised western world stands idly by while genocide, mass rape, concentration camps, massacres and other unspeakable atrocities occur on the European continent.  The exhortation by the Copenhagen Summit Conclusions to respond positively to the UN request for &ldquo;men and money&rdquo; should certainly be heeded as much as possible. While I note that in the wake of the summit the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, stated that our Government has received no request from the United Nations to commit troops to seek to protect the so-called safe areas in Bosnia, I believe that, in keeping with our outstanding record of peacekeeping in other world trouble spots, this country would be and should be willing to participate in such an undertaking, even though this will not be strictly peacekeeping but may well be peace-making.  The legal power to engage in those activities will presumably be <Col N="2316" /> available following the enactment of the Defence Bill within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the Taoiseach's meeting with Prime Minister Major in London on 16 June, to which he referred in his opening statement.  Neither what has been said by the Taoiseach this evening nor anything that was said in press conferences following that meeting gave one any indication that anything new or positive was happening.  Essentially, what the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister appear to be doing is agreeing with one another on many fine sounding ambitions and aspirations but, more importantly, in effect, agreeing not to take any initiative. The obligation to take an initiative in the present situation is one primarily for the two Governments.  It is an obligation that rests equally on both.  The Taoiseach's attitude has always been &mdash; and it is confirmed in his statement this evening &mdash; that we will consider what is put on the table and that he is prepared to recommend what he has called in the past a balanced package.  It is abundantly clear that he has no wish to contribute positively to the formulation of such a package and in particular that he has no wish to begin the process of compromise and the process of indicating to other parties at these talks that all the old historical requirements can at least be set aside in part so that progress can be made on the basis that everybody will compromise.</P>
    <P>There is no indication either in the speech tonight or otherwise that I am aware of, of any likelihood of a speedy resumption of these talks.  That is very depressing.  If talks have not started within the next week they are not likely to start before the autumn and, indeed, there is no indication that they will start in the autumn.  The possibility of those talks has not been helped by the unhappy event which took place in west Belfast last Thursday.  It was an overly political event and was very unusual in that respect.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House that that event could, in the last resort, have been avoided by an exercise of the Government's prerogative under Article 12.9 <Col N="2317" /> of the Constitution.  It appears that the Government chose not to exercise that prerogative and did so, presumably, with the full knowledge of what was likely to happen.  Therefore, we cannot say it is not a matter for the Government.  On the other hand, I have to say that the second unusual aspect of the events towards the end of last week was the disclosure for the first time ever, to my knowledge, of advice tendered.  We ended up with the rather unseemly situation that two contrary versions were being given in respect of the advice tendered.  The matter is an unfortunate one, but it is important. However briefly one is referring to current events in Northern Ireland, it is unreal to suggest that what happened last Thursday and certain aspects of its aftermath are unimportant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In his opening statement the Taoiseach referred to his talks with Mr. Major, the British Prime Minister, in regard to Northern Ireland, Effectively, he said there will not be serious negotiations between the British and Irish Governments and the parties in Northern Ireland at least until the autumn.  The possibility of that happening even then is very dim and it is time we acknowledged it because unless we do and acknowledge the realities of the position in Northern Ireland and the difficulties in restarting the three-stranded talks to which the Taoiseach referred, effectively, we are allowing the paramilitaries to exercise a veto on the peace process.  It is important that because the three-stranded process has come to a full stop we should not allow the process of peace-making to stop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently I put my views on Northern Ireland on the record of this House.  I stated what the Irish and British Governments should do in that regard.  There are two straightforward things the Irish and British Governments could and should do in the absence of three-stranded talks.  First, the British Government should take a firm decision to do something about the economy of Northern Ireland, which is in shreds.  Unemployment is almost as high there as in the <Col N="2318" /> Republic.  The alienation in working class areas, where the paramilitaries gain most of their recruits, is as strong as in any other unemployed part of this island.  I argue that a major economic development plan for Northern Ireland, using whatever assistance available from the European Community, could have a major impact on the capacity of the paramilitaries to recruit new members and maintain and sustain their paramilitary campaigns.  Second, the Irish Government could declare once and for all that it intends to change Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  The Government has argued that this is not a solution.  I have never argued that it is a solution, but it is part of the process needed to bring about peace on this island.</P>
    <P>It is self-evident that removing the siege, which Unionists feel they are under, by declaring that we intend to change our Constitution would be of untold assistance in ensuring that the democratic political parties in Northern Ireland could find it possible to talk about an internal arrangement which could be part of the peace process in Northern Ireland.  Those matters could be dealt with next week.  We cannot allow the process to grind to a halt and put it off until the autumn.  Unfortunately, for the people of Northern Ireland, the paramilitaries do not go on summer holidays. Therefore, it is esential that the Government should do its best to restart the talks.  However, they should not leave it at that, other initiatives are required to ascertain the way forward in bringing about a sense of security among the majority of people in Northern Ireland who are not engaged in paramilitary activities.</P>
    <P>The opening phrase in the conclusions of the European Council meeting in Copenhagen emphasises the current malaise in the European Community and the frantic search for a solution to the gloom without attempting to tackle the underlying causes.  In welcoming the outcome of the recent Danish referendum on Maastricht, the heads of Government stated their determination that it &ldquo;should mark the end of a prolonged period of <Col N="2319" /> uncertainty on the Community's direction&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This rush to grasp at straws illustrates the unwillingness to date of the member states to take into account the massive changes since the Treaty on European Union was cobbled together in the last years of a bipolar world.  Developments since 1990 have shown the need for a fresh look at what the new Europe and the new world should be doing.  If winning the day in the Danish referendum is seen as the end of the crisis on European union, then our heads of Government are seriously fooling themselves.</P>
    <P>Throughout the European Community there is considerable unease and confusion on the implementation of the European project.  The close result of the French referendum on Maastricht, the continued uncertainty in Britain, the rise of nationalist, neo-fascist and anti-European movements and parties in virtually every European Community member state illustrate a profound unease with the entire process of European union. How to establish an enthusiastic commitment among European citizens for the concept of European union is not addressed in the Copenhagen Conclusions.  The section headed &ldquo;A Community close to its Citizens&rdquo; ignores the alienation of an increasing number of its citizens.  If, despite the glowing references to the principles of subsidiarity and transparency, the European Parliament continues to be denied any real powers, if Council meetings continue to meet in virtual secrecy, if applicant countries such as Austria, Sweden, Norway and Finland are told to accept Maastricht or stay outside, if the problems facing less developed central and East European States are effectively deferred to the next century, the crisis in the Community and on its borders will not be resolved, confidence will not be restored and construction of a peaceful and resilient Community and continent will be made extremely difficult.</P>
    <P>In this regard I wish to express my extreme concern at the comments of the German Chancellor in proposing the lifting <Col N="2320" /> of the arms embargo on Bosnia.  This proposal was described, correctly in my view, by the French President as &ldquo;a desperate solution&rdquo;.  It was the earlier insistence of the German Government on the EC setting deadlines for Slovenia and Croatia to declare independence and subsequently setting a similar deadline for Bosnia-Hercegovina, which led to the sudden break-up of the Yugoslav federation. I understand, of course, that factors within the Yugoslav federation might eventually have led to a break-up but in the present form it was inevitable given the stance of the Germans supported by others in the recent past.  Proposing to increase the levels of armaments in the region will serve only to increase the death toll and widen the conflict to adjacent territories and states.</P>
    <P>It sidesteps the issue of how the civil war there can be brought to an end and how incipient conflicts elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe can be prevented.  It is also contrary to all the principles of peace-keeping which the United nations is seeking to employ, despite its weaknesses and strategic difficulties. What concerns me is that the Dutch Government seemed prepared to consider this option while there were other references to not lifting the embargo &ldquo;at this stage&rdquo;.  It is imperative that the European Community should not be bullied into accepting a policy for Bosnia or any other country in future which would fuel conflict and possibly lead to its eventual internationalisation.</P>
    <P>The Council has at last begun to pay serious attention to the unemployment crisis.  By the middle of the decade it is projected that EC jobless figures will reach the 20 million mark with 50 million people living below the poverty line. Horrific as this is, it is worth bearing in mind that Irish statistics are even worse and amount to twice the European average.</P>
    <P>The Council has made a number of potentially useful decisions with regard to action on job creation, including a medium-term strategy for growth, competitiveness and employment for consideration at the December summit.  I <Col N="2321" /> note that member states have been requested to make submissions on &ldquo;proposals of specific elements which might be included in this initiative by September 1st&rdquo;.  I would like to inquire of the Government how it intends to comply with this submission, when the work will be done and what facility the Oireachtas and interested outside organisations and members of the public will be provided with to make an input to the submission. I propose that committees in the House be enabled to make an input during the course of July and September.  It seems that there could hardly be a more vital issue on which the Government needs to get it right and on which confidential Cabinet discussions or secret stroke pulling must not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>While it is not stated in as many words, there appears to be a recognition that the next round of Structural Funds should be used specifically to assist job creation. There are a number of references to the requirements of peripheral regions and their &ldquo;relation&rdquo; to the centre of the Community. The Irish Government must ensure that this new recognition of the need for action on unemployment is responded to effectively.  It must ensure that Ireland, as a peripheral region, gains the necessary support from Community funds to at last develop our living standards beyond the &ldquo;two thirds&rdquo; status at which we have languished relative to the EC average since joining the Community two decades ago.  We in Ireland must ensure that that catching up is not done by enriching the rich but by improving the lives of the poor and the powerless.</P>
    <P>The conclusions contain an interesting proposal to consider the use of EIB loans as a bridging facility to assist development and jobs as an additional measure in advance of the Structural and Cohesion Funds coming fully on stream.  While the loan repayment would be drawn from future Structural Fund allocations, there could be merit in judicious use of this option as a means of funding job creation projects.  I would be interested to hear in more detail why the Taoiseach so readily disregarded the proposal.  He has been quoted as being unwilling to accept any <Col N="2322" /> measures which might increase the national debt, but investment in development should not be spurned so readily.</P>
    <P>I would also like to hear the views of the Labour Party on this issue.  During the last general election campaign Labour argued strongly, as indeed I did, on the need for investment borrowing as a means of boosting the economy.  Where does the Tánaiste and, indeed, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, stand on this proposal from the Council?</P>
    <P>A further concern is that we must ensure that any review of employment creation policy is not used as an opportunity to water down social legislation in the Community.  There is a constant clamour for changes and reductions in social legislation as a means to &ldquo;create jobs&rdquo;.  However, the evidence does not point to any success when this approach is implemented.  Britain, which has for more than a decade pursued a systematic assault on workers' rights, to the extent of opting out of its obligations under the Social Chapter of the Maastricht Treaty, has one of the weakest economies and highest unemployment rates in the Community.</P>
    <P>Applicant countries like Austria and those from Scandinavia, on the other hand, maintain both a high level of social protection and low unemployment. Indeed, I strongly welcome the prospect of entry of these countries to the Community by 1995 as a means of bringing a fresh and more optimistic understanding to the hitherto economistic and banker's interpretation of how the Single Market process should be handled, and so they may address the review on the Union in 1996.</P>
    <P>The announcement by the Taoiseach at the start of the summit of plans for a new £160 a week scheme to take 30,000 people off the dole is welcome.  It is clear, even from the limited information available, that the proposals made by Democratic Left before the last general election for a community employment programme to employ 25,000 people fulltime and a further 25,000 on part time basis, have been read carefully by Government advisers.  We may, therefore, shortly see <Col N="2323" /> a partial implementation of our plan. What is curious is that the Taoiseach decided to announce it as a publicity stunt at the summit and that it was not discussed first in the Dáil, and with local Community and unemployed organisations.</P>
    <P>The specifics of the Government proposal are as yet unclear.  How will the positions be filled and will there be any element of compulsory recruitment? What type of taxation regime will apply to the payments?  Will the scheme fall within the Structural Funds or the Delors jobs initiative?  Will people taken on the scheme have their hopes subsequently dashed a year or two later by being transferred back to the dole again?</P>
    <P>In Democratic Left's proposals for a community employment programme we proposed that these jobs would last from three to five years, that the scheme would be linked to plans for long term economic development potential and would be operated under the local partnership schemes set up under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> We also stipulated that employees on the scheme would be treated as full employees in every respect, paid the going rate, entitled to holiday pay, disability benefit, protective labour legislation and so forth. Jobs should not be established in competition with other services and should also seek to open up new areas of employment, such as sports training and local child care centres.  There should be a strong training and educational element in the new scheme, both on and off the job.  If the Government ever manage to bring their proposals before the Dáil &mdash; because they have a habit of producing these things and proceeding with them outside of the Dáil &mdash; I hope we will have an opportunity of improving the scheme in the way I have outlined.</P>
    <P>I note that the Taoiseach hopes to receive 75 per cent EC funding for his own proposal.  An interesting point arises in regard to additionality if this is accepted by the EC.  When tax and PRSI clawbacks are taken into account, the Governments would end up contributing <Col N="2324" /> little or nothing to the scheme.  Furthermore, when the saving on dole payments to people on the scheme are taken into account the question arises: what will the Government do with the money saved?  In our view it should be used as a means of paying the going rate for jobs under the scheme and as a source of investment in further job creation.</P>
    <P>While the proposals are welcome in principle, the enormity of the unemployment crisis is shown by the fact that even if 30,000 are taken off the dole, it will tackle barely 10 per cent of the unemployment figure.  If we are to reverse the continued slide into endemic unemployment much more is clearly needed.  How we use the next set of Structural and Cohesion Funds will be crucial to tackling this problem.  As I said on an earlier occasion when discussing the National Development Plan, these funds, while in one sense very substantial, are not an automatic panacea.  When debating the £8 billion EC funds I pointed out that we must face up to the fact that in the last tranche of the Structural Funds, just 14 per cent of the working population and a mere 5 per cent of the total population obtained more than half of all EC funds during the 1989-93 period.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a bottom up approach to spending.  Communities in need must themselves be involved in the process.  The Copenhagen conclusions state that the objective must be that the principles of subsidiarity and openness are firmly anchored in all spheres of community activity and fully respected in day to day operations.  If this is not the mere hollow rhetoric then we must end the process where Irish Government Ministers fly to Brussels with the begging bowl, but when it is filled they fly home to dispense the funds in a highly selective and unequal way.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would draw an example from the success of the Portuguese Government less than two years ago, when they negotiated £450 million in grants to bring a major car manufacturing project to that country.  The project is estimated to bring 5,000 direct and 7,000 indirect jobs to a country where one <Col N="2325" /> would not expect to see such an industry established.  Similar imaginative initiatives are required by the Irish Government on industry appropriate to Ireland in areas such as computer technology and food processing.  I urge that in preparing its submission in advance of the next summit the Government will take such a proposal on board and thereby seek to deal effectively with job creation and demonstrate that they are seriously concerned and not simply waiting for emigration or demographic changes to deal with the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to make this concluding statement in this series on his behalf.  The Tánaiste regrets that engagements in Bonn arranged some time ago, including a meeting with the German Vice Chancellor and Minister for Foreign Affairs, prevent him from making this statement personally.  However, it gives me great personal pleasure to make it and, as a former Labour Party spokesperson on Foreign Affairs, to note with some degree of pride that the Copenhagen meeting was the first EC summit meeting attended by a Labour Party Minister for Foreign Affairs since the European Council first met in Dublin in March 1975.  It certainly will not be the last summit at which our party will be representing this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in his opening statement earlier, dealt with the main economic issues on which the Copenhagen meeting focused.  He also mentioned that the meeting also dealt with other issues of tremendous importance for the Community, for Europe as a whole and for the entire international community.  I shall because of the time limit refer to a number of these, but first let me say on behalf of the Tánaiste and of my party that we also greatly welcome the fact that growth, jobs and unemployment were, along with the situation in Bosnia-Hercegovina, the issues that dominated the meeting.  These are the issues that are preoccupying our peoples, especially <Col N="2326" /> here in Ireland, and it is vital that the European Community harness all its energies, all its political will, all its resources of brainpower and money to tackle them effectively.  Copenhagen was a significant step forward in that respect.</P>
    <P>The European Council addressed a number of issues in the framework of European political co-operation, giving particular attention to the extremely grave situation in former Yugoslavia.  At a special meeting of Foreign Ministers on the night before the European Council, David Owen gave Foreign Ministers a detailed account of the current situation and prospects.  The background to the discussions was the new round of talks in Geneva under the chairmanship of David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg.  These talks began on 16 June and resumed on 23 June.  The Serb and Croat sides have proposed what is broadly a tripartite division of territory within Bosnia-Hercegovina in place of the proposal in the Vance/Owen plan for ten semi-autonomous provinces.  In these difficult circumstances the Bosnian Government is maintaining its commitment to the process of negotiation.</P>
    <P>In the absence of agreement between the three ethnic parties, the human tragedy in Bosnia worsens, the breakdown of civil society intensifies and the dependence on humanitarian relief efforts grow.  At the same time these relief efforts are jeopardised by the continuing violence on the ground.</P>
    <P>The policy agreed by the European Council in the course of two days of discussions is centred on the following elements: support for the negotiating efforts of Owen and Stoltenberg; insistence that a settlement must be acceptable to all three parties &mdash; in particular the Community will not accept a territorial solution dictated by Serbs and Croats at the expense of the Bosnian Muslims &mdash; and, thirdly, speedy implementation of UN Security Council resolutions on safe areas.  This overall approach is designed to make the strongest possible contribution to bringing the fighting to an end and achieving a fair and viable settlement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2327" /> The commitment of the European Community to the population of Bosnia-Hercegovina is expressed politically in our continuing support for the unity and independence of the country and for the other principles agreed at the London Conference last year which must be respected in any settlement.  The Community's commitment is also expressed through humanitarian efforts and through a readiness to respond positively to the request of the UN Secretary-General for additional contributions to UNPROFOR.</P>
    <P>Economic sanctions will continue to be rigorously applied.  As has been widely reported in the media, the European Council did not support a lifting of the arms embargo.  The general view, shared by Ireland, was that such a step could have uncontrolled and unpredictable consequences, putting more lives at risk and bringing about a spillover of the conflict into new areas.</P>
    <P>The key question now is whether the Serbs and Croats are prepared to respect the principles on which the international community has agreed as a basis for a just settlement.  In the context of a new federal or confederal arrangement for Bosnia, the rights and requirements of the Muslims must be fully reflected.  It will of course take compromise on all sides to halt the spiral of cruelty and violence.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have asked whether discussions at the European Council will lead to an increased involvement by Ireland in the efforts of the United Nations.  We already have a presence in Bosnia-Hercegovina through the EC monitor mission, the attachment of Irish officers to UNPROFOR and our humanitarian workers.  We have not been approached in connection with the most recent Security Council resolutions on UNPROFOR.  The Tánaiste has stated elsewhere that the UN is likely to look at the question of any further involvement by Ireland in the light of our existing commitments to UN peacekeeping, which in proportional terms represent an exceptional effort on our part.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2328" /> The appalling events we have seen in former Yugoslavia underline for us all the need for the Community, as the anchor of stability in Europe, to take creative and generous initiatives in both the economic and political spheres to ensure that never again shall we see these horrors replicated. It is vital that we support the courageous efforts being made in the countries of central and eastern Europe and in Russia to build and root democracy and to carry through the daunting process of economic reform and that we aim to promote such efforts also in the Ukraine and in the other states stemming from the former Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>The Community and its member states have already done a great deal along these lines but a step forward of fundamental significance was taken in Copenhagen when, in the words of the Presidency Conclusions:</P>
    <P>the European Council (today) agreed that associated countries in Central and Eastern Europe that so desire shall become members of the European Union.  Accession will take place as soon as an associated country is able to assume the obligations of membership by satisfying the economic and political conditions required. </P>
    <P>These conditions comprise achievement of stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for the protection of minorities, the existence of a functioning market economy, as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the union and adherence to the aims of political, economic and monetary union.  The conclusions also say that the union's own capacity to absorb new members, while maintaining the momentum of European integration, is also an important consideration.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it is one in which Ireland has a vital interest.  But, with all European countries, we also have a vital interest in peace and stability on our Continent.  The conditions to be met, particularly on the economic side, imply that it will be quite a number of years before these countries <Col N="2329" /> join the Community; but the clear affirmation that we want to see them doing so is a keystone in building the framework of stability.  But the summit went a good deal further.  It agreed that future co-operation with those countries will be geared to the objective of membership and approved an extensive programme of measures to enhance and upgrade significantly the existing co-operation. These are set out in the conclusions which have been laid before the House.  These also set out steps to be taken in support of Albania and of the Baltic states, including proposals to develop the existing trade agreements with the latter into free trade agreements.</P>
    <P>The meeting also adopted important conclusions on Russia, welcoming the new initiatives in the area of political reform undertaken by President Yeltsin; urging early conclusion of the partnership and co-operation agreement, on which recent negotiations registered progress; agreeing to hold regular meetings between the Presidents of the European Council and Commission and of Russia; and seeing the coming World Economic Summit in Tokyo as a timely opportunity to further the substantial efforts already made to support the reform measures under way and also make progress on issues relating to nuclear safety in the former Soviet Union.  Deputies may be aware that it is expected that President Yeltsin will attend the Tokyo meeting.</P>
    <P>The House is also aware that at their recent meeting in Paris the French Prime Minister, Mr. Balladur, presented to the Taoiseach his proposal for an initiative to be taken by the European Union for a pact on stability in Europe.  This is directed at assuring in practice the application of the principles agreed by European countries &mdash; in the Helsinki and Paris CSCE Charters and otherwise &mdash; with regard to respect for borders and rights of minorities.  The pace is seen as complementary to the CSCE instruments but as having the advantage, as regards implementation, of being able to draw on the economic leverage of the European Union.</P>
    <P>The Copenhagen meeting agreed that <Col N="2330" /> recent events in Europe have shown that action in these areas is timely and appropriate. It welcomed the idea of using, for the purpose in view, the &ldquo;Joint Action&rdquo; instrument provided for in the Maastricht Treaty and asked the Foreign Affairs Council to report on the proposal to the Brussels European Council next December with a view to convening a preparatory conference on the pact.  As the Tánaiste had indicated, our preliminary reaction in Ireland to the French proposal, even before Copenhagen, had been favourable.  There are aspects of it that will require to be clarified and to be developed with care, but we see it as a useful contribution to the general process of creating a new order of stability and peace in Europe.  The decisions at Copenhagen generally represent a solid contribution towards that objective, although much will depend, in terms both of genuine improvement in the terrible situation on the ground and of the Community's credibility, on the follow-up to the Declaration on Bosnia-Hercegovina.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Clontuskert (Galway) Group Water Scheme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to raise this important matter and place on the record of this House the sad state of affairs that in this day and age several hundred householders, farmers and others in the Clontuskert area of Ballinasloe, County Galway, do not have a water supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most galling aspect of this case is that, unlike many other areas around the country, there is an outstanding water supply available for distribution to the householders concerned, both in terms of quality and quantity.  The Ballinasloe Urban District Council has given permission for its mains to be tapped and because of a very substantial State investment in the mid-1980s there is far more water available than needed within the environs of Ballinasloe town, even allowing for future needs not yet identified.  It <Col N="2331" /> should have been a relatively easy task to pipe water to the nearby parishes given the availability of a water source but it appears nothing is easy.</P>
    <P>A very energetic local group water scheme committee was formed but they ran into a maze of bureaucracy.  Very ambitious and necessary plans were drawn up to supply water to a huge area requiring running water urgently. However, resources provided by Government for ever increasing costly water schemes began to dwindle and the prospect of getting a single house connected became a mere fantasy.  The years rolled on and, despite many very angry public meetings, countless deputations and internal committee meetings, the people of Clontuskert and the surrounding areas still do not have water. Indeed, I understand that this group water scheme committee met the Minister for the Environment in Roscrea recently.  I hope the Minister of State is aware of that.</P>
    <P>The committee, with local elected representatives, met senior county council officials about three months ago and a new revised programme of work was agreed on.  In brief outline that meeting decided that Galway County Council would lay a major pipeline from Ballinasloe to Stapleton's Cross, Clontuskert, together with a smaller pipe which would be used to supply water along the route.  The group water scheme committee would then be in a position to organise their own scheme which would bring water to about 125 houses and farms and another 25 to 30 land connections.</P>
    <P>This is Phase I of a much larger scheme but it would be regarded as a giant step forward if it commenced.  The new proposal is well known in the Minister's Department as I understand the council submitted the plans to the Department some weeks ago.  It has a price tag of between £240,000 and £250,000.  This compares well with the original cost of the scheme, which was almost £1.5 million. However, the commencement of this scheme would boost confidence locally <Col N="2332" /> and prove to people who are now angry and cynical that the Government understands their needs and will, respond accordingly.</P>
    <P>I do not need to explain to the House the importance of running water.  Much Dáil time was given recently to the discussion of many social issues, all of which to one degree or another try to liberate the individual and the term &ldquo;basic human right&rdquo; has echoed time and time again in this Chamber.  I submit that failure by the Government to provide the environment which will allow families in ordinary homes to acquire running water is definitely a severe curtailment of a basic human right.</P>
    <P>The families in Clontuskert are prepared to pay the going rate for a group water scheme of between £500 and £600 per house.  They are ready, willing and able to take on the responsibility of organising and administering the group water scheme themselves.  However, they cannot move an inch until the Minister's Department provides the £250,000 to fund the main pipeline to Stapleton's Cross.  Not only will this investment bring water to approximately 150 homes, it will form the framework for the second phase to link as many more houses in the next round.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State, on behalf of everybody in the Clontuskert-Ballinasloe area, to make this relatively small sum available this year so that work may commence immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleague, Deputy Connaughton.  I cannot remember getting as many letters and telephone calls about any scheme as the Clontuskert scheme.  The committee was so anxious to obtain a commitment in regard to it that representatives went to see the Minister for the Environment in his constituency. I know that Clontuskert is only one of 129 schemes in Galway awaiting <Col N="2333" /> approval; indeed the budget of £2 million could have been spent on the total Clontuskert scheme last year.  However, if the scheme can be carried out in phases it would be the best approach and the £250,000 mentioned for Phase I would be the ideal way to begin.  I ask the Minister and the Minister of State to approve Phase I to Stapleton's Cross and, hopefully, sanction the other phases of the scheme also.  These people are desperate for a water scheme and they have made this known to their local public representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> I thank Deputy Connaughton for raising on the Adjournment this issue which is supported by Deputy Michael Kitt.  I know they have the interests of the area at heart.</P>
      <P>This scheme proposes to serve up to 200 households and associated farms in an area centred about three miles from Ballinasloe.</P>
      <P>This is a large group scheme with a daily water requirement of over 250,000 gallons per day.  For many years, the group were unable to progress their scheme as all efforts to locate a suitable source proved fruitless.</P>
      <P>The public water supply at Ballinasloe is the nearest suitable alternative source for householders in the Clontuskert area. However, extending the distribution system as far as the group catchment would add significantly to overall group costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Galway County Council considered that the task of laying a very large diameter water-main through a built up area was beyond the capacity of a private group to execute and manage.  Following a detailed examination of the situation, the council put forward a proposal to serve the Laurencetown, Kiltormer and Aughrim areas by way of the Ballinasloe regional water supply scheme.  Phase I of this proposed scheme would extend the public supply to Clontuskert and provide the reservoirs and distribution mains to cater for the needs of the group scheme. The preliminary report for this proposed <Col N="2334" /> scheme is currently under examination in my Department and the cost of Phase I is estimated at around £1.8 million.</P>
    <P>Last month, Galway County Council submitted a revised proposal to construct approximately 4,000 metres of 300 mm water-main, which would extend to Ballinasloe public supply as far as Stapleton's Cross.  This latest proposal would provide a take off point for the group and could supply up to 115 households.</P>
    <P>I am sure both Deputies will appreciate that until such time as this new proposal has been examined and costed by my Department, I am not in a position to indicate what the overall cost of the group scheme is likely to be or when it might be possible to consider the scheme for grant approval.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I wish to express my thanks for the opportunity to raise this matter this evening.  The River Barrow, like all rivers, is a marvellous asset for any town, but unfortunately this asset can become a liability when it overflows its banks.  Carlow town is very proud of the River Barrow, but unfortunately the town has been hit twice in three years by flooding.  It is time something was done about this matter so that there will not be a third occurrence of flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the houses that were flooded were built in the 1840s.  From what I have been told, in 50 years there were only three floods, with a major flood in 1847. However, we can neither live in the past nor talk about the present.  Nor is it sufficient to say that nature takes over when the rains come or ask what can we do when the floods arrive.  I suggest that two things should be done.  First, the river should be dredged and any obstacles that hold back the flood removed.  I hope the Minister will be prepared to carry out a study on the difficulty involved in drainage of the River Barrow.  The second consideration should be the building of a wall to keep the floods in, which is possible. If that is agreed, work may need to <Col N="2335" /> be carried out downriver, because obviously we cannot prevent a flood in one part of the town while causing a flood in another part.  Such a study must be carried out with speed to prevent further flooding.</P>
    <P>The families and businesses whose premises were recently flooded experienced great difficulties and I ask the Minister what compensation will be given to these people.  The cost of drying out a house is very high and in some cases, due to the location of the house, there is no insurance cover.  Businesses experienced even greater loss because as goods were damaged business had to cease.  It is bad enough to experience flooding and all its attendant problems, but the financial expenditure involved in replacing fittings and equipment is an extra burden.  I hope the Minister will have positive news on the drainage of the Barrow and on compensation for those affected by the flooding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I think Deputy Browne for raising this matter. As the Minister for the Environment stated to the Dáil last week, the exceptional flooding which began on Friday, 11 June has had heavy and disruptive consequences for both urban and rural communities.  Our sympathy goes to all who have suffered hardship and inconvenience, but in particular to the families bereaved by the tragic losses of life which occurred.  I understand that flooding occurred in a number of areas of Carlow town during the period 13 June to 18 June.  It appears that this was mainly due to the River Barrow overflowing its banks following the exceptionally heavy rainfall which occurred earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The responsibilities of the Minister for the Environment relate to the financing of projects designed to provide adequate drainage of urban catchments within the framework of the water and sanitary services programme.  The causes of the recent unfortunate flooding in Carlow go beyond the question of urban drainage. The development of specific proposals <Col N="2336" /> in respect of water and sanitary services schemes is a matter for individual local authorities.  Deputy Browne will be aware that severe flooding also occurred at Kennedy Street and other parts of Carlow town in early 1990.  To assist in relieving the problems arising from flooding, my Department provided some £50,000 for drainage improvement in the areas concerned.  No further proposals are with my Department at present for any additional drainage works at Carlow town.  I suggest that the Deputy put forward proposals to Carlow County Council if the problem is as serious as he says it is.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible for the State to undertake liability for the kind of extensive damage to houses and other property occasioned all around the country by the recent flooding.  However, as the Minister indicated in reply to private notice questions on 15 June, assistance may be available from health boards to elderly persons, under the scheme of special housing aid for the elderly, to remedy damage to their living conditions which they are unable to undertake from their own resources.</P>
    <P>A health board may also, under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, assist a necessitous person where an urgent need arises.  I understand that the boards already have helped by providing temporary accommodation and contributed towards the replacement of household furnishings and appliances damaged by floods and have made cash subventions where warranted.  Individuals affected by the flooding who need assistance should contact their local community welfare officer.  Where necessary, local authorities can also help through the provision of temporary accommodation.</P>
    <P>The EC Commission has notified a provisional allocation of 200,000 ECU &mdash; £160,000 &mdash; to assist victims of the flooding. The use to which these funds might appropriately be put is now under consideration. Perhaps in that regard Carlow County Council and the people involved will apply to the Department of the Environment for funding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I wish to thank you for allowing me to raise this matter.  I thank the Minister for Health for turning up in person to reply to this debate.  In light of the fact that the Minister, who is now leaving the House, has delivered bad news on two occasions I hope this is a case of third time lucky. Knowing the competition that exists in Wexford I am sure the Minister will not pass up the opportunity to deliver some good news.</P>
      <P>Clinical psychologist is a term that almost inspires awe in the outside world. The public at large believe that these people are in the high echelons of earning, but the reality is much different.  I am sure the Minister is aware that the starting salary of clinical psychologists, at less than £15,000, is very poor in light of the work they carry out.</P>
      <P>The clinical psychologists in the health service play an enormously important role.  They deal with patients suffering from emotional and behavioural problems. They deal directly with the victims of child sexual abuse.  They are closely involved in the area of custody and access provisions for parents where marriages have broken down.  They are involved in counselling children suffering from trauma, which often manifests itself in bed wetting and soiling.  They are also involved in psychiatric assessments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, from the job description that these people perform a highly skilled job which, for various reasons including family breakdown and increasing levels of child sexual abuse, is in increasing demand in society.  Unfortunately, the Department of Health and the Minister, as their employer, and all of the health boards throughout the country have failed miserably to recognise the importance of this service and the value <Col N="2338" /> for money which it provides.  They have been in breach of agreed pay provisions for almost seven years.</P>
    <P>The reality now is that clinical psychologists working in the national health service are entitled to a 31 per cent pay increase in order to bring them in line with similarly qualified persons working in the Civil Service, particularly in the Departments of Education and Justice. In this case there is a breach of Government policy, which aspires to comparable salaries in all Departments.  There is discrimination against psychologists working in the health service, the most sensitive area in which that work is carried out.</P>
    <P>The consequences of the failure of the Department of Health to meet its obligations in this area manifest themselves in many ways, all of which affect the quality and quantity of service delivered. For example with current salaries arbitrarily held substantially below their agreed level our health services find it increasingly difficult to recruit, or indeed retain, staff.  This is because of a marked brain-drain to Britain and elsewhere, as well as to other branches of the profession. On 1 June 1993, 40 per cent of psychologist posts in the department of psychology in the Eastern Health Board were vacant.</P>
    <P>The availability of psychological services to those in need is at crisis point.  In many areas there are long waiting times for the public to see a psychologist, sometimes up to 18 months or more.  In other areas, there is no service.</P>
    <P>The psychologists working in our health services are over-stretched, under-resourced and working for less than three quarters of their agreed pay.  They have been deprived of their agreed salary for over seven years.  In recent times this House and the wider community were appalled by the circumstances of the Kilkenny incest case.  We were impressed by the Minister's swift and efficient response to that case, if somewhat disappointed with the financial response. Clinical psychologists deal with cases similar to the Kilkenny case on a daily basis.  They are directly charged with <Col N="2339" /> assessment, counselling and recovery of such victims.  Yet, we fail to pay them the going rate and we pass the buck instead of facing up to our responsibility.</P>
    <P>Five million pounds was available in the immediate aftermath of the Kilkenny case and a further £1 million pounds would resolve this issue, restore goodwill and recognise a job well done.  The 200 staff directly involved, have waited long enough and can wait no longer.  I fear further buck passing will inevitably lead to strike action &mdash; which none of us wants &mdash; in this very valuable sector.</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable for the Minister to pass the buck to the Minister for Finance as the Minister for Health is the employer of clinical psychologists.  Neither will it suffice to submit this claim to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> restrictions because it predates it. We want political recognition by the Minister of his responsibility in this area and a commitment to lobby the Minister for Finance to provide immediate resolution of the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Creed for raising this matter and affording me the opportunity to respond to an issue which has arisen recently with a degree of correspondence arriving in my Department.  I agree with the Deputy's assessment of the valuable and important work carried out by clinical psychologists.  It is a job which will become increasingly more important in the resourcing of the Child Care Act.  I am glad to be the Minister responsible and that my Cabinet colleagues saw fit to provide not only £5 million this year but to provide the resources required over the next three years to implement this legislation which will benefit children particularly.</P>
      <P>On the specific matter raised by the Deputy, there is a very long and complex history of remuneration relativities and relationships between the clinical psychologists employed by the health boards and their fellow psychologists who work in the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Psychologists in the health boards have <Col N="2340" /> officer status under the boards, while psychologists in the Department of Education are permanent civil servants.  The conciliation and arbitration procedures for both groups, while similar in form, are progressed in different conciliation and arbitration fora.</P>
    <P>Under the Civil Service procedures, psychologists, as professional staff in the Department of Education, have established a pay relationship with inspector grades in that Department.</P>
    <P>From time to time, one or other of these various groups bring forward their own claims for improvements in remuneration, on an independent basis, through the appropriate trade union at the relevant forum for conciliation and arbitration.  The last two awards to inspectors in the Department of Education were also applied to psychologists in the Department of Education.  Neither of these awards could be applied to health board psychologists in the absence of any specific claim from them.  Notification of such a claim has been received and that claim is now being processed in accordance with normal procedures under the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for local government and health service employees.</P>
    <P>In view of my role under the scheme and my statutory role in relation to the remuneration of the staff concerned, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the merits of the claim in question pending the outcome of normal industrial relations procedures.</P>
    <P>However, I cannot accept the factually incorrect premises in the Deputy's notice to the effect that this situation arose from any failure on behalf of successive Ministers for Health and-or health board managements. The onus of responsibility for seeking and progressing claims for special increases in remuneration traditionally lies with the particular claimants and their recognised trade union representatives. In the absence of any earlier claim from the clinical psychologists for ongoing maintenance of parity with their colleagues in the Department of Education, it would not have been possible for health services managements to <Col N="2341" /> increase the salaries of the clinical psychologists on any automatic basis.</P>
    <P>I would add that health board clinical psychologists received a special award under arbitration in June 1988 arising from a claim made in respect of an earlier special award given to the Department of Education psychologists.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the claim is progressing. I understand that the trade union involved is very active in ensuring that it is dealt with expeditiously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter and the Minister for coming in to reply.  This is the fourth Minister for Health who will hear this story from me in relation to the question of recommencing the nurse training in psychiatric hospitals in the Western Health Board.  Nurse training in psychiatric hospitals in the Western Helth Baord was a permanent feature up to 1987 but because of the cutbacks this was stopped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I particularly refer to St. Brigid's Hospital which has accommodation and a tutor for nurse training.  Since 1987 St. Brigid's Hospital, Ballinasloe, has had no students.  Three psychiatric hospitals are involved, Castlebar, Castlerea and Ballinasloe. Ballinasloe hospital usually had 20 students per year.  In 1987 there were only 15 students in the nurse training school.  Two years ago An Bord Altranais approved the recommencement of student training and a regional committee was set up in 1988 which formulated a policy for regional training. I understand it was envisaged that the theoretical work would be done in St. Brigid's Hospital, Ballinasloe, and that the practical training would be done in the other hospitals.  The Department of Health asked the Western Health Board to provide funding for nurse training but it would cost in the region of £30,000. That would go towards improvements to the teaching room, library facilities and accommodation and money for student allowances.  The Western Health Board do not have the money for this and cannot fund student training from their own <Col N="2342" /> resources.  I am asking the Minister for Health here this evening to provide the requisite funding and allow nurse training to recommence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Michael Kitt for affording me the opportunity to respond to the specific question of psychiatric nurse training at St. Brigid's Hospital, Ballinasloe, County Galway.</P>
      <P>My Department approved an intake of 15 psychiatric nurse students for the Western Health Board region in 1992.  All student nurse training intakes for all disciplines are approved on the basis that the costs arising from their recruitment can be met within the total allocation approved for the relevant health board or voluntary hospital.  That is the normal practice not only in the case of the Western Health Board but also in every other health board nationwide.  The same position obtains this year in that it is open to the Western Health Board to recruit an intake of psychiatric students next October. However, the funding for that intake, as in the case of all other health boards and training hospitals, is a matter for the board itself to undertake within the approved allocation of funding for 1993.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the Western Health Board, along with other health agencies, faces difficulties.  In fact I had a deputation from that region today, and another yesterday, on different service initiatives they want to take.  I am aware it is a progressive health board that wants to develop its services.  However, it must face the demand for additional services and resources on the same basis as every other area.  Given the firm restrictions on overall public expenditure within which the Government has to operate, there is no scope &mdash; and I have to be honest about it &mdash; for additional resources being allocated to the funding of existing health services over and above those already provided for in the Health Vote this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact, I should point out also that the Western Health Board did better proportionately than any other health board on the waiting list initiative, in respect of <Col N="2343" /> which in excess of £2 million additional money was provided to them for that purpose.  The onus rests on each health agency to apportion its allocation so as to maximise the service benefits and overall value to the local population from that expenditure.  Frankly any other approach would be unworkable.  In particular, I predict there would be very little support for any suggestion that, as Minister, I or my Department should be obliged to provide additional funding on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis for items which quite clearly can be anticipated when priorities for spending are being determined locally at the beginning of the financial year.  This would not alone be anathema to any sense of prudent financial management but would also question the whole <i>raison d'etre</i> of the health board structure as an instrument of local decision-making, taking account of locally-determined priorities <Col N="2344" /> for the allocation of available resources for their respective areas.</P>
    <P>In summary, the question of funding an intake of psychiatric students in the Western Health Board is, in the first instance, a matter for that board.  While Deputy Kitt mentioned a sum of £30,000, in the context of the total allocation of over £150 million made to that board this year, it is a matter for it to establish its own priorities and to distribute the money accordingly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 86 together.  The properties and buildings owned by the Department and used by the Defence Forces are extensive in scale and for many years, the Department has been pursuing a programme of building, construction and upgrading to provide the Defence Forces with accommodation <Col N="2183" /> suitable to the needs of a modern military organisation.  A board has been established to examine the whole question of married quarters in the Defence Forces, including the condition and grading of such quarters.  It will also examine measures to encourage a higher degree of home ownership by members of the Defence Forces and is also examining how local authorities could meet the housing needs of military personnel in the context of the Plan for Social Housing and the Public Capital Programme.  In this connection, it should be mentioned that married Army personnel have an equal claim on local authority housing with other members of the community.</P>
      <P>A considerable number of quarters have been sold to their occupants in recent years on very favourable terms and consideration is being given to the sale of additional quarters.  It is recognised that the remaining holding of quarters should be maintained to an adequate standard.  It is the responsibility of the Army Corps of Engineers to inspect married quarters and carry out renovation work as may be required within the resources available to them for that purpose. Major renovations have been carried out in recent years to married quarters in the Curragh and Collins Barracks, Cork.</P>
      <P>At present a total of 409 officers and other ranks live in married quarters.  A total of 2,391 officers and other ranks live in single accommodation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The group's findings suggest that there <Col N="2189" /> are serious imbalances in the distribution and deployment of military personnel with the result that a disproportionate number of Army personnel is employed on administration and clerical duties; in the running of stores; on cooking and mess duties; and on maintenance work. The findings are in line with the results of a survey undertaken earlier by the Gleeson Commission to establish the proportion of personnel employed on various military activities.</P>
    <P>A fundamental review of the Defence Forces will be undertaken by the efficiency audit group which will be tasked with recommending such changes as are necessary to prepare the Defence Forces to fulfil the roles assigned to them by Government as effectively and as efficiently as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can advise the Deputy that I fully ventilated our concerns and objectives for priority action to improve maritime safety and prevent marine pollution at the Council of Ministers in Luxembourg on 8 June last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to report that the Council unanimously endorsed a resolution outlining priority measures for a Community action programme which, when implemented should significantly contribute to the prevention of marine pollution around the Community coastlines. I am particularly gratified that measures which I identified as requiring immediate action at the Transport Council last March have been earmarked for priority action.  These include the introduction of ship traffic control systems at Community <Col N="2191" /> and national level, additional port state control measures including strengthened inspections and comprehensive reporting systems to cover vessels transiting along Community coasts.</P>
    <P>Most notably, however, the Community action programme highlights as a priority the urgent identification of environmentally sensitive areas and the adoption of measures for their protection. In this context I have informed EC colleagues that Ireland is pressing ahead with specific proposals to protect our coastline from potentially hazardous marine accidents.  Such avoidance measures are, for me, the immediate national priority.  I will shortly be bringing to the Commission and to the International Maritime Organisation detailed proposals which will require transiting tankers and other ships carrying dangerous cargoes to avoid vulnerable areas of the Irish coastline at distances ranging from at least 20 miles.  We have developed our proposals within the spirit of existing international guidelines and with full regard for the need to ensure that such measures are introduced and co-ordinated on a Community-wide basis.  I will, therefore, be urging the Commission to advance its work in this area at all possible speed.  In the meantime, I am confident of a favourable and constructive response from the Commission and the IMO to our own proposals to protect the Irish coastline.</P>
    <P>In addition to the preventive measures which I have outlined, I am also keeping under review our state of readiness for effective intervention in the event of a marine casualty.  The Irish Marine Emergency Service has responsibility for the co-ordination, at national level, of the Marine Counter Pollution Response and Safety of Life at Sea.  In addition to its own direct capabilities, IMES can also call upon a wide range of State and private services to supplement its own resources in the event of a marine emergency. The development of resources is as critical as the level of resources available. Exercises to test national response procedures for marine emergencies, <Col N="2192" /> including a communications exercise and a simulated in-port exercise, have been undertaken and further exercises are planned.  IMES has also been closely involved in recent major simulated marine pollution exercises undertaken by oil companies in Dublin Bay and off Tusker, and which involved all relevant agencies and authorities.  In addition, there are marine pollution response procedures in place at EC level under which the Community Task Force may be called on to assist with expertise and equipment in combating pollution threats in Irish waters.</P>
    <P>The Irish Marine Emergency Service as constituted provides a significant response capability in the event of a marine emergency both with regard to saving life and protecting the environment. That capability is, as I have said, under constant review.  I would stress again, however, the importance which I attach to preventive measures and early warning systems to ensure that the risks of a major marine casualty around our coasts are minimised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 47 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is uniquely situated to exploit the rich fishing waters of the North East <Col N="2193" /> Atlantic, where we have valuable quotas of both pelagic and demersal species. Fleet policy has, accordingly, developed along a two-pronged model.  One of these has encouraged the emergence of a powerful and efficient pelagic sector with an emphasis on ensuring bulk supplies of quality herring and mackeral to processors based primarily in the North West.  The other targets demersal stocks, particularly along the west coast where Ireland has traditionally underutilised its quota allocations.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the special whitefish scheme, introduced in 1992, skippers were encouraged to bring in specialised deepwater vessels which would target stocks of high-value whitefish.  Seventeen of these vessels have now entered the fleet with a further three expected before the end of 1993.</P>
    <P>I would also remind the Deputy that the campaign to modernise the Irish fleet received a major boost in April, when the Commission published its decisions on grant aid for the fleet.  Community funding of £1.3 million was secured for 23 modernisation projects, underpinning a total investment of around £4 million, making this the most successful Irish grant aid tranche for a number of years. The next round will be made in October next and I will be pushing strongly at that point for further funding for modernisations.</P>
    <P>Utilisation of pelagic quotas has remained steady at, or close to, 100 per cent over the last five years and with the new whitefish capacity coming onstream, utilisation of west coast demersal quotas is expected to increase significantly.</P>
    <P>I would, however, sound a somewhat cautionary note in reminding the Deputy that Irish fleet development is circumscribed by the MultiAnnual Guidance Programme for the fleet, for the period 1993-96.  Although Ireland recorded a considerable success in the negotiations on this programme at Community level and although the programme does provide for some expansion in the Irish fleet over the next few years, nonetheless, the fleet targets set in the programme must be met, with obvious <Col N="2194" /> implications for fleet development in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Turning now to markets, Ireland is a net exporter of fisheries products and exports are growing strongly year to year: over the five year period from 1987 to 1991, the value of these exports has grown from £124 million to £175 million. However, there is always room for improvement and we are continuing the search for new markets abroad, particularly for pelagic species.</P>
    <P>Many of the new markets identified are for processed fish products.  In this context I am happy to inform the Deputy that Ireland currently has in place a very successful programme for the development of fish processing, with aid from the European Community.  Over the past three years, over £25 million has been invested in projects in the processing sector with aid of over £11 million from the Community.  Almost 60 projects have been assisted and this will result in the creation of in excess of 500 new jobs and will serve to protect the long term viability of another 750 full and part-time jobs in the sector.</P>

      <P>As indicated in reply to previous questions on this topic on 24 February 1993, a comprehensive programme of measures to implement the recommendations in the Ballycotton report has been adopted. These include such operational matters as the operation of RIBS only in pairs when at sea, the adoption of detailed operational criteria for the operation of RIBS, the wearing by staff of the recommended types of survival suits and automatically inflating lifejackets while on sea-going duties, the marking of all boats and equipment, the training of all sea staff in sea survival, first aid and radio communications and the adoption of a training syllabus for sea going crews.</P>
      <P>Additional funding of £580,000 has been made available to the fisheries boards since 1990 to enable them to purchase personal and communications equipment and extra RIBS and cover the cost of training in order to carry out this programme.</P>
      <P>Since I came into office I have been making strenuous efforts to secure extra staff for the fisheries boards in key areas as recommended by the report, in particular the appointment of deputy managers. The Department is also pursuing the question of finance for mother ships for salmon protection work in the context of our application for funds from the EC surveillance programme.</P>
      <P>The question of changing the law to extend to fishery officers the same protection as applies to members of the Garda Síochána is still being pursued and will be dealt with as soon as a suitable opportunity presents itself of introducing the necessary amending legislation.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the special whitefish licence scheme was established in order to increase the exploitation of uncaught whitefish and prawn quotas off the south and west coasts which were estimated to be worth up to £10 million annually.  The 17 vessels introduced under the scheme to date are of the size and construction required to fish in deeper offshore waters and maximise the potential of these hitherto underutilised resources.</P>
      <P>I am aware of recent reports that some owners have replaced local fishermen with non-Irish crew members.  As the Deputy's question rightly implies the scheme was introduced to increase employment in coastal areas and benefit local communities.</P>
      <P>The terms of the licences require a demonstrable economic link between the vessels and the local communities from which they operate and this will be a key consideration when the licences come up for renewal.  I am determined to ensure that this requirement will be met and that the scheme is not undermined by the introduction of a flag ship operation.</P>
      <P>In order to deal with any possible shortages of local crews with the required skills, I have instructed BIM to draw up, as a matter of urgency, a training scheme specifically designed to improve the efficiency of fishing operations and the level of crew skills.</P>

      <P>For 1991, average fish consumption in Ireland <Col N="2197" /> was approximately 8 kg per person.  For the same period consumption in Spain was 39 kg per person.  Although no average figure is available for the EC, consumption is estimated to be of the order of 15-20 kg per person.</P>
      <P>Programmes to increase fish consumption are implemented by Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  The aim of policy is to promote the demand for quality seafood, through improving quality, standards, presentation and product range, and thereby to increase <i>per capita</i> fish consumption by about 0.2 kg per annum.</P>
      <P>BIM's Home Market Development programme consists of a number of measures, including: a programme of seminars and information briefings with the catering and retail sector, a general programme of advertising, including a weekly radio slot, and specific seasonal programmes, including participation in special events such as Healthy Eating Week, a promotions programme which increases consumer awareness of fish and includes cookery competitions, inshore promotions, testings, etc. and a public relations programme which promotes the use of fish in the home through the use of recipe and promotional material including an annual fish cookery calendar.</P>
      <P>The promotion of fish on the home market is, of course, increasingly market driven.  In this regard I am glad to note the increased promotion of fish in many outlets and the advent of major private national advertising campaigns, all of which are increasing the consumers awareness of the attractiveness of fish and fish products.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 16 items on the agenda for today's meeting of the Fisheries Council.  Several of these items are of major importance for Ireland, in particular: the Commission's <Col N="2198" /> proposal for a Community control regime; the review of the fisheries provisions of the Iberian Act of Accession; the Commission proposal for a new mandate to enter into negotiations for a fisheries agreement with the Russian Federation; and the Commission's report to the Council on the Irish paper which was submitted in the course of the review of the Commons Fisheries Policy in 1992.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Commission's proposal for a Community control regime, the Minister, who is attending today's meeting, intends to pursue strongly the Irish case for an increased Community contribution to the costs of surveillance and enforcement of the Common Fisheries Policy.</P>
      <P>The main Irish concern in the review of the fisheries provisions of the Iberian Act of Accession is to ensure that any changes to the present system will not give rise to increased fishing effort in areas of particular importance for Irish fishermen, including the Irish Box.  It is also the Minister's intention to resist strongly any changes to the present regime which could generate further difficulties from an enforcement perspective.</P>
      <P>The Commission's proposal for a new mandate to enter into negotiations with the Russian Federation on a fisheries agreement raises a number of very serious issues for Ireland, in particular in regard to access to waters, stock allocation and market access.  Under the proposed mandate, for example, Russian vessels could gain access to, and thus increase fishing effort on, the pelagic stocks of the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone of the North East Atlantic.  The Minister is determined to ensure that Ireland's interests are protected in any negotiations which may be initiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission is due to present its report on the Irish paper which was submitted to the Council during the review of the Common Fisheries Policy in 1992. The main issue outstanding, in addition to the operational costs of surveillance which I mentioned earlier, is the Irish case for an increased share of fish quota <Col N="2199" /> allocations.  The Deputy may rest assured that this case will continue to be pursued as a matter of the highest priority.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to underline the vital importance attached to finding satisfactory solutions to these particular issues.  With this objective in view, the Minister has, in advance of today's Council, taken every opportunity of pressing Ireland's concerns in these matters and in recent weeks has travelled to Brussels and to Denmark for discussions with the Fisheries Commissioner &mdash; Commissioner Paleokrassas &mdash; and the Danish President of the Council &mdash; Minister Westth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication of the Green 2000 Advisory Group report and am pleased that the authors recognise the significant growth and development of the acquaculture sector and its contribution to job creation and economic activity.  It is noteworthy that a relatively new industry like aquaculture features so prominently in the report in comparison to other established sectors.  This prominence reflects the high level of environmental scrutiny to which the fish farming industry has been subjected in recent years.  A detailed examination of the analysis, conclusions and recommendations of the report is currently under way in the Department.  The report is a most useful background against which existing development and regulatory policies can be scrutinised.  I will advise <Col N="2200" /> the House of the outcome of this assessment process as soon as it is completed and of my considered response to the 14 substantive recommendations contained in the report.  I have taken particular note of the report's recommendation that a national policy for aquaculture development be drawn up in consultation and agreement with all relevant sectors.  I would like in that context to reiterate the Government's policy objective in relation to aquaculture which is to ensure that development takes place in an ordered and well regulated manner, with full regard for other interests and in harmony with the environment, while maximising the industry's contribution to the economy. I fully agree that the strategies and measures to achieve that objective must be based on consultation and consensus and it is with this in mind that, in the first instance, a review of the present legislative framework is underway in full consultation with all relevant interests.</P>
      <P>The recommendations of the report provide a very helpful perspective on possible new arrangements to underpin the sustainable development of the industry. I welcome the opportunity for critical and constructive debate of these issues at national and, indeed, local level which the report's thoughtful exposition affords us.</P>

      <P>The total investment approved under the relevant EC regulations for the fish processing and marketing sector in the period 1989-93 will come to some £45 million.  The EC aid associated with this investment comes to £20 million.  Of the total investment of £45 million, about £20 million was approved under the EC Regulation No. 355/77 and related to the years 1989 and <Col N="2201" /> 1990.  Employment in the sector during this period is estimated to have increased by 360.</P>
      <P>The balance of the investment, £25.19 million, is being supported under a new EC Regulation No. 4042/89, which has replaced Regulation No. 355/77.  It is estimated that this investment of £25.19 million will yield more than 500 new jobs and will serve to protect the long term viability of 750 existing jobs in the fish processing industry.</P>
      <P>A major achievement of the present programme is the provision of support for Irish companies to enable them to meet the standards of health and hygiene required under new community directives. With this in mind and to help those involved to avail of EC funding a special grant aid scheme was instituted last year by the Department of the Marine.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that the fish processing investment programme will continue over the medium term.  Plans for a £40 million investment programme and the creation of 800 jobs have been drawn up in the context of the preparation of the National Development Plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>We are only six months into the Programme for a Partnership Government, so it is a little difficult to assess the extent to which we have begun to move towards our targets. However, there are clear indicators that, even in this short period, we have indeed started to move in this direction.</P>
      <P>First, the campaign to modernise the Irish fleet received a major boost in April, when the Commission published its decisions on grant-aid for the fleet. Community funding of £1.3 million was secured for 23 modernisation projects, underpinning a total investment of around £4 million making this the most successful Irish grant-aid tranche for a number of years.  The next round of grants will be made in October next and I will be pushing strongly at that point for further funding for modernisations.</P>
      <P>I would also point out at this point that the mechanism whereby Community funding will be provided for the development of the fleet is currently being modified with the incorporation of funding for fisheries development into the general Structural Funds framework.  This will mean greater efficiency in fisheries funding and will enable national authorities better to plan for periods of several years and to tailor individual schemes to real needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, as regards the expansion of the fleet, I am happy to inform the Deputy that here also we are moving towards our targets, particularly in the offshore whitefish sector.  The special whitefish licensing scheme, introduced at end-1991, has led to the introduction of 17 specialised all-weather whitefish vessels with an additional three vessels <Col N="2204" /> expected to enter the fleet before the end of 1993.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that in the context of the National Development Plan, a specific comprehensive programme for the fleet will be put in place for the period 1994 to 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my answer to his question of 24 February 1993 when I confirmed that powerful trawlers are not permitted to fish in the areas referred to by the Deputy.  To be specific, the use of trawl nets by vessels exceeding 10 GRT is prohibited by a by-law in that part of Waterford Harbour lying north of a line drawn from Gaultier Cottage, in Waterford to Broomhill Point in Wexford. Gaultier Cottage is an old landmark not used in modern maps but the effect of the by-law is to prohibit vessels of the horsepower mentioned by the Deputy from trawling in the inner reaches of the harbour.  I can see no reason to change the parameters used from tonnage to horsepower.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further consideration is the development of mussel fisheries within the sheltered areas of Waterford Harbour.  The commercial expansion of this fishery may require the presence of vessels larger than those envisaged by the Deputy.  In addition there are also high hopes for the development of a cockle fishery within that area.  In the main larger fishing vessels concentrate on grounds further out to sea with the possible exception of some herring fishing which takes place from time to time off the western tip of Hook Head.  You will appreciate, therefore, that it would not be practical to entirely <Col N="2205" /> prohibit larger vessels from fishing the outer reaches of Waterford Harbour.</P>
    <P>I would also refer the Deputy to EC Regulations forbidding large beam trawlers over 221KW engine power or 24 metres in length from fishing within 12 miles of the territorial baselines of the Irish coast, thus affording a certain measure of protection to smaller vessels.</P>
    <P>In addition under the terms of sea fishing boat licences issued by my Department, all vessels over 120' are precluded from fishing within a 12 miles limit from territorial baselines and all those over 90' from fishing inside the three mile limit.</P>

      <P>Prior to 1 January 1989 the Department of the Marine, which was established in 1987, did not itself undertake harbour works. These were carried out, on behalf of the Department, by the Office of Public Works.  Since 1989, the Department of the Marine has carried out harbour works directly either by contract or by direct labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where contracts are involved, the Department operates a competitive tendering <Col N="2206" /> system and awards contracts to the lowest suitable tenderer or most economically advantageous tender for any particular project.  Companies from all EC member states are eligible to tender for Department of the Marine projects.  This is in line with EC Public Procurement Directives, in particular the &ldquo;Works Directive &mdash; 89/440/EEC&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Such contracts have been awarded to non-Irish companies on two occasions. Both contracts were awarded after open tendering procedures.  In all other instances Irish companies were awarded contracts.</P>
    <P>In regard to the operation of select lists, I can confirm that an open tendering procedure has always been implemented for harbour works contracts.  It is not the policy of the Department to use negotiated or restricted procedures for harbour works unless such procedures can be shown to be in the interests of best value for State investment.</P>

      <Quest>the progress, if any, which has been made with regard to the implementation of the proposals announced by his predecessor in August 1992 which he stated could lead to the creation of an additional 3,000 jobs in the marine area; when it is expected that these jobs will come on stream; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Good progress has been made in connection with the marine jobs plans.  First, detailed implementation proposals have been drawn up and published by BIM and the Central Fisheries Board, in conjunction with my Department, to cover the aquaculture and inland fisheries sectors respectively.  Jobs in the sea fisheries sector will be covered by a joint development strategy to be agreed in the context of the new national plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programmes aquaculture and inland fisheries cover the period 1993 to 1997 and will dovetail with the National Development Plan proposals.  The development programme for aquaculture involves the investment in aquaculture projects of £46 million which has the potential to create over 1,000 extra jobs directly in aquaculture.  The programme <Col N="2211" /> targets the shellfish sector in particular, this is an area where this country is uniquely positioned by virtue of its national environment to tap into buoyant markets abroad.</P>
    <P>The inland fisheries sector is already an important contributor to tourism earnings. There is a growing demand worldwide for good quality angling and our fisheries have good potential for the further development of tourist angling.  The development programme envisages an investment of £17 million involving stock enhancement, access to fisheries and offer improvements in the product.  It is designed to generate a substantial number of new jobs in the medium term, both directly and indirectly.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that some 3,400 people are currently employed in the fish processing sector which has a production value of £200 million.  Most of the fish processing currently taking place is to a low level with less than 20 per cent of the fish being processed to a secondary level. An investment programme to increase added value production, develop the scale and specialisation to allow the industry to compete effectively and grow, develop the processing and marketing for non quota species and develop shellfish processing has been prepared and is designed to generate a subsantial number of new jobs in the coming years.</P>
    <P>The investment and job creation programmes outlined above have already commenced.  This year a number of projects in each area are being brought on stream.  Many of these projects have been approved for grant aid within the current EC Structural Funds framework.</P>
    <P>Most of the projects for development will come on stream over the next few years.  We are in discussion with our colleagues in the Government regarding the allocation of funding for this sector under the new national plan.  I consider that the job creation potential in this sector is substantial and to realise this I will be seeking a level of EC funding consistent with the development potential of the sector as outlined above over the coming years.</P>

      <P>There are ongoing high level consultations with the UK authorities and the European Commission on investment plans for the transport sector generally including ports and harbours.  The aim of these consultations is to ensure a consistent approach to the development of transport networks and, in particular, from the Irish perspective to ensure that links with such networks in the UK are adequately developed.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the European Community's fish withdrawals scheme is to support the market for fish when demand is low.  Each year the Commission, in consultation with the member states, fixes withdrawal prices for the species covered by the scheme.  Once the market price for a species falls to the level of the withdrawal price fish is withdrawn and compensation is paid to fishermen.  A feature of the withdrawals scheme is the requirement that withdrawn fish must be disposed of in such a way that it does not interfere with the normal marketing of the species <Col N="2213" /> in question.  Consequently, withdrawn fish is either used as fishmeal or animal feed or is dumped.</P>
      <P>It is calculated that 901 tonnes of fish valued at approximately £320,800 were withdrawn from the market and disposed of by means of dumping in 1991.  The corresponding figures for 1992 are 1,138 tonnes of fish valued at £405,200.</P>
      <P>Withdrawn fish can only be disposed of by means of dumping at sea under the direction of the Department's sea fishery officers.  The fish is sprayed with dye to prevent it being used for human consumption.</P>
      <P>The Fishermen's Producer organisations have been urged by the Department to avoid the dumping of fish where possible and to dispose of surplus fish through fishmeal or animal feed processing outlets.  I should point out that the vast majority of the fish withdrawn &mdash; well over 90 per cent &mdash; is used for processing into fishmeal or animal feed.</P>
      <P>It is encouraging to note that the percentage of withdrawn fish disposed of by means of dumping has decreased in each of the last four years, including a fall from 9 per cent in 1991 to 6.2 per cent in 1992.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose <Col N="2214" /> to take Oral Questions Nos. 59 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>The first point I wish to make is that it is my policy to encourage the staff of the Department of the Marine to partake in conferences and to debate in an open way at a technical level all relevant issues. This is a two way process which enables the administrators to communicate emerging Departmental thinking and also, and perhaps more importantly, exposes the administrator to the views and perception of industry organisations and individual fishermen.</P>
      <P>Views expressed by officials on such occasions are given in a personal capacity and do not necessarily reflect either the view of the Minister or the Department. Policy decisions are a matter for Ministers.</P>
      <P>As regards the specific questions raised by the Deputies, I can certainly assure Deputy Keogh that the analysis given of the European Community catching sector and its supporting infrastructure is not applicable to Ireland, where it remains a firm aim of policy to develop these sectors further.  Indeed this was highlighted in the paper.  The following extract demonstrates the point:</P>
      <P>A significant weight is attached to supporting the development of coastal areas and communities.  Given the key role of fishing in many of these areas, and the lack of other economic opportunities, it follows that policies, especially in relation to the provision of infrastructure, are geared, in so far as resources allow, to giving this continued support.  When taken together with other economic and social requirements and the priority attached to sustaining coastal communities, there is a clear rationale for positive policies to support the fishing sector in local areas. </P>
      <P>As regards Deputy Cox's question, the key point I would draw from the paper concerned is that while pure economic criteria, such as maximum economic efficiency, cannot be ignored in policy making, regional and social goals are also of critical importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2215" /> I believe that the fishing sector offers considerable potential for further growth and to play a significant role in development and sustaining coastal communities. The draft plans for the fisheries sector which have been drawn up for the utilisation of structural funds are directed at tapping this potential and creating significant additional employment, especially in the aquaculture and fish processing sectors.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware discussions on the financial details of the national plan are ongoing.  In this context, I have presented the case for the allocation of substantial structural funds to the fishing industry: I will continue to pursue this case very strongly.</P>
      <P>I would also like to inform the Deputy that matters are now in train to integrate the fisheries structural measures for the first time into the overall Structural Funds.  This will be a major improvement on the current position where fisheries funding is treated completely separately from other structural funding and, indeed, is split under two distinct measures: Regulation 4028/86 for fleet, aquaculture and port facilities and Regulation 4042/89 for fish processing.  It will mean greater efficiency in fisheries funding and will enable national authorities better to plan for periods of several years and to tailor individual schemes to real needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard the preparation of a sectoral plan covering all aspects of fisheries development &mdash; fleet, aquaculture, port facilities and fish processing &mdash; is well advanced in the Department and will be finalised for submission to the Commission <Col N="2216" /> following agreement of the National Plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the day of the incident in question, I despatched the Department's Deputy Chief Surveyor to Holyhead to make a firsthand assessment of the situation.  His report to me concluded that the incident resulted from the vessel rolling suddenly and then righting itself in rough sea conditions. The fast and heavy motion caused many passengers to lose their balance and some sustained injury through collision with moving or fixed objects.  Freight vehicles were securely lashed and stowed and did not shift appreciably.  Some cars moved on the car-deck resulting in damage of same.  I am satisfied, on foot of his comprehensive report to me, that no further investigation of this incident by the Department is necessary.  The UK Department of Transport have recently completed their own investigation and have undertaken to make a summary account of that investigation available to this Department as soon as possible.  The <i>Hibernia</i> is a UK registered vessel.  Stena Sealink Line, who operate the Hibernia, carried out their own internal inquiry into the incident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be keeping the safety of sea passenger transport under close review.  We have in this country, uniquely may I say, a special mechanism for the regular review of ferry safety.  This is the National Ferry Safety Committee which meets regularly to review safety procedures and standards and to make recommendations as necessary.  The Committee is chaired <Col N="2217" /> by the Department's chief surveyor and includes senior technical representatives from all the ferry companies operating into Irish ports.  The committee has made an assessment of the accident, and did not on the basis of that review recommend any new measures.  They did however review the guidelines on carriage and securement of vehicles on ferries.</P>
    <P>As part of the ongoing review of ferry safety, the Department has recently reiterated guidelines on the carriage and securement of vehicles and cargo units by way of a marine notice for shipowners, shippers and ship personnel.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress that notwithstanding recent incidents the safety record of such vessels operating into Irish ports has been a good one over the years. I am very conscious, however, of public concern in the matter and I am currently considering the possibility of commissioning an independent, comprehensive review which would look at all aspects of ferry safety.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The call referred to by the Deputy was made at the Irish Planning Institute's recent National Planning Conference.</P>
      <P>I also addressed this conference and in the course of my address I made a number of references to emerging policy thinking in relation to management of the coastline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said that coastal erosion is a serious and growing problem and that the Department of the Marine is currently reviewing its approaches to this problem. In this regard, I said, the way to proceed <Col N="2218" /> in the future is to look beyond individual projects and embrace the concepts of coastal zone management which gives a comprehensive overview.  I went on to identify close co-operation between the Department of the Marine and maritime local authorities, who have primary responsibility for coastal protection, as being essential in the planning of all coastal protection works.  Indeed, this close co-operation is important to the planning and management of all aspects of the coastal zone.</P>
    <P>In this connection, close co-operation takes place with maritime local authorities in relation to the planning system for the State foreshore.  Present practice involves extensive consultation with the planning authorities who have an interest in any foreshore development which will impact on their services and infrastructure and on the quality of that part of our environment heritage under their control.</P>
    <P>I also informed the conference that the Department of the Marine, in formulating a comprehensive national coast protection programme, wrote to all maritime local authorities, asking them to submit a list of their priorities for coast protection projects.  Drawing on the submissions received and the Institute of Engineers and the City and County Engineers Association's report &ldquo;Coastal Management &mdash; A Case for Action&rdquo;, proposals for a comprehensive programme, to be implemented over the next six years, have been drawn up.  These proposals are being put forward with a view to securing funding in the next round of Structural Funds allocations.  These allocations have yet to be finalised but hopefully the Government will accord a high priority to the Programme.</P>

      <P>As I advised the house on 23 February, Cork Dockyard was purchased by Damen Shipyards in 1990.  The yard has carried out dry-docking, refit and repair work on a number of Irish vessels during this period.</P>
      <P>Progress in expanding the Dockyard's operations and employment content has been greatly inhibited, however, by the general downturn in world economic performance and the related slump in demand for shipbuilding and ship repair.</P>
      <P>Damen Shipyards are, nevertheless, confident that when an upturn in demand for repair and construction occurs, Cork Dockyard will be well placed to expand its operations and employment content. In the meantime, the company, in consultation with the IDA, is examining various other engineering sectors in which the yard could compete.</P>

      <P>As part of arrangements made in 1986 for implementing EC Directive 79/7 on equal treatment between men and women in matters of social security, the then Government put in place a number of temporary alleviating payments. The purpose of these payments was to reduce the impact of losses arising where a spouse no longer qualified as an adult dependant.  These alleviating payments were made from November 1986, initially for a period of one year.</P>
      <P>During 1987, the then Government decided to continue the alleviating payments beyond the 12 month period set by the previous Government but to phase out the payments over a period of time. Phasing out began in 1988 with the payments being gradually reduced each year.</P>
      <P>However, arising from subsequent decisions of the European Court of Justice, it emerged that the alleviating payments, which offset the effects of the equal treatment legislation, were themselves in conflict with the principle of equal treatment and could not be continued.</P>
      <P>The temporary alleviating payments and special equal treatment payments in respect of mortgage payments were discontinued with effect from 30 July 1992, coinciding with the date of implementation of the budgetary increases in social welfare payments generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned ceased at that time to receive these alleviating payments <Col N="2224" /> in addition to his retirement pension. I regret that it is not possible to restore these extra payments to him.</P>
    <P>My Department has made arrangements over the past year to pay back money to women who were adversely affected by scheme differentials prior to the introduction of equal treatment. Under these arrangements, the wife of the person concerned was paid her full arrears entitlements of £148 in October 1992.  This sum represented the additional amount of disability benefit due to her for the period from December 1984 to August 1985.</P>

      <P>The Carer's Allowance, which I introduced in November 1990, provides a direct payment to carers on a means tested basis.  The scheme was originally directed at people on low incomes who were providing full-time care and attention to elderly or incapacitated social welfare pensioners.</P>
      <P>In July 1991, the allowance was extended to people providing care for recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance from the health boards or recipients of an equivalent social security payment from another EC country or a country which has a bilateral social security agreement with Ireland.</P>
      <P>Any further extension of the scheme to include categories such as recipients of occupational pensions, who do not qualify for a social welfare payment would have significant cost implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>Social Welfare legislation requires that an unemployed person must prove unemployment by signing the live register of the unemployed.  A person who works for any day as an employee and receives a wage for that day would not be able to satisfy the requirement of being unemployed.  This requirement to be unemployed has been a central feature of the unemployment schemes since their inception.  I am satisfied that this is a necessary feature and should continue.</P>
      <P>Since 1992 earnings from insurable employment have been assessed as means for Unemployment Assistance purposes.  However, with a view to encouraging unemployed people to take up part time or casual employment an amount of income is disregarded in assessing means.  The disregard was initially fixed at an amount equal to the daily rate of assistance plus an additional amount of £10.00 per week.</P>
      <P>In the light of representations made to me that that level of disregard did not provide a sufficient incentive for claimants to return to the workforce I announced in the budget earlier this year an increase in the disregard which now stands at the daily rate of assistance plus an additional amount of £15.00 for each day worked.</P>
      <P>This is a substantial improvement.  A single person working three days per week can earn up to £73.60 without any means assessment and a married claimant with three children working three days per week can earn up to £109.50.</P>
      <P>The question of further improvements in the disregard of earnings would be a matter for consideration in the budgetary context.</P>

      <P>There are a number of reasons why I am unable to answer the question directly.  In the first instance, the details supplied by the Deputy are insufficient to enable me to provide a comprehensive reply and, as far as I am aware, the persons concerned have not been in touch with my Department in the matter.  Apart from that, the Deputy is effectively <Col N="2228" /> asking me for an interpretation of the law in this area as it would apply to certain individuals and I would regard that as outside the scope of my official functions. In addition, I could not possibly agree to deal with this type of query by way of reply to a parliamentary question, given the indefinite number of situations of a real and hypothetical nature which could be tabled for my opinion.</P>
      <P>At the same time, I am conscious that the Deputy is endeavouring to be of assistance to a number of persons who, on the information available, are Irish or have strong Irish associations.  I propose, therefore, to write to the Deputy in the matter in the near future.</P>

      <P>There are currently 695 offenders under the age of 21 years in prisons and places of detention operated by my Department.  They constitute 31 per cent of the total prison population and can be assumed, therefore, to cost about IR£26 per annum which is that percentage of the total operating costs.  The figure does not take account of capital costs.</P>
      <P>Juvenile offenders are not detained in Garda stations pending determination of their cases.  Juvenile offenders are detained following arrest for a sufficient period of time to allow for the verification of identities and other matters which are required to be attended to under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, (Treatment of Persons in Custody in Garda Stations) Regulations, 1987 (S.I. 119/87).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Juvenile Office does not <Col N="2229" /> have a specific budgetary provision as it forms part of the Garda Community Relations Section.  However, it is estimated that a total of approximately £2 million will be spent on the Juvenile Liaison Service this year.</P>

      <P>Courtown harbour is owned by Wexford County Council who are responsible for its maintenance and repair.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Marine is formulating a fishery harbour development plan of the period 1994 through 1999. In this regard, the Department sought proposals for development projects in the fisheries interest from the various mari-time local authorities.  Wexford County Council in its submission listed Courtown harbour as its third priority for development, after Kilmore Quay and Duncannon.</P>
      <P>The Council has indicated that the harbour walls require piling and grouting, augmented rock armouring to the south pier and dredging of the harbour entrance.  It is estimated that this work would cost approximately £150,000. Possible inclusion of this project in the development plan will depend in the first instance on the cost/benefits involved and also on the level of funding available for such works under the next round of Structural Funds.  Decisions have yet to be made in this regard.</P>

      <P>The policy of the Department of the Marine is to facilitate the implementation of permanent coast protection schemes, where warranted, to prevent progressive erosion by the sea.  To this end, a national programme of coastal protection works is being formulated and in this regard all maritime local authorities were invited during 1991, to submit a list of priorities for coastal protection projects which they feel would be warranted and feasible and for which they would be prepared to make funds available.  On the basis of the submissions received the Department of the Marine is actively seeking funding for a comprehensive coast protection programme under the next round of Structural Funds allocations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of the Marine has given careful consideration to the report of the National Coastal Erosion Committee and recognises that the entire coastal area represents an asset which must be protected and managed.  As I indicated at the Irish Planning Institute's Annual Conference which was held recently in Cork, the Department of the Marine is reviewing its approach to coastal protection and embracing the concepts of coastal zone management which gives a more comprehensive overview rather than looking solely at individual projects.  This approach will require closer co-operation between the Department <Col N="2233" /> of the Marine and coastal local authorities in regard to the planning and management of all aspects of the coastal zone.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97 and 103 together.</P>
      <P>There is a complex history of relativities between clinical psychologists employed by the health boards and psychologists in the Department of Education. The Conciliation and Arbitration procedures for both groups, while similar, are located in different fora.</P>
      <P>In the Civil Service, psychologists, as professional staff, have established a pay relationship with Inspector grades in the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>These various groups bring forward their own pay claims on an independent basis, through the appropriate trade union at the relevant forum for Conciliation and Arbitration.</P>
      <P>Notification of a claim on behalf of health board psychologists has been received and is being processed in accordance with normal procedures under the Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for employees in local government and health services.</P>
      <P>In view of my role under the scheme and my statutory role in relation to the remuneration of the staff concerned, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the merits or otherwise of the claim in question and, in particular, on the specific issues raised by the Deputies, pending the outcome of normal industrial relations procedures.</P>
      <P>Health board clinical psychologists did receive a special award under Arbitration in June 1988 arising from a claim made in respect of an earlier special award given to the Department of Education psychologists.</P>

      <P>According to a survey in the Dublin area, carried out by the Health Research Board and published in 1992, on persons receiving treatment for drug misuse, opiates were the primary drugs of misuse among 80 per cent of drug misusers. These would be drugs such as heroin, morphine, methadone and pethadine. Cannabis was the primary drug of abuse among 12 per cent of these drug misusers and other drugs such as barbituates, amphetamines, hallucinogens, cocaine and solvents were the primary drugs of abuse among the remaining 8 per cent of misusers.</P>
      <P>There is nothing to suggest that there has been any noticeable change in the pattern of drug abuse since that survey was carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department, in conjunction with other State agencies and voluntary bodies, has in place a wide range of drug treatment and preventative strategies which are the subject of regular review. These are being implemented under the Government Strategy to Prevent Drug Misuse.  Recently, strategies to combat drug abuse have taken on another dimension due to the large number of persons <Col N="2245" /> who have become infected with HIV/AIDS as a result of sharing needles which have been contaminated with the HIV virus.</P>
    <P>A further development has been the production of the report of the expert group on the establishment of a Protocol for the prescribing of methadone. My Department is currently engaged in discussions with the bodies concerned with a view to moving forward with the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report.</P>

      <P>Certified copies of an entry in the Adopted Children Register, which for adopted persons fulfil the same functions as a birth certificate, are available only from the General Register Office at Joyce House, Lombard Street East, Dublin 2.  The issue of such certificates is statutorily a matter for the Register-General who has custody of the Register.</P>
      <P>I am informed by him that applicants for such certificates may apply personally to the General Register Office or send an application through the post.  Personal applicants are dealt with on the spot.</P>
      <P>However, there is normally a backlog of postal applications for certificates of all types.  Due to a significantly increased volume of demand in recent years this backlog has at times been quite lengthy. Currently the backlog extends to approximately 6 weeks postal business. However, within resource limitations all postal applicants will be dealt with as speedily as is possible.</P>

      <P>Details of my Department's scheme of special consideration were set out in my reply to Question No. 109 on 13 May.  In the particular case referred to by the Deputy the position is that an application for special consideration on the grounds of a specific learning difficulty was made to my Department on 18 November 1992 by the candidate's school.  Samples of the candidate's written work and a report from a psychologist attached to the Mater Child and Family Centre accompanied the application.</P>
      <P>The application was referred to my Department's Psychological Service for consideration.  My Department's psychologist considered the psychological report and the samples of the written work and met the candidate in the course of investigating the case.  He noted that she is able to read sample papers and that her scripts are legible.  He concluded that in these circumstances special consideration is not warranted.</P>
      <P>This decision was communicated to the school on 31 May.</P>
