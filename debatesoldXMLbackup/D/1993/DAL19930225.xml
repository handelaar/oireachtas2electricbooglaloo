      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that business might be interrupted at 12 noon today to allow the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to make a statement about the grave situation that appears to be developing in Digital.  The House has expressed its concern in a very united way about this and I know the Government would wish to ensure that the House was informed of developments in the most timely fashion possible.  The proposal for a brief interruption at 12 noon would allow us to be brought up-to-date on a matter of enormous worry to people, not just in Galway but all over Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the continuing industrial dispute concerning the audio typists.  This is causing major problems in the House.  I have looked at the terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in regard to the public sector.  It clearly favours the concept of independent mediation and mediation is suggested in the appendices to the programme.  May I suggest that there be agreement here on the appointment of an independent mediator to examine this dispute?  It is highly inappropriate that the Parliament should not have its proceedings adequately reported, as is provided for in Standing Orders, because of an industrial dispute. The settlement of this dispute is within the powers of those sitting in this Chamber.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Bruton for raising this important matter.  I am extremely disappointed that my own continuous efforts and that of my office to resolve this dispute with the union and the Department of Finance have not, as yet, been successful.  While, as Ceann Comhairle, I cannot divest myself of my statutory responsibility by submitting to binding arbitration, I am, however, prepared as Deputy Bruton suggests, to agree to the use of existing procedures under the conciliation and arbitration scheme which includes provision of the appointment of a mediator, if this can be arranged between the parties concerned, namely, the union and the Department of Finance.  This can be <Col N="1684" /> done if the industrial action ceases, perhaps immediately.  I will be prepared, as requested, to seek arbitration as quickly as possible in order to resolve this protracted dispute.</P>

However, the mediation should begin immediately, notwithstanding any stance the Department of Finance or the union may take. If we are to see a quick resolution of this dispute the mediation should get under way today.</P>

    <Title>Financial Resolutions, 1993. - Financial Resolution No. 10: General (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>THAT it is expedient to amend the law relating to customs and inland revenue (including excise) and to make further provision in connection with finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This House in conducting this debate and assessing this budget should recognise that it is taking place under the shadow of what is, perhaps, the most disastrous piece of industrial news in the history of this State. Some 800 jobs have been lost in Digital in Galway, in a high technology company, a company which was one of the flagships of the modernisation of the Irish economy since the 1960s.  This company was in a sector which was considered to be one where opportunities for expansion were immense and almost unlimited, a sector to which Irish industrial policy makers have devoted perhaps more attention than any other, namely, electronics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the day the Government introduced a tax on jobs in a budget, we hear that another 800 jobs have been lost. Could there by any greater dichotomy between the needs of the economy and the people and the budget introduced by the Government than on the very day we have news of the loss of 800 jobs, this Labour-Fianna Fáil Government introduces a further 1 per cent tax on jobs? There is no greater demonstration of the <Col N="1687" /> gulf between the understanding of politicians in Leinster House in their newly refurbished offices and the needs of the people than the imposition of a tax on jobs on the very day that 800 jobs are lost.</P>
    <P>Those who look for divisions in this Government are missing the point.  The most disturbing feature of this Government is that the two parties actually agree on their approach to dealing with the finances of this country.  Both believe extra taxation is the answer.  Both parties refuse to see that while increasing taxation may be the simplest way to solve immediate, short term problems it is no substitute for a long term realistic strategy. There is no strategy at all.  At every hand's turn the Government addresses symptoms rather than underlying causes.</P>
    <P>Relief for mortgage holders is welcome. The real long term response to the problems of those on mortgages is a strategy to bring down interest rates.  This would have an immediate beneficial effect on employment and would in a more sustained way relieve the mortgage holder.  It must be clear to everyone that the Government has no plan to bring down interest rates even though our economy has been rocked by the currency crisis since early autumn.  The Government operates on a muddle through approach.</P>
    <P>This is supposed to have been the first budget of a new Government.  It sounded like the last budget of a tired and retiring Government.  Usually in its first budget a Government tackles difficult and unpopular issues and sketches out a vision for the future.  Yesterday's budget did the opposite.  It dodged all the difficult tax reform proposals of the Culliton report and postponed all decisions on pay and conditions in the public service.  This budget marked time for another year. There was no sense of urgency about the fact that one-third of our people can find no work and an unemployment rate of 20 per cent is costing the taxpayers billions of pounds ever year.  There was no sense of urgency about the waste of human talent, the hopelessness and the indignity <Col N="1688" /> of the dole queue.  There was no sense of urgency about rates of interest that reward those who leave their money lying risk free in a bank account and penalise those who borrow to produce jobs for someone else.</P>
    <P>This budget rewards those whose mottoes are safety first and hold what you have and forget about the country.  There is no sense in this budget of a Government wanting to mobilise the people to tackle the nation's problems together. There is every sense of a Government who has settled in very quickly indeed, settled to draw their salaries, to employ their relatives, to refurbish new offices and to avert their eyes from the world around them.</P>
    <P>We sit in Kildare Street, Dublin, today, barely a mile from two of the biggest employment exchanges, Werburgh Street and Gardiner Street, where thousands sign on each day&mdash;a mile on the map but a thousand miles in the mind as far as the priorities of this Government are concerned.  People outside Leinster House are angry with TDs, their salaries and allowances and the empty benches in this House not because they begrudge us the money but because they begrudge the fact that while TDs individually may be sympathetic to their problems, TDs as a group, acting through the Government of the day, seem increasingly unable to do anything about the problems about which they talk all the time.  That impression of powerlessness is confirmed by this budget.</P>
    <P>This budget should have put job creation at the top of the national agenda. Instead it increased taxes on work, it introduced a 1 per cent levy which increases poverty traps and increases even further the incentive to take or create a job.  The Labour Party once said that their policy was one of full employment, yet the same Labour Party now sits in Government having refused the portfolio of the Department of Finance and watches unemployment exceed 300,000 for the first time in our history. Having watched this unemployment figure rise, this Government puts an extra arbitrary levy on those who create or take <Col N="1689" /> a job.  Its policy of full employment went out the window as it entered in the door of Government Buildings.  The Labour Party, which once used the Dáil to advocate the creation of large Irish owned food companies big enough to develop our indigenous resources, now prefers to use Dáil privilege to refuse to disclose to a tribunal established by the Dáil sources for grave allegations it has made against the Irish food companies.  The Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Spring&mdash;the present Tánaiste&mdash;in a speech in Cork last year, called for tax free lump sums to promote job-sharing and create 75,000 new jobs.  Now all that is forgotten and the Labour Party prefers to confine its job creation efforts to the families and friends of its Ministers.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a 1 per cent income levy in their first budget says all that needs to be said about the Labour Party's distinctive contribution to the governance of this country.  Crude across the board levies of this kind have all the hallmarks of last minute dodges designed to plug a looming gap in the budgetary arithmetic when only a few days were still to run to budget day.  Ministers had reached a stalemate and could not think of or agree on anything else.</P>
    <P>This is characteristic of the Labour Party in Government.  They postpone difficult decisions for so long around the Cabinet table that eventually the only option left is a last minute across the board levy on all income.  That is what happened in 1983 and now the Labour Party is only one month in office and it is happening again.  This 1 per cent is a betrayal by the Labour Party of those who voted for them.  It is a case of a Labour Party taxing labour, a Labour Party taxing work in a country where 300,000 people have no work and 150,000 people have emigrated because they could not find work, yet the supposed party of work wants to tax work so that we can have even less of it.</P>
    <P>This levy will be placed on all income without allowance for mortgage, and life assurance commitments.  A married person with a dependent spouse will pay the same levy as a person with no family <Col N="1690" /> responsibilities.  That is Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party's concept of tax equity.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's and the Labour Party's definition of the well off comes through very clearly in the arrangements for this 1 per cent levy on work.  With great generosity they have decided that anyone earning less than £173 per week will not have to pay the levy.  Anyone earning more than £173 per week is seen as sufficiently well off to pay the full levy on their entire income, including every penny of the first £173.  Who are these well off people?  Country council workers, Government messengers, clerical assistants, shop assistants, the low paid at work, about whom the Labour Party said so much when they were in Opposition, but are now sufficiently well off to contribute to Labour's 1 per cent levy on work.  We are told this levy is temporary. Yes it is temporary, but it will last as long as the Labour Party is in Government, no longer and no shorter than that.</P>
    <P>This levy results in double taxation. First your income will be levied at 1 per cent, and then the same income, including the 1 per cent you have already paid, will be liable for income tax.  It is double taxation, contrary to all the arguments advanced by Deputy Stagg when he complained that water charges amounted to double taxation.  What is his view on this form of Labour Party double taxation on people's income and work?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The first priority of this budget should have been to reduce the costs of creating a job.  I believe the Government should have cut employers' and employees' PRSI by a total of 7.5 per cent.  To ensure this resulted in extra jobs, not extra overtime and profits, the reduction could have been confined to employees working a 38 hour week or less.  By directly tackling the cost of creating a job would have allowed people to find their own job opportunities without form filling, lobbying FÁS, lobbying <Col N="1691" /> county boards for a grant or to see if they know somebody on the board, or lobbying other bureaucracies.  People could be empowered by a PRSI cut to get on with creating their own jobs without having to ask a favour from anyone.  That would be too simple for the new policy making establishment consisting of the Government and social partners.</P>
      <P>The architects of this disastrous currency policy, on which I will speak later, do not believe that people can be trusted to create jobs for themselves or to run their own enterprises.  Unless an enterprise consists of filling forms, completing feasibility studies, applying for grants or inviting Minister to official openings, it is not worthwhile in the eyes of the new Government and its chosen social partners.</P>
      <P>Labour Party members who are students of European socialist history might recollect what happened to Philip Snowden and Ramsay McDonald.  In order to obtain respectability from the big houses of England, they decided to opt for a hard currency policy.  They eventually split their party and would never have seen office again were they not rescued by the privations of the Second World War.  Those in the Labour Party who are currently enthused by the reception they are receiving from monetarists and economists should reflect on this.</P>
      <P>The fundamental cause of poverty is unemployment.  This Government has done nothing to address the root cause, but deals with the symptoms.  Both Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party see social welfare as a constituency which must be addressed separate from those on PAYE, in agriculture and the self-employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They do not see those on social welfare &mdash;most of whom do not want to be on it &mdash;as wanting to work.  In many cases, it is not worth their while to work, when account is taken of the increase in their rent and travel costs &mdash; all of which are taxed&mdash;and the new levy they will have to pay to fund the Labour Party's inability to agree on other more just areas of social <Col N="1692" /> expenditure or of taxation curtailment. They are not a constituency to be treated with palliatives.  They want to work, but are being prevented from doing so by the policies of this Government.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael starts at the other end of the spectrum.  We see those in receipt of social welfare as individuals, not a collective constituency of 300,000 unemployed. They, above all else, want to get out of the trap they find themselves in. Taxing the employed to fund benefits for the unemployed will create a vicious circle with those at work struggling to support more people out of work.  Those who are unfortunate to be on the margin of society must have an adequate income, but taxing work to pay for this is ultimately self-defeating.  I regard this as an obvious truth.</P>
    <P>The imposition of the 1 per cent levy was an easy option for this Government. I did it so that it could avoid making more fundamental decisions.  This budget proves that, after barely a month in office, this Government is already suffering from terminal fatigue.  The people voted for change last November, but got nothing of the kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to be optimistic or positive in assessing this budget, which is the first from this historic combination of Fianna Fáil and Labour in Government.  My kindest opening comment would be to state that it confirms my worst fears, although I will admit to being surprised at the proposed £150 million privatisation programme, but I will return to that later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish I could welcome this budget, and hail it as a refreshing and radical package of measures that would target the unemployment crisis with its myriad of social and economic downsides dogging Irish society but I cannot.  The reality of the unemployment crisis has been brought home by the tragic announcement that the manufacturing operation of the Digital plant in Galway, one of the <Col N="1693" /> most outstanding plants in the country, is closing leaving only the software operation here.</P>
    <P>The difficulty about the cessation of manufacturing is that all the spin off firms and industries spawned by Digital in Galway over the last 20 years, were almost exclusively established for the purpose of supplying components for the manufacturing operations.  The need for components in software and other services is limited because development in this area consists almost exclusively of brain power.  I deeply regret what has happened there.  I continued to hope, despite ominous rumours circulating in the last number of days, that things might improve, but unfortunately, this did not happen.</P>
    <P>This is possibly the most serious closure in Irish manufacturing history, not just because of its size but because of the effect it will have on so many other firms, which will effect many more than the 800 direct jobs now lost.  That makes the job creation provisions in this budget even more topical and necessary.  Viewed in the context of that news it renders this budget and its provisions very disappointing because they contain nothing to overcome such problems.</P>
    <P>As a result of being in Government up to recently, I appreciate the difficulties confronting any Administration and the conflicting demands it faces at budget time, but I am saddened and depressed by the absence of even a semblance of a strategy for getting the economy working efficiently, and the lack of awareness on the part of the Minister for Finance and this Government of the scale and urgency of the problems facing the country.</P>
    <P>While in Government the Progressive Democrats sought to advance a coherent strategy aimed at getting this economy working efficiently and generating more sustained employment.  The core of that strategy was embodied in a series of measures which we championed, and some of which we saw come to fruition. There were measures, such as the new Companies and Competition Acts to increase the efficiency and accountability of Irish firms on both the domestic and <Col N="1694" /> export markets.  We advanced radical pro-jobs tax reforms on the simple premise that a society with a record surplus of labour should not continue to tax labour as if it were a rare commodity.  The reality of Digital makes what occurred yesterday, particularly the 1 per cent levy on employment, all the more regrettable.</P>
    <P>We advanced significant reform which had realised partial success before our enforced departure from Government. Our period in office was marked by a significant widening of the tax net.  There was a very large increase in the tax take from the corporate sector which has roughly trebled in the past four years. There was the removal of a range of anomalies and disincentives and a reduction in personal taxation to two rates, and their reduction in turn to 27 per cent and 48 per cent.  The aborted revised Programme for Government which we negotiated in October 1991 envisaged these rates falling further to 25 per cent and 44 per cent.  We also wanted to achieve a considerable widening of the standard tax band so that people on average incomes would pay tax only at that rate.  We advocated radical overhaul of the PRSI system, which is simply a direct income tax by another name.</P>
    <P>Complementing this coherent pro-jobs tax reform strategy, I commissioned the Culliton review of industrial policy on the premises that we would never sustain an effective onslaught on the unemployment crisis unless it was grounded on the development of a massively expanded native industrial sector manufacturing goods and producing services of a quality and price that would command buyers on international markets.</P>
    <P>The Culliton prescription was scarcely novel.  Anyone who had seriously analysed the problems underpinning our under-performing economy, and the poor returns on massive State investment over many years, already knew them, but its significance lay not in its assembling of the problems but rather in the clarity and coherence of its prescriptions for resolving them.  Culliton outlined the institutional changes that were urgently needed from top Government level <Col N="1695" /> downwards, as well as the infrastructural handicaps <i>vis-à-vis</i> energy, telecommunications and transport that had to be overcome.  The Culliton report also outlined changes that were essential in the education and training systems, and in the tax system to create an enterprise culture with incentive-based employer and workforce sectors.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to recall Culliton's observations that there was no single area within this overall prescription where Government has the greatest opportunity to act than in the area of tax reform.  In effect, Culliton confirmed and complemented the Progressive Democrats' analysis of the problem and the necessary solution.  In the context of yesterday's budget it would be no harm to remind ourselves of what Culliton said:</P>
    <P>By removing the demoralising effect of the current tax system and removing the waste of non-productive tax avoidance activities, reform will create a far more conducive environment for productive enterprise and for more solidly based investment decisions.  In no other single areas does the Government have at its disposal the tools to make as far-reaching and effective a reform to support an enterprise economy as in taxation.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to look at yesterday's budget in that context.  Has anything been done to remove what Culliton calls &ldquo;the demoralising effect of the current tax system?&rdquo;  I see absolutely nothing.  In fact, I see an addition to the demoralisation with the 1 per cent levy which sets back some of the advances that were otherwise made in terms of tax reform, and increases the degree of penalisation. The Culliton report is much talked about now but it is beginning to fall into the same unhappy, slightly sanctified, category as motherhood, apple pie and the Irish team.  In other words, everyone agrees with him but when it comes to actually doing something, our support is purely verbal and we effectively ignore the recommendation.</P>
    <P>Part of the previous Government, in <Col N="1696" /> which I served, saw the whole of the Culliton report revolving around institutional changes.  In the first speech I made on the publication of the Culliton report, on 10 January 1992, I said that I did not want to see a debate about institutional changes.  I said Culliton was a prescription that had many components which needed to be taken on board as well as the spirit of the report as a whole. One of the most important elements was to face up to the disincentive aspect of our taxation system, not just of any one particular tax but of the amalgam of taxes, as well as facing the fact that we have huge cost impediments, which Culliton identified in telecommunications, transport and energy.  Yesterday's budget increased VAT on telecommunications and energy, which is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>There is a petty effort being made to raise £11 million by doubling the existing 1 per cent levy on non-life insurance which consists of motor employers' liability and public liability.  I do not know the reason for doing that.  The Minister for Finance's justification was that the former levy, which was used to bail out the bankrupt PMPA company, had now come to an end after nine years payment, and that, therefore, it should be replaced. This implied that the former levy to bail out the bankrupt PMPA was beneficial to the economy, and instead of rejoicing that this was at an end, it is replaced by a taxation measure which has the effect of further increasing the cost of essential parts of the economic or commercial process which are already more expensive than in any country.  I know of no other country where motor insurance, employers' liability and public liability are more costly than here.</P>
    <P>Public liability cover for a function organised by a voluntary organisation used to cost £5 some years ago.  It now frequently costs £750 or £1,000 to cover one, simple public function that lasts for a few hours.  Frequently, the £1,000 premium is not taken by the organisers at the gate.  Even if they were able to devote all the proceeds to the insurance cost, it would not cover the cost.  It is in these areas the Government chooses, in <Col N="1697" /> defiance of the Culliton report, to increase the costs of Irish business.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for my disappointment is that it is clear from yesterday's budget that the Culliton report has been, effectively, abandoned by the new Government.  I state this, not merely because of the budget's reversal of the tax reforms strategy championed by my party in Government and endorsed by the Culliton report but for a variety of other reasons.  Some of the key institutional changes urged by the Culliton report have been abandoned, notably, this Government's decision to hive off the marketing activities of An Bord Tráchtála from an integrated single industrial agency, embracing equity research and development, training and marketing for indigenous industry.  The greatest failure of the budget, in regard to the Culliton prescription, is its total failure to address the combined cost handicaps of Irish industry and, in particular, the cost of employing people.  The unemployment crisis combined with the competitiveness problems faced by this country, arising from the currency crisis, made it imperative that this budget should have had as its main focus the reduction of the cost handicaps facing Irish Industry.  It was obvious that the reduction of PRSI burden, while costly, would be the way forward but this budget offered nothing in this regard.  In so far as it addressed the question of the cost of employment, it simply hiked up the cost of employing people through the cynical and administratively easy device of the new 1 per cent income levy.</P>
    <P>The extent to which this levy reverses the progress made in recent years, in reducing the income tax burden and easing the plight of the PAYE sector, is graphically summed up in the Minister for Finance's admission on RTE television last night that this measure was the equivalent of moving the present 48 per cent rate to 52.5 per cent.  Is it any wonder the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach, during the course of the debate on the financial resolutions said that they regretted the tax reform strategy they had pursued in Government with the Progressive <Col N="1698" /> Democrats.  This only demonstrates how blind they are to the appalling impact of a high labour tax regime in this country and to its inevitable blight on job creation.  Faced with that attitude, is it any wonder there are over 300,000 in the dole queues and that the Minister for Finance is budgeting for an average rise of 26,000 in the numbers out of work this year.</P>
    <P>Instead of facing up to the root and branch agenda presented for radical action by the Culliton report, both parties in Government prefer grandiose sounding projects called special job schemes.  This budget proposes something called a £260 million jobs fund while, at the same time it projects only an extra 6,000 jobs or a net 3,000 when the inevitable further loss of jobs in agriculture are taken into account.  The figure of 6,000 extra gross jobs puts a price tag of over £43,000 on each of these jobs.  The more effective, but less glamorous way forward would be to tackle the excessive cost of employing people, highlighted especially by the PRSI system, and to cut the excessive input costs for Irish industries of essential services like energy, transport and telecommunications. Instead, there is a 5 per cent increase in the cost of phones and electricity, areas where we have some of the highest charges in Europe.  How can any Irish industrialist or entrepreneur create jobs faced with the hostile costs environment generated by our own Government?  The cost of an overseas call from this country is, on average, 35 per cent higher than that in competing countries in the European Community. Adding 5 per cent to the overall cost is going to make the differential perhaps 36.5 per cent.  I cannot see any sense in such moves.</P>
    <P>One ray of hope in this budget is the £150 million privatisation programme but we have no details from the Minister on it.  My guess is that it consists simply of selling off the remainder of the State's shareholding in Greencore and Irish Life. While I welcome that, it does not achieve a great deal.  The Government should be examining precisely what other opportunities exist to dispose of assets that are <Col N="1699" /> almost entirely unproductive and where they can be used to reduce the level of national debt.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary employment policies pursued the last number of weeks by the Labour Party in particular, strike me as being far removed from what is required.  It seems extraordinary that so many people would be employed at such high salaries for no reason other than the political benefit of Ministers and Ministers of State and that such people should include senior members of, for example, the Labour Party.  One such person is the national treasurer of the party and others are close personal relatives of the Ministers and Ministers of State involved.  It is not necessary to say much more about this because the people of this country have very strong views about it.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or Cork, or many other places.  This Government was in a unique position.  It is a new Government. It has a majority of 40, or at least 39 since last night.  This majority goes beyond anything that was ever seen in the parliamentary history of this country.  It has, therefore, at the beginning of its period of office a unique window of opportunity to take steps which could not be taken by a Government with a narrow majority or a Government coming towards the end of its term of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were ever to see a different approach to the country's problems, we should have seen it yesterday.  What did we see?  We saw a lame tinkering about with the <i>status quo.</i> We saw the outstandingly coherent call in the Culliton report for fundamental change absolutely <Col N="1700" /> and finally abandoned.  If this Government, at the beginning of its term of office, is not prepared to look forward or to cast aside the policies which have patently not worked and have cost the taxpayers so much, then I begin to wonder what hope there is for the future.</P>
    <P>Where is the element of change in this budget?  Where is the influence of the Labour Party on the budget?  It is remarkable that the party is prepared to accept many of the existing policies that obviously do not work.  Minor adjustments have been made and are pronounced beneficial.  We exist in a situation which does not work.  The Government had an opportunity yesterday to cast it aside and to attack our problems from a different angle but it failed to exploit the opportunity.  The Government is in a stronger position in parliamentary and political terms than many other Government but it has chosen to tinker about with the <i>status quo</i> rather than change it.</P>
    <P>If the Government did not take the opportunity for change this year the possibility of its doing so in the future is virtually nil.  That is the depressing aspect of this budget.  It must also be depressing for the many unemployed and for those who have become unemployed today and who face such an appallingly bleak future.  The manner in which the Government has chosen to approach our difficulties is profoundly disappointing and can only make many people feel there is little hope for the future.</P>
    <P>There is not even the prospect that any new worthwhile thinking will be introduced because the provisions introduced yesterday are patently inadequate.  It is a sobering thought that yesterday's budget is far less radical than the relatively modest ones introduced in each of the previous years.  I expressed regret at the relatively modest budgets of the past three years but at least they had a coherent direction.  There is no coherent direction or underlying philosophy in yesterday's budget.  It frightens me that the glorious opportunity, available to a Government with a majority of 40 and <Col N="1701" /> with a mandate for change, should have been so miserably missed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the dreadful job losses announced in Galway this morning. It is a tragedy for Galway and the country.  Nothing can be said to lessen the impact of this terrible blow.</P>
      <P>According to media speculation, inspired or otherwise, this was going to be the harshest budget in recent times. On budget day, even as the Ceann Comhairle warned the House against divulging the context of the budget before it was formally announced in the Dáil, the early edition of <i>Evening Herald</i> carried a very detailed account of the new income levy.  Perhaps the source of this leak should be investigated by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The objective of the leak seems to have been a calculated tactic to soften the blow of the formal announcement of what, in reality, is a form of taxation, and an inequitable tax at that.  It is not based on ability to pay and will be levied against even those wage earners who are below the average industrial wage, those who can least afford it.  This manipulative use of the media should not be ignored.</P>
      <P>It is difficult not to use strong language when referring to aspects of this budget. At least one aspect brings politics further down the road to disrepute, a road politics has travelled at a fast pace for some time.  I refer to the litany of broken promises contained in the Minister's Budget Statement.  Not only are there numerous broken promises, but the Government reneges on the solemn election commitments given before the last general election.  I consider the practice of making commitments and then, when safely in power, abandoning the commitments as unethical as any other form of corruption in politics.  I believe this is more damaging to political life and to the public perception of politicians and politics than anything the ethics in politics measures recently put before this House hope to address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The broken commitments are: the reversal of the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; social welfare cuts, the promised equity for Aer <Col N="1702" /> Lingus, the promised end to privatisation, the promised full mortgage interest relief for hard pressed homeowners, the promised permanent Christmas bonus, the promised protection of the lower income groups, the promised measures to combat unemployment and the promised moves to implement the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.  What happened to all of these promises?  It is clear from this budget there is no intention of honouring any of them.</P>
    <P>The infamous election slogan &ldquo;health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped&rdquo; was not a once off exercise in hypocrisy.  It has been more than matched by the Labour Party's slogan &ldquo;vote Labour and reverse the welfare cuts&rdquo;.  If there was an award for duplicity, it would have to be awarded to the Minister for Health, the most vociferous opponent of the hospital charges introduced by Fianna Fáil.  The day before the budget he jammed on the brakes and did the biggest U-turn of all by substantially increasing the hospital charges.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are, or I should say were, regarded as the party of the working class, the unemployed and the poor. However, to raise the expectations of the poor and then ignore their plight must be the most unseemly and dishonourable experience of recent political times.  It appears there is no honour left in politics and the poor must pay the price.  It seems the strategy of defeat, dishonour, lies and hypocrisy is now an acceptable way to attain power today.</P>
    <P>The workers in Aer Lingus were told by the Labour Party that the necessary equity would be provided.  However, the Budget Statement belatedly makes the reality clear, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Subject to the constraints on the national finances (of which there was no mention before the general election) which rule out very large injections of equity, the Government will be prepared to support a viable and convincing plan.</P>
    <P>This was Fianna Fáil policy before the general election but it was not the policy <Col N="1703" /> of the Labour Party.  The Programme for a Partnership Government said there would be no large-scale privatisation and indeed there will not be because they have changed the term &ldquo;privatisation&rdquo;. Instead, assets worth £150 million will be disposed of.  &ldquo;Asset sales&rdquo; is the new term.  There appears to be no end to the cynicism.</P>
    <P>The limited assistance given to mortgage holders is welcome.  Full mortgage relief was promised to hard-pressed mortgage holders if the problems with interest rates continued.  This is another empty promise that will, no doubt, shatter the hopes of thousands of families fighting to keep up mortgage repayments. It is like the promise to make the Christmas bonus a permanent payment.</P>
    <P>Some of the lower income groups are to be removed from the tax net.  Once again, there is a catch because it is only a temporary measure.  As soon as they receive the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> increase they will be back in the tax net and as badly off as they were in the first place.</P>
    <P>The income levy is a further tax on the PAYE sector.  It is difficult to believe the Labour Party could get away with this. That is why it had to be called an income levy.  One of the disgraceful aspects of this new tax is that it will be levied on workers whose earnings are below the average industrial wage.  So much for the protection of lower paid workers.  One in three workers in the public sector earns less than the average industrial wage and will be worse off as a result of the measure contained in this budget.  This is, once again, a glaring example of the refusal of successive Governments to move towards a more equitable society by concentrating harsh measures on the higher paid, on those with the ability to pay. Recent tax reductions favour higher income groups.  In this budget the burden falls on all earners, including those least able to afford it and especially workers on low incomes who, on balance, will be worse off as a result of this budget.</P>
    <P>The biggest single issue facing the country has been given the least attention <Col N="1704" /> or, as previous speakers said, did not receive any attention.  This budget offers little hope to the 300,000 unemployed.  It accepts there will be an additional 26,000 on the dole by the end of this year.  Those who voted for change in the general election were voting for jobs.  They were voting for imaginative ways, schemes and projects to create jobs but they received nothing in this budget.  There were more imaginative ideas among unemployed groups on the recent &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; programme than there are in the 39 pages of the budget speech.</P>
    <P>The prediction of more than 400,000 unemployed by the end of the 1990s is almost inevitable.  The real disappointment is that this budget, the first for a Government with major participation by the Labour Party, the party of radical change, is not a radical one.  It could have been presented by a Fianna Fáil Government without Labour involvement.  I would be interested to know how a special delegate conference of the Labour Party would view this budget and its omissions.</P>
    <P>It has become mandatory to pay lip-service to the poor at the beginning and end of Budget Statements and this budget is no exception.  At the beginning it speaks of ensuring that the less well off in our society are protected and at the end it states that the position of the weaker members of our society will be addressed in several respects.  As a Member elected to represent a constituency that has a high proportion of people living in poor circumstances and where unemployment levels can be in excess of 70 per cent to 80 per cent, a constituency shared by the Minister for Finance, I find these references offensive to the poor because in reality their position is not protected. They are worse off as a result of the budgetary measures.</P>
    <P>Much publicity surrounds social welfare increases which are said to be set at the rate of inflation.  However, they will not come into effect until July.  Meanwhile VAT increases, the increases in the price of clothes and food will become effective immediately.  Combined with local authority rent increases and the failure <Col N="1705" /> to reverse social welfare cuts, even the most casual analysis will show that the poor will be worse off, or at best will simply remain in a poverty trap.  These people will remain below the basic recommended minimum income levels set down in 1986 by the Commission on Social Welfare.  The commission regarded people with an income below the level as having an inadequate standard of living.  The failure to provide the increasing number of long term unemployed with an adequate minimum income is condemning them to a life of poverty which Members would not accept for themselves or their families. This budgetary-imposed inequality lies at the root of our increasingly divided society and shows clearly how poverty is perpetuated by political decisions.</P>
    <P>Each year in the weeks preceding budget day, Members of this House receive a number of detailed submissions from the Conference of Major Religious Superiors Justice Commission, the Combat Poverty Agency, groups working with the homeless, principally Focus Point and Simon, and the unemployed, as well as trade unions and various interest groups.  I wish to refer to the submissions from the organisations concerned with social inequality.  I agree with their viewpoint but their voice is not being heard. They argue that the type of society which those in power wish to maintain, whether it is an increasingly divided and unequal society or one where the attainment of social equality is a priority or even an objective, can be judged by the budgetary decisions taken by the Government of the day.  In recent budgets, for example, where tax concessions have been more beneficial to those on high incomes and where increases in social welfare payments have been minimal, it may be said that Governments, at best, are simply not interested in creating a more equal society or, at worst, are deliberately committed to serving the interests of the rich and affluent and, therefore, have a vested interest in social inequality.</P>
    <P>This budget is no different.  Once again, the lower paid and those on social welfare are the hardest hit.  It is a budget <Col N="1706" /> of the <i>status quo,</i> with no element of change.  While it is true that Governments have set up commissions to examine and make recommendations to alleviate inequality, most notably the 1986 Commission on Social Welfare&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No Government so far has been prepared to implement its recommendations or to set a time-scale for their implementation.  Even a Government with strong Labour Party participation, as we have at present, is not prepared to do this.  Instead, all recent Government, including the present Labour-Fianna Fáil coalition, have stated that they support the main recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare and they are working towards their implementation.</P>
      <P>According to the Justice Commission of the Conference of Major Religious Superiors the effect of the absence of any genuine political commitment is to condemn at least one million people to live in poverty or below a &ldquo;minimally adequate standard of living&rdquo;.  They argue that in 1993 the poverty line of minimum income, following from the recommendation of the Commission on Social Welfare, would be £65 for a single person and £104 for a couple.  They pose the question which must be asked here: could anyone in this House live with basic dignity on less than this amount?  I do not believe it is possible to do so.  This budget forces people to live substantially below these levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their budget submission the Justice <Col N="1707" /> Commission of the Conference of Major Religious Superiors urge the Government to ensure that everyone would have a minimum income equivalent to these figures in 1993.  They believe, as I do, that the cost could be met from the resources which already exist.  We must have a Government with the political will to make the necessary choices.  The first choice must be a commitment to eliminate poverty and the Government must have the political will to bring that about. However, the message from successive Governments and high profile economists and commentators who are their fellow-travellers is that social welfare payments represent a spiralling drain on our resources which the State cannot afford and which must be reduced.  This approach culminated in the so-called &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; welfare cuts under the then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy McCreevy.  This approach has not been reversed in this budget and those members of the Labour Party who fought the general election campaign on a platform committed to reversing the cuts and defending the interests of the poor are now open to the charge of hypocrisy and political dishonesty.</P>
    <P>The arguments and statistics presented by the Justice Commission of the Conference of Major Religious Superiors provides us with a different analysis to that of conservative Governments and economists.  They point out that in the six years since the publication of the report of the Commission on Social Welfare, Ireland's GNP increased substantially, but the percentage of GNP spent by Government on social welfare, health, housing and education has declined during those years.  They point out that the percentage of national income spent specifically on social welfare declined from 14.9 per cent to 13.8 per cent, even though the number of people depending on weekly social welfare payments increased by almost 100,000.  This analysis shows that in our divided society the poor are getting poorer and the rich are becoming richer.</P>
    <P>This can be readily verified when we <Col N="1708" /> examine the salary scales and increases enjoyed by the top of the scale salary classes in the public and private sector. The salaries of heads of Departments and large Irish companies rose by 52.3 per cent from an average of £28,960 in 1986 to £44,100 in 1992 while, at the same time, the salaries of Departmental Secretaries in the public sector rose by 66.2 per cent, an increase of £23,623.  The Justice Commission of the Conference of Major Religious Superiors argues that the income of the better off has risen by more than the income of the lower paid employees and social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>When preparing this analysis, the Justice Commission of the Conference of Major Religious Superiors choose 1986 as the base year because this was when the Commission on Social Welfare published its report.  Since then we have heard endless statements from various Governments, economists, public commentators and academics that the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare could not be implemented because they were too costly.  We now realise that if the percentage of GNP allocated to social welfare had been maintained at 1986 levels, the vast majority of the Commission on Social Welfare's recommendations would now have been implemented, even though an additional 94,000 people depend on social welfare today.  Successive Governments have made choices over the past six years.  These choices have benefited some people, principally the better off in Irish society.  However, these choices have also led to the growing exclusion of other people.</P>
    <P>The Justice Commission of the Conference of Major Religious Superiors argues that the agenda of the better off is kept at the forefront of national consciousness by the media which, for the most part, is owned, controlled and operated by members of that class and by high profile economists and public policy commentators who argue their case.  All recent budgetary strategy has favoured the socio-economic position of the more affluent, while aggravating the state of <Col N="1709" /> exclusion of the minority who are on or below the poverty level.</P>
    <P>That minority is growing and the gap between them and the more affluent is widening.  If the centre is to hold, argues the Commission, then a new budgetary strategy is required which would give priority to the elimination of poverty and social division.  This would help develop a society which would be less violent, more humane and a safer one in which to live.</P>
    <P>That is the analysis in the submission by the Justice Commission of the Conference of Major Religious Superiors.  I have quoted from it at length because I do not believe it is even read by those who shape the budgets.  I support the position of the Justice Commission and would go further in saying that if the strategy of yesterday's budget continues, and no real attempt is made to create a more equal society, then we are heading for violent social conflict.</P>

Deputy Gregory tends to be very selective in quoting from their deliberations and conclusions.  He attacks the Government for not doing enough in relation to mortgage relief and then goes on to refer to other aspects of the conclusions of the Conference of Major <Col N="1710" /> Religious Superiors.  But if he looked at some of their conclusions he would realise that they, in fact, have discussed and pointed towards the phasing out of mortgage relief completely, the taxing of child benefit and the phasing out of VHI relief.  If Deputy Gregory is to be consistent he should present the reports in total rather than selecting the pieces that suit his point of view.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also mentioned the Labour Party's commitments in relation to social welfare and mortgage holders. The whole question of social welfare will be dealt with in detail today by the Minister for Social Welfare and there will be no difficulty in seeing progress in relation to social welfare and promises made in that area.</P>
    <P>The budget, which was presented to this House yesterday, represented a series of promises and commitments kept, in a context that required and demanded total management, hard decisions and shared sacrifices.  In that sense it is a budget with which I am proud to be associated.  It was not a radical budget.  There was neither the time nor the room for that.  This Government took office five or six weeks ago and since then it has had to grapple with a series of economic and other issues that were not of its making.  Inevitably the first budget, and it is the first of several, had to be drawn carefully and prudently.</P>
    <P>From the day this Government was formed it has operated against a background of turbulent economic conditions, nationally and internationally. The continuing European recession has been aggravated by the upheavals that have taken place in the financial markets. The task has not been made easier by the attacks of speculators on our currency. High interest rates have damaged our economy and created a great deal of hardship for families with mortgages. Above all, there has been the spectre of unemployment which has passed through the all-time historically high figure of 300,000 people.  Behind that statistic lie, on the one hand, countless stories of human suffering and indignity and on the other, the need for far reaching and <Col N="1711" /> fundamental reforms of structures and policies to begin to turn the spiral downwards. In that context the news in relation to Digital this morning is a serious blow, not just to the city of Galway, but to the many families involved and indeed to the economy.  It highlights the fragility of mobile investment. Hidden behind the statistics too is a story of disadvantage and inequality &mdash; of families in need of shelter, of children going to school cold and ill-equipped, of elderly people waiting patiently for hospital treatments they should have had months, if not years, before.</P>
    <P>No Government, coming new to office, can ignore these stories.  No Government, coming new to office, can ignore the need to tap into the commitment of its people to change.  Above all, no Government, coming new to office, can ignore the demand for wealth and job creation throughout the economy.</P>
    <P>This is the first of four budgets that will be presented to this House by this Government.  Even though every subsequent budget will be more radical than this one, I believe it is already clear that this Government has not shirked the hard decisions.  It is already clear that this is a Government that intends to keep its promises.</P>
    <P>The budgetary discipline that we have imposed will ensure that the Exchequer borrowing requirement will be one of the lowest in the European Community this year &mdash; well within the range that satisfies our commitment to the Maastricht Treaty.  At the same time, we have produced a public capital programme that is up by 20 per cent on last year, demonstrating a commitment to job creation and to steady improvement of the infrastructure of our economy.</P>
    <P>We have asked for sacrifice in the budget &mdash; I do not deny that for one moment.  We have ensured that, to the maximum possible extent, that sacrifice is spread across the community and borne by those most able to bear it and we have begun the task of eliminating disadvantage, starting by substantially <Col N="1712" /> improving the situation of a great many families in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Above all, the commitment that this budget has made is that jobs are the number one item on this Government's agenda.  No budget in recent years has provided anything like as much money for extra investment in jobs.  I have no doubt that the great majority of our people fully recognise the need for such investment.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt either that the people will willingly put their shoulders to the wheel in the effort to modernise our economy and infrastructure, position ourselves for further growth and wealth creation, and create jobs in the short and medium term.</P>
    <P>The £500 million increase in the public capital programme will result in a whole series of major projects in roads, rail, housing, sanitary services, schools, hospitals, and communications.  Coupled with this investment, the new county enterprise boards will spearhead an effort to unleash local dynamism and commitment, and to channel much better use of Structural Funds and the new Cohesion Fund in the creation of jobs and the improvement of the quality of life throughout our country.</P>
    <P>Added to these measures, improvements in apprenticeship and training, together with targeted measures for people who are long term unemployed, and a range of incentives for people to invest in jobs, will make as big an impact as possible on our unemployment crisis.</P>
    <P>I fully accept that we have a long haul if we are to bring our unemployment level down to anything like an acceptable level, and I have to say that those of us in jobs have to be prepared to accept some measure of sacrifice if we are to achieve that objective in a reasonable period of time.  I believe that if the budget and the Estimates are taken together, any objective political commentator will recognise that most of the promises and commitments made, both during the election campaign, and in the Programme for a Partnership Government, have been honestly kept, <Col N="1713" /> despite the very considerable difficulties that the incoming Government faced.</P>
    <P>Many of the specific measures to be found in the budget can be traced directly back to their origins in the recent election campaign.  I make no apologies for concentrating on those commitments made by the Labour Party in the course of the recent campaign.  The following are some of these measures: the resources available for income tax relief are being concentrated to ensure that those on low incomes will be protected; we have gone as far as we can to protect families with mortgages who have been hit by higher interest rates in recent months; the increase of 27 per cent in child benefit is the largest kind in many years, and it is the first phase of much needed reform in this essential area; the provision in the Estimates for 3,500 local authority housing starts, coupled with other spending plans in social housing, represents a complete reversal of policy in this area, and will enable us to make a very good start in redressing the housing crisis; basic rates of Social Welfare are being fully protected against inflation, and many of the measures in this budget will be of particular benefit to elderly people; as the details unfold, it will be clear that many of the cuts in social welfare of the last couple of years are being reversed&mdash; and even more work will be done in that area over the next few months; in the area of health care, a significant start is being made in attacking the waiting lists that have so damaged patient care in the past; the increase in the provision for mental handicap is the biggest such increase since the issue of mental handicap was rightly forced to the top of the political agenda; in both Estimates and budget, education spending has been increased to take full account of our determination to redress the growing disadvantage in the whole system, and to honour a series of important commitments; the budget featured the largest increase in Third World aid in many years, and has put us on course to meet a high international standard in this area. All these issues featured in the election campaign; all of them are dealt with in <Col N="1714" /> the Programme for a Partnership Government.  Anyone who wishes can examine the manifesto we published in the campaign and they can examine the programme.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that an honest examination will show that to a degree that is perhaps unique in recent years, promises made then are being honoured now. There is much more to come over the next few years as the economy begins to grow and as we come more and more to grips with the issues of equality and justice that are an essential part of the reason we are in Government.</P>
    <P>In the light of some of their recent utterances, an honest appraisal would be too much to expect from some of the Opposition parties.  I have been astonished by the carping, the vilification, and the sheer dishonesty and hypocrisy of some of the Opposition benches since the Government was formed.  Since this is my first opportunity to address it, I would like to take a few moments to refute some of the hypocrisy that has so diminished the Fine Gael Party in particular.</P>
    <P>Much of their dishonest criticism has centred around the establishment of the Office of the Tánaiste, and the appointment of advisers to the Government.  Let me set the record straight for the benefit of anyone who may have been misled by Opposition comments &mdash; the people on the Opposition benches already know what the true position is, even though they choose not to admit it.  The Office of the Tánaiste was established, with the agreement of the Government, for one reason only &mdash; to monitor the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i> effectively and to help ensure that all of its commitments are delivered.  It is there to assist in the delivery of a democratic programme, nothing more, and nothing less. It does not exist for the sake of my ego. The only egos in this place that need soothing are the battered and dishevelled egos that failed so totally to make any impact in the election and compounded that failure by the arrogant way they approached its aftermath.</P>
    <P>The cost of running the office is made up almost entirely by re-allocating personnel <Col N="1715" /> from other Departments and not, as some would seek to pretend, by incurring extra expenditure.  The only extra cost involved is made up by employing two or three people hired for their very particular expertise and I will refer to them in detail in a moment.</P>
    <P>In other Departments, we have employed a number of advisers to assist in the process of delivery.  The great majority of them, even when they are not civil servants, have come from other areas of the public sector and do not represent any significant additional cost. Some have come from the private sector and some have taken a cut in their private sector incomes to assist in delivering our programme.  All of them are motivated by a high degree of public commitment and none of them deserves the vilification that has been heaped on them by some of the begrudgers on the Opposition benches.</P>
    <P>The system of advisers, working side by side with committed, dedicated and able civil servants, was essentially pioneered in this country by Dr. Garret Fitzgerald. He knew the value of the system, particular in helping a Government commited to wide-ranging and fundamental changes, and I feel absolutely sure he must have cringed at some of the cheap and dishonest comments on the issue made by representatives of the party he once led with such distinction.</P>
    <P>As far as my own position is considered, I want to deal with the suggestion of &ldquo;jobbery&rdquo; head on.  I carry a fairly heavy work-load.  That is well known.  I am not complaining about that, it goes with a job that I am proud to do.  For ten years, I have employed the same three people to help me with that work-load and to help me provide an effective level of representation to the people that I serve, both as a constituency TD and as Leader of a major political party.  One, my sister, runs my constituency office and has done so since she resigned from the Department of Agriculture ten years ago to become my secretary.  One runs my office in Leinster House, and another works as an adviser, researcher, and <Col N="1716" /> spokesperson for me.  For ten years, they have worked as public servants, in the best sense of that term, and have been paid accordingly.  They could stand before any forum and relate the hours of dedicated service they have given to the public, to me and the Labour Party for the past ten years.  All of them are well-known to everyone associated with Irish politics and they are well known for their dedication, skill and commitment to their jobs.  At no stage in the past ten years has any one of them been accused of being in receipt of political patronage and at no stage in the past ten years has the accusation of jobbery been levelled against me for employing them.</P>
    <P>Now that I have become a member of the Government, I have no intention of firing these three people as some have indicated.  I intend to continue to employ them because they do good work, serve a very wide community and public interest in the work they do and because they earn every penny of the salaries they are paid.  Everyone who knows them knows that.  That is is not &ldquo;jobbery&rdquo;, it is good sense.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the House quite frankly that I am determined to do a good job over the next four years and that I will need help to do it.  I greatly value the advice and commitment of every civil servant who works for the Government and I greatly value having sources of independent advice too.  I believe strongly that co-operative interaction between civil servants, all of them expert in their own fields, and other experts, with skills and day to day experience of a wider world, can only strengthen the contribution that this Government can make.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I intend to employ expertise and to make no apology for doing so.  In addition to the three people I have already mentioned, I am recruiting a top-class business manager, a leading and highly-respected economist and an expert lawyer and legal draughtsman to strengthen the Office of the Tánaiste and to make a a major contribution to the work of reform and change.  All of them will be paid the rate appropriate to the <Col N="1717" /> job, all of them, will be worked hard over the next four years, and each of them, in his or her own way, will contribute to making Ireland a better place.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I wish to advise the House that as Minister for Foreign Affairs, I have responsibility for two Votes; Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation.  With so many fundamental political and economic interests at stake, the need for an active, well-informed and effective foreign policy has never been clearer.</P>
    <P>I am actively engaged in examining these issues, in close consultation with the people who represent Ireland so well around the world, and I am determined to ensure that our foreign policy, which has always been an expression of our independence and sovereignty, as well as our commitment to the community of nations, will continue to reflect values as well as interests.  I am examining which of our bilateral relations needs to be strengthened, and how we in the Department of Foreign Affairs can contribute even further to the development of trade, investment and cultural links.</P>
    <P>In so far as possible, however, we are determined to ensure that new challenges are met within existing resources and the 1993 budgetary allocation reflects this.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me not to say a few words about the continuing tragedy of Northern Ireland in this context.  I will not, however, go into detail here, since I intend to address the whole subject of Northern Ireland at some length in the next week or so.  For the moment, let me refer to the proposals in relation to the establishment of the Foreign Affairs Committee in so far as they concern Northern Ireland.  I know that there has been some adverse reaction to the seeming exclusion of Northern Ireland from the deliberations of the committee.  It is not my intention that Members of the Oireachtas should be precluded from putting forward views and ideas or debating issues in relation to Northern Ireland, but Members must accept and realise that there are sensitive issues involved and that there will be times when it is simply necessary, and in everybody's interest, <Col N="1718" /> that matters relating to Northern Ireland be dealt with on the basis of total confidentiality. Subject to that understanding, I am prepared to examine ways and means of dealing with the reservations expressed by Members in regard to the terms of reference of the Foreign Affairs Committee.</P>

      <P>In the International Co-operation Vote we have provided £53 million for official development assistance in 1993, an increase of 44 per cent over the 1992 allocation.  This fulfills the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to increase overseas development assistance to 0.2 per cent of GNP this year.  Despite the acute pressure on every area of public expenditure, the Government has remained resolute on the issue of assistance to the Third World.  The difficulties we face in Ireland cannot blind us to the needs of those in the developing world who are suffering from drought, famine and disease.  Whatever our problems, they do not bear comparison with the wretchedness of the poorest countries in Africa and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The additional funding for development assistance will be used to increase our bilateral aid efforts and also to provide additional contributions to the various Irish and international aid and development organisations.  The allocation for bilateral aid will be increased from £10.9 million in 1992 to £15.3 million this year.  My Department is currently finalising plans for expanding our aid programme and we are examining the possibility of including new priority countries, in addition to the four currently targeted &mdash; Sudan, Tanzania, Zambia and Lesotho. The increased allocation of £3.35 million for emergency humanitarian relief will allow us to respond more quickly and generously to requests for assistance following disasters in developing countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will also this year double our voluntary contributions to a range of UN development agencies, including <Col N="1719" /> UNICEF and UNDP, as well as strengthening our co-operation with Irish non-governmental organisations such as Concern, Trócaire and the Red Cross.  The 71 per cent increase in the allocation to APSO will allow for a significant increase in the number of Irish volunteers working in developing countries.</P>
    <P>In the Programme for a Partnership Government, we committed ourselves to increasing ODA expenditure by 0.5 per cent each year after 1993 in order, by 1997, to place us on a par with our EC partners and to make steady progress towards achieving the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP.  I can assure the House that despite the difficult financial situation we will have to confront over the coming years, the Government will not waver in its commitments to the developing world.  This is a moral and humanitarian obligation which, as a nation, we cannot shirk.</P>
    <P>Once again this week, with the tragic death of Valerie Place in Somalia, we have had the most compelling illustration of the extraordinary commitment and dedication shown by Irish volunteers in so many parts of the developing world.  It is entirely fitting that we as a Government should show the fullest support for their work.  The tributes that have been paid to Valerie Place this week have been moving and thoroughly well-deserved.  I can think of no better tribute than that we should intensify our efforts to bring relief, support, and encouragement to the countries of the developing world, for whose people Valerie Place gave her life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Today is one of the blackest days in Irish industrial history. We are debating the 1993 budget in the shadow of the Digital disaster, where 800 employees have lost their jobs.  Neither the Taoiseach or any of his Ministers was able to confirm this to the Dáil.  It was left to Deputy Bruton to raise the issue this morning as the Leader of the Opposition. This is symbolic of the appalling contribution of this Government to that <Col N="1720" /> disaster, and of its approach to the question of jobs.</P>
      <P>My contribution to the House today must focus on the jobs crisis.  The Fianna Fáil-Labour Government budget is a coward's charter in its failure to confront the problem.  It is a blueprint for bigger dole queues.  At an individual level, the helplessness of each of the one third of a million without work will now be converted to hopelessness.  What is even worse is the phony rhetoric in the budget about jobs.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, once again, claims that the budget is framed on the principle that jobs are the overriding national priority.  He talks about having to face hard choices and of the need for those in employment to put the need to create jobs above their personal interests.  However, neither the Minister nor his colleagues in Government have done this.  If the Minister genuinely confronted the jobs crisis, unpopular decisions would have to be made which could impinge on many powerful lobbies, most of whom represent those with jobs.</P>
      <P>In his Budget Statement yesterday, the Minister for Finance mentioned that a provision of over £4,000 million is being made for public service pay and pensions for 1993.  This represents an increase of 7.5 per cent over the 1992 outturn, which is well ahead of inflation.  Even worse, the 1992 figure represented a 10.5 per cent increase over the 1991 outturn.  Over the past two years, public service pay and pensions have increased by almost 20 per cent, and all the Minister can tell us is that the scale of this expenditure and its increase continue to be matters of major concern for the Government.  Then this Government tells us its overriding priority is job creation.  I know there are many low and middle-paid public servants who need their increases badly. However, overall increases of almost 20 per cent in the public service pay bill surely deserve more than a passing reference by the Minister and his Government, who still pretend that job creation and enterprise are their primary objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you want to discourage cigarette <Col N="1721" /> smoking, you tax it.  If you want to further discourage it you tax it more.  The problem with the way our public finances are based is that this is exactly what this Government is doing in relation to jobs. Apart from additional taxation, additional PRSI is now payable.  Having consulted with economists, Fine Gael made it clear that our objective was to see a reduction in PRSI, because it is essentially a tax on employment.  Yet, ceilings will increase from £20,300 to £21,300 for employers, and from £19,000 to £20,000 for employees and the self-employed. Instead of reducing tax on jobs, this Government has increased it and this has been accompanied by the savage imposition of a 1 per cent income levy, which further taxes enterprise.  The hard choices made by Fianna Fáil and Labour appear to be nothing more than deciding to give a kick in the teeth to those on PAYE and to those who believed their elected promises about job creation.</P>
    <P>In the United States President Clinton produced a budget package calling for sacrifice, which clearly set forth the basis on which those sacrifices could impact on the dole queues and have a real economic effect.  Unfortuntely, we have a sacrifice which will have nothing but an adverse impact on these two factors.  Those who might have been happy &mdash; I know there is a strain of idealism here, if one could only reach and tap it &mdash; to shoulder the burden of such a sacrifice would certainly not be willing to undertake it in these circumstances.  Charles Lamb wrote: &ldquo;Young men see visions, old men dream dreams.&rdquo;  If one contrasts the approach of President Bill Clinton and Deputy Ahern, it is clear that the young man seeing the vision is President Clinton and the old man dreaming dreams about job creation is Deputy Ahern.</P>
    <P>The Government solution to the job crisis is the imposition of £130 million annually, by way of extra tax from the iniquitous 1 per cent income levy, as well as an extra £25 million, which has not been referred to, by way of PRSI contributions. The overall PRSI take will rise much more having risen by £100 million <Col N="1722" /> last year.  The increase will probably be the same this year because of increasing income.  There will, however, be a further £25 million because of the increase we have seen that is coupled with an additional annual £130 million yield from the changes in VAT.  The additional VAT will also impact on jobs.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the iniquitous 1 per cent income levy as being temporary. I was reminded of William Pitt the Younger who imposed income tax at sixpence in the pound as a temporary measure to pay for the Napoleonic Wars. That is not a good precedent for anybody who would rely on this Government's promise that this levy will be temporary.</P>
    <P>Let us not ignore the impact on jobs of the increase in VAT.  We have a domestic economy which is as flat as a pancake. There is no confidence in it at all.  In many ways the Government does not realise the contribution the domestic economy makes to the creation of jobs. There are hundreds of thousands of people in the domestic economy providing goods and services, many of whom will have to pay a high price for yesterday's Government measures in lost jobs, particularly in the hotel and catering sector.  The VAT increase also affects the clothing and footwear industry.  I remember all the bruhaha years ago and reference is still made to our party Leader, Deputy Bruton, and the VAT on shoes.  Yesterday's budget put through an increase in VAT on shoes, clothes and jobs, yet people who had the brass neck to criticise what was at the time a minor part of the budget and which was approved incidentally by the Labour members of the then Cabinet, now ignore the impact on jobs of these crushing VAT increases.</P>
    <P>The optimistic assumptions of the Government put GDP growth at 2.5 per cent, a figure rejected by most independent commentators.  The Government says that real disposable income and personal consumer spending will rise by the same figure which has again been rejected by most independent commentators. Even on those optimistic assumptions we are talking, on Government <Col N="1723" /> figures alone, of an increase in the annual live register of 26,000.  I believe that this figure is unfortunately an underestimate.</P>
    <P>One other aspect of the budget's impact on jobs that has not been highlighted involves the £11 million smash and grab raid on the insurance compensation fund.  Essentially, the 1 per cent levy on insurance liability arises out of the ICI disaster and that levy terminated at the end of the year.  What we now have is employer, public and motor liability insurance premiums that could have been reduced by a sum equivalent to £11 million per annum.  Instead the Government has sequestered this money and the cost to employers will again be adversely affected.  Only last week the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, admitted to me, in reply to a Dáil question, that high costs, whether insurance costs or otherwise, have an adverse effect on the trading sector of the economy in terms of output, employment and the ability of firms to compete in the marketplace.  Yet that same Minister is a Member of a Government which contributes to those high costs.</P>
    <P>A recent report from the NESC pointed out that the rate of employment growth in Ireland has never been sufficient to cater for the potential increase in the labour force at prevailing wage rates.  The result is that we have had prolonged episodes of large-scale emigration and/or high unemployment.  This report pointed out that over the period 1960-90 total employment in Ireland grew by just 8 per cent from 1.04 million to 1.13 million.  During those three decades employment in the EC rose by 13 per cent while employment in the wider OECD group of countries grew by as much as 39 per cent.  As a result of this year's budget this appalling record is set to continue.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that the link up between the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil in Government would have provided a new standard of which this country might have been proud.  Hopes in this regard have, <Col N="1724" /> however, been dashed.  The Tánaiste has given no justification whatever for the enormous expenditure on the separate office apparently established, as we all believe, merely to boost his ego.  He denied this, yet if one examines what he has to say, reinforces the argument that this office was established to boost his ego.  Is it any wonder that there is a cynical reaction amongst the general public to the activities of our £1 million Tánaiste from the Labour Party whose main contribution, despite what he had to say this morning, has been jobs for the boys and to spend money on himself?</P>

      <P>I am grateful for that intervention &mdash; 12 pages of self-justification. No, methinks he doth protest too much.  I do not believe that he is giving the full picture.  He refers to the fact that virtually no costs are involved because the cost of running the office is made up almost entirely by reallocating personnel from other departments.  How then in the Book of Estimates have we a situation where, of the £831,000 provided for the office of the Tánaiste, there is not a single penny under subhead A for salaries, wages and allowances?  The Estimate comprises: travel and subsistence, £450,000; incidental expenses, £65,000; postal and telecommunication services, £75,000; office machinery and other office supplies, £100,000; office premises expenses, £70,000; and consultancy services, £10,000.  How then does the Tánaiste justify telling the House that the cost of running the office is made up almost entirely by reallocating personnel from other Departments and not incurring extra expenditure?  This is all extra expenditure.  This £1 million Tánaiste is not going to get away with that kind of rubbish that we have had to listen to this morning.</P>

      <P>I am talking about <Col N="1725" /> correcting the misleading record that has been put to this House this morning by the Tánaiste.  In relation to jobbery we had hoped for something new, something fresh from the Labour Party.  Instead we have had the establishement of an office for the £1 Tánaiste, accompanied by his own colleagues in Government who are giving a disgraceful example by spending substantial public moneys, estimated by one commentator with experience of this House at almost £3 million, on bloated ministerial staff, some of whom are apparently members of their own families. Will this kind of example from either Labour or Fianna Fáil Ministers do anything other than add to the general cynicism with which politicians are viewed?  It is certainly not the kind of change for which the people voted last November.</P>
      <P>It is important for us to be clear that the kind of justification produced by the Tánaiste this morning is not acceptable. He tells us that for the last ten years he has employed three people to help with his workload and he challenges us to say whether he should fire them.  If he employed people for the last ten years that is his own business and he can continue employing them.  Does he expect the taxpayers to pay for them now?  Even worse, we have a situation where with the greatest bravado he tells us he is not satisfied with all the people already taken on from the Labour Party who were solely helping and advising him on how to run the Labour Party.  They had great pride in it.  He has the gall to announce that he is to recruit even more highly paid staff.  It is outrageous that this House should be subjected to a speech of this nature by somebody who in Opposition talked about high standards and ethics in Government, and who now, with the greatest brass neck comes in and delivers this lengthy speech of self-justification which the hard-suffering taxpayers will laugh at.  I am appalled at the reaction of the Tánaiste, from whom I had expected more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also expected a caring approach from the Labour Party when it joined the Government.  I am glad to see the Minister <Col N="1726" /> of State, Deputy Stagg, here.  I presume he is here to justify the health charges which are the meanest cuts of all. They amount to a tax on the sick.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that it is now a Labour Minister for Health who is attempting to justify them.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, referred to ODA.  I am pleased with the approach now being taken in relation to ODA. Public finances are not a huge factor in foreign policy except in relation to such aid.</P>
    <P>I also welcome his reference to reviewing the very restrictive terms which he has proposed for the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs &mdash; we pressed him very strongly from this side of the House on that issue.  There is a solution in regard to the position in Northern Ireland.  It is ludicrous, as we said, to exclude Northern Ireland from discussions at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  Reference has been made to the political and security aspects of Northern Ireland.  I see no justification whatsoever for excluding from discussion the political aspects of Northern Ireland.  We are politicians and ultimately there is going to be a political solution there.  In relation to the security aspects there may be a case for some arrangement which would ensure that sensitive issues might be discussed in private.</P>
    <P>We should put the position regarding ODA in perspective.  I am glad that the totally hypocritical approach adopted since Fine Gael left Government in 1987 has been arrested.  When Fine Gael left office ODA, for which I was the Minister with responsibility, stood at 0.26 per cent of GNP.  The moneys now provided only partly restore the level of ODA that existed when we left office.  I am delighted to see the level of ODA going up from 0.16 per cent of GNP, an utterly outrageous figure, to 0.2 per cent. However, it is only partly restoring the situation which we bequeathed to the nation when we left office.</P>
    <P>One other new tax deserves to be highlighted. Death duties have been restored for the rich and poor.  It has been overlooked <Col N="1727" /> that the 2 per cent probate tax will affect every bereaved family.  This is another example of the unthinking, uncaring approach of this Government. Clearly, in the Ireland of Fianna Fáil and Labour, it does not pay to work or provide jobs.  There is no escape from the dole queues, one cannot afford to be sick and now there is even an exit tax for everyone who dies.</P>

      <P>I too am very disappointed at the decision of Digital to phase out the manufacturing facility at Galway. Galway is an excellent centre of expertise and professionalism and excellent people work there.  It ranks as one of the best technology centres in the world.  I hope further development can take place there yet and that some of its operations can be redeemed during the proposing phasing period.  I am particularly disappointed as the Department of Social Welfare is one of Digital's largest customers, and I intend to convey my views in that regard also to Digital.</P>
      <P>The budget is a budget for people, for people at work, for people trying to generate business, for home-owners, for people who depend on our social welfare services.  Most of all, it is a budget for jobs.  The budget will keep confidence in the economy.  Last year we astounded our European partners with our strength of resolve in managing the currency problem. We successfully held our place in the ERM and proved the inherent stability of our economy.  The budget will also stimulate investment and kickstart job creation with the £500 million investment package for roads, ports and housing. The county enterprise partnership boards are getting a £25 million cash boost and the extension of the BES will attract new tourism and leisure projects.</P>
      <P>The budget will also protect and strengthen the position of workers, particularly those with families on low pay; and maintain and safeguard the position of people depending on social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social welfare improvements <Col N="1728" /> announced in this budget protect the incomes of those dependent on social welfare by maintaining the real value of their social welfare payments, improve payments for children considerably, provide extra support for families at work, underpin the status of the social insurance fund for workers and employers, and underline the work of the voluntary sector.</P>
    <P>The Government has provided an additional £180 million a year to maintain the real value of social welfare payments. This brings overall expenditure for 1993 to £3.7 billion, more than £10 million a day for each day of the year.</P>
    <P>More than 800,000 people and their 700,000 dependent spouses and children depend on social welfare payments each week.  These include 250,000 pensioners, people who have worked hard all their lives and have contributed to the growth and prosperity of our country.  Now in retirement, they have the right to expect that their financial position will be safeguarded. Pensioners will be reassured by the provisions in this budget.</P>
    <P>Children are a priority with this Government.  We are providing an extra £62 million a year for child income support. This is made up by £50 million in child benefit increases and £12 million in higher child dependant allowances and improved FIS.</P>
    <P>Child benefit is our universal income support for children.  It goes to every mother in the country.  It is funded entirely by the taxpayer.  It is recognised as a most effective means of directing resources to families.  In contrast, increases in child dependant allowances have been shown to create barriers for workers wishing to return to the jobs market, especially for those with large families.  Child benefit is paid to families both in and out of work.</P>
    <P>Almost half a million families receive child benefit each month and all of those will benefit from the significant increases being provided.  This is the beginning of a process in which we plan to increase child income support with the main emphasis on child benefit.  Child dependant allowances payable with all weekly <Col N="1729" /> social welfare and health board payments are being increased by £0.30 per child per week, that is an increase of the order of 2.4 per cent in line with this new approach.</P>
    <P>The main features in this year's budget are:</P>
    <P>3.5 per cent increase in all weekly social welfare and health board payments. These increases will apply to personal rates and adult dependant allowances and come into effect at the end of July.  This will cost £113 million a year and some £50 million this year.</P>
    <P>A special increase of 4.9 per cent in all short term payments at a cost of £7 million a year.  Child benefit is being increased to £20.00 per child for each of the first three children and to £23.00 for the fourth child on.  This is an increase of £4.20 per month or 26.6 per cent in the rate for each of the first three children.  The new rates will come into effect from the beginning of September. A £12 a week increase in the family income supplement.  An increase of £6.20 a week, 11.7 per cent in the carer's allowance to bring it to the long term rate of £59.20.  An increase of £5 in both the minimum and maximum rates of maternity benefit.  A new grant of £200 for mothers on the birth of twins.  A better deal for unemployed people who qualify for the third level education scheme.  The maintainence element of their higher education grants will be disregarded in determining their allowance.  An extra £1.37 million in grants to the voluntary sector and to assist in measures to conteract moneylending.</P>
    <P>An additional grant of £100,000 to the Combat Poverty Agency.  Changes in recent measures which adversely affected people's claims to unemployment assistance, disability benefit and treatment benefit.  Changes in the regulations improving the entitlement of part-time workers.  Free colour television licence for pensioners who already qualify for the black and white licence and who also qualify for free fuel.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1730" /> Over the last number of years the Government has progressively increased the lowest social welfare payments.  The long term payments reached the Commission on Social Welfare's priority rates in July 1991.  All pensioners, widows, lone parents, deserted wives and the long term unemployed have been receiving at least the priority rate for the past two years.  That group represents 80 per cent of the total number of weekly recipients. Special increases, over and above the general increase, for all short term payments were given last year and I am glad to continue that process this year.  The current personal rate of £53 per week is being increased to £55.60 per week, an increase of 4.9 per cent.  This new rate applies to: disability benefit, unemployment benefit, short term unemployment assistance, and supplementary welfare allowance.  Considerable progress has been made in recent years towards bridging the gap for this group. That progress is being considered this year with £7 million a year being allocated for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The package of general, special and child benefit increases, is best illustrated by the following examples: a couple with two children on short term unemployment assistance or supplementary welfare allowance will receive a total of £125.94 per week, taking child benefit into account &mdash; they will be £6.34, or 5.3 per cent a week better-off.  A couple with four children on long term unemployment assistance will receive an increase of £7.34, or 4.7 per cent per week, taking child benefit into account, bringing their total weekly payment to £165.07.  An old age pensioner couple each on a non-contributory pension will receive a total increase of £4 bringing their weekly pension to £59.20 each.  A couple both over 66 on a contributory old age pension will receive a payment of £112.80 which is an increase of £3.80 per week.  A widow or deserted wife with four children, on a contributory payment, will receive a total payment of £147.77, taking child benefit into account, which is an increase of £6.24, or 4.4 per cent, on their weekly payment and a lone parent with <Col N="1731" /> one child will receive an increase of £3.27 a week, taking child benefit into account, bringing their total payment to £78.72 a week.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance, which I introduced in 1990, was designed as an income maintenance payment to cares providing full-time care and attention to social welfare pensioners.  It recognised, for the first time, the important role of carers in society.  Since its introduction, the allowance has been increased and improved each year and has been extended to cover carers of people receiving payments other than social welfare payments.  With effect from July next, the weekly rate of carer's allowance is being increased to the long term rate of social welfare payments, that is £59.20 a week.  There are 4,400 people receiving the carer's allowance at present.</P>
    <P>The weekly income thresholds for the family income supplement have been increased at each point by £20.  This will give recipients an additional £12 per week in their payment.  More than ever, this scheme now represents major support to workers bringing up families on low pay.</P>
    <P>The social insurance fund is the cornerstone of the social insurance scheme.  It exemplifies the partnership consensus which exists between workers, employers and the State.  Since 1988 the selfemployed have been making an increasingly important contribution to the fund.</P>
    <P>The social insurance fund is working well.  This year, the fund will spend £1,800 million, of which £1,080 million, 60 per cent, is contributed by employers; £470 million, 26 per cent, by employees; £72 million, 4 per cent, by the self-employed with the State meeting the balance required of £178 million, 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>This fund provides benefits for all insured workers.  The main groups benefiting from the fund are: 84,000 unemployed people and their families, £179 million; 95,000 people who are ill, £362 million; 129,000 pensioners, £556 million; and 86,000 widows, £294 million.</P>
    <P>As Deputies can see, the fund is an important investment for both workers <Col N="1732" /> and employers.  Despite the extra pressure it has come under in the recent past, it is vital that PRSI contributors have confidence that their rights and entitlements will be safeguarded.</P>
    <P>Some recent changes in schemes covered by the fund impacted on contributions to the social insurance fund in a way that undermined their confidence in the ability of the fund to meet their needs.  The Government has accepted my proposals for the following adjustments. On Unemployment Assistance, I propose to increase substantially the daily earnings which will be disregarded in assessing earnings from casual employment. Details of the improved disregards will be announced in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill.</P>

      <P>On disability benefit, the rule requiring at least 13 paid PRSI contributions in a recent contribution year will not apply to people on long term unemployment assistance and the pre-retirement allowance when they claim disability benefit.  On treatment benefit I am introducing the following changes in the treatment benefit scheme.  The earnings limit of £25,000 per annum for eligibility will be increased to £30,000 &mdash; the corresponding limit for a non-working spouse will be £60,000.  The rule requiring at least 13 paid PRSI contributions in a recent contribution year will not apply to people on long term unemployment assistance and pre-retirement allowance &mdash; this rule has already been lifted for invalidity pensioners and people receiving long term disability benefit and pensioners who were adversely affected by the increase in the contribution condition requiring five years paid contributions will be restored to benefit &mdash; the former contribution condition will continue to apply in their case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the recent measures concerning exceptional needs payments under the supplementary welfare allownce scheme, I am at present examining the effects of these measures on people who have recourse to supplementary welfare <Col N="1733" /> allowance.  The suitability of dealing on a regular basis with periodic household bills under what are exceptional needs provision is being addressed in my review.  I am convinced that there is a better way of meeting these needs and I expect to make an announcement soon. Meanwhile, the Government has allocated an additional £11 million to the scheme and I wish to stress that community welfare officers have discretion under the Act to make payments for exceptional needs and to ensure that the needs of families in particular are met. The total allocation for supplementary welfare allowance is now £112 million.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, part-time workers, brought into insurance for the first time in April 1991, became eligible for unemployment benefit and disability benefit. A new condition for entitlement to unemployment benefit was introduced under which claimants had to have suffered a substantial loss of employment in order to qualify for benefit.  I have decided to relax the substantial loss of employment condition by reducing, from two days to one day, the loss of employment which a claimant must incur.  This change will make it easier for part-time workers to qualify for unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>My Department provides a free black and white television licence to about 180,000 pensioners and disabled persons in receipt of certain social welfare payments. I am delighted to be able to give a free colour licence to those already getting the black and white licence and who also qualify for a free fuel allowance. This will be of considerable benefit to these pensioners.  I also intend to include a small number of persons in other categories who would qualify were it not for their particular living conditions.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased to introduce the new grant of £200 for mothers on the birth of twins.  The minimum payment of maternity benefit will be increased from £60 to £65 and the maximum rate from £154 to £159.  The increase in the minimum payment will ensure that the maternity benefit rate will be at least as much as a worker would receive if they were out sick from work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1734" /> There are 330 people on the third level allowance which I introduced to enable the long term unemployed people to take on full-time study.  Where a higher education grant is payable, the maintenance element is assessable in full for means test purposes.  I propose to disregard the maintenance element of the higher education grant for the third level allowance means test.</P>
    <P>Voluntary and community groups play an important part in improving the quality of the lives of people dependent on social welfare.  I would like to put on record my personal appreciation of the invaluable work being carried out by voluntary and community groups throughout the country.  I am committed to continuing and developing the supports provided by my Department in this area. I am delighted that the Government has accepted my proposals for an additional £1.37 million for this activity in 1993.  This brings the overall allocation this year for support for voluntary activity to £4.73 million.</P>
    <P>In addition to maintaining the supports already provided for, I intend to make a number of once-off special grants to voluntary organisations in need of assistance or to fund proposals for innovative services &mdash; £780,000 has been provided for these grants in the budget in addition to the £600,000 provided in the 1993 Estimates; increase by £250,000 the amount available under the community development programme to enable the programme to be extended to a number of new areas &mdash; this brings the overall allocation for the programme to £1.5 million; continue and develop a pilot programme of advice and assistance to low income families to combat the problems associated with moneylending &mdash; I am providing an additional £240,000 for this pilot programme bringing the overall allocation in 1993 to £500,000.  I intend to increase by £100,000 the amount available for locally based women's groups bringing the total allocation in 1993 to £600,000.  In addition I am allocating an extra £100,000 to the Combat Poverty Agency bringing their allocation for 1993 to £1.48 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1735" /> I have outlined for Deputies a number of once-off special grants which I made in the context of the budget.  The Minister mentioned some of them yesterday and I will outline the remainder.  The total allocation is £1.37 million.  A grant will go to the Respite Care Trust Fund amounting to £500,000.  A sum of £100,000 will go to a special fund for retired people to facilitate the introduction of a social mentor scheme.  I want to encourage voluntary and community groups to develop innovative measures aimed at providing support for vulnerable elderly people in the community and also to give retired people the opportunity to help enterprise groups by making their skills available to them after they have retired.</P>
    <P>There will also be a grant of £40,000 to Senior Citizens Concern at Ramsgrange; £25,000 to Energy Action; £100,000 for voluntary groups who bring forward schemes to help lone parents to get back into the work force or education; £50,000 to the National League of the Blind for people with disabilities; £40,000 to the Rehabilitation Insititute; £40,000 to the Irish Wheelchair Association; £25,000 to the Capuchin Centre for Homeless Men; £20,000 to the Carmichael Centre for Voluntary Groups to enable them to provide accommodation and administrative facilities and a training resource to more than 30 small voluntary organisations; £20,000 to Barnardos; £20,000 to Cherry Orchard Family Resource Centre; £20,000 to Droichead Nua Family Support Group and £20,000 to Newbury House Family Centre in Cork.</P>

      <P>In relation to moneylending we will be able to extend the existing programme, and I propose to bring to Government shortly plans for a new transition to work programme.  This programme will build on the successes of various <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> initiatives piloted in 12 designated areas of high unemployment.  These arose from the community development programme introduced by me in 1990 but will now also include new initiatives to support people preparing to re-enter the workforce and find a niche for themselves in gainful employment.  We will work closely, of course, with the county enterprise partnership boards in developing initiatives.  Greater support for people and security for their families in making the transition to full-time or part-time work will be a main element of the proposals.</P>
      <P>I will return to the House later with more details but I want to encourage inexperienced young people to get training and education and get into the workforce &mdash; that is something Members on all sides of the House would want.</P>
      <P>Unemployed people are not just part of the jobs equation.  Thousands of them have ideas, motivation, the drive and the courage to confront their situations.  I want to provide them with the flexibility and support they need to take that step. This budget consolidates the provisions of our social welfare services and allows me a certain latitude to do some of the things Members would like.</P>

It is ironic that the Minister for Social Welfare should make his speech flanked by Deputy Stagg, who is now a Minister of State.  Deputy Stagg single-handedly managed to have Deputy McCreevy transferred from the Department of Social Welfare because of what, he very aptly called, &ldquo;the dirty dozen&rdquo;.

      <P>I will be happy to highlight the outrageous anomalies and problems that still remain in social welfare after this budget despite all the protestations of the great &ldquo;socialists&rdquo;, Deputy Stagg and his colleagues.  The sad fact which has emerged in the past six weeks is that the Labour Ministers and Deputies are on a gravy train since they came to power.  They are appointing their families and friends to office while there is no money to pay people living in poverty and those who are entitled to social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party's behaviour has been quite disgraceful and unconscionable. The Tánaiste's new highly promoted Office is costing £800,000 to the taxpayer, £600,000 of which is new expenditure.  Can the two Ministers of State opposite justify that expenditure when people who were paying £10 a day for hospital charges will now pay £25? The £800,000 being spent on the Tánaiste's Office is only being spent on one Minister.  We will get the full bill for the rest of the Ministers and Ministers of State, and their handlers shortly.  That £800,000 is the equivalent of 80,000 bed nights at £10 and those bed nights could have been paid for by the Government and the burden lifted from workers.  The Labour Party have increased hospital charges to £25 per night.  Deputy Stagg is silent, will he answer now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Stagg should examine his conscience <Col N="1739" /> and the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare should do likewise.  How can they justify this?  The fact is that the Deputy, and his colleagues, are all on a gravy train, they have filled their pockets and those of their families and friends since coming to office.  How many Minister's children, brothers and sisters, have been put on the State payroll since the Deputy came to office?  They have been filling their own pockets and those of their families and friends since assuming office.</P>

      <P>According to the Tánaiste's office, up to yesterday £800,000 would have paid for 80,000 nights in hospital beds.  However, because the cost has increased to £25 per night, the number of bed nights will decrease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was nothing new in the contribution of the Minister for Social Welfare. <Col N="1740" /> Everything had been announced yesterday.  The Minister went through the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance, what was contained in the <i>Principal Features of the Budget 1993</i> or in the press release issued by his Department. There is no suggestion that the Minister understands the role of the Department of Social Welfare in regenerating this economy as the principal means of alleviating poverty.  There is no mention of economic development in the Minister's statement.  That is the central point of my speech.  I have believed for a long time that the manner in which the Department of Social Welfare spends its considerable budget causes poverty.  It is wasting hundreds of millions of pounds.  I will give illustrations shortly.</P>
    <P>The budget is £3.7 billion, a considerable sum of money but the end result will be more unemployment and poverty. A central feature of our social welfare system as it relates to our tax system is that it traps people in poverty.  When I was a Minister I wrote a memorandum when Barry Desmond was Minister for Health.  He took it as an attack on social welfare when I said that everybody wants a good social welfare system.  However, our social welfare system traps people in poverty.</P>
    <P>Prior to the 1988 budget I wrote an article for the <i>Irish Independent</i> highlighting the poverty trap.  I devised a table showing all the adjustments <i>vis-à-vis</i> a person on the average industrial wage and a person on unemployment assistance, especially someone with a family. When one makes all the adjustments after transport costs to work, pension contributions, medical cards, differential rent, Christmas bonus etc., the reality is that since 1988 people are worse off in work on the average industrial wage than they would be on unemployment assistance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

      <P>No, the taxes are too high and the Government increased them further in yesterday's budget.  That is my first point, the Government does not understand what it is doing.  The Government placed another 1 per cent levy on all income yesterday which has further increased the poverty trap.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from the Minister's heckling that he does not understand the problem, nor indeed does <Col N="1742" /> the Government.  The tax and social welfare policies of the Government mean that this economy is trapped in poverty. Anyone married with two children or more on the average industrial wage will be worse off than if they were in receipt of unemployment assistance and they are already living in poverty.  The budget makes that position worse because of the 1 per cent levy and the increased ceiling for PRSI for employers and employees.</P>
      <P>Two further significant costs will make matters worse.  Disability benefit is to be taxed, a great socialist development. People who get sick and go into hospital will have to pay more &mdash; £25 a day instead of £10 and £250 instead of £100 if they are there for ten days.</P>
      <P>This situation started in 1988.  At that stage people on the average industrial wage were £2.30 worse off, not counting the cost of a medical card in that assessment. In answer to a question to the Minister for Health I discovered this cost is, on average, £6 per week.  People were worse off then by approximately £8.88. After last year's budget they were worse off by approximately £33 a week, and, as a result of this budget they will be worse off by approximately £37 a week.  Many people do not qualify for a medical card because they are assessed on gross rather than net pay.  The rent differential will be adjusted upwards, as always happens, quietly and unannounced.  Transport costs for work go up because of increased petrol prices or bus fares.  All these factors mean workers will be worse off each year.</P>
      <P>A worker on the average industrial wage of £240 a week will be worse off than somebody living in poverty on social welfare of £140 a week.  It costs the employer £350 to pay that sum, when one considers public liability insurance, sick pay, PRSI etc.  This economy is caught in that bind.  This is the sixth budget in a row in which the Government has demonstrated it does not understand the problem because it has made matters worse.</P>

I do not need the children's allowance but I receive it.  Thousands of my constituents living on small incomes receive the same children's allowance as the Minister of State.  How socialist is that?  How can it be maintained that it is targeted at the poor?</P>
      <P>The Labour Party ceased addressing that constituency; it is addressing the new middle classes of Dublin South which the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald now represents. They are looked after, not the poor of Dublin Central.  The rich have received as much as the poor in children's allowances.  How can a socialist Minister justify that when there is so much grinding poverty?  I know all the arguments about paying everybody equally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I know that not alone am I annoying the two Ministers of State present because what I say is true, but I am touching a sore, raw nerve among their supporters.  Before the Minister of State at the Department of Finance came in, I said the Labour Ministers and backbenchers were on a gravy train looking after themselves.  There will now be the chairmanship and convenors of the various committees which will result in more money for Labour backbenchers in addition to the advisers to Ministers and Ministers of State.  We are more than doubling the cost of hospital beds to workers who are already less well off by being at work.  Clearly, the Ministers have lost the run of themselves and have abandoned the working class and are now going helter-skelter for the middle classes.  There is no other explanation for what they are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not profitable for anyone to take or create a job here.  We badly need several key reforms; one of which should be to reduce taxes on employment, notably PRSI, which the Government increased yesterday.  We should reduce PRSI which amounts to a 20 per cent tax on jobs.  In addition, taking into account the two income levies, the health levy and the other encumbrances we put on <Col N="1745" /> employers, it is impossible to employ people.  Employers &mdash; and not only Digital &mdash; are reducing their workforces.  I understand some of our banks will produce major redundancy programmes in the next few weeks.  We are talking about up to 1,200 job losses in one of our major banks in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>And they make no profits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>If they can make more profits elsewhere &mdash; I know the Minister of State deeply resents anyone making profits &mdash; they will go elsewhere.  If it is profitable for them to employ people they will but the Minister of State, and his philosophy, is making it impossible for them to employ people.  We increased the pay roll tax by levies and increasing the ceilings when we should have been doing the reverse.  That is one key element.  I wish to give an example.  I will not name the private company concerned which has a turnover in excess of £500 million and employs 123 people.  It pays in employers PRSI, £300,000.  CIE, a public company, which employs 12,000 people has a turnover of less than £500 million, and they pay £32 million for the pleasure and privilege of employing those people.  It is no wonder that the management in CIE, An Post and Telecom Éireann have been reducing their workforces.</P>
      <P>I had hoped it would be announced in the budget that all means-testing would be on take home pay rather than gross pay.  I have been pressing for years that change, which was introduced in the United Kingdom in 1984.  One of the great anomalies is that people are losing entitlement on money they never see. Eligibility for medical cards, differential rent, civil legal aid and higher education grants should be based on take home pay rather than gross pay.  People are being assessed on money they never see and can never enjoy.  The 1 per cent levy is a form of double taxation because people will be taxed on the element which is taken away from them in PAYE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must also decisively reduce income tax, preferably by substantially increasing <Col N="1746" /> allowances and bands.  That has to be paid for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

I hope it is not too late this year to reverse some of the Government's ridiculous social welfare rules such as forcing young people out of their parents' home in order to qualify for unemployment assistance, thereby qualifying for the full assistance, a medical card and rent subsidy and costing the State a great deal of money because of stupid social welfare rules and policies. It is one of hundreds of anomalies which these Ministers have refused to change. The social welfare budget which is supposed to alleviate poverty is causing poverty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am six weeks in Government today, unlike Deputy Jim Mitchell who spent five years in Government.  I have not been able to change the world overnight but the budget marks key progress and the fulfilment of key commitments made by the Labour Party and included in the Government programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1747" /> First, there has been a £500 million increase in public investment, from £1.85 billion last year to £2.34 billion in 1993, with a significant impact on jobs.  There was reference on the radio this morning to this being only £500 million as if it was only £5.  This is a very significant increase and injection into public capital spending which will have a significant impact on jobs now and in the future.  Secondly, and my colleague, Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, is responsible for this, 3,500 council homes are to be constructed to begin to tackle the housing crisis which has built up over the past five years.  Thirdly £20 million is being provided to tackle waiting lists for hospital treatment, fourthly, £8 million is being provided for people with mental handicap, the largest step yet in implementing the needs and abilities report.</P>
    <P>There has also been a 27 per cent increase in child benefit and social welfare improvements well ahead of inflation for those on the lowest rates, in line with the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.  We targeted help for mortgage holders in difficulty and income tax relief and improvements in family income supplements focused on the low paid.</P>
    <P>This has been a particularly difficult budget to frame for two reasons.  First, the acute difficulties caused for our open economy by the downturn in world economic activity, high interest rates and uncertainty in the exchange markets. Second, there are problems this year because of a series of once-off factors which were there before we took office. In these difficult circumstances, it is all the more welcome that we have been able to move ahead on so much of the Government programme in the first year, and, in particular, during the first weeks.</P>
    <P>Within the constraints of the tight financial discipline it has been possible to give a significant boost to job creation through expanded public sector investment, funded both under the Public Capital Programme which has increased by 25 per cent and through the investment of Cohesion Fund and other revenues. <Col N="1748" /> Table 6 in the Principal Features shows the substantial boost to public sector investment which is being undertaken in the current year.  A sum of £500 million is large money in anybody's book.</P>
    <P>Over the last five years, housing capital has borne the brunt of cutbacks in Government spending, and housing waiting lists have soared.  This has led to an acute problem of homelessness.  Full hostels have led to significant spending by local authorities on bed and breakfast accommodation for homeless people. The supplementary welfare allowance scheme has been paying up to £20 million a year in rent allowances for insecure and often substandard private rented housing.</P>
    <P>I am therefore, particularly pleased to see the substantial investment in local authority housing planned for the coming year, with work on 3,500 houses due to begin in the near future.  This represents more than the investment in housing during the last three years and it is a significant change.  The Labour Party influence in Government is clearly seen in this measure which will make inroads into a serious housing problem.  It makes far more sense to invest in long term homes of good quality than to spend a high proportion of public money on stop gap solutions.  It must, however, be recognised that it will not be possible to eliminate overnight a backlog on housing waiting lists which has built up over a number of years.</P>
    <P>The housing programme will have considerable spin-offs in terms of local employment.  Building is a labour intensive industry, using primarily Irish materials, and the direct and indirect effects on jobs will be positive.  This investment will also make a significant contribution to urban renewal.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that it has been possible in this budget to carry through two important commitments in the Programme for Government.  First, £20 million has been allocated to tackle waiting lists which have grown to unacceptable levels.  Second, £8 million has been allocated to handicap services, primarily mental handicap.  I know the pressure on <Col N="1749" /> parents who have been trying to soldier on caring for a handicapped son or daughter when they are no longer able to cope, and the tremendous worry and fear those parents have about what will happen their child in the future.  The Needs and Abilities report documented the extent of unmet needs in the mental handicap services, particularly the acute shortage of long term residential places and the shortage of day places for adults. Another longstanding problem has been the inappropriate placing of mentally handicapped people in psychiatric hospitals.  These often forgotten people have a right to services which are appropriate to their needs.</P>
    <P>I believe it is better to make substantial progress in tackling areas of longstanding need in the health services, even if it means a modest increase in charges for certain hospital services, than to let the situation drift and to let the backlog that has built up over the last number of years go unchecked.  I am sure anyone on a waiting list for a hip replacement operation who now has a realistic chance of having that operation done in the near future would prefer to pay an extra £5 a day as a public patient and be seen this year, than pay nothing, and stay on a waiting list for another couple of years. It is also important to point out that the cost of outpatient and inpatient care can be claimed against tax on the MED 1 form where unreimbursed medical expenses go over £50 for an individual or £100 for a couple in the tax year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell discussed the issue of poverty traps.  He seemed to be confused because at one point he was advocating more means testing, which creates poverty traps, and at another point he seemed to be castigating child benefit.</P>
    <P>The increases in child benefit which will cost £50 million in a full year are an important way of directing help towards families.  A study by Brian Nolan and Brian Farrell of Child Poverty in Ireland which was conducted for the Combat Poverty Agency stated:</P>
    <P>Child benefit is the most direct and effective means of assisting all low-income <Col N="1750" /> families with children, irrespective of the source of their income, labour force status, or whether they are inside or outside the tax net.  It also has the crucial property that unlike most other approaches it should not entail significant adverse effects on the incentive to work, and therefore acts to reduce rather than increase dependency.</P>
    <P>The authors also point out that 93 per cent of families with children have income under £25,000 a year, so that very little of the expenditure under this heading could be regarded as going to families who do not need it.</P>
    <P>Our system of child support has developed in a way which offers significantly less to parents in employment than to those who are out of work.  This is one of the key areas which creates poverty traps.  It is striking that 45 per cent of families with four or more children have parents who are out of work or on welfare.  This structural defect in our child support system needs to be addressed.  Increasing the level of child benefit is the key to child support system which is neutral as to the work status of the parents.  This year's increase marks the first step on that road.  It is an important element in tackling the poverty trap which has been identified by Deputy Mitchell. Child benefit has a key role in combating these poverty traps.  Deputy Mitchell said at one stage that we were protecting the middle class, and then he thought we were protecting those on low incomes.  He should make up his mind.</P>
    <P>The focus of the budget changes has been on protecting people on the lowest incomes.  The social welfare increases for those on the lowest rate are ahead of the rate of inflation.  Together with the moves being taken to reverse a number of last year's welfare cuts, announced by the Minister for Social Welfare, and to restore the principle of social insurance as conferring entitlement to benefit, this marks a return to the principles of the Commission on Social Welfare, on which I was proud to serve.</P>
    <P>There are tough decisions in this <Col N="1751" /> budget, we are living in tough times. However, we have taken care to protect those at the lowest end of the income spectrum, and half a million people at the lower end of that spectrum are exempt from this income levy.  The income tax reliefs, unlike when the Progressive Democrats participated in Government, have been concentrated at the lower end of the income scale.  Unlike Deputy Cox, I do not weep any tears over the tax clearance measure being introduced to ensure compliance with the existing provisions of the residential property tax.  Those at the upper end of the income spectrum should pay the taxes they are legally obliged to pay.</P>
    <P>I repeat the Tánaiste's comments this morning in relation to the Office of the Tánaiste and the myths about the £830,000 budget.  The bulk of this budget is to pay staff who are redeployed from other sectors of the public service.  Only three new staff members have been engaged.  It continues a practice initiated and successfully operated by Dr. Garret FitzGerald when he was Taoiseach.  The new members of staff are an economist, an accountant who leads the team, and a legal draftsperson.  It is interesting to note, in the autobiography of the former Taoiseach, that Fine Gael was unable to implement its programme for government because of its own embargo on employing legal draftspeople.  It is sensible to ensure that the Programme for Government is implemented and the new structures are there to secure that aim. After six weeks only a small element, although significant, of a four to five year programme has been implemented.  We must ensure that the radical elements of the programme will be implemented.</P>
    <P>It is important in the current uncertain international climate to provide a reasonable balance between spending for jobs and prudent management of the nation's finances.  The budget provides for an Exchequer borrowing requirement of 2.9 per cent which should indicate to the markets the serious policy of this Government on prudent management of the finances and should help to establish <Col N="1752" /> favourable interest rates which are a key element in encouraging job creation and job growth.  I commend this budget to the House.</P>

      <P>I very much regret the announcement of lay-offs by Digital in Galway.  I agree with Deputy Kemmy's recent statement that the Minister's action in relation to Digital constituted a fire brigade type of action.  It must have come as no surprise to the Government that Digital had been experiencing difficulties over a period of time, that they were concentrating on large main frame computers at Galway and had changed their manufacturing emphasis in Ayr.  I am very surprised that stronger remedial action was not taken by the Government long before now.  When one considers the vacuum in politics due to the procrastination of Deputy Dick Spring, now Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, one can better appreciate those difficulties.</P>
      <P>In his Budget Statement yesterday the Minister described it as a pro-jobs budget.  Any analysis of the budget will reveal that it is not pro-jobs.  It has been accepted that we are heading rapidly to an all-time record of 400,000 unemployed unless strong remedial action is taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was highly amused during the recent currency crisis to note the criticism that emanated from Government circles of both the British Prime Minister and the German economy.  We have a tendency to lash out at others in relation to problems which are often our own.  I remember the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, in the course of a television programme describing the British economy as a sick economy.  While I have no axe to grind in relation to the United Kingdom, interest rates there have been reduced to 6 per cent, and the Prime Minister has said it is his objective to reduce those rates to 3 per cent.  They have mortgage rates of 8.5 per cent and 9 per cent while the rates here are excessive. If we want any evidence of our economic problems, such is immediately available in the prohibitive interest rates, <Col N="1753" /> deterring any potential employer from investing in jobs and farmers from investing in agricultural buildings.  Until we rectify the interest rates we shall continue to experience serious unemployment problems.  Neither the Taoiseach, nor Minister for Finance has referred, as did British Prime Minister, to any objective of reducing interest rates.  Rather than criticise other economies we should examine the defects within our own. Over a period of four months during the currency crisis we appeared to have an exaggerated perception of the importance of our role within Europe, to such an extent that the Government contributed to the excessive mortgage rate increase of 3 per cent and further job losses.  In relation to this budget the impetus intended to create jobs within the construction sector probably will not compensate for the loss of jobs during that currency crisis.  We all know of clothing companies that went to the wall, being unable to compete with those in the British economy.  This Government stands indicted on its procrastination in dealing with this issue, thereby creating many of our present problems.  It is understandable that budgetary measures are taken, to help out those people holding mortgages, paying prohibitive interest charges.  These people are in many cases the new poor of our society. We should remember that the Government created many of those people's problems.  The budgetary palliative will not in any way compensate them for their loss of income resulting from such high interest rates.</P>
    <P>I have observed enormous efforts by the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, and by the Minister of State at his Department, Deputy Fitzgerald, to justify the creation of his new office.  We all know that Deputy Spring is engaged in a giant-sized ego exercise in relation to the role of Tánaiste; he is endeavouring to assume responsibilities never intended for that position within our Constitution.  When viewed against the background of the Labour Party's preaching to us on ethics it demonstrates arrogance about ethics in Government on their part.  I do not see <Col N="1754" /> any reason this should not be described as a Coalition Government, as in the past.  Perhaps they are afraid of the taint of any coalition idea being attributed to their party.</P>
    <P>It is public knowledge that £831,000 is being expended on the Tánaiste's office. One might well ask why should it be publicised.  The answer is that there was no similar expenditure on that office in the past.</P>
    <P>In regard to the recruitment of business consultants, economists, legal draftspersons, I know from having participated in the Special Committee on the Finance Bill of last year, that a whole battery of people are deployed on the Finance Act. I am sure there are economists and accountants within the Department of Finance.  I wonder whether the Taoiseach intends moving existing personnel within that Department, or does he perceive the recruitment of outsiders as more jobs for the boys, more jobs for Labour supporters? When one thinks of a total of 135 jobs to date, at a cost of £3 million to the State, to support this Government one realises the degree of nepotism which is unparalleled in the history of the State. The main contributors are the Labour Party, who have not been slow in employing members of their own families.  As a Deputy, one is entitled to one secretary. I will have my secretary based down the country but, even though my daughter is looking for a job, I would not resort to the type of nepotism practised on such a wide scale by this Government.  With the enormous shortage of jobs within our economy, it is only right that other people be given opportunities.  This is the Tammany Hall style politics the Labour Party have brought to this Government.</P>
    <P>Were I to welcome one budgetary measure it would be the commitment to build 3,500 local authority houses.  I have been a councillor for the past eight years and have experienced enormous frustration in relation to long local authority housing waiting lists.  Why has there been such an increase in those waiting lists? Why is such frustration being experienced? During the four-year period between 1983 and 1987 approximately <Col N="1755" /> 11,500 local authority houses were built nationwide.  Since then the building of local authority houses has been put on the back burner.  In my own county 24 houses were built last year.  We have a waiting list of about 350.  We welcome the increase from 24 to 60, but I do not see it alleviating the backlog created. Nonetheless I welcome it, as a step in the right direction.  Hopefully we will accelerate the building of local authority houses in the future thereby creating jobs into our economy.</P>
    <P>I should like to have seen reconstruction grants reinstated even if in an amended way.  Restrictions were imposed to ensure that such grants were allocated to people who deserved to be housed.  Any rural Deputy knows of buildings around the country which have been vacated, in respect of which an extra £10,000 or £15,000 would do an excellent reconstruction job.  Many younger people cannot afford a mortgage.  A grant of £10,000 or £15,000 would give them a start in life; many of them are considered ineligible for local authority houses.</P>
    <P>I could not understand the Taoiseach's logic in justifying the increase of VAT on concrete blocks and poured concrete from 10 per cent to 21 per cent.  He maintained it would give legitimate builders an edge over rogue business people in the construction sector.  I could not understand that logic because it will contribute to increased housing prices.</P>
    <P>VAT increases which it is hoped will yield approximately £71 million have been imposed on newspapers and telecommunications. So much for the commitment to business people.  We observe many other charges which will lead to increased costs generally.  In the course of the present currency crisis many clothing and footwear companies went to the wall, especially clothing companies.  Now we see an increase in VAT on clothing and footwear.  Is the objective of that to create jobs?  I do not think so.</P>
    <P>The PAYE sector, the &ldquo;pain after you earn&rdquo;, people are now subjected to an extra penalty of a 1 per cent income levy. The Labour Party, as people who championed <Col N="1756" /> the working class and made a lot of play of their commitment to it in the last election, duped the public by their promises.  Regarding what they were going to do for the working man and as agents of change in Irish politics.  The Labour Party agree with a budget and with a prohibitive levy which will help to contribute further unemployment.  Many people are caught in the poverty trap. The differential between working and not working is balanced in favour of the unemployed.  People will ask why they should work in this environment which is so hostile to working.  The 1 per cent levy is a punitive levy.  It reminds me of the youth employment levy which was introduced in 1982.  It was introduced as a temporary measure, but ten years further on we still have that levy.  I have no doubt that it is the Government's intention to continue with this levy, which will have a destabilising effect on many people.</P>

      <P>I am concerned about county enterprise boards.  The objective of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company is to promote small industry and community development. Shannon Free Airport Development Company straddles three local authorities and one corporation and covers areas such as north Kerry and south Offaly.  The county enterprise boards have been criticised by councillors because they see them as a contradiction.  The Government is saying it wants to give more responsibilities to local authorities, yet local authorities are not strongly represented on these boards and within county councils these boards are seen as diminishing their role.  My concern relates to the functions of the county enterprise boards and the possible duplication of functions of Shannon Free Airport Development Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also concerned about the lack of commitment to group water schemes. <Col N="1757" /> Within the Estimates £2.5 million is devoted to group water schemes.  There is already an overrun on last year's capital allocation of £1.5 million.  Every rural Deputy knows the importance of group water schemes.  They generate jobs. Apart from Exchequer funding, there is a commitment on the part of the participants in group water schemes to provide some of their own funds.  We have roughly 87 group water schemes throughout the country, including ten in my own county, and I am continually asking if the funding will be provided.  The answer is almost always in the negative.  I waited with great patience for the Estimates to see if finance was provided and I am bitterly disappointed.  Out of that 87 group water schemes which are awaiting final approval and funding, 61 are entirely new schemes and the remaining 26 need an extra injection of cash.  What will happen to those 61 group water schemes?  The 87 water schemes cater for at least 4,000 members.  What hope do I have in relation to the group water schemes in my own county?  We expect one basic essential &mdash; good quality water. People have to put up with iron content in water and difficulties in relation to wells which become polluted and so on. What hope do I give them in relation to a water supply?  I can give very little, from what I see within this budget and in these Estimates.  I had hoped, when I saw the Cohesion Funding &mdash; this magical chunk of money which is due to materialise from the 1 April &mdash; that there might be some funding for providing this basic essential.  It is an area which the Government will have to address urgently.  I am sure they will be under pressure, not alone from Opposition Deputies but from their own Deputies in relation to group water schemes.  Last year the commitment was £2 million but this year it is only £1 million.  Something will have to be done.</P>
    <P>This budget is very bland.  Fianna Fáil had the difficulty of trying to accommodate Labour's wishes but they fell between two stools.  The reaction to this budget is one of disappointment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Finucane, for sharing his time with me.  We would all agree that the major problem is unemployment.  It is the source of many of our social ills, including the breakdown of law and order, marriage breakdown, the increase in delinquency, ill health and so forth. This budget will do little to create employment.  Indeed, many of its provisions will have a further negative effect on employment creation.  The increase in PRSI ceilings for both employers and employees and the increase in VAT on building material, tourism and telecommunications will have an adverse effect on employment creation.  The increase in VAT on newspapers, combined with the abolition of the cap on RTE advertising, could cost jobs in many of our provincial newspapers.</P>
      <P>The budget lacks coherent economic strategy.  It lacks the radical approach which the country is crying out for.  It lacks the promised imagination and creative content that we expected from the Labour input.  It reflects a lack of leadership and direction in Government.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the county enterprise boards seems to be the only response to a worsening jobs crisis.  The Minister provided £25 million in the budget to set up these new bureaucracies. This figure when divided will result in a figure of less than £1 million for each board.  When the administrative structures are established, there will be very little left for enterprise creation and the developments leading to increased employment that the Minister referred to in his budget speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in favour of the concept of enterprise boards.  However, I question the necessity for another layer of bureaucracy. It surely would have been possible to extend the present brief of the county development teams and to make them more representative of the areas they serve.  The Government and especially the Labour Party have lost the moral authority to ask people to make extra sacrifices, when they have feathered their own nests first.  They have given very lucrative positions to their families and <Col N="1759" /> friends as managers and special advisers. They have shot themselves in the foot and certainly this Coalition has lost its way already.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of £20 million for the reduction of hospital waiting lists for hip replacements, cataract operations, ENT operations and heart bypasses. Unless beds are made available in our hospitals, these extra procedures will not be carried out.  I would refer to the hidden agenda of this Government regarding health.  The announcement on the eve of the budget of a 20 per cent increase in the charge for entry to hospitals will certainly push up the costs of private and semi-private beds.  It will place a further burden on middle income taxpayers already hit by mortgage increases and with little relief on third level grants.  There are few concessions to the hard pressed PRSI sector in terms of third level grants.  The agricultural community is penalised to the extent of £20 million and the new 2 per cent inheritance tax will hit all farm families.  The tax on disability benefit is a penal tax on sickness.  These people are forced to leave jobs because of sickness.  This Government has lost its way and this budget reflects a lack of decision and direction.</P>

      <P>I wish to express my disgust at the treatment of some Members of this House yesterday.  I asked last Tuesday that a copy of the Minister's speech be made available to all Members of the House, not just to Ministers and Ministers of State or to former Ministers. I have yet to hear a proper explanation for this practice which has been followed in this House for some time.  Equality seems to be the buzz word around Leinster House recently but unfortunately it was forgotten yesterday.  I cannot understand why all Members are not treated in the same manner.  This is a ridiculous practice and one that must be changed for future years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year's budget has been presented a little later than usual due to the prolonged <Col N="1760" /> negotiations that took place in trying to form a Government.  On the night the Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, announced his Government I acknowledged the tremendous talent and potential among those selected but I said that if it was to work collective responsibility would be required not just in Cabinet but also among members of the Fianna Fáil and Labour parliamentary parties.  The previous Government was threatened on many occassions by a certain member of the smaller party who was not even a Member of the House at the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>In any coalition &mdash; I make no apology for calling it a coalition because it consists of two parties &mdash; there is bound to be tension and difficulties. Compromises have to be made on a regular basis.  Most parties tend to use their time in Opposition to formulate new policies, find faults with the Government performance and, more importantly, promise the electorate that they can do a better job.  As soon as a party gets into Government it becomes abundantly clear that all the promises that were made cannot be lived up to.  Responsibility becomes the order of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both Fianna Fáil and Labour faced serious difficulties in trying to put together their first budget.  While there is an acceptance among the members of the Government parliamentary parties that tough decisions are necessary, unfortunately it became very obvious from the early days of this Government that one Member in particular was not prepared to accept collective responsibility &mdash; I refer to Deputy Jim Kemmy.  Maybe he did not expect to be still wearing the track suit.  I say to the Deputy, even though he is not present, &ldquo;You ploughed a lone furrow for some time and maybe you are still adjusting to your new field&rdquo;.  This country needs a Government.  It is not interested in personal grievances and if Deputy Kemmy is so unhappy with recent events, perhaps he would like to move to greener pastures.  It is most <Col N="1761" /> unfortunate that this situation should arise, particularly in view of the commitment by both Fianna Fáil and Labour members to make the Government work.</P>
    <P>This budget was formulated in a very difficult period, just a few weeks after the currency devaluation at a time when the number of people unemployed has exceeded 300,000.  The Minister explained yesterday that he was trying to strike a careful balance.  On one hand he did not want to jeopardise the financial discipline we have achieved which is so vital for investment in the future and at the same time he had to stimulate the economy with a view to creating employment. More has been written in the run up to this budget than any other budget. Reports were published to the effect that this was going to be the toughest budget to date.  Major increases in taxation were predicted, and anyone who smokes or drinks will have had a few sleepless nights over the last week.  Despite the predictions and the major difficulties confronting the Minister he struck a good balance.  I am sure the majority of people were pleasantly surprised at the Minister's proposals.</P>
    <P>The improvements and changes in social welfare reflect the caring attitude of the Government.  An additional £8 million will be provided for people with a mental handicap.  This money will create extra residential and day care places and emergency and respite care.  The needs of people with a mental handicap and of those who look after them have never been fully appreciated or understood. For that reason the Minister's initiatives are very welcome.  They will provide much comfort and help to hundreds of very deserving cases throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal at some length with the changes in regard to tobacco products.  Yesterday the Minister announced a proposal to increase tax on cigarettes by 10p per packet of 20.  Last year tax on cigarettes was increased.  One reason that has been continually given for these increases relates to the health aspect.  The Government acknowledged this fact some years ago when an order <Col N="1762" /> was made making it compulsory for all packets of cigarettes to carry a Government health warning.  There has been great emphasis on health education, aimed particularly at young people, and legislation has been passed banning smoking in certain areas.  Collectively all of these changes and initiatives have created an awareness of the serious health hazards not just for smokers but for people who work and live in a smoking environment.</P>
    <P>Depite these efforts more and more young people are starting to smoke.  The time has come for the Government to make illegal the advertising of tobacco. The case against tobacco is easy to make. Statistics show that each year in Britain, 111,000 people die from smoking &mdash; 26,000 from lung cancer and 85,000 from other tobacco-related diseases.  Smoking is by far the greatest public health hazard facing this country.  Unlike other industries the tobacco industry faces a serious problem, with thousands of their customers dying each year and the industry must set about recuiting new smokers to take the place of those who have died. This campaign takes place by way of advertising.</P>
    <P>The majority of smokers begin the practice while in their teens and for that reason tobacco advertising is directed at young people.  As a result this is the only age group in which the number of smokers in Ireland is not falling.  A ban on tobacco advertising would be strenuously opposed by the industry.  In Britain more than £100 million is spent annually on tobacco advertising and the argument put forward is that they are simply promoting brand switching.  As everyone knows, it is impossible to persuade a person to change brands if you have not already persuaded them to start smoking.</P>
    <P>It would be a courageous move by the Government to ban tobacco advertising. This is something that must be done.  A ban has been imposed in many countries, with very positive results.  In New Zealand an advertising ban succeeded in reducing tobacco consumption by 7.5 per cent; in Canada the reduction was 6 per <Col N="1763" /> cent; in Finland, 7 per cent and in Norway, 8 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is often argued that a ban on tobacco advertising would result in a huge revenue loss to the Exchequer.  While it would not be difficult to calculate what the loss would be, it would be impossible to calculate the damage smoking causes to people's health and the cost to the Exchequer in paying for patients' hospitalisation due to tobacco-related illness. How many people are absent from their work place today due to tobacco-related illnesses and what is the cost to industry?  I am not in a position to give the answer but I am sure that the cost is enormous.  I emphasise that I do not want smoking to be banned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is getting ready for an international, I hope he is not smoking.  People must choose for themselves whether they want to smoke, but it must be recognised that in some cases the public interest is more important than freedom of choice.</P>
      <P>This country has a long history of smoking.  For that reason it has become very difficult to change people's thinking. I venture to say that if cigarettes were invented today, it is likely their production and sale would be banned.  I repeat that I am not suggesting that smoking should be banned.  This is a freedom of choice issue: to do good or evil, that is the question.  Can anyone say that tobacco advertising is in the best interests of our people?</P>
      <P>Tobacco is a most peculiar product. Even when it is used in moderation it kills.  It kills and damages the health of not just the person who uses it but also those who live and work in a smoke filled environment.  These stark realities cannot be ignored and I demand an immediate response from the Government. I call on the Minister to bring forward the necessary legislation to ban tobacco advertising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much debate during <Col N="1764" /> the last 24 hours as to whether this budget is pro-jobs.  I listened to the contributions of a number of Opposition speakers yesterday and again this morning.  While I did not expect them to throw bouquets over to this side of the House, I did expect them to offer some constructive criticism. In the majority of cases speakers were very selective.  We all realise the problems and the difficulties politicians face and that they lack credibility with the public, but we can change that.  I admit we did the same when in Opposition but I would like to see Members on all sides of the House adopt a different approach&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy said that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;whereby they would offer constructive criticism rather than make negative contributions which are difficult to listen to.  This would require maturity on the part of politicians but it is necessary that we see such a change in this House.  When we talk about reform we should look at ourselves first.</P>
      <P>The increase in capital spending will provide a major boost to the economy and in particular to the construction industry which everyone recognises has been on its knees for some time.  We need a vibrant construction industry if we are to reduce the unemployment figures. When the agriculture and construction industries are booming the rest of the country also seems to prosper.  I am delighted that emphasis is being placed on the need to create a vibrant construction industry and to give it a helping hand that has been missing for various reasons over the last few years.</P>
      <P>The Government, which has only been in office for a few weeks, acknowledges that it faces a major task in curtailing unemployment.  The proposals made and the initiatives announced yesterday will have a beneficial effect in the not too distance future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For home owners the increase in interest rates was a major blow which has swallowed up their disposal income. Indeed many have been unable to meet <Col N="1765" /> the increase.  A reduction in interest rates would be of help in increasing employment. The financial discipline the Minister adhered to in the budget should make that a reality in the not too distant future.  In relation to mortgage interest relief, the commitment made prior to the budget has not been honoured in full but the Government has adopted a caring approach and accepts that many families are experiencing difficulties and hardship. It has made a serious attempt to rectify the matter.</P>
    <P>I want to comment briefly on the banks.  During the past six to 12 months many small businesses which had been thriving, which have succeeded in employing thousands of workers and which we take for granted, have found the going tough due to circumstances outside their control.  Unfortunately, the banks have not been willing to facilitate them during this difficult period.  They are not giving them the money they need. I regard this problem as being short term but unless they are offered assistance to cushion the blow many of these businesses will find themselves in serious trouble due to the increase in interest rates.  I call on the banks to adopt a more caring and compassionate approach in dealing with small businesses.</P>
    <P>A committee on employment has been set up to consider policies that would lead to a reduction in unemployment.  Over 300,000 people are unemployed at present.  This is a marvellous resource but we are paying people to do nothing. Unlike others, I have no difficulty in accepting that the majority of the unemployed want to work and there is much work to be done.  We must devise schemes in the near future to create jobs for these people so that they will have a reason to get out of bed in the morning. This would provide the country with a tremendous boost and I do not think it would be impossible to devise such schemes.  I would like to see the new Minister for Enterprise and Employment bring forward proposals in that regard because it is unacceptable in such a small nation that there are 300,000 people unemployed.  As I said, this is our greatest <Col N="1766" /> resource.  We must channel their energy and talents to give them back their pride and a reason to get up in the morning.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the carer's allowance from £53 to £59.  While the allowance is a recognition of the tremendous work being carried out by carers at home, the conditions attached make it impossible for many deserving people to qualify for it.  The conditions should be broadened to allow more people to take up that allowance.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his second budget.  It was expected by many political commentators to be the toughest budget to come before the House.  When the Minister presented his first budget he was under different pressures at that time for various reasons.  He had more time to put his budget together on this occasion and did a good job.  We have heard much criticism from the Opposition benches, but this Government is in place only a few weeks.  It deserves a chance.  It is in the interests of the country that we have a good Government to pursue the proper policies.  I ask the Opposition to judge the Government by its performance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is somewhat ironic, after a budget which is purporting to be a pro-jobs budget, that this is our blackest and one of the most devastating days, in terms of job losses, with the announcement by Digital in Galway this morning.  People should bear in mind that while we speak of 800 jobs there, the value of those jobs is more than double the value of the average job that could be lost.  People have lost their incomes and the disposable income which went into the local economy in Galway will be lost with a far greater impact than stacking up the value of a number of individual average industrial jobs.  Digital was one of our flagship companies with a tremendously committed workforce.  Because of their productivity and ability they earned a very high income.  The trauma that will occur as a result of lost income to those people and their families will be great over the coming months.  There is a question as to the impact on mortgages, homes, and the <Col N="1767" /> future for their children.  That is very serious, not to mention the loss of the manufacturing end, and there is a question mark over the existence of the ancillary service industries, the small industries in the Gaeltacht areas and centred around Galway that were dependent upon Digital.</P>
      <P>We know that the cost structures in that plant were excellent.  We know that industrial relations were excellent, even to the extent that the workforce offered to take wage cuts.  We know that their productivity was excellent.  We know that production capacity was way ahead of the Ayr plant and was far more sophisticated and modern than the Ayr plant.  I would surmise that all of these factors would negate any extra transport cost that would be incurred in moving goods from this country to the UK.</P>
      <P>What was the other reason this decision was taken?  One can only look to very serious political interference in the decision-making process of this company, pressurised by the British Government at the highest level.  For me, somebody who has always been a committed European, what happened in Digital tears up the underlying unifying force of Europe, which was to strengthen the regions of Europe so that Europe can be a truly unified single economic entity. That concept has been torn up by a more powerful economy than the Irish economy. That poses very serious questions for the continuing development of Europe in a cohesive way.  Regional strengthening and EC cohesion has been undermined by what has happened.  It behoves the Taoiseach at the next Heads of Government meeting to bring to the table as a matter of urgency the question with which we are now faced in the country of creating a balanced single market in Europe which takes special regard of the need to strengthen the regions.  That must be done and I urge the Taoiseach to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we heard of the prospects of the Labour and Fianna Fáil parties forming a Government in the latter part of 1992, the words which kept recurring on all <Col N="1768" /> occasions were, &ldquo;This will be a radical Government, particularly in tackling the national jobs crisis.&rdquo;  That was the consistent message.  Because of the message one made allowances for what I could only call the elephantine gestation period before the Government's ultimate formation. What have we got?  They have been radical in what they have said because they have disregarded Telesis, Culliton, NESC, and every independent commentator over the last decade as to what it will take to create jobs.  Last evening the Taoiseach said that he did not understand the efforts of the last few years.  He did not adhere to the policy of tax reduction and incentives for people to go back to work and in particular the policy of creating an environment where productivity could be enhanced, coupled with the ability to earn more income, thereby engendering more disposable income which could be spent in the local and national economy and create jobs. This has all been torn up, and ignored by this Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said that the budget is framed on the principle that the over-riding national priority is jobs.  I could not agree more.  He said that we have to do whatever is required to raise the pace of sustainable employment growth, both short term and long term. I agree with that.  He also said that we have to have policies that promote and underpin genuine economic progress and that those of us who have jobs must put the need to create jobs above our personal interests.  He goes on to say that there is no greater inequity than joblessness.</P>
    <P>The budget speech yesterday began on a very interesting note.  The Minister could have effectively left the House after the initial part of his speech, because he had nothing else to contribute to create an environment whereby jobs would be created and existing jobs sustained and enhanced.  What we got was a contribution by the Minister for Finance to ensuring that existing jobs will be under threat and the prospects for creating new jobs have been further diminished.  It is an interesting paradox that the Minister <Col N="1769" /> expects GDP growth to be of the order of 2.5 per cent this year.  The Minister is over optimistic because his budget strategy was not consistent with bringing about that sort of growth in the domestic economy this year.  That figure is over optimistic when considered in parallel with the policies the Minister enunciated yesterday.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 170 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December 1992, the EC Commission decided to exclude carcases in excess of 340 kg from intervention with effect from 1 January 1993.  Following opposition by Ireland and other member states, the commission decided to postpone the operative date to 1 March 1993. I met the new Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development on 8 January 1993 and impressed upon him the special difficulties such a weight limit would have on the Irish beef sector.  On 15 January 1993, the Commission proposed a modification of their previous <Col N="1770" /> decision which would phase in the 340 kg weight limit as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash; a limit of 380 kg on 1 July 1993</P>
    <P>&mdash;a limit of 360 kg on 1 January 1994</P>
    <P>&mdash;a limit of 340 kg on 1 July 1994</P>
    <P>Based on intervention in-take in 1992, a limit of 340 kg would exclude from intervention over 60 per cent of Irish steers at present eligible for intervention.</P>
    <P>I am maintaining my strenuous opposition to the weight limitation and am seeking to have the measure replaced by one which could achieve the objective of reducing intervention in-take in accordance with the Council's decision of June 1992 in a manner that would be equitable as between member states.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that for the next three years, given the breeds of cattle already on farms, the minimum carcase weight for cattle, will be 400 kg as a minimum?  Would the Minister give a commitment to this House that at the next Council of Ministers meeting he will make every effort to ensure that a weight limit of 400 kg will be kept in place for the next three years, so that if we are to have a change in breeding patterns it will be given some time to have an effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what Deputy Yates said in relation to the weight limit of 400 kg.  Since 1988, the breeding programmes of AI stations and breeders generally have gone substantially for continental breeds and a weight limitation of less than 400 kg would impact disproportionately on Ireland.  Deputy Yates and the House can have my undertaking that I will seek to protect the best interests of the Irish beef industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that when the milk quota was introduced in 1984, it was part of the textual agreement that if there was any additional milk quota Ireland would get it?  How can the Minister explain, when Ireland has had a 12.5 per cent cut in its milk quota since 1984, that it now looks likely that the Italians will get an extra 200 million gallons? Will the Minister oppose this and explain how the Italian Minister seems in line to get something but we cannot when we are facing a super levy bill this year of perhaps £17 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the Protocol in 1983 when we got our original base quota.  I have quoted it several times in the past year, at both Council of Ministers meetings and at bilateral meetings. It appears that unless one gets the actual regulation of any addendum or Protocol it has no legal effect.  At the same time there is a moral obligation to appreciate that the dairy industry is a vital part of our agricultural and overall economy in Ireland.  I want to make it clear that there will be no question of agreeing to any resolution of the Italian milk quota problem without ensuring that Italy pays up for ignoring the milk quota since it was introduced and that they will reduce their <Col N="1772" /> milk production.  It would be quite unfair to expect the Irish industry to allow a member state that flouted the rules of the quota regime to get off scot free while we who have been adhering to the rules have been penalised as a result.  The question of the Italian milk quota is up for consideration and with that a whole lot of matters relating to the milk regime, including the 4.5 per cent suspended quota, the proposed 1 per cent cut in quota this year, and a restructuring scheme for small farmers.  All that will have to be taken together in any consideration of the Italian question.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not see the developments in relation to Spain and Italy as an ideal opportunity to get this proposed permanent cessation of this 4.5 per cent of the national quota reflected differently for Ireland because of our unique dependence on this section?  The sop to Italy and Spain will, in my view, be agreed.  Will the Minister make a special case that this 4.5 per cent would not go ahead for Ireland?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 196 together.</P>
      <P>The national base area, for the purpose of compensatory payments under the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, is the average of the areas under cereals, oilseeds, protein crops and the set-aside in 1989, 1990 and 1991.  The national cereals area determined by the 1991 census of agriculture, carried out by the CSO, was 301,500 hectares (740,000 acres).</P>
      <P>The CSO census was conducted in accordance with the Statistics (Census of Agriculture) Order 1991 (S.I. No. 126 of 1991).  The full implications of the census figures for the national base area will not be known until adjusted figures for 1989 and 1990 are submitted by the CSO to EUROSTAT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Has there been an underestimation of about 30,000 hectares in determining the national base area and, if so, could the Minister tell the House what the cost to Irish farmers of that mistake will be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In July-August 1992 Ireland, together with other member states, submitted data to the Commission concerning base areas.  This data, as required by regulation, is based on historical information submitted by the CSO to the European Statistics Office.  In respect of 1991, the figure included in the base area for cereals was 333,300 hectares.  In June 1991 the CSO carried out a full agricultural census for the period since 1980.  The preliminary results of this census were published on 18 December 1992.  The statistics showed that the base area for cereals was 301,500 hectares, as against 333,300 in the original submission.  This represented a drop of 10.5 per cent of the previous estimate for 1991, which was based on the June enumeration sample for that year.  I wish <Col N="1774" /> to point out that the CSO is obliged to furnish EUROSTAT with the revised figures in respect of the cereals area and it may have to revise the figures submitted for previous years, including 1989 and 1990 which are also used to calculate the base area.  The full implications of the census figures for the national base area will not, therefore, be known until the adjusted figures for the three years 1989, 1990 and 1991 are submitted to EUROSTAT.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an extremely serious development.  We have lost, overnight, 10.5 per cent of our base area, and this could penalise cereal farmers.  I am aware of this possibility and I have been in contact with the cereals section in the Department.  We are engaged in discussions with the European Commission about the matter.  I will do everything possible to ensure that Irish cereal farmers are not penalised because of what seems to be an error in the figure.  No definite decision can be taken until the average for the three years is made known to EUROSTAT.</P>

Will the Minister confirm that what is basically proposed here is a price freeze and that this is particularly unacceptable for the sheep and pigmeat sectors which, despite the general increase in incomes, have experienced a severe drop in incomes in 1992?  Will the Minister clarify the position in relation to pigmeat?  I have seen reports which state that the Commission is proposing a 25 per cent cut in the base price for pigmeat at a time when prices are at their lowest level for 12 years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We have only been presented with proposals at this stage, and they are at the preliminary discussion level, the first stage.  I will be using the price negotiations to rectify a number of matters of concern to Ireland.  We have already spoken about beef and the intervention weight limitation.  Deputy Yates <Col N="1776" /> referred specifically to the position in regard to sheepmeat, about which I have been made aware over the last number of months.  I have sought to improve the situation somewhat and an additional £56 million will be sent out to sheep farmers during the next few weeks.  I will be using the occasion of the Council of Ministers' meeting to highlight the fact that prices in the European Community have not converged and that we are being unduly penalised as a member state.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates also referred to pigmeat. A reduction of approximately 25 per cent in the base price of pigmeat is proposed. I will be seeking a modification of that figure because even though the market for pigmeat was good during the earlier part of last year it became quite depressed towards the end of the year; a very poor year for pigmeat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to have special regard to the sheep and pigmeat sectors because the overall income figures mask the fact that those sectors are going through an exceptionally difficult period.  As I understand it, last year farmers made a profit of £8 per pig but are now incurring a loss of £7 per pig.  These proposals on the guide price for sheep and the base price for pigmeat are unacceptable. Will the Minister bring that view forward on behalf of Irish producers at the appropriate Council of Minister's meeting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  With regard to pigmeat, we have modernised the processing end of the industry and the marketing aspect has been taken up by CBF. Towards the end of last year, producers suffered a drop in price.  As the Deputy said, producers lost approximately £8 on each pig.  I will take that very much into consideration.  Last year was a difficult year for sheep farmers but, unlike pig farmers, they got very substantial headage and premia payments.  In the full year, 50,000 sheep farmers got £152 million in direct payments, which is not an insubstantial amount of direct aid. Indeed, if other sectors or Departments got that kind of annual payment they <Col N="1777" /> would consider themselves to be quite well off.  I have contacted CBF, who have opened up valuable markets in Spain and Portugal.  I hope that not only will the income from headage and premia be maintained for the year, but that the market for sheep will improve.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 24, 43, 59, 218 and 219 together.</P>
      <P>I am at present reviewing in a comprehensive way the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958.  As part of that review I am also considering the question of hare coursing.  I would hope to have proposals for Government arising out of that review at an early date.  In making those proposals I will have regard to the many suggestions made here and by various interested bodies and, of course, to trade and tourism considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1779" /> I have received somewhat in excess of 2,000 representations, mostly from the USA, either directly or indirectly within the past 12 months.  The contents of this mail has been noted and the points raised will also be taken into account as part of the review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that hare coursing is a barbaric and cruel activity and would he acknowledge that the overwhelming majority of people would like to see live hare coursing banned?  Would he agree also that the recent hare coursing meeting in Cloonana which resulted in 51 hares being torn to shreds and killed was a particularly horrific example of an activity that is unacceptable?  Will the Minister indicate whether he agrees with the views expressed by Deputy Kemmy and others that it is a sickening sport and that it should be banned?  Is it his intention under the new legislation once and for all to ban hare coursing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of points arising from Deputy Shatter's question.  First, I want to declare my interests.  I follow a number of sports both here and in other countries but I am not a follower of here coursing.  I have to listen to all sides of the case regarding hare coursing and while the Department received more than 2,000 representations from outside the country in relation to hare coursing, we got less than 50 from within Ireland in relation to the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I stated that I am not a follower of hare coursing. The Cloonana and Clonmel incidents were a disgrace and totally unacceptable. Nobody, whether they are for or against hare coursing, could justify the slaughter of that number of hares at two coursing meetings.  I would condemn that in a most forthright manner.  An assistant secretary in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry chairs a group of people representing the Department, Bord na gCon and the industry generally who will report to me in the near future.  Having considered all the matters raised here the representations made to the Department and, in particular, the recommendations of that group, I will submit a proposal to Government.</P>

The Greyhound <Col N="1781" /> Industry Act, 1958, the Protection of Animals Acts, 1911 and 1965, and the Wildlife Act, 1976, would have to be considered in relation to this matter.  On receipt of a report from the group investigating the matter I will submit proposals to the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's sympathetic comments.  I hope he follows through on what he has said.  If the Minister accepts that live hare coursing inflicts extreme suffering on timid and defenceless animals and that there can be no justification whatever for such cruelty, will he accept that it is time to stop this cruelty?  In view of what he said about the weekend meeting at Cloonana where 51 hares died, will he prevent any further unacceptable suffering by suspending all further coursing meetings pending the review which he has announced?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made my views known on what happened at the two meetings.  In relation to coursing generally, I do not know if it is true that 81 per cent of the people want to terminate it because a substantial number of people in rural Ireland go coursing and enjoy this type of activity.</P>

      <P>I am concerned about the greyhound industry.  Most of our greyhound tracks are losing money, attendance levels are decreasing, as is the value of the greyhound industry for tourism.  Even the export of greyhounds is in a shambles. Part of the industry needs reform and can be recovered.  I am examining the entire industry, which badly needs a shake up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the report to which he refers makes it clear that the greyhound industry is in no way dependent on the continuation of coursing meetings?  It was suggested that there is an interdependence, but there is not.  Will the Minister agree that there is not?  Will he indicate if he agrees that what took place at Cloonana and Clonmel is unacceptable?  Will he indicate whether an investigation into those two things is taking place either in his Department or the Office of Public Works with a view to instituting prosecutions against those responsible under the Wildlife Act? Previous investigations of meetings where a large number of hares were killed established that the hares were coursed contrary to statutory regulations in force. Will the Minister indicate what action the Government has taken with regard to the unacceptable number of hares killed at those meetings?  Finally, is the Minister aware that a survey carried out by an independent body some years ago showed that 81 per cent of people favoured banning hare coursing?  Will he agree that hare coursing is just as cruel a sport as badger baiting, which is now outlawed?</P>

Bord na gCon have advised that the executive committee of the Irish Coursing Club has initiated a wideranging and urgent fullscale inquiry into all aspects of the running of the meeting in question by the County Limerick Coursing Club.  This investigation has already commenced and will extend to the summoning of the committee and officers of the club before the Irish Coursing Club.  The Irish Coursing Club has confirmed that its inquiry will address such issues as the causes of the high mortality rate; whether the advertised programme of events should have been curtailed in the circumstances; the care, management, feeding, training and husbandry of the hare stock; the precoursing veterinary attention to the hare stock; to what extent, if any, the rules of the Irish Coursing Club and the licence held by it were breached, and whether major changes are required in the structure of the County Limerick Coursing Club as administrators of future Irish Cup meetings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 45, 129, 143 and 145 together.</P>
      <P>The first thing that must be said is that there has been no GATT agreement yet. The agriculture deal referred to is a draft deal negotiated between the Commission and the US negotiators.  It has still to be accepted by the Council of Ministers, the US Congress and the other parties in the GATT.  There are 14 other topics in the overall GATT negotiations some of which, for example services and market access, are proving equally difficult to finalise.  The question of acceptance or rejection of a GATT deal will not arise therefore until an overall agreement covering all sector areas has been finalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has carried out a preliminary analysis of the proposed deal on agriculture having regard to the Commission assessment of its compatibility with Common Agricultural Policy reform.  However, there was a clear need <Col N="1786" /> for the Commission to provide a more detailed explanation of the agreement and to have it evaluated at Community level.  Accordingly, I sought and obtained a commitment at the Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting in January that the deal would be fully evaluated by the Special Agriculture Committee, so as to ascertain its compatibility with the reformed Common Agricultural Policy.  This evaluation has now been embarked on and a report will be made to the Council in due course.</P>
    <P>My initial analysis of the draft agreement is that, while it contains improvements in relation to the Dunkel framework &mdash; for example the exemption of Common Agricultural Policy reform and disadvantaged areas payments from GATT restrictions &mdash; there are other areas where I believe the undertakings proposed would require the Community to go beyond that which would flow automatically from the Common Agricultural Policy reform decisions of last May.  I am particularly concerned that the proposed 21 per cent volume reduction on subsidised exports which, when taken together with market access arrangements, could result in the Community having to reduce its beef exports well beyond what the Common Agricultural Policy reform measures would have required.  Similar problems, but to a lesser degree, would also arise in the dairy sector particularly in relation to cheese exports and in the whitemeat sector.  The problem is exacerbated by the requirement that exports would have to fall back to the average of 1986-88 exports in the first year of implementation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness to the Minister, we had a lengthy debate last week in Private Members' time on this.  Matters are to be deferred until after the French general election.  Following that, will the Commission come forward with a deal more or less as it is now?  In view of the threat to the beef sector and the dairy sector, would the Minister be prepared to use the veto to protect our vital national interests?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1787" />
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>If the proposals remain in their present form, yes, but I do not expect them to do so.  They are only in draft form at present.  My energy will be used to obtain modifications and to ensure that the final deal which has to be approved by the Council of Ministers will be compatible with the Common Agricultural Policy reforms.  I have said repeatedly both in this House and in the Council of Ministers that the proposals as they stand are incompatible with the Common Agricultural Policy reform and are unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that the Commission, on behalf of the EC, has already submitted to Geneva the very figures that constitute the basis for the fears in all of these questions? Would the Minister not accept that he is fighting a rearguard action and that it will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to change things?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The schedules have been submitted to Geneva, as pointed out by Deputy Cox.  The fact remains that the Council of Ministers has to agree and formally sanction this agreement ultimately. Between now and the finalisation of the agreement the additional time will give us an opportunity to bring about the modifications.  The situation as it exists at present would be, to put it starkly, devastating for much of our industry, particularly when the implications would take place early on in the agreement. The present position is that the Irish will strongly disagree with the draft agreement as it stands and we will use every opportunity to tailor it to suit Irish conditions. We have a fair amount of support for our position within the Council of Ministers, notably from the French.  We are working in tandem on this matter and I expect we will be able to bring about the necessary modifications to suit our system here.</P>

      <P>During the GATT negotiations did the question of the prohibition of New Zealand lamb entering the EC arise?  If not, why, because our <Col N="1788" /> lamb trade is being destroyed by massive imports of New Zealand lamb into the EC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that matter arose on a number of occasions.  We always highlighted it, especially last year when our lamb trade was going through such a difficult time.  It was galling to find competition in the European marketplace from a non-Community country but we were constantly reminded of the existing agreements which had to be adhered to.  At the same time we pointed out the anomalies of a member state going through a difficult time in a sector which was aggravated by substantial imports of New Zealand lamb.  We will continue to highlight this matter and will seek to improve it in any review of existing agreements.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that it is necessary in any GATT agreement to obtain a guarantee from the Americans, New Zealanders and Eastern Europeans that they would also accept a quota regime in relation to milk?  Without casting any aspersions on the Minister &mdash; I accept he is doing his best &mdash; I urge the Taoiseach to consult his European partners to ensure the GATT agreement is fought tooth and nail as it is vital to our national interest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no point in introducing discipline in production and supply control in Europe if other parties to an agreement throughout the world can increase their production.  There must be discipline in the area internationally. We are aware that New Zealanders, Australians and Americans are increasing production.  At the same time we must appreciate that a trade agreement is needed.  It is very important for us to have trading partners who have a benign attitude to Ireland.  Deputies will recall the difficulty in regard to the oil seed dispute last year when many representations were received from the dairy industry in relation to casein and cream liqueurs.  Fighting the GATT agreement <i>per se</i> is not enough.  If the Americans <Col N="1789" /> decided to retaliate it would affect Ireland more than most countries as we have an open economy.  There are two sides to this story.  We want to get a balance, a global and fair agreement that would not have a detrimental effect on any sector of our economy and which it would allow us to trade in Europe and internationally.  Any sacrifices by Irish producers &mdash; or indeed those in any member state &mdash; should also be made by other parties to the GATT agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 12, 15, 23, 26, 30, 33, 39, 47, 51, 131, 153, 154, 178 and 202 together.</P>
      <P>The Disadvantaged Areas Appeals Panel is carrying out a detailed analysis of data from the survey of 10,000 townlands in Leinster and Munster which appealed their non-inclusion in the disadvantaged areas.  When the panel has completed its analysis it will make recommendations to my Department on the townlands under appeal.  On the basis of the panel's recommendations the Department will prepare a formal submission to the EC Commission who will make the final decision on the areas to be proposed for ratification by the Council of Ministers.  It is important to note that details of the proposed areas are confidential to the appeals panel and my Department and results of the appeals will not be released until the final decision is made in Brussels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the size and complexity of the task it is not possible to predict when it will be completed and, while it is in everyone's interest to have the job done quickly, it is equally important that the panel should carry out a thorough analysis as a prerequisite to having acceptable recommendations for submission to the Commission in Brussels for ratification. There will be no delay in finalising the issue here and, when the submission is <Col N="1794" /> ratified, there will be no undue delay in making payments available to farmers in successful areas.</P>
    <P>When the analysis of areas seeking inclusion is completed, the panel will turn its attention to examining the areas seeking reclassification including all remaining areas of Cavan and Monaghan which were raised in specific questions and are under appeal.  The review of the criteria for reclassification has been the subject of recent negotiations between my Department and the farming organisations, and I expect a reasonably early positive decision on this matter.  The results of the departmental review will, of course, be notified without delay to the appeals panel.</P>
    <P>The costs incurred by the disadvantaged areas appeals panel from its commencement in June 1991 to date amount to £330,000.  The bulk of the cost is attributable to the survey of 40,000 farms early last year.  Fixed costs, such as the salaries of the 200 departmental inspectors involved in the survey and permanent office staff, are not included in the figure; £151,000 has been allocated to the panel in respect of 1993.</P>
    <P>The disadvantaged areas scheme is designed to operate on fixed boundaries drawn on the objective basis of the smallest permanent administrative unit, the townland.  The present appeals arrangement is, necessarily, being operated in that context.  The Programme for Government does, however, commit us, in the light of the outcome of the GATT negotiations, to review the income support effects of EC structural measures for agriculture and to pursue with the Commission necessary improvements.  In that context the question of a disadvantaged farms programme will be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal for a third category is in its very early stages of development.  The question of which areas should be included, including County Mayo, is being considered.  In this regard discussions are taking place <Col N="1795" /> between my Department, the EC Commission and the farming organisations with a view to defining boundaries. Decisions, on the level of payments, will be taken following the reorganisation of the scheme resulting from the work of the appeals panel and the resolution of the third category issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the time scale involved, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that an intensive and indepth analysis had to be carried out of all the farms concerned.  Ten thousand townlands were surveyed, which would give Deputies some idea of the numbers of farmers involved.</P>
      <P>The time scale specified by the Minister in relation to the field work was adhered to.  While the task of processing the applications, when submitted to the Department, proved far more difficult than expected, nonetheless, this work was expedited and the appeals panel are now considering the matter.  I am satisfied that they will quickly reach a conclusion. While it is difficult to specify a time scale every possible effort is being made to expedite the appeals decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked exactly when all of Cavan-Monaghan will be included, and I take it that a field survey has not been carried out in the area.  The main problem is the 40 per cent income limit which should be raised to 70 per cent.  It is absolutely essential that this is done.  It is difficult to understand the <Col N="1796" /> reason all of Cavan-Monaghan has not been declared handicapped given that all of Longford-Roscommon has been included.  Because some of the poorer parts of Cavan-Monaghan have already been included the average income figure has been raised in the remaining parts. When will this matter be dealt with?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister of State would show us the figures which resulted in Longford-Roscommon being included because it is very difficult for us to understand how parts of Longford-Roscommon could be included while vast areas of Cavan-Monaghan, such as Seeall Mountain and my own parish of Aghabog, have not.</P>

      <P>Sixty-three per cent of the total land area of County Cavan, or 119,000 hectares, is classed as severely handicapped.  This compares with a figure of 39 per cent prior to the last review. Forty-three per cent of the total land area of County Monaghan, or 56,000 hectares is classed as severely handicapped and represents an increase of 23 per cent.  I am sure the Deputy would agree that it would be sensible to dispose of the appeals first and then move on to review the criteria and the question of disadvantaged farms.</P>

Would the Minister of State give a commitment here today to raise family farm income limit from 40 per cent of the national family farm income figure to at least 70 per cent? Would he also give a commitment to raise the limit in regard to the number of people engaged in agriculture in a townland from 40 per cent to 70 per cent and to include part-time farmers as part of the farming population?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is our goal to ensure that the maximum number of areas are designated under existing regulations and it is for that reason we are using townlands for the purposes of classification. As the Minister has already indicated, we are prepared to extend the criteria to include individual disadvantaged farms. I am satisfied that the appeals board will examine the question posed by the Deputy to maximise the benefit to be gained under the scheme.  The Deputy <Col N="1798" /> can be assured that the appeals board will endeavour to achieve the best possible result.</P>

Would he further agree that his credibility on this matter has been eroded given that not one penny has been provided in the Estimates, not to mention the third category of extremely disadvantaged areas?

      <P>To date, the redesignation process has demonstrated that there is a distinction drawn between disadvantaged farms and disadvantaged areas.  There have been adequate surveys and figures available to demonstrate clearly it is time disadvantaged farms were taken into account; I stress that the evidence exists.  In my constituency the extensions were effected by drawing lines with a pencil, extending existing areas instead of moving into the centre of the county where we had undertaken our own surveys, which proved that the only fair and equitable method or criteria on which to rely would be a farm survey rather than an extension of townlands, as has been done to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 56 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The deseasonalisation slaughter premium which was negotiated as part of the Common Agricultural Policy reform agreement is designed to encourage a more even slaughtering pattern throughout the year, which is essential for marketing purposes.  The premium is payable on eligible animals slaughtered in Ireland in the period 1 January to 30 April 1993. It is not payable on animals exported live. However, the EC Commission recently increased the export refunds payable on <Col N="1802" /> live exports to certain Third Country destinations until 30 April 1993.</P>
    <P>My overall objective is to ensure fair competition so that a proper balance is struck between providing producers with reasonable returns and providing processors with the supplies they need to sustain and develop trade in value-added products.  The improvement in the structure of the beef processing industry to ensure that as much as possible of its value-added production takes place in Ireland is an important policy aim.  I am satisfied that adequate supplies are available to meet our present processing needs.  However, I am monitoring developments closely to ensure that there are no trade distortions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that there is a gross anomaly in relation to the export refund scheme under which producers are encouraged to export animals live rather than having them processed at home?  He stated that there is a policy aim in relation to processing at home which forms part of the Joint Programme for Government. Nothing in his reply indicates how he intends to proceed to ensure that that happens.  Is the Minister also aware that serious concern has been expressed by IBEC that the IDA policy in relation to this overall matter is also very specific? Is he aware that there are expressions of grave concern in relation to job creation? How does he intend to realise the aim which, obviously, he supports?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>At present there is an expert group sitting within my Department considering this matter, which is to report within the next month or two, advancing a proposal for the expansion of the food processing industry disseminated from the Culliton report on through the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> agreement.  When that report is available it will be referred to the social partners.  However, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has already stated &mdash; and I reiterate that assurance &mdash; that it will not be delayed in the Department.  Obviously, <Col N="1803" /> the optimum aim is that no beast leaves the country without going to a factory to be processed, and that we benefit from the added-value and the job creation arising therefrom.  The present dilemma is reflected in the two questions which have been tabled.  Deputy Yates's question relates to the premium being extended to cattle which go outside the Community whereas Deputy McManus dealt with the retention of sufficient stocks.  There is no problem in terms of supply, we are continuing to monitor the position to ensure supply and, at the same time, a proper return to producers.  At the end of the day our aim is to encourage competition in the market, ensuring returns for producers, but having as much processing as possible of our national herd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that while, superficially, IBEC and Deputy McManus have a point about maximising jobs, if one looks at the position, one will observe that the only buoyancy in cattle and beef prices has been as a result of the reintroduction of live exports?  Beef processors said, when MCAs were to be abolished, there would be a cut of 12p a pound in beef, this reduction did not materialise not because MCAs were not abolished &mdash; they were &mdash; but because of live exports.  Will the Minister of State agree that it is essential that farmers, producers, and all the economic spending they generate, means they are entitled to a fair return on their beef and that the best method of ensuring this is to have some level of decent export refunds such as is now in place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Yates that it is vital for the producers to get a proper return.  Indeed the fact that live exports are taking place once again shows us clearly the value of competition.  The Deputy will appreciate the dilemma to which I referred earlier that we have to get the balance right.  When there is distortion of trade the Department and the Minister must move at Community level to have it put right.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that if the gap between the subsidy for live cattle and slaughtered animals is to be narrowed the subsidy on live exports should be reduced?  Will the Minister further agree that it is only when we have a good live export trade that our factories see fit to give farmers a decent price for their animals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Current comparison figures would be £53 at the factory and £38 on export refunds.  Obviously &mdash; I reiterate this &mdash; we must cater for the producer.  In the context of the producer, competition is very important.  On the other hand, we must ensure that every development is made in the food processing industry and that there is a resultant increase in employment, something to which all Members in this House are committed.  In the context of the expert group report which is due, we hope to make strides in that regard this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>While acknowledging the agreed need for competition between the live export trade and the factories, will the Minister agree that millions of pounds have been given by way of grants to meat factories but that instead of real added value all that has happened to date &mdash; with few exceptions &mdash; is that the workers cut the heads and tails off the animals, freeze them and export them in their raw state?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, we seek to have the highest level of added value applied to the industry.  Since I became Minister of State in the Department it has become clear that we must aim for upmarket goods and sophistication in terms of products.  The Government is concerned to do everything possible to ensure that &mdash; as I said in an earlier reply &mdash; we get the maximum number of jobs from the food processing industry and, with particular reference to this question, from the beef processing industry.</P>

Will he guarantee that, in relation to this report and whatever procedure takes place after that, the full potential for job creation will be realised in the whole field of agriculture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The present position seems to indicate that the live cattle export trade has orders for 80,000 animals. At present, there is a sufficient supply to the existing meat processing factories and we do not have the problem to which the Deputy alludes.  On the other hand we have to broaden the base of this industry.  I can give a commitment that both partners in Government will be pushing that issue as quickly and as effectively as possible.</P>

      <P>In relation to the spring slaughter premium, I would like to bring to the Minister's attention that many people processing for the home market who are approved under the Abattoirs licence are not eligible for the spring slaughter premium because they do not have an export licence.  A number of cases in that regard have been brought to my attention and to that of the Department in recent weeks.  As these are bona fide steers slaughtered in the country will the Minister ensure that the slaughter premium will be made available to those abattoirs who have the highest hygiene standards etc., and licensed under the Abattoirs Act?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 48, 54, 134 and 168 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were 34 applicant groups for funding under the EC Leader programme on rural development in 1991. For convenience, I will send a list of the applicants to Deputy Deasy instead of <Col N="1808" /> detailing them here.  The business plans submitted by these groups were independently evaluated by consultants engaged by my Department at that time. The order of merit of the plans, based on the evaluation, is confidential.  The Government decided to submit all the business plans, with the report of the consultants, to the EC Commission for consideration.  The Commission eventually decided to select 16 Irish groups for funding under the programme.</P>
    <P>The major features of the Leader programme are that the selected groups are funded through global grants and that the decisions on the use of the grants are taken by the groups themselves in keeping with the general development strategy in each particular group's business plan.  There is a formal legal agreement between the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and each of the Leader groups which sets out the responsibilities of the parties, including the arrangements for advance of the public funds, which are normally paid in quarterly instalments.  In addition, detailed guidelines were supplied to each group by my Department in relation to the operation of the programme and in particular to project eligibility criteria.</P>
    <P>While keeping with the spirit of the programme &mdash; in particular, that the decisions on investments in projects are made by the groups themselves &mdash; the agreement requires each group, among other things, to document its operations, keep adequate accounts, submit monthly progress reports to my Department and provide a bond to ensure that moneys advanced to it will be used only for the purposes for which they are provided. In addition, the groups are subject to periodic checks through visits by local inspectors of my Department.</P>
    <P>In the recent Tipperary Enterprise case, some £306,000 was refunded by the group at my request in December.  The request for the refund of a further £250,000 more recently following the outcome of investigations undertaken by my Department relating to the operation of the Leader programme by that group resulted in a decision of the company to <Col N="1809" /> wind up its affairs.  As a result, I have taken steps to recover the funds under the bond.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I am making every effort to ensure that the balance of £2 million of Leader funds is secured for County Tipperary and that the programme can continue in the county under the management of a new group.  For this purpose I met a number of the interest groups from Tipperary in the past week.</P>
    <P>The question of continuing the Leader programme, which is an EC pilot scheme initiative outside the Community Support Framework of the Structural Fund, falls to be considered by the EC Commission in the context of the post-1993 round of Structural Funds.  I have made no secret of my commitment to the Leader model and I hope to see it continue on a national basis and with increased funding. However, much will depend on the success of the current programme, not just here, but in the other EC member states.</P>
    <P>Under the present programme, the level of grant aid that may be offered for individual projects is, on average, 50 per cent.  The case for increased grant levels will be taken up in the context of the evaluation programme.</P>

Does the Minister not think that, in view of the scandal surrounding Tipperary Enterprises, the report should be made public? There is a suspicion &mdash; I am simply using the word &ldquo;suspicion&rdquo;&mdash; that some of the projects were not among those recommended by the independent consultants. Therefore, I ask the Minister to publish the report as soon as possible so that the public will know if there was some political favouritism or patronage <Col N="1810" /> involved, particularly in the Tipperary Enterprises case.</P>

      <P>In relation to the whole question of public accountability, is the Minister aware that because this is a new scheme there is a wide variety of programmes in operation involving different management structures and that a certain amount of assessment is required at this stage in regard to its success?  It would be very useful if this information was made public.  As regards the checking system and the success of these programmes, will the Minister say whether any difficulties are being experienced where areas most in need of development projects may not be able to take up the programme because they simply cannot match the 50 per cent required?</P>

      <P>It is important that Deputies understand the nature of the Leader programme.  It is a pilot scheme involving for the first time local communities who identify their potential for development, put in place business plans to initiate development and avail of funding from the European Community &mdash; it is what is known as a &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; approach.  The scheme is being carefully monitored by the Department without employing extreme bureaucratic control because that would cut across the whole <Col N="1811" /> spirit of the scheme.  Arising from what happened in Tipperary, we are reviewing the control procedures for the purpose of accountability of public funds while at the same time allowing the maximum freedom to local groups to implement their programmes with the least possible bureaucratic control.</P>

However, as I indicated, this is a pilot programme, which is due to conclude at the end of 1993.  I hope we will be able to negotiate a Leader mark II programme.  In the negotiations for that programme I will bring all those points to the attention of the Commission, as well as our experiences in relation to the operation of the first Leader programme.  The Deputy can take it that we will endeavour to ensure a continuation of the Leader programme with the ongoing voluntary participation of local communities and, I hope, with a degree of flexibility in relation to the level of local contribution required.</P>

      <P>I issued the following statement today &mdash; I will read it for the benefit of the House &mdash; in relation to the announcement made and conveyed to me at approximately 9.30-10 o'clock this <Col N="1925" /> morning: This is a major disappointment to the Government and the people of Galway in particular who have served the company loyally over the past 22 years. The upheavel this decision will cause to the community and the economy of Galway cannot be overstated.</P>
      <P>Support for the Digital operation in Galway was never an issue as Ireland bettered anything on offer and, indeed, made certain innovative suggestions to secure Digital in Galway.  The deciding issue appears to be Digital's perception of the need to have a continued presence its major European market, the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>I reject the basis for this perception and point to the many companies who are successful in penetrating and building across Europe from Ireland.  Their broader vision of the potential of the wider European market reinforces their commitment to Ireland as a manufacturing base.</P>
      <P>The undertaking by Digital to upgrade the existing Galway software operation to become one of two global locations for software development is an endorsement of Galway's existing capabilities and a reaffirmation of the quality of Ireland's dynamic software sector.</P>
      <P>In discussion with Digital headquarters in Boston, I was reassured that the company will allow 12 months to phase down the operations at Galway and to enable the marketing of the facility for new investment; existing Irish suppliers to Digital Galway will continue as preferred suppliers to Digital, Ayr, Scotland; the first class Galway facility will be made available to potential investors on attractive terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The shock and anxiety experienced today by all those concerned demands an urgent response from the Government and its agencies.  Today I have asked the IDA to immediately devise and implement a priority programme of investment and enterprise promotion for Galway with the target of achieving the maximum number of new jobs in the city and county within the one year timeframe conceded by the company.  My colleagues and I in Government will be working <Col N="1926" /> closely with the IDA and other development agencies to ensure that this programme is successful.</P>
    <P>I will read an extract from the press statement issued by Mr. Kieran McGowan, chief executive of the IDA, giving details of the action that the IDA now proposes to take in relation to the programme to which I referred:</P>
    <P>1.  A high level task force, comprising senior managers in IDA with long track record in delivering results, will immediately commence intensive marketing of Galway as an excellent centre for new high-tech investment.  There is immediately available 80,000 sq. ft. of factory buildings to accommodate such investment, in addition to the facilities which Digital Corporation DEC will be making available.</P>
    <P>2.  A programme of enterprise promotion and contact will be put in place to work with Digital staff to ensure that every effort is made to form new businesses which can grow out of their long experience and track records in working with one of the world's leading companies in high technology manufacturing.</P>
    <P>3.  An increased effort will be made, backed by a flexible and wide range of incentives, to stimulate more new and expansion of small business investments by local people in Galway to help alleviate the impact of the DEC job losses. There is a particular opportunity right now to work in partnership with the large number of foreign companies in Ireland who want to source more Irish components and services here in Ireland.  For example, in electronics alone, there is a short-term potential for up to 3,000 new jobs.</P>
    <P>4.  IDA people, at top level, will also be immediately available to join with local leadership in Galway to formulate any other plans that have prospect of increasing the prosperity of business, and its employment impact, in Galway.</P>
    <P>The Government has been aware of this problem for a number of months. Indeed, for nine months during the period of office of the previous Government the precarious position of Digital's hardware area was brought to the attention <Col N="1927" /> of the then Minister for Industry and Commerce through the IDA.  Following the closure of Digital in Clonmel the warning bells started to sound.  Those bells go back five years when Digital, in gearing up for the next stage in technology, took a strategic decision to invest in Scotland.</P>
    <P>Nothwithstanding that, I wish to assure the House and those who are of the opinion that the Government was lax or too late in intervening to try to save the hardware jobs in Digital, that from the very first day I was appointed Minister the situation in Digital was brought to my attention.  From the beginning I was in regular, if not daily, contact with the IDA, both directly and indirectly through officials in my Department.  We intervened immediately we were requested by the IDA in terms of our physical presence in Boston.  I responded to a very generous and non-partisan offer of help from the Mayor of Galway, Deputy McCormack, to make himself available should that be considered useful.  Following consultations with the Taoiseach, I availed of that offer.  The Mayor of Galway and the Galway city and county manager accompanied me to Boston to make the final presentation.  Regretfully, I must announce to this House, and to the people of Galway, that despite the best, united efforts of everybody in this House and in the IDA, we were not able to dissuade Digital management in Boston from their perception of their advantage from the point of their shareholders and their company of the position they would obtain by being based in Ayr with their hardware manufacturing.</P>
    <P>The effort of the IDA in conjunction with the 800 workers whose jobs will now be phased out over the next 12 months will be unstinting in our determination to find new forms of wealth creation and job creation.</P>

      <P>The loss of 800 jobs, probably seen as the most secure in the country, is a tragedy for Galway, the west and the nation.  The families concerned are devastated.  Where can they now go for work?  What hope can they offer their children of being able to continue their education in the area in which they grew up?  This sense of loss is so overwhelming that it is important this debate should give some sense of hope to the people concerned, and I hope that it does, or at least some sense of understanding of what happened.  This loss, the sense of fear and foreboding will be felt by many who still hold jobs in the commercial sector.  It will accentuate the caution and the aversion to risk that has already been generated by the highest interest rates in the history of the State and by the anti-jobs element of the budget just published by the Government.</P>
      <P>The managing director of the IDA told us at lunchtime today that these jobs were safe for Galway up to three weeks ago and had been lost to Scotland in the past three weeks.  It appears that the Minister's intervention, despite the polite comments from Digital, was too little and too late.  I regret in particular that the Taoiseach, a native of the west, and the Tánaiste who also comes from the western seaboard, did not visit Digital headquarter to underline the case that, no doubt, was made with sincerity, if belatedly, by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>
      <P>These jobs were lost to Scotland because Digital felt it could serve its British customers better from Ayr than from Galway.  It would appear that the rhetoric about 1992, about Ireland being part of a Single Market, including Britain, counted for very little in the hard commercial decision-making in the boardrooms in Massachusetts.  Making complaints to Brussels at this stage is to late.  What can Commissioner Van Miert do at this stage to save the jobs in Digital? He can do nothing.  Why were complaints not made three weeks ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The loss of highly skilled jobs in a company that had invested so heavily in new technology and set such a good example in research and development in Ireland, <Col N="1929" /> creates a sense of vulnerability about all the 28,000 jobs in computer hardware manufacturing in Ireland, our biggest single export sector in value terms.  It is clear that being in high technology does not guarantee job security.  The vulnerability of mainframe computer manufacturers, in view of the 30 per cent overcapacity in the industry worldwide and the market trends towards personal computers and away from mainframe, has been known for two or three years or more.  It would appear that Governments led by Deputy Reynolds over the past two or three years did not devise a plan &mdash; and there is no evidence of one at this stage &mdash; to deal with this generalised trend in computer manufacture, a sector on which we depend so much.  It is clear that strategic anticipiation of problems of this nature can save jobs.  For example, Ericsson once manufactured telephone cables.  It was able, by good strategic planning with the aid of the IDA and an intelligent Government, to transform itself out of cable manufacturing and into an area where it is now employing just as many people at higher wages in software. Why was the same level of intelligent anticipation of problems in the Ericsson case some years ago not brought to bear in the Digital case now?  That question has yet to be answered by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government urgently needs a strategic plan for electronics sketching a vision for the future.  There has been no evidence of that to date.  The IDA needs to recognise that the maintenance and upgrading of existing jobs is just as important as attracting new jobs from overseas.  Saving jobs that will otherwise be lost may not be the stuff of ministerial press release, but it is even more important than announcements of new jobs, some of which may never be created.</P>
    <P>We need a taskforce in Galway to find new work opportunities for Digital's highly skilled workforce.  This mix of complimentary skills, if broken up, can never be put together again.  It is important that any action taken by the Government and the IDA is immediate.  Taking action in a year or two will be too late. It is by indicating a will to take action <Col N="1930" /> along those lines that the Government and this House will convince the workers and their families who have suffered such a devastating blow today that we care about their situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Monday I accompanied a Digital worker to Galway County Council to help him to solve a problem in relation to planning permission. At the time the man was devastated at the thought of losing his job. He said that if he lost his job this week he would go back to the council office, tear up the planning permission application and ask the council to build his house at the taxpayers' expense.  That man has no job today and, worse, no prospect of getting one.  That story, repeated 780 times in Galway this evening in a county that already has 15,000 people out of work adds up to a story of bitterness, devastation, shock, horror and loneliness.  Can anybody really understand what goes on in the mind of a person who is highly trained and motivated and who entered into mortgage arrangements in keeping with his financial circumstances at the time who now sees his world crashing down around him?  I assure this House that the workers of Galway feel literally sick this evening.  They have no idea what went wrong.  They had excellent productivity, excellent markets, and Galway seemed more secure than any other Digital unit in the States or Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some very searching questions to put in the few minutes at my disposal, questions that are being asked by thousands of people around the country. Where were the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs when all this was going on?  They acted like Pontius Pilate and just washed their hands of the problem when they knew what the final outcome was likely to be, which is outrageous behaviour.  Whether they would have had any effect is not the central issue, but their cowardice in keeping a low profile when a more aggressive attitude was called for is the really sickening thing about this.  When the Taoiseach ignored this problem last week I knew that the Galway workers were <Col N="1931" /> doomed.  If they were to be saved the Taoiseach, not Minister Quinn, would have gone to Boston.</P>
    <P>Another question concerns the Government's reaction to the alleged intervention by the UK Government to keep Digital open in Ayr, Scotland.  I raised this matter yesterday on the Order of Business but the Taoiseach just shrugged his shoulders, as he often does. It appears that the Government has an inferiority complex when dealing with our European partners.  EC competition law has definite ground rules to prevent certain financial inducements being used to attract industry to member states, otherwise small countries like ours would be swamped in Dutch auctions.</P>
    <P>I call on the Taoiseach and his Ministers to send another ministerial team and, perhaps, to go himself with the IDA to Digital in Boston immediately to seek an expansion of the software facility in Galway with a view to increasing its workforce very rapidly.  In addition, the IDA must be instructed to place Galway at the top if its priority list and to scour the world to attract a flagship industry to Galway.</P>
    <P>Galway has had a very bad record of replacing flagship industries.  The Sugar Company in Tuam which closed down with the loss of 600 jobs was not replaced. Tynagh Mines in Loughrea provided 500 jobs and not one is left.  The peat briquette factory at Ballyforan closed with the loss of 400 jobs.  If the Minister cannot do better than he did in the past, the people in Galway will not believe a single word he says.</P>
    <P>It is disquieting that the Government politicians from west Galway have kept a very low profile.  I am surprised at this, on other occasions one could not keep them out of the limelight, but this time they are extraordinarily quiet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>With all my fellow citizens of Galway I am deeply shocked at the announcement this morning that the manufacturing unit of our great flagship industry, Digital at Ballybrit, will close. In an earlier debate on this subject I mentioned that I was present 22 years <Col N="1932" /> ago as a Minister in the Government that approved a grant for this factory.  I was present at the contract signing ceremony when there were only four or five people employed by the company.  I saw the company grow from that small start to an industry which today employs 1,100 in its manufacturing plant and in its software unit and which also provided temporary employment for over 200 people.  Many more people are employed in all the companies throughout County Galway and in other parts of Ireland which are subcontracting to that company.  All together we are talking about 2,000 or more jobs. This is the most terrible disaster that has struck industrial employment in all my years in this House.</P>
      <P>This will have a severe effect on employment in Galway city and the wider region outside the factory because of the link between the main company and the smaller companies that were encouraged to develop.  My heart goes out to the workers and their families who are the immediate sufferers in this tragedy.</P>
      <P>I heard what the Minister said about a task force.  As a Galway Deputy I call on him to commit the full resources of the State to immediately establish an alternative industry in the Galway region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have learned a lesson from this; all along the only people who had access to what was happening were senior executives in the IDA, the Ministers of the Government and the Taoiseach.  There was no information if one was not in the Government.  Until 4 November my knowledge of this situation was up-to-date; I was in close contact with my colleagues Deputy O'Malley, who, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, was greatly concerned about the threat.  I cannot understand why, in the intervening period, no political action seems to have been taken if we are to believe what the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, told the House here earlier.  He said that one of his predecessors had gone to America twice.  I had to inquire from an official afterwards to whom he was referring; it was Deputy O'Malley.  There have been three Ministers in that Department since Deputy O'Malley resigned in early November. <Col N="1933" /> The former Minister, Mr Flynn, would have been informed immediately of the threat to Digital.  What did he do? He went to Brussels and was replaced by Deputy Bertie Ahern, who had responsibility for the Department of Industry and Commerce as well as the Department of Finance.  He would have been informed immediately by the IDA chief executive of the threat.  The Taoiseach would also have been kept informed about this issue because it was so big.  When the present Minister came into office he admitted, in the course of a debate in the House, that he had been told the company was under serious threat.  Everybody has known about the threat to the computer industry, because of the major revolution there in the past two years.  In this case, it boiled down to one question: would the Ayr or Galway factory be closed?</P>
    <P>It is a matter of great regret to have to criticise the Ministers who succeeded Deputy O'Malley for not having gone to Boston or not having made arrangements to meet the decision-maker in Digital, Bob Palmer.  Surely in modern day business it is essential to know the person making the decision, especially when that decision will have a traumatic effect, not only on employment in one locality in the west but all over the country?  I point an accusing finger at the Minister, the Taoiseach and the two previous incumbents in the Minister's office for not having done the obvious thing, built up a relationship with the chief executive of Digital, for not having met him, spoken to him and built up a relationship with him.  That was the way in which my colleague, Deputy O'Malley carried out his responsibilities as Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Unfortunately, that did not happen in this instance.</P>
    <P>The Minister and workers in the factory have confirmed it was understood until January that, on the straight issue of Ayr versus Galway, the Galway plant was the favourite as, on every assessment, it was the more efficient and stronger plant and had greater productivity. What happened to make the company decide to close the Galway plant and transfer its operations to the plant at Ayr?  Political intervention led to that <Col N="1934" /> decision.  Even though the IDA officials wore a track flying the Atlantic it was far beyond their capacity to salvage the plant and solve this problem; it was a matter for a higher authority.  We lost the plant because of the intervention of senior politicians in the United Kingdom.  If the Minister wishes to deny that he may, but in my discussions with him, which were confidential until today, I understood that was also his opinion.  It is well known and accepted that John Major, Mr. Heseltine and Ian Laing had a role in this issue.  Political action on their part in networking the system won the day for Ayr, even though on a one to one comparison the Galway factory stood head and shoulders over it.  I went into some detail in my contribution in an earlier debate in outlining the strength, capacity and capabilities of the Galway plant <i>vis-á-vis</i> Ayr.</P>
    <P>The workers have been offered a redundancy package of six weeks pay for every year worked in the plant.  As 800 people are being thrown out of work, there will be massive problems in the repayment of mortgages.  Lump sum payments will be made to the workers on the basis of six weeks pay per year of employment.  Will the Minister confirm that tax will not be deducted from that lump sum to enable the recipients to meet their mortgage commitments and to hold on to their homes?  Otherwise, there will be a total collapse of the economy in Galway and hundreds of houses will be repossessed.  These families will not find alternative employment in the Galway area or any other part of the country which would enable them to continue to repay their mortgages.  I ask for special concessions for those families who are faced with this huge calamity.</P>
    <P>In future these issues should not be left solely in the hands of the IDA and Ministers.  There should be an involvement from the bottom up in this task force.  Businessmen and community and industrial leaders in Galway should have a role to play in promoting their town. They should not be left totally dependent on an organisation located in Dublin, with the possibility of no information being communicated to the people in <Col N="1935" /> Galway city.  Part of this tragedy is that we were kept in the dark and those who knew about it did not take action in time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The announcement of the loss of 800 jobs in Digital is certainly a black day for Galway and the country.  It is an announcement everybody had feared for some time but hoped would never take place.  It marks one of the blackest days in our recent economic history.  Even at a time when factory closures are commonplace, the scale of the job losses in Galway is shocking and the potential economic damage to the city and the region is frightening.  On a <i>pro rata</i> basis, the loss would be equivalent to the loss of approximately 4,000 jobs in the Dublin area.  Of course, the direct job losses are only part of the picture. We cannot even guess at the indirect job losses which will follow in supplier companies, in the motor trade, retail, leisure and transport areas, and construction arising from the lay-offs and the consequent reduced money flow in the Galway region.</P>
      <P>On a personal level, we must extend our sympathy to the Digital employees who stand to lose their jobs and who face the dismal prospect of joining approximately 16,000 people already on the live register in the Galway city and county area in the demoralising search for non-existent jobs.  While the Digital job losses are clearly a major embarrassment to the new Fianna Fáil-Labour Party Government, we do not take any pleasure from it, the tragedy for Galway is far too serious for that.  However, the Government can be criticised for failing to be alert to the Digital plans, for failing to react with sufficient speed and then attempting to cover its political tracks by engaging in an elaborate public relations charade by dispatching the Government jet across the Atlantic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The responsibility for the Digital disaster does not rest solely with the Government.  Responsibility must be shared by successive Governments who have held office over the past decade and who have ignored the conclusions drawn in virtually every study of Irish industry <Col N="1936" /> from Telesis to Culliton.  After all, it is not as if the Digital experience was new or that the Government should have been taken by surprise by the decision of a computer giant to dump people on the dole.  Digital now takes its place on the role of dishonour alongside Nixdorf, Prime Computers, Wang, Apple, Seagate and others who have been prepared to take the money and run.  Will the Minister, in replying to the debate, give some indication of the amount of money provided for Digital in terms of grants, aids and concessions and whether any of this money will be returned?  Irish workers have paid a very high price for the failure of successive Governments to ensure the development of indigenous industry and the very heavy reliance on footloose multinationals for job creation.  The multinational companies simply follow the market and the money.  They will go wherever the profits can be maximised and where they stand to receive the most generous grants and concessions.  They have no social conscience and have little regard for the human consequences of closing factories and putting people on the dole.  The fact that the competition for the last number of weeks was between the workers in Galway and the workers in Ayr has been lost sight of.</P>
    <P>I hope even at this stage that the Government will have learned something from this latest and very painful lesson. First, it should take steps to establish procedures for identifying jobs which could be in danger and ensuring that whatever intervention is possible is taken in advance of irrevocable decisions by company boards in far away places.  Secondly, they must now move to implement the recommendations of Telesis and Culliton and ensure the development of indigenous companies based on our natural resources.</P>
    <P>I welcome any jobs we can secure from the multinational section, but I question the value of spending so much money on attracting jobs which more and more can be considered only temporary.  The Culliton Report stated:</P>
    <P>It remains true that, while investment in the form of isolated production units <Col N="1937" /> of foreign multinationals have made enormous contributions over the years, reliance on this source of industrial growth is not enough.  If Irish industry is to make the transition to the levels of performance to which we aspire there must be a greater contribution from firms that have deeper roots in the economy and especially from home managed firms.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy made a comparison between Ayr and Galway and stated the clear lead that Galway had in relation to productivity, efficiency and effectiveness. Experience has shown that is a low priority for such multinationals when it comes to choosing between one location and another.  I am not arguing for low productivity, I am simply making the point that it is not necessarily the only basis on which such companies make their decision.  The fact that Digital has about one quarter of its turnover sales in the United Kingdom was a major factor in choosing Ayr.</P>
    <P>There is an interesting article in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> by G.T. Wrixon, the director of the national micro electronics research centre at University College, Cork.  He raised pertinent questions in relation to how we should keep those mulitnationals linked to this economy.  He said we must ask a series of questions about the type of strategies we need to develop, not just today but for the future and to constantly readjust them.  Despite all that, at a time when the Government is forecasting an increase of 26,000 in the unemployment numbers in the next 12 months, the tragedy of Digital is compounded by the failure of the Minister for Finance to produce any significant job creation initiatives in yesterday's budget.  Will the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, when he addresses the House in relation to the budget over the next week, indicate if he intends to meet the expected deadline referred to in Culliton, that its main recommendations will be implemented by the end of this year if certain political decisions are taken?  Will the Minister indicate if that is the intention despite the fact that yesterday's budget did little in real terms to create a significant number of jobs?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1938" /> Workers in Digital who knew their jobs were in danger, and others who spent months or years on the dole who looked in hope to yesterday's budget, must be bitterly disappointed.  The sort of minor measures announced yesterday by the Minister might have been appropriate if we had an unemployment level of 50,000 or 60,000, but it now stands at more than 300,000.  This is a crisis and the budget has done nothing to reflect the urgency of the position.  Deputy Rabbitte asked about our monetary policy and our attitude to the whole question of interest rates.  How can we seriously talk, as the Minister for Enterprise and Employment did, about growth in the indigenous sector when we compare our interest rates with those in the United Kingdom? What impact did that differential in interest rates have on Digital's decision to relocate its manufacturing sector?</P>
    <P>There is also a need to look at where we can potentially create jobs.  In recent years the Government has let 3,000 people go from the local authority area. That is equivalent to three or four Digitals in terms of the number of jobs lost. The Government also needs to examine that area if we are serious about tackling, not just the crisis in Galway, but all over the State.</P>

      <P>Tá mé chun mo chuid ama a roinnt leis an teachta Michael Kitt. The Opposition implied that Government Deputies were quiet while this was taking place.  As somebody who devoted a lifetime to job creation I resent that implication because, although we did not receive media attention, we were lobbying to the best of our ability to save those jobs.  My heart goes out to the people who will lose jobs in the coming year.  I know the trauma and shock they will experience and redundancy payments do not compensate for the loss of a job.  Those who will not get alternative employment need ongoing support, advice and help because there is nothing more lonely than to be made redundant, to lose contact with workmates and left to one's own devices.  People who have been out of work for a year or so have come to me when it begins to bite.  The suffering, loneliness and financial problems <Col N="1939" /> that arise at that stage are what we must prepare for now.</P>
      <P>Urgent consideration should be given to people whose unemployment benefit runs out because if they have saved their redundancy money they will be means tested on the residual funds.  Will the Taoiseach and the Minister examine that matter and consider the question of ongoing advice?  It is very important that a breathing space of one year has been given so that we can get an alternative industry.</P>

      <P>I also extend my sympathy to the 780 workers who are being let go in Digital.  They have served Digital well and Digital has also served Galway and the country well.  I know there will be criticism of the Government but the Taoiseach and the various Ministers have done all they can at this difficult time. I thank, in particular, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment for meeting the Galway Oireachtas Members and giving us details of the efforts made by him, the Mayor of Galway and others in this regard.  The Mayor of Galway did not think that the trip to Boston was a charade.  The Minister told us of the efforts he made in contacting and alerting the two Commissioners, including the Commissioner for competition and I hope those matters will be investigated.  It is important to set up county enterprise boards, in Galway in particular, for which a sum of £25 million was announced yesterday. The Minister should again meet the Oireachtas Members from Galway to discuss how the enterprise board in Galway can be helped.  It is important that the skilled workforce in Galway is retained.  There is a huge facility in <Col N="1940" /> Galway.  It was described today on the news as similar in size to four Croke Parks.  The facility contains £100 million worth of equipment.  It is first class and must be used by the agencies to ensure that the skilled workforce will obtain employment in the city and county of Galway.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that the Fine Gael Deputies appear to want to do that. I will turn to two constructive points made by Deputy De Rossa.  The first was in relation to the value of the grants to Digital.  If one includes the Clonmel plant, approximately £15 million grants in all were given to Digital over a period of time.  The wage bill, including that for the software workers from Digital plants in Galway this year was of the order of £43 million so, in terms of value for taxpayer's money, we received more than our share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, whether Digital was Irish owned or internationally owned, the <Col N="1943" /> technology which it employed and which it is attempting to sell on an international market is no longer capable of finding a market because of the rapid transformation in the industry.  The people who know this best are the people in Galway, those at the coalface in Digital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me to raise this important local issue in the House.  I am disappointed that the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, is not present to hear the indignation, resentment and anger that exists in Cashel and in all south Tipperary concerning the shock decision by the South Eastern Health Board to end orthopaedic trauma services at Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel.  I urge the Minister on behalf of the people in south Tipperary to refuse outright to ratify this decision, which is unfair, unwise and, indeed, damaging to the future health services in south Tipperary.</P>
      <P>We are determined to fight this plan to centralise all orthopaedic trauma services in Ardkeen in Waterford.  Regretfully, the decision is merely the continuation of an ongoing policy to undermine the health services in south Tipperary.  This policy will reduce the number of health services available to the county.  Furthermore, it will compel Tipperary patients to travel unacceptably long distances for urgent medical treatment.  It is morally indefensible to dismantle this orthopaedic service, for two reasons.  First, the waiting list, even for appointments with an orthopaedic surgeon in Cashel, is now 18 months to two years.  Why is the South Eastern Health Board not taking steps to reduce this waiting list instead of abolishing the service and dashing the hopes of those unfortunate people of ever getting an early appointment in this new centralised service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, the necessary infrastructure does not exist to facilitate a centralised service in the south east.  The roads and <Col N="1945" /> the transport service are not good enough.  As a result of this decision ten beds for orthopaedic care will be transferred from Our Lady's Hospital in Cashel.  The chief executive officer stated that the decision was based on quality versus local convenience.  Will the Minister agree that the availability of an immediate hospital service which saves lives is essential when there may not be time to travel for quality service?  Health service is about people and this decision is a fatal blow, not only to Cashel but to the south east which will be totally dependent on hospital facilities in Waterford. The people of south Tipperary are not prepared to allow their health service to be gradually eroded.  I appeal to the Minister to appreciate the concerns of all the people who strongly object to this decision.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to protect the excellent services provided at present by Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel, and not allow south Tipperary to be stripped of a quality health service, which is not only appreciated but needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>A major review of orthopaedic services in the South Eastern Health Board was undertaken by the Department of Health and Comhairle na nOspidéal during 1991-92.  The reason for the review was the general dissatisfaction in regard to the organisation and level of orthopaedic services in the region.  Waiting lists for elective orthopaedic surgery were growing because of the volume of trauma cases being dealt with in Kilcreene.  It was envisaged that Kilcreene would be solely an elective orthopaedic hospital but, for a variety of reasons, the situation had developed where approximately 60 per cent of the workload being performed there was trauma-related.  The review was undertaken to advise the South Eastern Health Board on the organisation of orthopaedic services for the region in the most effective and efficient manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review group, in preparing its report, consulted widely within the South-Eastern Health Board area.  Subsequent <Col N="1946" /> to the review group's report, the South-Eastern Health Board engaged in a lengthy and comprehensive series of discussions at local level.  The report was discussed at the general hospital programme committee of the board and subsequently at the board meeting of 11 February 1993, where, as the Deputy is aware, a full discussion on all the issues took place.</P>
    <P>The review group, in its report of March 1992, recommended that major orthopaedic trauma cases should be brought to Waterford Regional Hospital. It was not envisaged by the review group that all orthopaedic trauma cases would be brought to Waterford.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health was anxious that the board consider all aspects of the review group's recommendations and make a decision based on local needs having regard to the observations of the board's management following their detailed local discussions and consultations.</P>
    <P>The review group recognised that there were a number of potential disadvantages to centralisation for the other hospitals in the region and, to minimise such disadvantages and extra travel impositions on patients, the review group recommended that regular and frequent consultant orthopaedic input should be made to Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel, by the consultant orthopaedic staff based at Waterford.  The report envisaged that (a) two orthopaedic clinics per week in Cashel would be conducted by a designated consultant orthopaedic surgeon, at least one would be a fracture clinic; (b) in conjunction with these clinics, a ward consultation service in Cashel should be provided for in-patients at the request of locally-based consultants; and (c) the designated consultant orthopaedic surgeon should be responsible for providing an advisory service to Cashel on orthopaedic related problems to the staff of the local general hospital.</P>
    <P>All the above elements will be incorporated in the new arrangements following the health board's recent decision. The South Eastern Health Board has also decided that the direct transfer of major orthopaedic trauma to Waterford <Col N="1947" /> Regional Hospital would not be adopted at this time.  The board considered that such cases should be brought to the nearest acute hospital for assessment and emergency care in accordance with good medical practice.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health understands that the health board's recent decision, which involves in some respects a modification of the review group's recommendations, was made only after very detailed and careful consideration, and in the best interests of the population it serves.</P>

      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this issue which is a major one in my home town.  Scoil Chríost Rí is a Gaelscoil which has been in the area for the last 12 years, it has a complement of about 200 children and eight or nine teachers.  The school building consists of prefabs and is unsuitable. Most people would agree that children running from pre-fab to pre-fab for classes is unsatisfactory.  A new school has been built beside it and the pupils of the Gaelscoil share a school yard with it. This is a dedicated Gaelscoil which has been brought to the attention of the Minister for Education to note the conditions in it.  Last year the teachers were lucky to get a staff room, a converted pre-fab which had been in use for the past 11 years.  Recently they were lucky to recruit a secretary from a FÁS scheme but, to accommodate the secretary, they had to discard the toilet facilities in one of the pre-fabs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the constraints on the Estimates but I ask the Minister to give some consideration to including a figure in the Estimates either this year or next to provide a permanent school building on that site.  There is a commitment to promote the Irish language and I would have thought there would have been an emphasis on funding for Gaelscoileanna. This school has been awaiting funding for 12 years and the pupils and parents have <Col N="1948" /> been patient over those years.  It is only in recent times that they have become more vociferous and we should bear that in mind.  They have picketed the Dáil and have been on television.  I do not believe that such conditions exist in any other school and I ask the Minister to address this matter.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity of outlining the present position in regard to the proposed new school for an Ghaelscoil Chríost Rí, Dundalk, County Louth.</P>
      <P>In 1984 the Department gave the all-Irish stream at St. Joseph's national school, Avenue Road, Dundalk, permanent recognition as an all-Irish school. Presently, the school is being accommodated in prefabricated classrooms on the grounds of St. Joseph's School.  The school has a principal and seven assistant teachers and the current enrolment is 211.  My Department has approved the provision of a new school.  It is proposed to provide eight classrooms and the estimated cost is £400,000.  Architectural planning is at an advanced stage and tender documents are being prepared by my Department's architectural staff.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that each national school authority seeking capital grants from my Department invariably makes the case that its project deserves priority treatment.  My task and that of my Department is to allocate the available resources in any one year as fairly as possible to as many schools as possible having regard to the overall restraints.</P>
      <P>Because of the other demands from the 150 or so projects at pre-contract stage at the end of 1992 which were deemed to be of higher priority and which had to take precedence, it was not possible to include this project in the national school programme for 1993.  When the tender documents are completed by my Department's architectural staff I assure the Deputy that I will continue to consider this project for inclusion in the national school building programme in the light of available resources and other commitment and priorities.</P>

      <P>The waiting lists at Sligo General Hospital are such that the orthopaedic surgeons there felt compelled, under the new patients charter, to take the very unusual step of writing to the patients on these lists for hip and other operations to apologise for the delays.</P>
      <P>They listed five problems preventing more operations, insufficient operating time available; insufficient anaesthetic time allocated to orthopaedics; no provision for additional nursing staff; no plans for a second &ldquo;clean air&rdquo; theatre for joint replacements, fracture fixation, and other surgery and no protection of orthopaedic beds to ensure that planned admissions were not cancelled.</P>
      <P>They were also hit by the seasonal ward closures in December and in August adding further to the already unacceptable long waiting lists.  The Minister may tell us that an extra £20 million has been provided in the budget for the reduction of hospital waiting lists.  Presumably he will not tell me about his own mini-budget the previous day raising the hospital charges to pay for this.  They were introduced by a Minister who was totally against any charges in principle. What difference will the extra money mean to the health services and the North Western Health Board area?  I am told it will be very little.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the additional nursing staff be provided to facilitate more operations?  Will the extra anaesthetic time be allocated as sought by the orthopaedic surgeons?  Will the second &ldquo;clean air&rdquo; theatre come? Will the wards be closed down in summer and at Christmas, effectively taking off one fourth of the whole year?  My understanding is that the wards will continue to close.  Because of the special needs in the Sligo General Hospital area and in the north west, and the aging population there should be a special allocation from the additional money.  If we simply get a proportion based on the population then this supposed attack on the waiting list will have little or no effect on those who are waiting two, three or four years for a hip operation.  People who are suffering <Col N="1950" /> like that are waiting a long time for the postman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, there has been significant investment in hospital services in the North-Western Health Board region in recent years, I might add, more so than in the case of my health board area.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1990, there were two orthopaedic surgeons working in the North-Western Health Board region, both based at Sligo General Hospital.</P>
      <P>The North-Western Health Board identified and agreed the need to establish an orthopaedic service in Letterkenny General Hospital.  Comhairle na nOspidéal and the Department of Health approved the appointment of an orthopaedic surgeon for Letterkenny and an extra orthopaedic surgeon for Sligo. There are now four orthopaedic surgeons in posts serving that region.  Equipping the new 22-bed unit at Letterkenny cost £600,000 and an extra £1 million per year was allocated to run the unit.  The orthopaedic unit was opened in April 1992.</P>
      <P>In the context of the major new facilities in Sligo General Hospital, additional funding was allocated in 1992 for the further development of a range of services at the hospital, including the expansion of orthopaedic services and the phased development of ENT services.  In spite of these significant developments in the North-Western Health Board region, I am aware there are still a number of people having to wait longer than they should for their operations.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware also the Government has allocated £20 million for a major action programme to reduce waiting times in the areas of orthopaedic surgery, ophthalmology, ear, nose and throat surgery, cardiac surgery, vascular surgery and plastic surgery.  The overall objectives is to eliminate waiting lists in excess of 12 months in these specialties and to set a maximum period of six months for children awaiting ENT or eye treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health will announce his decisions in regard to the allocation of the £20 million in coming weeks.  The <Col N="1951" /> Deputy can be assured that he will be considering the position of the North-Western Health Board as sympathetically as possible.</P>

      <P>St. Mary's boys national school, Carrick-on-Shannon has 120 pupils and four teachers.  The school building comprises three classrooms and one prefab.  By any standards, the accommodation is in a deplorable state of repair.  The windows are rotten and unable to retain the glass.  The roof of the prefab is leaking.  The furniture is antiquated, there is no floor covering. Ventilation in the classrooms is very poor because the windows cannot be opened. The roof of the corridor is leaking and all around there is evidence of rat infestation.</P>
      <P>I understand that even the Department of Education accept that the building is not a fit place now for school purposes. Major renovation and extension work is needed.  This has been promised, and solemnly promised, particularly at election time.  In total frustration at the inaction, the INTO members went on official strike last week, with the full backing of the parents.  I understand the Minister has decided to transfer the pupils to vacated classrooms near the girl's national school but I am not sure this will mean amalgamation.</P>
      <P>This suggestion to dodge the responsibility of giving adequate school accommodation to Carrick-on-Shannon will not wash.  The rooms suggested were vacated because they were substandard.  There is no suitable playground and the noise level is excessive because of a major road nearby.  One cannot solve one substandard school accommodation problem by simply moving to another location.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of Carrick-on-Shannon demand that the promises made be honoured. There is no need to put forward further points to justify their case.  The building makes the argument for me and does so eloquently.  The Minister of State, who is present, should give a date <Col N="1952" /> when funds will be made available and when work will start on this building.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was the subject of a Adjournment Debate in the Seanad last Thursday and also the subject of a parliamentary question today.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has afforded me the opportunity of outlining to the House the position regarding St. Mary's boys' national school, Carrick-on-Shannon, County Leitrim.  The present accommodation at this school consists of three permanent classrooms and one prefabricated classroom.  The staff is comprised of a principal, three assistant teachers, and its current enrolment is 117 pupils.</P>
      <P>On foot of the application which had been made to my Department for the provision of a permanent extension my Department had approved a major building project which would have involved the retention of two of the existing classrooms, conversion of the third classroom into a staffroom/library and the construction of two further permanent classrooms.  The estimated cost of the project would be at least £90,000.  Architectural planning had commenced and planning permission was received from the local authority.</P>
      <P>However, an option which has to be considered at this stage in the light of up-to-date information is whether the school should be amalgamated with the girls national school.  This arises in the context of surplus accommodation known to exist in the girls' national school and in the light of projected future enrolments.</P>
      <P>Preliminary indications are that probably there would be sufficient accommodation in the convent national school to accommodate, with adaptation and development, the entire boys and girls primary school population in the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it behoves my Department, in its administration of the capital resources available, to utilise them effectively in providing adequate standards of accommodation for our primary school population. This has to include the full <Col N="1953" /> utilisation of all good accommodation which already exists and which has been provided for in the past by capital allocations from my Department.</P>
    <P>My Department must provide facilities in a way that does not duplicate them or result in significant surplus unused accommodation within a short number of years.</P>
    <P>Such an approach is a necessary part of the strategy of directing the funds at our disposal to those projects most needed and where justified by a continuing need in future years.</P>
    <P>In the light of the foregoing my Department is in consultation with the relevant school authorities in order to decide on the appropriate course of action regarding the provision of primary school accommodation needs for the future in Carrick-on-Shannon.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to raise the question of remedial teachers at Milford primary school, Charleville, County Cork.  Perhaps I will be allowed to broaden it because there is not an adequate acknowledgement of the work that remedial teachers do in primary schools. In this school I understand that one-third of the children are in urgent need of remedial teaching.  If this facility is not provided now I suggest the children will be deprived in secondary school and will be unlikely to get into third level education. It is not fair, right or just to deprive these children of this important facility.  Due to deprivation, unemployment and social problems in the area the number of children in need is substantially higher than the average.  The Minister should give approval for a remedial teacher as a matter of urgency. I am not seeking a full-time remedial teacher for Milford or Tullylease but rather part-time teachers for two hours per day.  That is not an unreasonable request; it is fair and just and the children of that area are entitled to such a service.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Crowley for raising this matter.  My Department is currently examining the scope for the employment of additional teaching resources for children with special education <Col N="1954" /> needs.  The question of remedial teaching posts will form a key element in this consideration.  In this connection the Programme for a Partnership Government provides for the recruitment of 500 remedial teachers by September 1996.  I assure the Deputy that the needs of the school referred to by him will be borne in mind when it is next possible to make remedial teacher appointments.  I take the point made by the Deputy in relation to the sharing of a remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>The needs of the school referred to by the Deputy will also be considered in the context of any extension to the special scheme of assistance for schools designated areas of disadvantage.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise the question of the replacement of the roof at Cabinteely community school.  More than two years ago it was agreed both by the school architect and the Department's architect that the roof needed replacing.  However, we are waiting since.  The estimated cost of this work is approximately £50,000.  The mineral felt which was put on the roof in 1978 when the school was built is in need of replacement. Water lodges in the valley of the roof and seeps through to the Art Room. The art teacher has to use a plastic bucket to catch the drips of water.  The building has been damaged purely because of neglect and that is a scandal and will cost the taxpayer more money if urgent repairs are not carried out.  Two years is long enough to wait for a replacement roof. The school authorities carried out temporary works during the past couple of years at a cost of £5,000, but it is like throwing money out the window because it does not solve the problem.  Contractors have been chosen to carry out this work and I ask the Minister to give a commitment that approximately £50,000 will be made available immediately to carry out these urgent repairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">

      <P>I thank Deputy Barrett for raising this matter which was the subject of a parliamentary question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I would like to explain that my Department accepts that work is needed to the roof at Cabinteely community <Col N="1955" /> school.  The difficulty has been the level of funds available to tackle the huge number of urgent projects needing attention.</P>
    <P>The work to the roof at this school will cost almost £50,000 and so the project is quite a significant one.  It has been the Department's policy in recent times to attempt to respond to the urgent requirements for classroom accommodation in many areas and accordingly the limited funds available have been devoted to that purpose.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, it has not been possible to include the remedial work to the roof at Cabinteely in the 1993 second level capital programme because of other demands, as I have explained, being deemed to be of a higher priority and having to take precedence.  The work involved will continue to be considered for inclusion in the programme in the light of available resources and other commitments and priorities.  Every effort will be made to accommodate repairs in the current year because of the nature of the repairs involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise the question of improvements to Kilglass national school, Ahascragh, Ballinasloe, a three-teacher school with 89 children. At present there is a temporary partition in one classroom, resulting in two small classrooms.  The proposal is to build a third classroom and to convert the existing three classrooms into two classrooms. There is an urgent need for cloakrooms and toilets also.  The estimated cost of the work is in the region of £65,000 but that sum may have to be increased as the project has been under discussion for a number of years.  I hope the Minister will <Col N="1956" /> treat this as a priority.  There has been much speculation that it will not be dealt with at present.  A small library and health room is required also.  I hope those elements of the project can be put together and money provided for it in 1993.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kitt for raising this matter.</P>
      <P>The improvements proposed to my Department for Kilglass national school consists of the provision of a new permanent classroom, together with staff room and other ancillary accommodation, including a new toilet block, the conversion of two of the existing classrooms and the refurbishment of the existing building.</P>
      <P>This project is at an early stage of the planning process.  A sketch scheme is currently in course of preparation.  When this has been completed the school authority will be advised to seek planning permission from the local authority.</P>
      <P>Subject to receipt of planning permission, working drawings will then have to be prepared and a fire safety certificate obtained before architectural planning of the project is concluded.  As the physical planning process is unlikely to be completed in the current financial year the question of including this project among the projects approved to date for inclusion in the 1993 national school capital programme does not arise.</P>
      <P>However, I wish to assure the Deputy that this project will continue to be considered for inclusion in the programme in due course in the light of available resources and other commitments and priorities.</P>

      <P>The effects on the timber industry of the recent currency fluctuations, particularly the decline in the value of sterling, have been severe. Export markets amounting to nearly £40 million, almost exclusively in the UK, were under serious threat and the domestic market was also experiencing pressure from timber products sourced primarily from Scandanavia.</P>
      <P>These difficulties were fully appreciated by my Department and a concerted approach, in full consultation with the Irish Timber Council, was made for special assistance from the Market Development Fund.  The fund allocated a total of £2.7 million for the timber sector and, of course, the 10 per cent devaluation of the Irish Pound will also have improved the situation significantly.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that the prospects for the industry are good.  To fulfil its potential, the sector will have to develop a more export-orientated approach which will involve a certain element of restructuring in order that companies are of sufficient scale to compete at the international level.</P>

      <P>I expect that the scheme for early retirement from farming under EC Regulation No. 2079/92 will be in operation here, following clearance by the EC Commission, by the end of the summer.</P>
      <P>Details of the scheme which I will be introducing are at present being drawn up by my Department but I intend that it will provide attractive financial inducements to encourage farmers to consider early retirement.</P>
      <P>The EC Regulation governing the scheme requires a significant increase in the size of agricultural holding of the transferee to improve its economic viability before Community funding will be given.  The precise percentage figure which will be regarded as a significant increase has yet to be agreed with the Community.  A division of family holdings, however, at a time close to the date of transfer in order to meet the enlargement requirement at the time of transfer would not be acceptable to the Commission as meeting the restructuring objectives of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The normal situation under EC schemes is that eligibility is confined to actions taken from the date the measure is put in place in a member state.  I am, however, examining this and other aspects such as age requirements for transferees and the situation in relation to joint ownership in considering the details rules for the early retirement scheme as a whole.</P>

      <P>The position is that the EC Structural Funds allocated to Ireland under the Operational Programme for the Control of Farmyard Pollution have been fully committed. Consequently, it has not been possible for some time to deal with any further applications under this measure.</P>
      <P>However, grant aid for pollution control works continues to be available under the Farm Improvement Programme and over 7,000 schemes of work have been approved under this programme in the past 12 months.</P>
      <P>Grant payments to farmers with current approval under the Operational Programme for the Control of Farmyard Pollution of course continue to be paid subject to the approved works being completed to the satisfaction of the Department within the prescribed time.

      <P>I am aware of the importance of the Control of Farmyard Pollution scheme. For this reason, I will be seeking to ensure maximum support for continuation of this measure in the context of Ireland's submission to the EC for a new allocation of Structural Funds.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 42, 55, 63, 135, 182 and 183 together.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to implement a coherent four year Bovine TB Eradication Programme with the support of Community funding and subject to the conditions attaching to those funds. Agreement was reached with the EC Commission in regard to the relevant conditions in October 1992.  However, because of budgetary limits on the EC veterinary fund delays have arisen in having the programme approved for Community funding.  I am pressing for an immediate increase in the level of EC veterinary funding to enable appropriate finance to be made available.</P>
      <P>A sum of £43.5 million has been allocated in the Book of Estimates to cover the running costs of the programme for 1993.  The exact format of the programme including grant structure of this year's scheme will be determined by the timing of the availability of EC funding.</P>
      <P>Most of our EC partners have progressed their eradication programmes to an advanced stage.  The broad format of our eradication scheme is similar to those operative in other EC countries.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 152 together.</P>
      <P>There has not been a 4.5 per cent cut in Ireland's quota this year.  What is in question is the future treatement of 4.5 per cent of the quota which has been suspended in all member states in part from 1987 and in part from 1988.  During the council negotiations which took place last year on the revision of the milk quota regime, I made it very clear that Ireland does not accept that a final decision has been taken on the future of the suspended quota.  I indicated then that a decision should be taken on this issue at the same time as the Council decides on quota levels for the coming year, that is, before the end of March 1993.  Since then, I have raised this issue both within Council and also bi-laterally with the Commission. I will continue to press strongly for a satisfactory solution in the forthcoming Council discussions.  The question of a legal challenge by the Government on this issue does not arise at present.</P>

      <P>Under the European Communities (Classification, Packaging and Labelling of Pesticides) Regulations, 1985 to 1992, conditions are prescribed to safeguard the health of the people handling or using a pesticide and to protect against damage to the environment.  A pesticide may not be sold on the market unless it has obtained clearance under the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maximum levels of pesticide residues are prescribed for a number of areas as a direct protection for the consumer.  The relevant regulations are the European Communities (Pesticide Residues) (Fruit and Vegetables) Regulations, 1989; the European Communities (Pesticide Residues) (Foodstuffs of Animal Origin) Regulations, 1988; the European Communities (Pesticide Residues) (Cereals) Regulations, 1988 and the European <Col N="1827" /> Communities (Pesticide Residues) (Feedstuffs) Regulations, 1992.</P>
    <P>Regulations are also in operation to prohibit the marketing and use of pesticides which have been found to present unacceptable hazards to human health and/or to the environment.  For example, the marketing or use of aldrin, dieldrin, DDT, mercury compounds and others have been prohibited under the European Communities (Prohibition of Certain Active Substances in Plant Protection Products) Regulations, 1981 to 1990.</P>
    <P>The overall position relating to pesticide use is continuously monitored both nationally and within the EC.  Controls are introduced as necessary in the light of the scientific evidence available.</P>

The effectiveness of these schemes has been routinely looked at internally and the Comptroller and Auditor General has also commented on them.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government decided to introduce an exchange risk guarantee scheme in December of last year.

      <P>The Common Agricultural Policy reform package adopted by the European Community last June substantially overhauled the livestock premium schemes.  I accept that the new arrangements are relatively complex and that many farmers may have difficulty in coming to terms with them. For this reason my Department with the assistance of Teagasc held a series of public information meetings from mid-January to mid-February 1993 at over 60 centres around the country in order to explain the new arrangements to farmers. These meetings were attended by approximately 25,000 farmers.  My Department has also produced a special booklet which explains the details of the new arrangements and the procedures for claiming the grants.</P>
      <P>At the Department's request, Teagasc has put in place a package of measures to assist farmers in dealing with the complexity of the new Common Agricultural Policy arrangements while also advising them how to secure optimum income under the various schemes.  The extra £1 million which has been provided in the budget to enable Teagasc to extend its small farm development service should contribute significantly to this effort.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the procedures for claiming the premium and headage grants are largely dictated by EC regulations and audit requirements which are designed to ensure that grants are not improperly paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department simplified the application procedures in 1992 following consultation with the farm organisations and intends to keep the procedures as simple as possible in the future, while at the <Col N="1830" /> same time meeting the control requirements of EC regulations and auditors.</P>

      <P>The terrestial flatworm, Artioposthia triangulata, is a native of New Zealand.  Occasional incidences have been reported in Europe, which were presumably introduced on imported plants from New Zealand.  The first record of it in Ireland was in a County Antrim garden in 1963.  In recent years there has been a number of isolated occurences within the State.</P>
      <P>The flatworm feeds on the common earthworm.  My Department, Teagasc and the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland have been keeping a general monitor on the position relating to the New Zealand flatworm and on its movement.  There is no evidence that it has caused any noticeable diminution in the general earthworm population.  The position will continue to be kept under observation.</P>

      <P>Payment of agricultural grants and subsidies to farmers is subject to EC Regulations which lay down the conditions under which such <Col N="1831" /> payments must be made.  These regulations impose obligations both on the farmers in relation to the type of supporting documentation required and on the member state authorities as regards the level of inspectors and checks required to ensure that the subsidies and grants are not improperly paid.  Accordingly, my Department is obliged to satisfy itself that the terms and conditions of the various schemes are fully complied with before it can pay the grants or subsidies to farmers.  The time required to undertake these inspections and checks depends on a number of factors, including the number of applications submitted, and the accuracy with which the applications are completed by the farmers themselves.</P>
      <P>In addition, disputes between the Department and individual farmers as to entitlement to a grant or subsidy may take some time to resolve, depending on the complexity of the case.</P>
      <P>I very much recognise the increasing importance of premium-headage payments in farmers' overall incomes and I am committed to ensuring that all applications for grants and subsidies are processed in the shortest possible time and that payments are made at the earliest opportunity, subject to the time constraints laid down in Community Regulations. I do not believe that setting a &ldquo;pay by date&rdquo; would add to that commitment.</P>

      <P>In common with other European countries, full-time employment in the agricultural sector in Ireland has been declining in recent years.  However, this decline masks a <Col N="1832" /> trend towards greater diversification in the income sources of farm and rural holdings and an increase in the number of farmers engaged in part-time farming.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, agricultural output of a number of products is limited by EC production restrictions, which may increase pressure on farm employment in our main production sectors in future years.  To help counteract this, a range of measures are now in place aimed at maximising income and productive employment and stimulating rural development.</P>
      <P>Within the operational programme for rural development under the aegis of my Department there is a number of schemes designed to encourage farm diversification and farm-based enterprises. The uptake of schemes to promote alternative farm enterprises, horticulture and agri-tourism has been good to date.  Teagasc has a role in promoting these schemes and in providing advice and training to farmers in the areas of produce quality, animal productivity and cost control.  The Leader programme is designed to enable groups in rural communities to draw up and implement integrated business plans.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I am precluded from introducing <Col N="1834" /> measures to subsidise the costs of imported farm inputs under Article 93 of the EC Treaty.</P>
      <P>However, the agricultural sector was a major beneficiary of the &ldquo;green pound&rdquo; devaluation and any increased costs on imports of farm inputs would be very substantially less than the farm income benefits which accrued.  The reduction of interest rates associated with devaluation also represents, of course, a considerable benefit to the farm sector.</P>

      <P>In November 1991 the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg found that Ireland was in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights in the case referred to by the Deputy.  In a further judgment awarding just satisfaction to the applicants under Article 50 of the Convention which was delivered on 1 February 1993, the court made an award of £1,362,655.11.</P>
      <P>The award is made up of £1,200,000 to the second corporate applicant and to the individual applicant jointly in respect of pecuniary damages, £50,000 to the individual applicant in respect of non-pecuniary damages, £42,655.11 for domestic costs and expenses and £70,000, together with any value-added tax that might be due, for the costs and expenses of the Strasbourg proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sum of £1,200,000 in respect of pecuniary damages includes interest since July 1992 at the rates applicable to Irish court proceedings.  The State has three months from the date of the judgment in which to pay the amount awarded by the European Court of <Col N="1836" /> Human Rights.  Any tax liability that might arise out of the court's award would be a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>The amount provided in the North-South and Anglo-Irish Co-operation subhead, subhead F, of the Department of Foreign Affairs Vote is used to assist organisations involved in reconcilation work and in efforts to create better understanding between people in both parts of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain.</P>
      <P>An amount of £115,000 was allocated originally to the subhead last year as the 1992 Estimates provision for this purpose. The provision in this year's Estimates is exactly the same.  However in the course of last year, certain costs relating to the Anglo-Irish political talks which took place during 1992 were also ascribed to the subhead.  The ascribing of these costs to subhead F in 1992, which accounts for the variation between the original allocation and the provisional outturn figure of £335,000 for that year, had no bearing on the amount which was actually available for distribution as grants under this subhead in 1992.  The amount available for distribution in 1993 will be exactly the same.</P>
      <P>I commend very valuable activities of organisations engaged in North-South and Anglo-Irish co-operation.  Despite the current very difficult budgetary situation, the 1993 allocation to the subhead has been maintained at the level of the original 1992 Estimates provision.  I very much hope that the budgetary circumstances next year will be such as to permit an interest allocation to be made to this subhead.</P>

      <P>Following the termination of the Exchequer funded special loans scheme in 1980 a scheme (referred to as the Development Finance Scheme) was agreed between ICC Bank and the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme, the Exchequer accepted 40 per cent of the credit risk on certain high risk loans, (for industrial development purposes in the manufacturing and tourism sectors), advanced by ICC Bank from its own funds.  On normal commercial criteria, ICC Bank would not otherwise have advanced loans of the amounts involved to their clients.</P>
      <P>The scheme was terminated at the end of October 1990.</P>
      <P>The expenditure of £977,000 in 1992 covers the losses attributable to the Exchequer, incurred by ICC Bank under this scheme for the year ended 31 October, 1991.  The 1993 provision of £1,250,000 provides for the losses attributable to the Exchequer which are expected to arise under the scheme for the year ended 31 October 1992.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to payment of child benefit is governed by regulations which confer the entitlement on the child's mother in the first instance.  However, if she so wishes, a mother can nominate the child's father, or another person, to receive child benefit on her behalf.  In situations where the couple are living apart entitlement is given to whichever parent the child is residing with.</P>
      <P>This situation is in line with the recommendation of the First Commission on the Status of Women (1972), which took the view that the best way of ensuring that child benefit was used for the benefit of the child was to have it paid to the mother.  The priority given to the mother is not regarded as anomalous in situations where a separated couple have joint custody of the children.</P>

      <P>Allowances such as free electricity, free natural gas, free telephone rental and free television licence are subject to a &ldquo;living alone&rdquo; condition. However, the living alone condition allows certain persons to live with the pensioners without affecting entitlement. For example, in the case of the free electricity allowance, a dependent spouse or child or, in the case of an invalid, a carer may live with the recipient.

      <P>(2)  Subhead F refers to lone parent's allowance, which provides for meanstested payments to parents bringing up children on their own.  The increase is due mainly to an increase in the estimated average number of recipients in 1993.</P>
      <P>(3)  Subhead E refers to Unemployment Assistance payments, including payments to smallholders.  The increase is due mainly to an increase in the estimated Live Register of the unemployed in 1993.</P>

      <P>The number of persons committed to prison for failure to comply with a court order to make payments in discharge of a civil debt was 219 for the 12 month period from 24 February, 1992 to 23 February, 1993 and the average sentence imposed by the courts was 24 days.  The information sought by the Deputy as to the average period spent in custody by such persons is not readily available and could not be obtained without an inordinate expenditure of staff time.  It should be noted that the average period spent in custody by debtors would be less than the average period of committal imposed by the courts because, in practice, some debtors make payment either on committal or shortly after committal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order that the impact of the foregoing on prison accommodation may be properly understood I should explain that the number of persons committed to prison for non-payment of debt represents a small fraction only of the total committals to custody in any year.  Such <Col N="1852" /> persons occupy less than 1 per cent of prison space on an annualised basis.</P>
    <P>Nobody may be committed to prison merely for non-payment of debt.  Commital usually takes place only after all other avenues to enforce the debt have been exhausted.  In fact a person may be committed to prison only for failure to comply with a Court Order to make payments of a debt, an order which may be made only after examination of means designed to establish that the person can pay.  Only those with the capacity to make payment may be committed.  The question of introducing a system of attachment of earnings to secure payment of debts is under examination at present. Any proposals which may emerge will be announced in the usual way in due course.</P>

      <P>The principal determining factor in arriving at departmental allocations for 1993 is the constraints inherent in the overall budgetary situation. This accounts for several areas of my Department's Vote, including Vote 34.J &mdash; the Science and Technology Development Programme &mdash; which are the subject of a decreased allocation.</P>
      <P>I should, however, point out to the Deputy that the reduction in the voted amount for the S&amp;T Development Programme is offset by an additional £13.416 million which is being directly co-financed, for the first time this year, by the EC Commission.  This additional funding is being provided for a new measure under the Structural Funds-supported Operational Programme for Industry and will assist in-company research and development projects.  When this allocation &mdash; which is not provided from within the Vote &mdash; is taken into account, the total expenditure on the S&amp;T Development Programme amounts to £34.381 million, an increase of 30 per cent on the 1992 outturn.</P>
      <P>The general effect of the reduction in the voted amount will be to reduce the level of ongoing activities under the programme and to delay the commencement of certain new activities planned for 1993.</P>

      <P>The apparent reduction of 54 per cent exaggerates the actual reduction between the two years in that the equivalent allocation for 1992 included a special once-off allocation of £300,000 to enable the Irish Productivity Centre to carry our a major restructuring which was considered necessary by the management, in addition to a provision &mdash; £25,000 &mdash; for special pay increases brought forward from this year.</P>
      <P>Therefore the real reduction in the 1993 allocation is of the order of 25 per cent.  This is in line with the policy of phasing out Exchequer funding for the centre over a three-year period in order to allow it to operate on a wholly commercial basis.</P>

      <P>My colleague the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has overall responsibility for Irish citizens abroad.  My responsibilities relate to the welfare of Irish workers in Britain and to the general question of free movement of workers within the EC.</P>
      <P>The only funds available to my Department for assisting Irish workers abroad are allocated for the purpose of alleviating the problems and hardships encountered by some Irish emigrants to Britain.  These funds are very specifically targeted at problem areas.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to say that the sum allocated has been maintained at £500,000 this year, despite the reduction in emigration and the difficult Exchequer position.</P>

      <P>A total of £149.265 million in Exchequer funding has been made available to FÁS in 1993 of which £83.811 million has been allocated for the social employment scheme.  This amount, together with EC funding of £97 million <Col N="1857" /> approximately, will enable the provision of about 50,000 opportunities on FÁS programmes this year.  Average participation in training will be 14,500 which is on a par with last year's outturn.  The funding available for the social employment scheme represents an increase of about £10.5 million on the 1992 expenditure level.  This will allow average participation on the scheme of 13,500 as against an average of 12,000 in 1992.</P>
      <P>The broad thrust of yesterday's budget was to generate economic growth leading to the creation of sustainable employment. In particular the jobs fund for which £250 million is being provided in 1993 is designed to promote recovery and job creation.  In addition, the Government is pressing ahead with the establishment of the county enterprise partnership boards.  An allocation of £25 million is being provided for the boards which will support local initiative and development through assisting the start up of small enterprises.  The boards will also initiate activity under a nationwide series of community development programmes.</P>

      <P>The exceptionally low figure for 1983 was due to the greatly reduced level of applications in the period 1980 to 1983 following the &ldquo;amnesty&rdquo; for provisional licences in 1979 and the fact that the &ldquo;accompanied&rdquo; rule for provisional licence holders did not apply during that period.</P>

    <P>The average waiting period for a test, nationally, is now eight and a half weeks, <Col N="1858" /> compared to 34 weeks in October, 1989, 14 weeks in October, 1986 and seven weeks in October 1983.  Persons who genuinely need a test quickly can normally be accommodated.  I am satisfied, therefore, that the present situation is satisfactory and that no changes are necessary at this stage.</P>

      <P>The main reason for the increase is the additional provision for new planting by the private sector in 1993.  Provision is being made for the grant-aiding of over 12,000 hectares in 1993 compared to just over 9,400 hectares in 1992.  Increased provision is also required for second instalment grants and farmer premium payments.</P>

      <P>It is now widely recognised that badgers play a role in the transmission of Bovine TB and there is a growing body of scientific evidence to support this opinion.</P>
      <P>With regard to control, badgers are a protected species under the Wildlife Act, 1976, and may only be removed under licence.  Where my Department is satisfied that there is a probable link between badgers and an outbreak of bovine TB in cattle application is made to the Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works for a licence to remove badgers for post-mortem. Applications are considered in the context of an agreed programme of research aimed at determining what role the badger plays in the transmission of bovine TB.  Badgers are removed by shooting and are brought to the most conveniently located veterinary laboratory for post-mortem examination and disposal.  The overall position nationally is that 1,547 badgers were removed for research in 1992.</P>
      <P>There are a number of ongoing research projects including the quantifying of the number of badgers in the country and the incidence of TB in the badger population as well as examination of the extent to which the removal of badgers influences the level of bovine TB.  It is planned to commence a feasibility study shortly into the development of a vaccine for use in badgers and possibly other species.</P>

      <P>The green pound devaluation of 8.2 per cent secured by Ireland with effect from 3 February has effectively resulted in an increase in national currency terms of 9 per cent in agricultural support prices, which will undoubtedly result in a considerable increase in returns to Irish farmers this year which will help compensate for losses experienced in the recent years.  I am happy to report that already farmers are experiencing improved trading conditions as prices paid to producers are already on the increase.  During the next 12 months further benefits will accrue to producers as the various subsidies and premia payable under the Common Agricultural Policy are increased by about 9 per cent in Irish pounds.  In a full year I expect that the effects of the green pound change on incomes in the agriculture, food and forestry <Col N="1881" /> sectors should amount to around £150 million.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the benefit for farmers are considerable and even taking into account an increase in the cost of imported inputs, the net effect will be very positive in terms of farm incomes.</P>
      <P>The green pound was not devalued to the full extent of the devaluation agreed within the ERM.  In conformity with the Community's agri-monetary rules a 2 per cent devaluation option, which must be exercised within 12 months from 3 February was retained.  I took this decision in the interests of the longer term development of the Irish food industry. It is in my view important to ensure that the new support prices do not tilt the balance too much in favour of intervention as against sales to the market. For this reason a full devaluation was not sought and it is my view that our competitive position in the market has been greatly enhanced by this decision.  I have undertaken to keep the position under constant review in the months ahead.</P>

      <P>In so far as the operational programme for the control of farmyard pollution is concerned, the position is that the EC Structural Funds allocated to Ireland under this measure have been fully committed, and it has not been possible to deal with any further applications under this scheme for some time.  It may, however, be possible to re-open the scheme in the coming months.  In any event, I will be seeking to ensure maximum support for continuation of the control of farmyard pollution scheme in the context of Ireland's submission for the next round of Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently drawing up a scheme to give effect to the Agri-Environment element of Common Agricultural Policy reform.  The aim of this measure is to aid farmers who undertake to engage in farming practices compatible with the requirements of protection of the environment and maintenance of the countryside.</P>

      <P>Children seen by the Western Health Board's school dental service from Mayo are <Col N="1912" /> referred for screening for orthodontic treatment in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department.  Urgent cases, such as cleft palate, are treated as a matter of urgency.  There has been a significant improvement in the level of orthodontic services in the Mayo area as a result of the additional money made available since 1990.  A total of 700 children are currently receiving orthodontic treatment.  A full time Consultant Orthodontist has recently taken up appointment with the Western Health Board which will result in further improvement in the provision of orthodontic services in the region.  This appointment will enable the board to develop a comprehensive orthodontic service and will facilitate the provision of training in orthodontics for the board's dental staff.  According to a recent return made to my Department by the Western Health Board the position regarding orthodontic treatments in County Mayo is as follows:</P>

      <P>I am glad to confirm that I have <Col N="1917" /> included the project for Kilmessan in the National School Capital Programme for 1993.  Tenders will be invited shortly and the project should proceed to contract in the second half of the year.</P>
      <P>Because of other demands, deemed to be of higher priority, which had to take precedence, it was not possible to include the extension of Robinstown National School in the National School Capital Programme for 1993.  Tender documents for the project have been prepared and it will continue to be considered for inclusion in the programme in the light of available resources and other commitments and priorities.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a national school is determined by the enrolment in the school on the 30 September of the previous year.</P>
      <P>In the case of St. Peter Apostle Junior national school there were 355 pupils enrolled on the 30 September, 1991.  This number warranted a staff of Principal plus 11 assistants for the 1992/93 school year.  The school also has the services of a full-time remedial teacher, a concessionary teacher under the special scheme for schools serving disadvantaged areas and an assistant in charge of a special class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were 326 pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September 1992, a drop of 29 pupils compared with the preceding year.  While the staffing arrangements for the 1993/94 school year have not yet been finalised, an enrolment of <Col N="1918" /> 326 would warrant a staff of Principal plus ten assistants.</P>
    <P>In the case of St. Peter Apostle Senior national school there were 350 pupils enrolled on the 30 September, 1991.  This number warranted a staff of Principal and 11 assistants for the 1992/93 school year. The school also has the services of a full-time remedial teacher, a concessionary teacher under the special scheme for schools serving disadvantaged areas, two assistants in charge of special classes.</P>
    <P>A home-school liaison teacher is shared between the schools.  There were 306 pupils enrolled in the school on the 30 September 1992, a drop of 44 pupils compared with the preceding year.  While the staffing arrangements for the 1993/94 school year have not yet been finalised, an enrolment of 306 would warrant a staff Principal plus 10 assistants.</P>
    <P>My Department will be in touch with the authorities in both schools regarding staffing as soon as the arrangements have been finalised.</P>

These costs include the remuneration and superannuation of non-teaching staff, as well as the maintenance of pupils and other non-paying expenses.  Also covered by this Vote is the expenditure on courses in child care for staff of these schools and the transport services for home visitations by pupils.  A new centre for boys and an expanded centre for girls were opened on a phased basis in 1991.  Both these centres reached full operational capacity, with full staffing in late 1992. The increased provision in the Vote for 1993 takes account of the centre being fully operational for the full year.</P>

My Department is in consultation with the school authorities in the matter.</P>
