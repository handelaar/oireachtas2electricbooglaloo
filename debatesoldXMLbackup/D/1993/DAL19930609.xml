      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Before dealing with the Order of Business proper I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 30 from Deputy John Bruton.  I now call on Deputy Bruton to state the matter of which he has given notice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Standing Order 30 I wish to raise the proposal to make decisions behind closed doors permitting the Dáil to spend £12.5 billion of EC and Irish money &mdash; approximately £10,000 for each household &mdash; without either the prior approval of the Dáil or the publication of the costly research on how the money can best be spent.  I request a Dáil debate on a motion under Standing <Col N="2" /> Order 30 instructing the Government to publish the ESRI report on the Structural Funds and to submit its proposals for use of those funds to Dáil Éireann prior to submission to the European Commission in view of the Dáil's clear responsibility for public finances under Article 17.2 of the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 4, 5 and 2.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing <Col N="3" /> Orders, that: (1) the sitting shall not be suspended at 1.30 p.m. today; (2) Nos. 4 and 5 shall be decided without debate; (3) the Second Stage of No. 2 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 6.45 p.m.; (4) the Select Committee on Social Affairs shall meet on Friday, 11 June at 10.15 a.m. to consider and conclude all Estimates relevant to the Department of Education; and (5) Private Members' Business shall be No. 12 and the proceedings thereon shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m. today.</P>

Is the proposal for dealing with No. 2, that Nos. 4 and 5 shall be decided without debate, agreed?  Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with the Second Stage of No. 2 agreed?  Agreed.  Are the proposals for the meeting of the Select Committee on Social Affairs agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <P>On item No. 4, the fact that this matter has to appear on the Order of Business to make an order for the committee to sit on Friday indicates that the committee system is not working and that it is unsatisfactory.  Has the Government any proposals in regard to this matter because if the system does not work satisfactorily the Dáil should sit four days a week as was the case previously?</P>

      <P>As previously stated, the committee system will be reviewed at the end of this session and there are no plans to review it before that.  This matter is referred to on the Order of Business, not to instruct the committee to meet on Friday, but to ensure that the Estimate is concluded because if Estimates are not concluded on the days specified there will be time <Col N="4" /> tabling problems towards the end of June.</P>

      <P>A number of EC directives and legislation do not pertain directly to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the House is well aware of the threat of 1,000 redundancies in Aer Lingus and the cloud hanging over every family involved with the national airine.  In regard to promised business, will the Government allow the Dáil to take the Revised Estimate for Transport and Communications which concerns this area under item No. 7, Estimates for the Public Service?  Will it allow that matter to be dealt with by one of the committees in the Dáil next week so that we will have an opportunity to debate the widespread concern of Members of this House about the threat to so many jobs in Aer Lingus and the devastating effect on the economies of north County Dublin and further afield?</P>

      <P>Last week on the Order of Business I raised the question of the publication of an amendment to the Defence Act which was promised by the Government and I was told it would be published over the weekend.  That has not happened.  Will the Taoiseach indicate when the Government will decide on this matter and when an amendment, if any, will be brought before the House? Will he indicate also if the promise from the Ministers for Finance and Foreign Affairs to publish a discussion document on this proposal in advance of the matter being debated in the Dáil will be kept?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to introduce new arrangements for the operation of planning control in relation to future development by State authorities and to address, from the perspective of planning law, the position of development carried out up to now by these authorities.  It makes provision also for new arrangements for public notice and public participation in relation to proposed development by local authorities.  The measures proposed will establish an appropriate and effective framework for the regulation of development by Government Departments and the Commissioners of Public Works, and they will bring about greater openness and transparency in relation to development by those bodies and by local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals in the Bill derive primarily from commitments on the control of development by public bodies and local authorities included in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government,</i> which was published last January.  The precise form in which the proposals relating to development by Government Departments and the Commissioners of Public Works have been framed takes account, however, of the recent ruling of the Supreme Court in the cases relating to the development at Mullaghmore, County Clare and Luggala, County Wicklow.  Before proceeding to look in detail at these legislative proposals, it <Col N="15" /> may be useful to put matters in context by looking briefly at the history of development by State authorities and its relationship with planning law.</P>
    <P>State authorities have carried out a very large volume and variety of development over the years, including the construction of Government offices and other public buildings, piers and harbours, telephone exchanges and post offices, military facilities, works related to the preservation and restoration of historic buildings and national monuments, and civil engineering operations of various kinds.  Much of this development has been carried out by the Commissioners of Public Works, acting in their own right or on behalf of Government Departments, but various Ministers of the Government have also, over the years, been responsible directly for development and construction work.</P>
    <P>In recent years, the range of development carried out by State authorities has diminished somewhat, with the transfer of functions to State companies such as Telecom Éireann, An Post and Coillte Teoranta to which the Planning Acts apply in the ordinary way.  Nevertheless, State authorities are still responsible for a substantial ongoing programme of construction and civil engineering works, employing a significant number of persons.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that most of the projects undertaken by State authorities over the years generated little or no controversy at the time.  Those responsible for State development have striven to achieve high standards of development, and have succeeded in doing so in most cases.  It would be wrong, therefore, if the impression were to be given that this Bill is, in any way, a reflection on the work of State authorities, particularly the Office of Public Works, which has served the country well down through the years.  Instead, the Bill should be seen as part of a more modern approach to environmental and planning matters generally &mdash; an approach which responds to the demand for systems of public information and <Col N="16" /> involvement and which leads to greater transparency in decision-making.</P>
    <P>The starting point when one turns to look at the relationship between State authority development and planning law is the Town and Regional Planning Act, 1934, the precursor of the modern physical planning code.  Section 16 of that Act permitted Ministers and statutory bodies to co-operate with planning authorities and enter into agreements with them, but did not impose any binding requirements. When the Act of 1934 was replaced by the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, mandatory requirements for certain development by State authorities were introduced by section 84 of that Act.  This required State authorities to consult the relevant planning authority before constructing or extending a building, other than a building in connection with afforestation by the State.  It provided also for a form of arbitration role for the Minister for the Environment, requiring the promoting State authority to consult the Minister if objections raised by the planning authority were not resolved.</P>
    <P>The general understanding until recently was that the consultation requirments under section 84 represented the full extent of State authorities' obligations under planning law and that planning permission was not required for development undertaken by or for them. Acting on this understanding, State authorities have not applied for permission for any development carried out since the 1963 Act came into operation on 1 October 1964.</P>
    <P>Times have changed greatly since the 1963 Act became law.  People now rightly demand more openness and accountability from public bodies generally and expect to have a greater say in relation to decisions which may affect their lives. It was against this background that a commitment to new provisions for development by public bodies was included in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>
    <P>Specifically, the programme indicated that public bodies would be required by law to comply, in general, with the information <Col N="17" /> procedures contained in the planning laws.  The underlying intention was to ensure significanlty enhanced public information about, and involvement with, State development.  However, when I came to consider how this objective could best be achieved, I concluded that State development should, in general, be made subject to planning controls in the same way as private projects. Accordingly, I proposed to the Government that, subject only to certain exceptions which I will outline later, State authority development should be subject to the normal planning permission requirements.  The Government approved this proposal last March but the precise form the legislation should take had to await the outcome of the legal proceedings relating to the Mullaghmore and Luggala developments.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, there was a general understanding until recently that State authorities' only obligations under planning law were those set out in section 84 of the 1963 planning Act.  However, the question of whether development by these authorities needs planning permission was raised in the Mullaghmore and Luggala cases and, as Deputies will be aware, different rulings were given in the High Court.  The matter was, therefore, brought to the Supreme Court on appeal to obtain a definitive statement of the existing law.  This was essential so that the Government's proposals for the future regulation of State authority development could be finalised by reference to a correct understanding of the existing position.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court ruled on 26 May last that State authority development requires planning permission.  This ruling did not affect the fundamentals of the proposals already approved by the Government for the regulation of State development, but it influenced the content of the Bill in two ways.  In the first place, it made it necessary to address the position of development already carried out without planning permission by State authorities.  Second, the fact that planning permission has been held to be required under existing law makes it <Col N="18" /> unnecessary to include any provision in the Bill to apply planning controls to the general body of State authority development; the absence of such a provision may have led to some initial misunderstanding of the effects of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the development already carried out or in progress by State authorities, it would be wholly impractical and unreasonable to expect State authorities to apply for permission to retain all development since 1964.  To do so would result in a diversion of scarce resources to searching through records to identify development carried out and to drawing up planning applications for retention permission.  Such a course of action would also clog the planning process with applications which would be of purely historical interest at this stage, and frustrate the crucial objective of ensuring that current applications are dealt with as expeditiously as possible.  The appropriate course is to wipe the slate clean by providing that planning permission shall not be, and shall be deemed never to have been, required for development completed before the relevant provision of section 5 of the Bill comes into operation.</P>
    <P>As well as rectifying in planning terms the position of completed development, the validating provision in section 5 (1) will also regularise development which was in progress when the Supreme Court gave its ruling.  It would not be reasonable to suspend work on such projects while planning permission is sought, because of the contractual problems, disruption and loss of employment which would, inevitably, arise.</P>
    <P>It would not be appropriate, however, for a validating provision of this nature to extend to specific cases in which a court has already ruled that planning permission is necessary for development, or to any other case in which a court gives a ruling on the need for planning permission in proceedings which were initiated before the Supreme Court gave its ruling in the Mullaghmore and Luggala cases on 26 May last.  The proviso in section 5 (1) will restrict the subsection accordingly.  In practical terms, this <Col N="19" /> means that the validation will not extend to the Mullaghmore and Luggala developments, or to any other case in which a court rules that permission is required and the proceedings in question were initiated before the Supreme Court ruling.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the Government decided that applications for planning permission are to be made, following the widest possible consultation with all interested parties over a period of two months, in relation to the developments at Mullaghmore and Luggala and in the Boyne Valley.</P>
    <P>Having outlined the effect of the Bill in relation to development carried out or in progress, I move on to look at the application of planning law to future development.</P>
    <P>As I have explained, the fundamental proposal in this regard is that State authority development will generally be subject to normal planning permission requirements, with the same exemptions for minor works, repair and maintenance, etc., as currently apply to private development.  There must, however, be some limited exclusions to take account of the special nature of some State development, as well as provision for a smooth transition to a new regulatory framework.</P>
    <P>The proposed limited exceptions to the application of normal planning controls are provided for in section 2 of the Bill. This will give the Minister for the Environment power to provide, by regulations, that planning Acts will not apply to particular types of development by State authorities.  There are specific limits on the use which may be made of this power; it can be availed of only in relation to development which is related to public safety or order, the administration of justice or national security or defence, or where development is subject to authorisation in accordance with another statutory process.</P>
    <P>The reason for including a special provision in respect of development with a security dimension is, simply, that it would not be appropriate for development <Col N="20" /> of this nature to be subject to the detailed requirements as to submission and public availability of plans and paticulars which planning law lays down.  I am sure Deputies will recognise and accept this in the case of facilities such as prisons, courthouses and army installations. The fact that development may be taken outside the scope of normal planning controls on security grounds does not mean, however, that there will be no public information about, or involvement with, such development. Paragraph (b) of section 2(1) will allow the Minister for the Environment to establish, by regulations, procedures of public notice and consultation for development of this kind.  Provision could be made, for example, requiring a State authority proposing a new security related development to give public notice in a particular form, to make general information on the proposal available to the public, to allow an opportunity for public comment and to take account, in deciding whether to carry out the development, of any views expressed. The precise nature of the requirements to be applied to a particular form of development will depend, of course, on the security considerations involved, but it is my intention that section 2(1)(b) will be used to ensure that there is as much public information and consultation as possible for development of this kind.</P>
    <P>The other use which can be made of the power of exclusion under section 2(1) is to prevent the unnecessary duplication which could arise if planning permission had to be obtained for development which already has to be authorised through another statutory procedure.  It is my intention that development will be brought outside the remit of the planning process on these grounds only if I am fully satisfied that the other statutory procedure provides adequately for public notice, information and involvement.  An example of what I have in mind would be drainage works authorised in accordance with the arterial drainage Acts.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of section 2 contains the other exclusionary power.  It allows for an <i>ad hoc</i> decision to remove particular <Col N="21" /> development from planning control or from any alternative public notice or consultation requirements that may have been applied to it by regulations under subsection (1)(b).  Any Minister of the Government will have power to make an order bringing about such an exclusion, but only in the event of an accident or emergency or where development is otherwise necessary in the public interest.  This power is intended to cater for situations where works have to be carried out urgently to protect people or property following a natural disaster such as a major storm, or where work, or a material change of use, are needed to provide accommodation without delay for refugees who are taken into this country or others made homeless by some disaster. It could be used also where a specific development is deemed essential and urgent because of vital national strategic considerations.  The power is of a reserve nature; it will be called upon only in entirely exceptional circumstances and public notice will be given where it has been used.</P>
    <P>The other way in which the Bill will qualify the application of normal planning controls to development by State authorities is through the provision of a transitional period.  I mentioned earlier that there would be unacceptable disruption for projects which were in train when the Supreme Court gave its ruling if planning permission now had to be sought for all of them.  The same considerations apply in relation to projects in respect of which contractual commitments have already been entered into or which are at an advanced stage of planning.  Section 5 (2), section 6 and the commencement powers under section 7 (3) will, therefore, provide for this necessary transitional period.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (2) (a) proposes that planning permission will not be required for any development by State authorities commenced during the period of one year after the coming into operation of section 5.  I intend to bring section 5 into operation as soon as possible after the Bill is enacted.  Planning permission requirements will, therefore, generally apply to <Col N="22" /> State development from the middle of next year.  Until then, State authorities will continue to operate the consultation procedure under section 84 of the 1963 Act.  However, it is my intention at the end of the transitional period &mdash; that is, the middle of 1994 &mdash; to bring section 6 of the Bill into effect, thereby terminating the section 84 consultation procedure. Development by State authorities undertaken after the end of the transitional period which has undergone the section 84 consultation process by then will, under section 5 (2) (b) of this Bill, be authorised to proceed.</P>
    <P>Before moving on to consider what is proposed in relation to local authority development, I should refer briefly to section 3 of the Bill.  While the Supreme Court has now ruled that planning permission is needed for State authority development, the fact is that the Planning Acts were enacted on the understanding that State authorities would be bound only by section 84 consultations.  This means that it may be necessary to make minor technical modifications and adjustments to provisions of the Acts to facilitate their application to the State, and section 3 will authorise the Minister for the Environment to make these modifications and adjustments by regulations.</P>
    <P>As regards local authority works, the position at present is that local authority members already have power to make the final determination as to whether particular works are to proceed.  The manager of a local authority is required, by section 2 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, to inform the councillors before works, other than repair or maintenance works, are carried out.  This is so that the members can exercise, if they wish, their power under section 3 of that Act to direct that works are not to go ahead.  My objective, therefore, is to reinforce this position, while at the same time providing for more openness and transparency in relation to local authority development proposals.</P>
    <P>A local authority needs permission in the same way as a private developer for any development, other than road works, <Col N="23" /> which it wishes to undertake outside its own functional area.  Development within an authority's own area is exempted development for planning purposes and does not, therefore, need planning permission.  This is a necessary exemption because, clearly, it would make no sense to require authorities to apply to themselves for planning permission. This does not mean, however, that local authorities have an entirely free hand in relation to development in their own areas, because section 39 of the 1963 Planning Act prohibits the carrying out of any development which contravenes materially the development plan, and the development plan, as we know, is adopted only after extensive public consultation.</P>
    <P>There is already a system of public notice and consultation for certain major development in a local authority's own area, through the environmental impact assessment procedures set up to implement the EC directive on that matter.  However, there are no such requirements for most other projects within a local authority's own jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill will, therefore, give the Minister for the Environment power to make regulations laying down requirements as to the giving of public notice, the public availability of plans and particulars, an opportunity for public comment and the submission of a report on proposed development to the elected members.  It is my intention that these requirements would apply to projects not already subject to public consultation requirements, other than minor works or works required by law or by court order to be carried out.  I intend also that the new requirements will come into operation after a suitable transitional period, which will be essential to avoid disruption to projects at an advanced stage of planning. They will, however, come into operation not later than the end of the one year transitional period which section 5 will establish for State authority development.</P>
    <P>The new requirement to submit a <Col N="24" /> report on proposed development to the elected members which will be established through regulations under section 4 will, in my view, strengthen their position by ensuring that they will have all necessary information and thus be able to give balanced and careful consideration to all the issues involved.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment to having open, effective and relevant procedures for dealing with development by State and local authorities.  It constitutes a significant movement towards greater transparency and accountability in relation to such development.  I look forward to contributions from all sides of the House so that when we have completed our work on this Bill we will have effective legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The proper planning and development of our country, county by county, is one of the most important functions of local government.  Together with programmes on housing, roads and sanitary services, the drawing up and reviewing of development plans rates as one of the most important areas of responsibility for the councillor.  The development plan is the councillor's plan, not that of management or executives.  The democratically elected members bring to the council chambers an intimate knowledge of their functional area and the needs and wishes of the electorate.  This knowledge and experience, together with professional guidance of planners and engineers, results in plans that reflect the best way forward for the next five years or so for the proper planning and development of the functional area in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been a member of a local authority for 19 years and have been involved in several reviews of our development plan.  There have been many contentious issues to deal with, not least of which was the zoning of an area for a nuclear power station.  Many hours have been spent, even in recent months, thrashing out issues in our current review of the development plan.  Councillors have proposed amendments to the draft development plan and in all cases compromise <Col N="25" /> and agreement has been reached with planners and management.  On some issues councillors bowed in favour of the technical advice from the professionals while on other issues management bowed to the express wishes of councillors and acknowledged the wisdom of councillors' local views on issues.  This balance between professional advice from the top table and the coal face experience of local representatives is essential to the production of a development plan which charts the way forward for orderly planning and efficient development, with both public and private sectors in harmoney recognising the best interests of the functional area in question.</P>
    <P>Autocratic management removed from the needs of the community and failing to understand the natural evolution of the village and town nuclei will not evoke co-operation from the local representative.  Conversely, representatives who cannot accept the professional advice of management on certain issues have the added responsibility, as lay people, of making important decisions on critical planning and economic issues against the wishes of the Executive.  This latter scenario is very rare in local government.  I value the statutory functions and independence of the democratically elected councillors to formulate their own development plans and a lot can be learned from careful analysis when there is a breakdown of what should be a symbiotic relationship between councillors and their executive, planners, engineers and managers.  My experience reinforces my view that it takes a lot to make councillors reject sound managerial advice on planning and development.  When they do, searching questions need to be answered as to how that evolved, not least the question as to whether the advice in the first place was sound.  I have no doubt that intransigence on both sides and failure to accommodate the other view is not in the best interests of proper planning and development of any area.</P>
    <P>This Bill extends the application of the planning Acts from 1963 to 1992 to development by the State and State authorities. <Col N="26" /> It also retrospectively validates all such development to date carried out on the understanding that planning permission was not required &mdash; that was until the recent Supreme Court judgment.  The Bill excludes from this general validation any project which is or has been the subject of court action, such as the interpretative centres at Mullaghmore and Luggala.  The Minister has taken upon himself the power to give an amnesty under the provisions of this Bill to any State development underway, to protect contractual commitments and jobs and to allow for what the Minister calls an orderly transition to the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>While I sympathise with the Minister's rationale to a certain extent on this matter, he is not observing either the letter or the spirit of the Supreme Court judgment in this regard and as a result he could find himself involved in court proceedings with disgruntled objectors.</P>
    <P>The Minister also provides in this Bill for his right to exclude certain developments from planning control &mdash; developments in the areas of justice, defence and security, or which is more sinister, developments which are subject to other statutory authorisation processes.  The Minister retains the ultimate control in cases of emergency or accident, in that under the terms of this Bill he may make an order excluding a development from any planning controls.  This power, the Minister assures us, will be confined to special cases where development would be necessary in the public interest.  I cannot quibble with that provision.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduces changes in the case of development by local authorities within their own functional area.  I am less than satisfied with these changes, not least because an objector will not have the right to appeal the decision of the councillors to either An Bord Pleanála or the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    <P>In section 1 there is an omission in that there is no definition of &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo;, referred to throughout the Bill.  As far as I am concerned, it is the Minister for the Environment and that should be amended <Col N="27" /> on Committee Stage.  In regard to regulations section 2 (3) reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister may by regulations modify or adapt any provision of the Acts....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here, the Minister is taking upon himself to proceed further down a road about which there is some doubt by virtue of the High Court judgment in March, the so called clenbuterol or angel dust judgment, in relation to whether we are in order in proceeding to repeal enactments or existing legislation by way of regulation.  Perhaps when replying, the Minister will refer to present Government thinking as this whole issue of regulations comes into several sections.  There is quite a lot of concern and confusion in the legal profession, apart from environmentalists, about whether we are in order in proceeding in this way.  I hope the Minister will take some amendments on board; in any event this issue should be clarified.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (1) (a) deals with, among other things, the exclusion from planning permission in certain areas of justice, national security, defence and public safety.  The Minister will be going too far if he takes all those exclusions to himself. I agree that in relation to public safety or order the Minister needs some element of control in an emergency but the routine administration of justice, national security and defence, such as the construction of jails or military airports, do not need to be entirely excluded from the planning process.  There is no reason outline planning permission should not be required for such constructions or developments. We do not need to know where every door, cell and safe is to be in each jail and we do not need detailed full planning permission for such constructions but outline planning permission dealing with the nature, character and the location of the development should apply.  The public are entitled to be involved at least through the level of outline planning permission in the areas where the Minister would now ask for exclusion.  An objector should have the right to appeal to An <Col N="28" /> Bord Pleanála at the very least.  There is omission from the appeal procedure in other areas.  We must look again at An Bord Pleanála and the Environmental Protection Agency.  At this point An Bord Pleanála would be the right avenue for appeal.  I ask the Minister to allow for outline planning permission in the areas dealt with by section 2 (1) (a) (i) and to provide an appeal avenue for objectors generally.</P>
    <P>The exclusion which relates to an area looked after by another enactment or authorisation process is a little sinister.  I am not sure why the Minister needs this provision.  He mentioned arterial drainage. Any development on the foreshore for example, would be excluded and it appears that all mining and extraction processes will be excluded.  That is a hornet's nest.  There are extreme views on both sides but there is a middle road which makes solid sense in respecting environmental concerns while allowing reasonable access to ore.  Am I right in interpreting 2 (1) (a) (ii) to exclude all prospecting licences and all the authorisations already in place in relation to mining and the extraction of ore?  It is unnecessary to have these exclusions.  If environmental impact statements are needed we should not be concerned about duplication.  The EIS could be prepared and submitted as part of the planning application.  There will be no duplication as the planning authority will not have to go over the ground already covered by the EIS.  I am not comfortable with the exclusions the Minister is allowing here.</P>
    <P>Another subsection needs to be added after section 2 (1) (b) ensuring that all development is carried out in conformity with the current development plan.  The Minister refers in his opening address to conformity with the development plan, but it needs to be stated in the Bill.  An eighth paragraph expressly stating that there should be conformity to the development plan would be extremely helpful in this area.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with section 3.  The provisions of section 4 have to do with regulations being made in respect of any cases <Col N="29" /> or specified classes of cases of development proposed.  I am not comfortable about those provisions.  The provisions of section 4 also omit any appeal process which I contend must be included when we reach Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>On an initial reading of the provisions of this Bill and looking at the 1963 Act I felt the Bill would have been improved by an explicit requirement for planning permission.  Nonetheless I accept the very neat point made in section 6 where, in one sentence, the Minister states and requires what might otherwise have needed several paragraphs if one inserted an explicit requirement for planning permission.  Perhaps we can talk about that on Committee Stage when discussing this section.  There are some who still feel that an explicit requirement for planning permission might strengthen the provisions of the Bill rather than just removing the requirement for consultation only.  I will bow to the Minister's advice and wisdom in this area.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (2) (a) refers to any development commenced by or on behalf of a State authority during a period of one year beginning on the commencement of this section, or in respect of which planning permission will not be required. Could we have a definition of &ldquo;development&rdquo;? For example, at what stage does a seminal thought in some developer's head become an actual development proposal? Is it when plans are drawn up? Is it when contractual commitments are made.  This could be the subject of litigation unless the Minister can clarify what he means by &ldquo;any development&rdquo; within the context of this subsection.  For example, if initial plans are on the drawing board, will a development be considered to have commenced?  Will any plan on any piece of paper constitute the commencement of a development and so exclude the relevant developer from the requirement to obtain planning permission within this 12 month period?  I do not know.</P>

      <P>These are issues for which senior counsel and the legal profession generally thank us.  Lack of clarity in this House certainly helps others in different quarters earn a very good living.  The time the contract is placed should be deemed to be the commencement of a development within the meaning of this subsection.  Once contractual commitments are made it will be difficult to go back and apply for planning permission. Jobs will be at stake and a lot of money will already have been invested.  It could complicate the position considerably.  I would ask the Minister to clarify that position.</P>
      <P>We shall be discussing detailed amendments on Committee Stage.  We will be opposing this Bill because of its negation of the spirit of the Supreme Court judgment.  If a law applies to citizens it applies also to the State.  This Bill lacks democracy, transparency and accountability in too many areas.  There are too many exclusions or get-outs allowed by the Minister within the areas of local authority development, security, defence, justice and, very intriguingly, in relation to development subject to other statutory authorisation processes.</P>

      <P>Some people may welcome this Bill but they do not include very many on this side of the House.  If this Bill were a well thought out proposal following on the promises given in the Programme for Government I would find it hard to fault the Government and would welcome at least some aspects of such a Bill.  Unfortunately, as stated in the explanatory memorandum, this Bill has been introduced as an immediate response to the ruling of the Supreme Court that the controversial interpretative centres could not go ahead because the Office of Public Works did not have planning permission therefor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose many people would find it difficult to credit the political ineptitude which characterises this sorry episode in Irish political life.  It is all the harder to credit bearing in mind the other political inept events of recent weeks, such as the proposed increased telephone charges <Col N="31" /> and tax amnesty which caused an outrage across the spectrum of our society.  Irish people do not believe that the end justifies the means and do not approve of rewarding rich law breakers.  I should not like to be a member of the Government when people begin to receive their revised telephone bills in the near future.</P>
    <P>I would describe this so-called partnership Government as morally tawdry and political inept; it is big but very definitely not beautiful.  This latest example of how this Bill came about tells its own story.  The Government sat on its hands until forced into action by the commitment of volunteers who challenged the decision to proceed with the interpretative centres all the way to the Supreme Court.  The Government sat on its hands and watched, as the Minister admitted, as if this were a soap opera. Why was not the whole <i>débacle</i> sorted out in the course of the protracted negotiations for a partnership Government? How is it that, despite the Labour Party's general election manifesto commitment to &ldquo;a reversal of current policy on interpretative centres&rdquo; the suitors chose to ignore this highly contentious subject in their Programme for Government? How is it that nobody noticed that the Programme for Government actually contained a particular section entitled &ldquo;Our Heritage&rdquo;?  Despite the certain knowledge that the siting of the controversial interpretative centres was being challenged, no effort was made to resolve the political differences of which we were then aware and which remain evident?  In the case of the Burren National Park visitors centre costs incurred have reached at least £1.5 million. We are constantly being told by this Government that this or that cannot be done because of lack of money and so on, yet the same Government watched, like a cinema audience eating popcorn, while a sum of £1.5 million went down the tubes.</P>
    <P>Then we had the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht engaging in his principled performance, pretending to want the Burren interpretative centre <Col N="32" /> relocated.  While he advanced an alternative proposal, work went ahead anyway.  We learned subsequently from the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Noel Dempsey that an alternative proposal would cost in the region of £7.3 million, excluding the purchase price of the land involved.</P>
    <P>Many of our young population are currently sitting examinations to win the requisite points to gain access to third-level education or obtain jobs.  On the performance of the past three months, neither the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht nor the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Noel Dempsey, would gain the relevant points for Ministeries.  Looking at their performance kindly, one might award them an E grade, or perhaps no grade in some instances.  Who did the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht think he was fooling?  Why did not the subject of interpretative centres figure on the agenda in the course of the protracted talks on the formation of this partnership Government?  It never arose because this Government will not face up to political realities and does not have good judgment.  Its arrogance is based on its numerical strength, though few of their Members are present to hear this debate today.  This Government adds up to less than the sum of its parts &mdash; it is a case of adding two and two together and getting three and a half.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision of the Supreme Court on the interpretative centres as an indication of the democratic process and the people's right to open, accountable Government.  Government and State agencies should be accountable for their actions.  Despite its stated intentions the Government has been forced into transparency in its actions, but it has had to be forced.</P>
    <P>I might give another example.  The Minister for the Environment has within the last week or so introduced regulations to implement the EC Directive on Freedom of Access to Information on the Environment, to which Deputy Doyle has already referred.  These regulations fall far short of what is needed.  This halfhearted <Col N="33" /> response appears to be based on some type of restricted &ldquo;need to know attitude&rdquo; rather than openness or so-called transparency.  So far we have had no time to debate these issues, something to which I want to return.  I agree totally with Deputy Doyle in her expressed doubts about the way the Government is operating by way of regulation.  What is the Minister afraid of?  Is this some type of paternalistic protectionism?  From whom are we being protected?  Is it from the so-called golden circle about which we hear so much?</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister recently made statements in which he was critical of the planning process.  In particular he voiced criticism of councillors from his own party for their developer-led consideration of the development plan for Dublin County Council.  While I share these misgivings, I should point out that Dublin County Council is still engaged in its examination of the plan which was due to be submitted in 1991 and that the Minister has granted a number of extensions to allow the council complete its review.  As recently as 14 May he granted an extension to 31 December.  The Minister has emphasised that there is an urgent need to complete the review and I agree with him wholeheartedly but he is being disingenuous in criticising councillors at this late stage without first explaining what his views are and what the philosophy behind decisions should be so that his party's councillors will be under no misapprehension about what they should be doing.</P>
    <P>I suggested recently that we should adopt the same mechanism in dealing with rezoning motions in relation to a development plan as was adopted at the behest of the Progressive Democrats in regard to decisions on material contraventions of an existing plan.  The Minister dismissed this suggestion and said that such matters should be carried out on the basis of simple majority decisions. On the face of it that may amount to democracy but what about the fear of possible abuses?  Why not give the public the reassurances they deserve?  This is what the Progressive Democrats did <Col N="34" /> when in Government.  I am sure the guardians of political ethics, the Minister's partners in Government, would agree with a proposal that on rezoning motions a two-thirds majority should be required and that there should be a clause insisting that only councillors from the relevant area could propose such a motion given that planning is an emotive issue.  There is a body of opinion which states that at worst it is open to corruption and at best bad decision making.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision of the Supreme Court that the planning laws apply to the Office of Public Works and other State agencies as much as to any ordinary citizen, company or organisation. The Bill acknowledges this but unfortunately it bears all the hallmarks of rushed, ill-considered legislation.  It is fundamentally flawed and is a minimal reaction which the Minister has been pushed into by the Supreme Court judgment.  In general, it is very permissive in its language.  It gives wide discretionary powers not only to the Minister for the Environment but to any Minister and does not provide for any appeals mechanism in respect of decisions made by local authorities.  It may also be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>A brief examination of the Bill will show its shortcomings.  On Committee Stage tomorrow we will go through it in greater depth but I would like to give a number of examples at this stage.  Section 2 refers to development by State authorities and provides that the planning Acts shall not apply to specified categories of development by or on behalf of State authorities and provides for a procedure of public notice and consultation. What does this mean?  The section is very wide and open to interpretation. It is not enough for the Minister to give a vague promise that there will be a procedure of public notice and consultation or to talk in vague terms about regulations that may be made some time in the future.  We need to know what exactly is being put before us.</P>
    <P>I have my doubts also as to whether section 2 (2) (a) is constitutional as it appears that a Minister will be empowered <Col N="35" /> to make an order that the planning Acts will not apply.  Is the House being circumvented?  Are we allowed to do this?  Does the Constitution not forbid it? It is stated that it will be up to the Minister to decide but this flies in the face of the Constitution.  This means that the Minister will have discretionary powers.</P>
    <P>The wording of this section should be tightened considerably.  I intend to table an amendment in this regard.  Whatever about the need to exercise power, for the purposes of public safety and order and the administration of justice, why should a Minister be given wide discretionary powers?  The Government is displaying arrogance.  What will happen next &mdash; Government by decree?  It is my intention to propose that section 3 be deleted.</P>
    <P>One would think that, as a local councillor, I would welcome section 4, which deals with regulations made for development carried out by local authorities. This part of the Bill is very weak.  As the Minister said, the local authorities are also the planning authorities.  One cannot apply to oneself for planning permission. Provision has not been made for an appeals mechanism.  To whom can one appeal against a decision?  I suggest that if county councillors make decisions in the absence of an appeals procedure it is likely that those who are offended will have recourse to the courts.  Councillors may base their decisions on well-founded reasons which may not be in keeping with strict planning criteria.  Even though we try to comply with the criteria laid down, every councillor who has the best of intentions will be open to representations in respect of the sad, bad case.  No allowance is made for this in the section.</P>
    <P>Provision should be made for an independent appeals body, such as An Bord Pleanála or the Environmental Protection Agency.  On foot of this the board could determine the adequacy of an environmental impact statement.</P>
    <P>It is not clear if provision is being made for an oral hearing or a submission as part of the consultative process with a local authority.  In normal circumstances this is a fundamental right where an <Col N="36" /> environmental impact statement is being prepared.  In the interests of transparency and openness, this should be part of the procedure.  I intend to examine this matter in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There is some doubt as to whether there is a need for section 5 in view of the judgment handed down on 12 February by Mr. Justice Costello and the subsequent enactment of the State Authorities (Development and Management) Act on 18 February.  The Bill as drafted does not specify the State development that requires planning permission as held by the Supreme Court in its judgment of 26 May.  On one reading it could allow the State to complete the development of the contentious interpretative centres.</P>
    <P>Section 5 will also allow a year's grace in respect of development carried out or commenced by or on behalf of State authorities without permission.  Any reasonable person would agree that there should be a period of grace to allow certain developments to proceed but the Minister should make it less open-ended. Why should we have to wait for a commencement order?  Could the Minister not state a reasonable date &mdash; for example, from 26 May last?  On a more positive note I am glad the Minister is repealing, in section 6, section 84 of the 1963 Act.</P>
    <P>This is a short Bill but it is being hurried through as an instant response to the Supreme Court decision.  It is flawed in many respects.  It is permissive in its tone. The use of the word &ldquo;May&rdquo; must cause concern and there must be some doubt about its constitutionality.  It is a bad Bill because it relies far too heavily on the Minister who will have discretionary power to enforce regulations.  At the very least the Minister should give a commitment that these regulations will be debated and voted on in Dáil Éireann in an effort to be open on this matter.  A great deal of concern has been expressed about the use of regulations.  The Minister could defuse this concern if he agreed to give a commitment that the regulations will be debated in the House.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to examine the planning <Col N="37" /> laws in their entirely as the existing legislation is fragmented and there is a need for a comprehensive overview and overhaul of the legislation.  It may be necessary in some circumstances to react but we should always look at the big picture.  It is the intention of the Progressive Democrats to oppose the Bill for the many reasons I have outlined.  I intend to table a number of amendments on Committee Stage which I hope the Minister will consider favourably as they would improve the Bill to some extent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;in view of:</P>
      <P>(a)  the failure of the Bill to provide for equal application of the planning laws between State bodies and private citizens,</P>
      <P>(b)  the extensive exemption from the planning process for State bodies,</P>
      <P>(c)  the proposed power for the Minister to amend the planning laws by regulations,</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill pretends to require public authorities to apply for planning permission but does nothing of the kind.  In his opening statement this morning the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>The fundamental proposal in this regard is that State authority development will generally be subject to normal planning permission requirements, with the same exemptions for minor works, repair and maintenance, etc.  as currently apply to private development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That statement could hardly be more at variance with the general thrust of the Bill, which proposes to exempt development by State authorities on grounds of public safety, order, justice and defence. <Col N="38" /> It also proposes to exempt any development which, under other legislation, requires a licence, consent, approval or any other type of authorisation.  Under our centralised system of government and administration, this leaves out very little.  It also proposes to exclude any development begun in the year following the commencement of section 5, but it does not fix a date for the commencement of the section itself.  After all that, section 3 effectively enables the Minister to amend our planning laws without any further reference to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers constantly to &ldquo;consultation&rdquo;. It has all the hallmarks of the kind of compromise which is typical of this Government.  Like so much else from the Government, the Bill pretends to go left and then swings right.  Planning is supposed to be a positive process.  The stated purpose of planning legislation is to provide for proper planning and development.  This is reactive legislation to the latest planning crisis &mdash; the Supreme Court decision in regard to Mullaghmore and Luggala.  Reactive piecemeal legislation such as this defies the principle of good planning.  Yet for the past four or five years we have had a series of <i>ad hoc</i> piecemeal planning legislation, each one reacting to the most recent crisis.</P>
    <P>This is the sixth Government Bill substantially covering the area of planning to have been introduced since I came into this House in 1989.  These Bills were all reactive.  The 1990 Planning Compensation Act reacted to huge compensation awards to speculative developers even though successive Governments had claimed for years that it would be unconstitutional to ban planning compensation.  The Environmental Protection Agency Act changed the laws on licensing, it was a response to the controversies over industrial development such as Merck Sharp and Dohme, Merrell Dow and Sandoz.  The 1991 Local Government Act, which changed the law on section fours and material contraventions, was a response to the abuse of these procedures by members of some local authorities.  The 1992 Planning Act, <Col N="39" /> which changed the appeals system, was a response to builder's organisations who wanted to speed up planning appeals and to make third party appeals more difficult. The State Authorities Act, which was brought before this House last February, gave retrospective approval to Garda stations and other public buildings following the High Court decision in the Mullaghmore case.  Some of the secondary legislation, such as the regulation on environmental impact statements and access to information, were forced on a reluctant Government by EC law.</P>
    <P>Virtually all this legislation was introduced in an attempt to put right damage already done.  Today's planning Bill fits perfectly into this tradition.  The courts found that the State needed planning permission for its interpretative centres and should not have started building without permission.  The State, whose adherence to the law should be exemplary, has been found to be behaving no better than any bad developer who, without planning permission, decides to build and be damned, gets caught, is subjected to enforcement proceedings and has to stop work and apply for retention.  This Bill is the biggest application for planning retention in the history of this State.  This is done in a way which has become part of what we are.  In this country an oath is not an oath if we do not mean it to be, last week we legislated for the sale of condoms by saying that they are not contraceptives and this week we will give retrospective planning permission to every school, Garda station, barracks, local authority house, road, bridge and every other building built by the State by providing in section 5 that they did not need planning permission in the first place.  Section 5 states:</P>
    <P>Permission under Part IV of the Principal Act shall not be, and shall be deemed never to have been, required for development carried out or commenced by or on behalf of a State authority before the commencement of this section....</P>
    <P>Where does that leave Mullaghmore and <Col N="40" /> the other controversial interpretative centres which have given rise to this legislation? This brings us back to the partnership side-step again &mdash; pretending to go left and then going right.  Michéal Ó Hehir could never have foretold that the phrase he made famous would so accurately describe the <i>modus operandi</i> of this Government.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (1) seems to suit Deputy Bhamjee and the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  It appears to exclude developments which had been the subject of court proceedings before 26 May from the general planning amnesty which is being granted to the State by that section.  Section 5 (2) proposes that any building started within one year of the commencement of section 5 will not need planning permission while section 7 (3) will enable the Minister to commence section 5 whenever he likes.  If the Government wants to avoid applying for planning permission for the interpretative centres, the Minister for the Environment merely has to delay the commencement of section 5 until the promised consultation process is complete and then give the full year within which there will not be a requirement to apply for planning permission.  The advantage in this case will be to the Minister of State at the Department of Finance and Deputy Killeen.</P>
    <P>In its submission to the Minister, An Taisce has drawn attention to this point. It states:</P>
    <P>If these two sub-sections of Section 5 are read together as worded in the Bill the effect would be to enable the State to recommence and complete the building of the contentious Office of Public Works Interpretative Centres before the Courts prior to 26 May without planning permission by utilising Section 5 (2) (a) and (b).  The most the State would need to do in those circumstances would be to seek planning permission to retain the works already constructed at Mullaghmore and Luggala.</P>
    <P>The effect of utilising these sub-sections in this manner would be to <Col N="41" /> almost render null and void the practical effect of the Surpreme Court Judgment on 26 May 1993 for at least a year after the enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated in his speech and publicly that there was a Government decision to apply for planning permission. I am very glad to hear that and I accept what the Minister says in this regard.  However, it is remarkable that the Bill does not require the Government to do this.  This was effectively acknowledged by the Minister in his speech in which he justifed the way in which section 5, as presented, will allow other types of developments which have been started to go ahead.  He said it would be unreasonable to stop these and we have the word of the Government and the Minister that they will apply for planning permission for Mullaghmore and Luggala.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that legislation which has been brought about by a Supreme Court decision in relation to Mullaghmore and Luggala does not expressly require the Government to make the planning application which the courts found was necessary.  Instead, we have been presented with a Bill which will exempt the Government from the requirement to apply for planning permission if it chooses, to exercise that option.</P>
    <P>It is a brilliant achievement for the Minister, confronted with a Supreme Court decision which stopped works and which required planning permission to be sought, to produce a Bill which states that everything which has been built by the State to date does not need planning permission.  That will enable the Government, if it wishes to do so, to slip the noose in relation to Mullaghmore and Luggala and possibly not to have to apply for planning permission, which gives the Minister the minimum of a year's lead-in to start other developments which will not need planning permission if they are being carried out by the State; which exempts local authorities from the planning process and introduces a consultative process, which is quite long in the text of that Bill but which in reality, <Col N="42" /> especially without a provision for an appeals procedure, may be found wanting in practice and which exempts a whole range of activities by State authorities from the requirement to apply for planning permission.  On top of that, section 3 empowers the Minister to change the planning laws by regulation.  This is not just a belt and braces Bill, it is belt, braces and garters legislation.</P>
    <P>This Bill, which is supposed to require the State to apply for planning permission for developments carried out by State bodies, does the reverse as everything that has been built to date is deemed to have had planning permission, every development that will be started within a year following the enactment of section 5 &mdash; whenever that will be &mdash; will be exempted; everything covered by the term &ldquo;public safety and order&rdquo;, which I presume are prisons and developments of that kind, will be exempted; everything covered under the heading &ldquo;administration of justice&rdquo;&mdash; which I presume covers Garda stations and courthouses and so on &mdash; will be exempted and everything covered by the heading &ldquo;security and defence, barracks&rdquo; and all the rest will be exempted.  If it was left at that there might be some case for exempting certain developments and the Minister made the case, for reasons of security and confidentiality and so on, why it was necessary to have these exemption included.</P>
    <P>What is the justification for section 2 (1) (a) (ii) which exempts every development covered by other types of legislation, for example, fish farms, mining activity and the development of marinas which require a foreshore licence?  These developments will now be exempted from the requirement to apply for planning permission and what amazes me is that for the first time we will have effectively an exemption not only for State bodies but for private development if it requires a licence or authorisation from a Government Department.  The range of developments requiring a licence, consent, approval or any other type of authorisation will become exempted developments.  When one considers the <Col N="43" /> way in which the local authorities, State bodies and so on are tied to the umbilical cord of centralised administration and that everything they wish to do has to be approved by the parent Department, there is virtually no type of development by a State authority which does not come under this exemption provision in regard to applying for planning permission.  A Bill which we are told sets out to require State authorities to apply for planning permission has built into itself so many exemptions that it is virtually impossible to think of any kind of developments not covered by one or other of these exemptions requiring the State to apply for planning permission.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is another extraordinary section that has been slipped into this Bill.  Not satisfied with all the exemptions he has given to himself, the Minister may, by regulations, modify or adapt any provision of the Acts for the purpose of securing or facilitating its application to development by or on behalf of a State authority.  In effect, this section allows the Minister to make regulations to change the planning Acts.  I know that An Taisce in its submission on the Bill has already questioned the legality of building in a provision in the legislation which effectively allows the Minister to change the planning Acts without bringing amending legislation before this House.  The situation which the courts have found to be unsatisfactory, is that the requirement to apply for planning permission did not apply to State bodies and there is simply a requirement on them to have a consultation.  It is fair to say that the intention of the Supreme Court decision is that the State and State bodies should be required to undergo the same type of planning process as anybody else carrying out a development.  This is not what happened.  Instead of the present position where it is assumed that the planning laws do not apply to the State, we are being presented with a situation where one type of planning law will apply to the State and another to the individual citizen.  That is a denial of the concept of equity in planning legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="44" /> The Bill complicates the planning process and adds a further degree of confusion and complication to our planning laws.  The whole purpose of planning law is to have a democratic system of planning in the State in which the public as well as the professional planners and so on could participate.  The intention of the law was to have a system clearly understood by the public.  Increasingly, the planning system befuddles the public and it is now intelligible only to those with professional expertise or others who because of long experience, have become expert in the planning process.  As well as the 1963 Act, the 1976 Act and various other laws to which I referred, with secondary legislation and regulations, had to be introduced following EC legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill presented us with an opportunity to make a positive statement requiring State bodies to apply for planning permission under Part IV of the 1963 Act.  The simple way to do it is to make a positive statement that there is now a requirement on State bodies to apply for planning permission instead of the series of extractions and exclusions from the application of Part IV of the 1963 Act, which completely complicates the planning process and will become an area in which lawyers can make a windfall.  It is time that some attempt was made to consolidate the planning legislation, we need a consolidated Act that incorporates not only the primary legislation but the various secondary legislation to make it more accessible to the public.  It is very difficult at present for the public to understand planning law.</P>
    <P>The controversy about the interpretative centres gave rise to the legislation. It is regrettable that this controversy has put the Office of Public Works into the firing line.  It has done a great service to this country over the years in its work in restoration, maintenance and conservation of national monuments and public buildings and in making available to the general public areas of our national heritage which perhaps might not otherwise have been opened up.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that a State body which has done so much for conservation <Col N="45" /> and our heritage should have been involved in such controversies, pitted against people in the community who wanted to protect our heritage.  The fault lies not with the Office of Public Works but with the fact that we did not have legislation which would have required public bodies &mdash; in this case the Office of Public Works &mdash; to engage in dialogue and open consultation with the public about its plans and intentions and have them subjected to the planning process in the normal way.  Unfortunately, this Bill does not correct the fault.  It does not provide for the kind of planning law that will require public bodies in the future to subject themselves to the planning process. If it were to do that then the controversies, the heat and the divisiveness which have arisen in connection with the interpretative centres might be avoided in the future.  This Bill provides that developments will be covered by various types of exemption.</P>
    <P>I had hoped, arising from the Supreme Court decision and the rather vague statement in the Programme for Government, that we would have legislation which would require State bodies to apply for planning permission in the normal way.  When the State authorities Bill was before the House I proposed an amendment &mdash; which was voted down by the Government &mdash; seeking to require public bodies to apply for planning permission. I had hoped this legislation would have included such a provision in a way that was clearly understood by Members of the House and by the public. This Bill is designed to pretend to the public that there is a requirement on State bodies to apply for planning permission while providing so many exemptions and exclusions that, in practice, they will not have to apply.</P>

      <P>This Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, <Col N="46" /> 1993 is the culmination of much public debate during the past year or more.  The main thrust of the Bill is to be lauded in that it ensures that most comprehensive safeguards are put in place for future regulation by or on behalf of the State.</P>
      <P>The hight profile cases of the interpretative centres at Mullaghmore in County Clare and Luggala in County Wicklow have brought the anomalies in our current planning system into virtually every home in the country.  Despite the pub licity surrounding these cases there are other centres around the country con tributing the understanding of the local environment and boosting the coffers of local economies.</P>
      <P>The Bill has come about due to the appeal to the Supreme Court in the Mullaghmore case which was taken to establish, without doubt, the extent to which existing planning laws apply to State developments.  Two separate High Court cases had determined two different rulings on this issue.  In the Programme for a Partnership Government there are proposals for new operating procedures in relation to State projects which take into account the amount of work underway already and the employment of people whose jobs are currently in suspension. welcome this Bill while also mindful of the concerns of those with environment reservations.</P>
      <P>It is easy to pontificate about the pro and cons of preserving the natural environment from the comfort of our armchair. The realities of the issues is far different for the people living in the localities concerned.  Emigration, stagnation, unemployment, empty school and an ageing population are endemic some of the areas earmarked for environmental development.  While I am favour of protecting as much of our natural environment and heritage as possible I do not think that it is environment sabbotage to develop a natural resource in harmony with the ecology, providing much needed local employment in both the construction and the day to day administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The secret of success in this sphere is balance and proper monitoring a <Col N="47" /> utilisation of the prized and respected resource.  Under this Bill the State will be obliged to apply for planning permission like any individual or organisation for any development or construction.  This is welcome.  It obviously did not apply under the Planning Acts of 1963-92.  It must be acknowledged that some mistakes were made.  I should like to give two brief examples.  We are all aware of the legacy of the National Building Agency development in the sixties whereby the Minister has to provide millions of pounds for the upgrading of these substandard dwellings in which thousands of our people live.  I compliment the Minister on the amount of money he has provided and will continue to provide for the next couple of years.  The second major error was the development of six blocks of flats at Blackpool in Cork, one of the most historic areas of the city.  They were ugly and out of character with the area.  If we had then some of the regulations, the openness and the transparency we will have following the enactment of this Bill, we would not find ourselves in that situation.</P>
    <P>That was in a pre-environmental awareness era.  Nowadays everyone from local school children to council representatives and Members of this House has acquired a heightened awareness and is more informed in relation to preserving and caring for the environment.  This is why I find it difficult to comprehend the abdurate opposition of interested groups from outside the areas of Mullghmore and Luggala to the proposed developments. The Office of Public Works has an excellent track record in maintaining the highest standards in preserving our heritage.  We have only to look at Dublin Castle, which several years ago was slipping into the moat, and at the Department of the Taoiseach.  The old college of engineering was hidden and unnoticed by the thousands of people walking past it every day until it was taken in hand by the Office of Public Works and contractors. Can we not trust these guardians of our heritage to do the right thing?</P>
    <P>In dealing with the whole area of <Col N="48" /> interpretative centres we must be careful not to generate over-anxiety which would undermine the essence of preserving what we treasure so dearly.  This Bill will go a long way towards attaining this objective.  Not all of our national monuments are deemed to be under threat when opened up to tourism; a case in point is the new and highly acclaimed Céide Fields project in Mayo.  This whole area will open up in tourism terms if all goes according to plan.  New jobs will be created and the local economic infrastructure will be strengthened by the additional income generated.  If the ecological balance can be safely maintained in Mayo it begs the question as to why it cannot be maintained in Mullaghmore. Surely it is highly preferable that tourists are brought in and educated about the surrounding natural domain instead of walking willy nilly all over the flora and fauna in a pair of hobnail boots.  Inaccessibility is no longer a deterrent in these latter years of the 20th century.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>We will deal with that tonight.  We live in the age of the jet plane, the four wheel drive and the scrambler motor bike.  Nowhere is too far away, too difficult to reach, too remote or unapproachable.  An out of the way place is an attraction to those who want to get away from everything.  It would be better to control tourism to afford the utmost protection to the natural habitat of the area while adding to the wealth of the locality.  I will highlight an example of controlled tourism benefiting the protection of a natural resource.  In Kenya in Africa there is a famed coral reef with a fine ecological balance still intact which such reefs require to survive.  Yet, this reef is situated in a prime tourist area of the Indian Ocean coastline.  The area has been turned into a national marine park, no boats can drop anchor, nobody can walk on the reef and divers are subject to a levy of approximately £5 per dive. This princely sum, by Kenyan standards, goes back to the coffers of the marine <Col N="49" /> park and is used to pay the marine police who patrol the area in highpowered speed boats, giving much needed employment to the locals in the surrounding area.  The resource which needs protection there is the self-sustaining environmental success.</P>
      <P>However, in Gambia on the west coast, uncontrolled tourism has led to the destruction of a similar reef.  In that area there is a marine desert wasteland and tourists are going elsewhere.  The people responsible for the destruction have moved on and Gambia is now targeting a different tourist market, the budget tourist, who cares little for the indigenous culture of the area and comes only to consume the basics.  Surely we, in a developed country, can learn a lesson from a Third World country with limited resources and little education on environmental matters?</P>
      <P>The local people in Luggala and Mullaghmore are in favour of interpretative centres and are more in tune with their environment than those outside the area who are perceived to be concerned about it.  Their wishes must be taken into account when decisions are made regarding the natural habitat of their area.  They are surrounded by a natural wealth on a daily basis and they are aware of the pain of broken families, lack of facilities and the emigration trail.  Surely they would not jeopardise their economic future by destroying the means to maintain their families at home?  Any properly managed resource is an asset to the community and the Office of Public Works and most other people are aware of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will facilitate the expansion of proposed works.  Citizens from outside the immediate areas have a right to voice their concerns regarding issues and resources which belong to the nation as a whole.  However, we must be mindful that such issues do not become the platform for the vested interests of pressure groups who want to maintain their high moral platform to gain leverage for their hobby-horse of the day.  We must ensure that the planning process will not be usurped by groups with narrow interests making spurious claims in the form of <Col N="50" /> litigation which would not be in the long term interests of the environmental movement.  What benefits outweigh those serious consequences?  Those litigants will, no doubt, claim that their efforts aim to save Ireland from pollution. However, by suggesting this they are also saying that the State's experts on environmental pollution assessment are wrong, which is a dangerous line of argument. Awareness of our environment and how to avoid destroying it is essential. Nevertheless, it is a mistake to think that the environment is independent of the other issues with which we are confronted. On the contrary, it must be considered as part of all national issues.  The environment is an integral part of industrial and agricultural development, tourism, urban and regional planning, forestry and fisheries and many other aspects of our natural planning and legislative processes.</P>
    <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1993, will allow for greater transparency, a contribution to such decisions and each new State development will give public notice of the proposed project.  The plans and details of the works to be carried out will be available for public viewing and members of the public or organisations will have an opportunity to make submissions or observations to the relevant local authorities regarding their concerns. The local authority will be obliged to submit a report relating to the proposed developments to the elected members of the local authority in addition to the normal environmental impact assessment requirements.  With those structures in place and the goodwill of the local populace, there should be no reason genuine development of our natural legacy should not go ahead.  The responsible members of the environmental movement realise that their cause is best served by ensuring that all our national authorities are fully aware of the environment and the ecological considerations are an integral part of their activities.  This Bill encompasses all those matters and more.  Therefore, I reiterate <Col N="51" /> my support for the Minister in placing this Bill before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the fact that it provides for public notice and greater public participation in the planning process, particularly as it applies to State developments.  There is a commitment in the Programme for Government to have greater openness and transparency in the planning system. While the system has come under severe pressure and has been criticised, many issues have been mixed and planning has not been central to the problem in all cases.  I am glad the Minister stressed that this Bill is not a reflection on the work of the Office of Public Works, most speakers so far have paid tribute to its personnel. The Office of Public Works will now have a far less stringent procedure to which it must adhere when applying for planning permission.  I base that observation on my experience of the procedures under the section 84 consultation with Clare County Council which were stringently applied and it was difficult to know when they were completed.</P>
      <P>As a member of Clare County Council, I have never seen an applicant for planning permission put through the hoops to the same extent as the Office of Public Works.  To some extent that arose because the nature of the development became controversial and there was an onus on the people involved in the planning process to ensure that all angles were examined.  It would be fair to say that at least that much was done.  Seeking planning permission in the normal way would have been far less complicated, it would have been much easier to know at what stage the procedure was completed and to comply with the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An example is a case involving a group of people in the Burren area who applied for planning permission for an interpretative centre more than twice the size proposed by the Office of Public Works and which would have catered for approximately twice the number of people.  The planning application went through the county council without any <Col N="52" /> difficulty within a relatively short time. There was no controversy in regard to it because the fears based on financial considerations that appear to be in vogue in relation to Mullaghmore did not come into the process.  It was fortunate for the developers that planning permission was sought when the finances required to construct it were available.  If those developers had the ill luck to have applied for planning permission at a time when it was widely believed they would be in a position to complete the development they might well have faced some of the difficulties which the Office of Public Works faced in regard to Mullaghmore. In that instance much of the controversy seen to be centred on the planning process had its origins in considerations of financial gain or loss as perceived by people in the industry in the North Clare area.  I thank Deputy Wallace for recognising the integrity of the local people in the Mullaghmore area.  An unfortunate element of the controversy is that local people have begun to feel that their voice is ignored and have felt insulted by some of those who have opposed the development and placed very little store in their views.  These people and their ancestors have preserved the environment in that area for countless generations.  The least they are entitled to is that their view be given equal prominence with the views of people from the outside who might have the right connections in the environmental lobby but who might not perhaps, know as much about the area as the local people.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister does not intend that all State developments since 1964 will be required to apply for planning permission. Apart from the difficulty, in some instances, of finding out what has been done since then, the huge volume of applications would clog up the system, particularly where there were objections to some developments.  I enjoyed Deputy Gilmore's commentary of how he perceives things.  I am particularly grateful to him for his advice should I not be satisfied with the outcome <Col N="53" /> of the planning process a few months from now.</P>
    <P>Although I am not completely happy with section 5 (1), I am prepared to live with it.  Having gone through section 84 procedure, the Mullaghmore project should get through the planning system as the same criteria are applied.  There is much more involved there than the planning issue.</P>
    <P>I am glad that section 3 has been included because it allows the Minister to make minor adjustments to the Bill, some of which will inevitably be required because all legislation since 1963 has assumed that section 84 applied to State authorities.  That is bound to create some anomalies.</P>
    <P>Obviously local authorities cannot apply to themselves for planning permission. I welcome the fact that the position of the elected councillor is very much strengthened by this Bill.  Although it has generally been the procedure for management to refer major development matters to the council, it is right that this should be required by legislation and I am glad that has been included in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 6 repeals section 84 and many State Departments will be pleased with that.  I am sure that in retrospect they will feel they would have been in a better position had they had to apply for planning permission in the normal way from the beginning, because the section 84 procedure allowed for matters to be dragged out interminably and left them open to all kinds of accusations, most of them unjustified.  In the general context of care for the environment it is important that extreme views should not be allowed to override balanced views.  Although some of us may be fed up with some of the arguments emanating from that lobby, it is still incumbent on us to adopt good planning procedures.  This Bill seeks to include provisions for doing that.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1993, presented to the House by the Minister for the Environment.  The need for this Bill arose from the recent Supreme Court decision referring to the Mullaghmore and Luggala developments and I understand it was also included before that in the Programme for Government.  This court decision ensures that all State developments will be required to have planning permission. This is something which I welcome.  It is only reasonable that all planning proposals be treated equally whether from the public or the private sector.  Any proposal for an industrial development, for a housing development or for an interpretative centre should be subjected to the same level of public debate and scrutiny.  It is only reasonable that any Department or the Office of Public Works should have to apply for planning permission to the local authority where the development is to be carried out.</P>
      <P>However, this Bill does not go far enough and I am concerned at the exclusions under section 2.  Lest I appear to be condemning the Office of Public Works I wish to commend the tremendous work they have done in many areas around the country.  Their sensitive restoration work is to be particularly commended.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of the Bill excludes development for security reasons.  What exactly does this mean?  Does it mean that the erection of radar or satellite tracking equipment would be excluded?  Does it mean the building of a military installation or the building of a military airport would be excluded?  The Minister might clarify this when responding.  I certainly have reservations about this section unless the development is very urgent. Deputy Avril Doyle suggested earlier than even in such cases at least outline planning permission should have to be sought.  Perhaps that is a point the Minister will take on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 (1) (a) (ii) is undesirable <Col N="55" /> because it fragments planning control. For example, if the State decided to build a national incinerator this would normally require an integrated pollution licence.  The proposal under section 2 could mean that such a development could be taken out of planning control if the Minister of the day so decided.  This contradicts the Supreme Court decision and departs from the comprehensive, integrated and transparent planning system that should apply to all developments.</P>
    <P>Section 2 paragraph (1) (b) allows the Minister, if he feels it necessary, to create by regulation a system for publication and input by local authorities and the public in dealing with these developments which are excluded from seeking planning permission.  However, the Minister may decide not to invoke these regulations; he may decide not to involve the local planning authority or he may decide not to seek an environmental impact statement in any such development. What happens if the local planning authority, who are only involved in any of these matters on a consultative basis, disapprove of the project proposed by the Department?  Can there be an appeal against such a State decision and, if so, to whom would the appeal be made? What role would An Bord Pleanála have?</P>

      <P>I am referring to any of the excluded projects where the local planning authority would be involved on a consultative basis but the Minister could override the decision.  I am asking if there will be an appeals mechanism. Section 2 (b) (vi) provides for reference to a specified person of any dispute or disagreement.  Why not involve An Bord Pleanála, which is the body already in place for making decisions on disputed planning permissions?  Why bring in somebody else?  Is the Minister implying that a new tier of appeal mechanism should be created?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 (2) (a) allows emergency <Col N="56" /> development to be carried out without recourse to planning regulations.  Perhaps the Minister could give us some examples of the type of development envisaged.  The Minister mentioned refugees or people who are homeless.  Perhaps he would give us more examples along those lines.</P>

      <P>Section 3 allows the Minister to modify or adapt, by regulation, any provisions of the Planning and Development Acts to facilitate development by a State authority. This is a far reaching power.  Will the Minister give the House some indication of the nature and extent of the adaptation allowed under this section? The Minister is taking upon himself the power to change any part of any Act from 1964 to the present by regulation only. The Minister is shaking his head indicating that this is not so.  The interpretation section, section 1 states that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the Acts&rdquo; means the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 to 1992, and any instrument made thereunder.</P>
      <P>Section 3 states:</P>
      <P>The Minister may by regulations modify or adapt any provision of the Acts for the purpose of securing or facilitating its application to development by or on behalf of a State authority.</P>
      <P>Under that section the Minister can change any provisions in the planning Acts by regulation.  That is too far reaching a power to be given to the Minister without recourse to the House.  I oppose it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 refers to developments by a local authority.  Those proposals, which provide for greater openness and accountability of local authority projects, are welcome.  It should be noted that the county manager will remain the decision-maker <Col N="57" /> in such cases.  There is no appeal procedure for the public in relation to local authority developments and that is regrettable.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (1) validates development commenced or carried out prior to the initiation of this Bill except in specific cases which were decided on or are before the courts.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (2) postpones for one year the application of planning control to State authorities.  The Bill is unclear in relation to the stage a development must be at before it will be exempt.  Regarding a hospital or a State development&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It will give the public greater input into the planning process but, unfortunately, it does not go far enough.  It is unclear from the Bill whether the Minister for the Environment or other Ministers will be in a position to act independently if he or she so desired.  We will be opposing the Bill.</P>

      <P>Our planning laws are an essential part of a good quality environment.  This Bill has been produced <Col N="58" /> because of a crisis in relation to one aspect of our environment, the interpretative centres.  The Green 2000 advisory group report is important and it is critical that we should have a timetable for its implementation.  It should be the environmental bible of this coalition Government.  I hope its recommendations will begin to be implemented within the lifetime of this Government.</P>
      <P>The Bill attempts to move towards greater transparency, democracy and clarity in the planning process and that is important.  It is critical that we learn from the recent crisis in relation to the interpretative centres on this issue.  They have been painful and difficult sagas and much can be learned from the issues that emerged and the groups who lobbied in relation to those centres.</P>
      <P>I was somewhat surprised at the comments by Deputy Wallace on the intent of some of the groups concerned with the issues which arose in respect of Mullaghmore. We have learned a great deal and we can be grateful to the groups who took the time, interest and put in the energy to think through the issue. However, I am concerned about the divisions created; we must move on.  I hope the round of consultations proposed will help to resolve the issues.  If we spend money from Structural Funds or elsewhere carelessly and take careless environment decisions, we, our children and their children will pay dearly.  I am aware that the Minister shares this concern.</P>
      <P>Environmental issues cannot be hived off into one area of Government thinking. For example, it is regrettable that we did not have some environmental or green thinking built into the provisions of the budget.  We did not have any such thinking in regard to unleaded petrol. Opportunities to address environmental issues ought to be taken and developed. It is unfortunate also that very often environmental issues are dealt with by way of fire brigade action.  We are doing that again today by trying to roll back disasters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In <i>The Observer</i> last Sunday there was a report on the use of pesticides and fertilisers and disturbing evidence emerged <Col N="59" /> about their effects on children's health.  We will have to consider that matter.  There is a critical need for a coherent national plan for the preservation and development of our environment. The proposals in the Bill do not take us far enough along that road.  The word &ldquo;amnesty&rdquo; was mentioned earlier; the Government appears to be getting fond of amnesties.  We have had a tax amnesty, a social welfare amnesty and this Bill is a type of environmental amnesty.</P>
    <P>The discretion the Bill gives the Minister for the Environment or any other Minister is too great.  Sufficient safeguards are not built in in relation to that discretion.  As a result we may not in the future avoid repetition of what took place in relation to interpretative centres.  Does the Minister consider the discretion that has been built into the Bill so great that it does not concur with the spirit of the Supreme Court judgment.</P>
    <P>I would have the same concerns about section 2 (1) (a) and section 3 &mdash; Deputy Doyle expressed her concerns in that regard.  Will the Minister clarify section 5 (2) (a) which refers to development commenced by or on behalf of the State? What does &ldquo;commencement&rdquo; of development mean?  What development will be allowed and at what point will the Minister assess that development has begun?</P>
    <P>In relation to the Structural Funds, the European Commission requires member states to involve the relevant authorities in the different stages of programming. Those authorities must include in their plans an assessment of the environmental situation of the region concerned and its expected development.  Will the Minister indicate if this has been done in relation to the programme which he has drawn up?  Obviously, the Cohesion and Structural Funds will provide the impetus in the economic area and is it critical that this is accompanied by strong environmental awareness by environmental-proofing how we spend the money in so far as that is possible.  I regret that this Bill does not move in the right direction, that it is not true to the spirit of the <Col N="60" /> Supreme Court judgment and that the discretion allowed within it is too wide.  I am concerned that we may have a recurrence of the difficulties we had because of the extent of the discretion that has been built into the Bill.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on what has been said in relation to the balancing of economic and environmental factors.  This is a critical matter.  We should pay a great deal of attention to it rather than dismissing people concerned about environmental issues.  As we have seen from other countries, we do that at our peril and at the risk of life itself.</P>
    <P>We are debating a serious issue here today which involves the quality of our environment, how we manage it and the effect of decisions taken today will have an impact for many years to come.  We must encompass as much consultation, accountability and transparency as possible in our planning decisions.  I hope that is the direction the Minister will follow in his ministry.</P>

      <P>I would like to begin my contribution by referring to the point on which Deputy Fitzgerald concluded, that is, the necessity for tolerance in this debate.  The genesis of the debate was the issue of interpretative centres as they related to Luggala and Mullaghmore.  It goes without saying that in any political party there is consensus on those particular issues.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dan Wallace, who is not here at the moment, made unfortunate references to &ldquo;spurious grounds&rdquo; and undermined the rights&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of those persons involved in court proceedings.  The Minister and I may cross swords at a later stage on a different issue but I would like to make some use of my remaining four minutes without interference from him. Deputy Wallace's contribution was intolerant and has been a hallmark of this debate to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of us expected, on foot of the <Col N="61" /> Supreme Court decision, the type of watershed in legislative terms referred to by Deputy Fitzgerald.  Unfortunately, the Bill before the House does not meet that standard in any way.  We should be particularly grateful to the environmental groups and, indeed, to other outside agencies who often brought the authorities here, kicking and screaming, to the altar of environmental protection. The effect of EC directives, the efforts An Taisce and other groups have been largely responsible for much of the environmental protection here.  As a legislative body we have been rather lax in that regard.</P>
    <P>The legislation before us today does not meet the spirit of the judgment handed down in the Supreme Court.  We have heard much about partnership in Government, but there is no spirit of partnership in this legislation.  The planning process should be about partnership between State bodies and the public. What we have in this legislation is a series of exemptions which are tantamount to tokenism to the spirit of the Supreme Court judgment and empire building for &ldquo;Ministers&rdquo;, as referred to in the legislation. That Bill does not involve wider participation in the planning process but rather centralised decision making for a whole range of developments envisaged by the Act being carried out by public bodies.  This is essentially a hasty, ill-considered and ill-thought out response. There is no credit due to the Minister for having brought it before the House in such an unprepared state.</P>
    <P>I wish to place on the record my appreciation of the Office of Public Works in regard to projects they have carried out.  Very often, in the face of much local opposition, they have been the guardians of our heritage and many of the difficulties they have faced were due largely to the political control to which they were subjected, particularly with regard to Mullaghmore.  The record will show this to be the case.</P>
    <P>The consultation and public notice aspects of the legislation is merely a cosmetic exercise.  This legislation contains no legal safeguard for the public from <Col N="62" /> unwarranted, unhealthy and environmentally unfriendly developments which local authorities foisted upon local communities in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>There is provision in this legislation to further exempt local authorities from accountability and responsibility. That is a regrettable feature of the legislation which, due to time constraints, I do not have time to debate at present but which I intend to do at a future stage.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate here today and listened with great interest to contributions made by opponents of the Bill.  I agreed with many of the points made, although I felt many of the speakers were too negative in their contributions.  It is important to criticise &mdash; that is the function of Deputies &mdash; but it is important also to put in place the legislation put forward by the Minister.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Office of Public Works, Deputies want the luxury of criticising them on certain issues while praising them at other times.  We would all like to have the best of both worlds, but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that is not possible. I agree with the points made in regard to planning laws and the maze of piecemeal legislation enacted in this House over the years.  I would not deny there has been far too much cobbling of items of planning legislation, which is unfortunate.  There is a need for an overall planning law based on good criteria and planning enactments.  I would support this, because planning is far too serious an issue to be left to this haphazard process. We need proper criteria at national and local level against which planning can be measured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important for the country as a <Col N="63" /> whole that we have proper planning infrastructure and, above all, that we have good planners.  The human factor in planning has not been mentioned so far in this debate.  Planning is not carried out by somebody from Mars or by automatic pilot.  It is carried out by planners who are merely human beings and there is a need for improved education and training for these people at national and local level.  I am always amazed at the divergence of opinion in planning at national and local level.  How many times have we at local level disallowed planning applications for takeaways in the principal streets of our cities only to be overruled by an Bord Pleanála?  If doctors, accountants and solicitors have a criteria to work from, planners must have some criteria also.  Looking around our country one can see it is pock-marked with bad planning decisions.  How can this be possible if these planners came from the same school and went through the same process? Surely they are as offended by these sights as myself.  That is an issue that has not been addressed by any Deputies, namely, the need for good planners at national and local level.</P>
    <P>The shadow of Mullaghmore and Luggala has been hanging over this debate today and the court judgments have been referred to also.  It is natural that reference would be made to this, but I would never shy away from a debate regardless of how unpleasant, because democracy does not exist in a furtive cloak and dagger environment.  Democracy in planning will only exiast by having debates such as this in this House, by achieving consensus and, above all, by seeking good planning criteria.  That must be our objective in this debate and not simply to score points, which is useless and gets us nowhere.  We must work towards the objective of good planning at national and local level.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to see Deputy Killeen step back from his original Bismarckian attitude towards Mullaghmore.  He was much more measured in his contribution today.  He has been criticised in the past in regard to his views &mdash; and I have criticised <Col N="64" /> him &mdash; but it is part of the educational process and he will learn from that.  It is good for him to come here and listen to somebody giving the other side of the story.</P>
    <P>I was making my way back from the Goldsmith Weekend yesterday where I had been speaking on Oliver Goldsmith. I took the opportunity of stopping off in The Burren and visited the House of the oldest family in that area, the O'Loughlin family.  I do not know of any older family than the O'Loughlin's in the Burren region.  This family was totally at one with me in my attitude towards this issue and were determined that I would not lose my resolve in my attitude towards the Mullaghmore interpretative project. What took place in regard to this project was wrong.  It was illegal to commence the project, it was illegal to continue it, and that fact cannot be denied.  Those who gave the go ahead for this project must take the responsibility for it.  They acted illegally in going ahead with the project and there is no point in saying otherwise.</P>
    <P>The question must be posed as to the purpose of buildings, especially public buildings such as interpretative centres, in our society.  What is the purpose of an interpretative centre?  That debate was never entered into before these projects commenced.  Recently I visited Cobh where a very good interpretative centre in the old railway station was converted into an emigration museum.  I advise Members to visit that museum which is one of the best of its kind in any country.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Law Reform Commission, which is an independent body under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Anthony Hederman, works to a programme and the timing of the publication of reports is a matter for the commission.  The commission is currently preparing reports on a wide range of topics, including the topics mentioned in the Deputy's questions, each requiring extensive research and consultation with interested parties.  While the Attorney General may from time to time request the commission to examine particular issues, it would be disruptive and unhelpful to set deadlines for the publication of specific reports.</P>
      <P>Once reports are published, it is, of course, the responsibility of individual Ministers to examine them and to take whatever action they deem appropriate. In this regard, a considerable number of the commission's recommendations have already been accepted by the Government and implemented, including proposals relating to child abuse, malicious damage, foreign adoption decrees, the Statute of Limitation, rape, the competence and compellability of spouses in court proceedings, receiving stolen property, civil liability for animals, divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> and the Hague Convention on the abduction of children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that publication of the report on family courts is urgent in light of the Government's commitment to hold a referendum on divorce?  Is he aware that facilities in family courts are very poor in Dublin and virtually non-existent outside Dublin, with in many cases no consultation rooms and no opportunities for private discussion between the families involved?  It is imperative that this report be not only published but acted upon before the divorce referendum is held.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Taoiseach has not answered the specific question I put to him about family courts. That suggest the matter does not loom large in his concerns.  In regard to the occupiers' liability report &mdash; I note the Taoiseach said he has no control over the timing of reports &mdash; is the Taoiseach aware that the Minister for Equality and Law Reform has claimed that this report will be available within the next number of weeks?  I would like to know whether this is true.</P>

      <P>On Deputy Bruton's first question, he may not take it from what I said that the Government is not concerned about family courts.  Of course we are so concerned.  This matter is very important and as soon as the report comes to hand decisions will be taken by the Government.  On the Deputy's second question, we expect that report shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree, in view of the imminence of the report, it would be wise of the Government to accept on Second Stage Fine Gael's Bill on occupiers' liability?  In view of the commencement of the tourist season when many tourist attractions may be closed to tourists because of fears of liability by owners in the event of an accident occurring, will the Taoiseach agree to allow the Bill go to Committee Stage where it can be amended, if necessary, in light of the report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 9, 71 and 97 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I have had no meeting with the <Col N="76" /> Presidents of the University or the Higher Education Authority, discussions are ongoing between my Department, the heads of the universities and the Higher Education Authority about fee levels in the universities for the coming academic year.  In these circumstances it would be inappropriate for me to make any further statement on the matter for the present.</P>
    <P>The £70 fee referred to by Deputies Quill and McDowell relates to students wishing to attend courses at the constituent or recognised colleges of the National University of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;matriculated student&rdquo; appears in the Irish Universities Act, 1908, the Charter of the National University of Ireland and Statute Number I of the university.  Students must ordinarily be matriculated students to be awarded degrees by the university.  Up to last year, when the matriculation examination of the NUI was discontinued, prospective students of that university could matriculate either by taking the examination or on the basis of specific performance in the leaving certificate or other acceptable examination.  Fees have always been payable to the NUI for sitting the examination or for matriculating on the basis of other examinations. While, as I have said, the matriculation examination has been discontinued the process of matriculation and the associated fee remain and are requirements of the university.  Under its legal charter the NUI has the legal authority &ldquo;to demand and receive such fees as the Senate may from time to time appoint&rdquo;.  The university in this, as in many other matters, is autonomous and the Minister for Education does not have the power or authority to issue instructions to the university in such matters.  The NUI received a statutory grant of £10,000 a year from the Exchequer under the provisions of the Irish Universities Act 1908 and the remainder of its financial requirements must come from various fees and charges including the matriculation fee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that the last section of society that <Col N="77" /> should be burdened with any increase in fees, particularly an 8 per cent increase, is the hard pressed PAYE sector, the majority of whom do not get higher education grants?  Is the Minister not aware that the basic problem relates to money and that over the years in the various Government programmes a central feature was the increased number of studnets in third level education?  This massive explosion in numbers has put enormous pressure on universities who simply cannot cater for the demand without the resources to do so.  Last year on the capital side for building and maintenance the universities had to endure a cut of 27 per cent, or £6 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">

      <P>It would not be helpful to comment on the announcement by the universities that they would raise their fees by 8 per cent although I am concerned about the plight of the PAYE worker and student.  I announced in the House last month the setting up of a committee, which I hope will report to me within the year, to study the implications of the changes in the grants scheme put in place in 1992.  I share the Deputy's concern about the ability of all sections of the community to qualify for grants.  When the committee reports I will be delighted to discuss in the House the recommendations to ensure that students who have the intellectual ability will not be discriminated against in regard to third level education on the grounds of inability to pay.  I share the Deputy's concern with regard to increased numbers. This is a problem Ministers will have to face in the last decade of this century because of our demographic trends which do not pertain in other European countries.  I will take every opportunity to make that problem known to our counterparts in the EC who seek places in their universities on a slightly different basis from that operating at present.  This being my opening question. I am sure members would like to join me in wishing well to all the students who began their examinations today.  I am sure their concerns are shared by all the Opposition spokespersons.  Indeed many <Col N="78" /> students sitting examinations today will be affected by the different parts of the questions tabled to me today.</P>

      <P>In relation to the subject matter of my Question No. 9, will the Minister accept, as the matriculation examination has been abolished and since all information in relation to entry eligibility is freely available at the push of a button in the Central Applications Office, that there is no justification for a charge of £70 for the process of matriculation, as described by the Minister?  Will she also accept that the imposition of this charge constitutes another barrier to entry to third level education, particularly in relation to children of PAYE parents and those from working class homes, cutting right across the aspirations of the Programme for Government in which the Minister had an input?</P>

      <P>The term &ldquo;matriculated student&rdquo; appears in the Irish Universities Act, 1908, the Charter of the National University of Ireland and Statute No. 1 of the university.  As the Deputy will be aware, regardless of whether they sat that examination students had to pay the fee.  The sitting for the examination was not affected by charging a fee to become a student, with a matriculation certificate, to graduate. Under its legal charter the NUI has the authority to demand and receive such fees as its Senate may, from time to time, prescribe.  Therefore, it is not a new barrier but one that has been in operation to quite some time.  I take the Deputy's point about relevant information being readily available.  However, it is not a question of information.  According to the universities, it is a question of students registering in that way to be awarded a degree.  As Minister for Education, I do not have the power to issue instructions to the universities.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister realise <Col N="79" /> that, in extending good wishes to all students who commenced the leaving certificate this morning &mdash; wishes in which we all share &mdash; she has given the thumbs down to one of the major aspirations, that the review of the operations of the third-level grants system, as revised by the Minister's predecessor last year, will not be completed until next year?  Does she realise that the deadline for taking a course option is two weeks' time? Equally does she realise that all the choices of these students will be based on the availability of ESF, regional technical college, vocational education committee or higher education grants and that there will be disappointment that the Minister has not published the results before now?</P>

      <P>There is only so much I could have done in the short term of my period in office.  Major changes were effected in 1992 which I spelled out in great detail on the last occasion on which I answered questions here.  I share Deputy Higgins's concern that all students cannot avail of the third-level grants system.  As a result of that concern within the past two months, I appointed a grants committee who is working on that subject.  We should not curtail the length of time that committee may sit if we are to be satisfied with its findings and recommendations.  Given the history of former committees and the periods within which they sat, I am satisfied that this committee will report within a reasonable time.</P>
      <P>On the subject of final options, I hope that most students sitting their examinations today will have made those choices, since they are taken much earlier in the year and dictate the subjects on which they will be examined.  I should not like the message to go out from this House that everybody can indulge in final options now.  A very small number of students are affected but I should not like that to detract from the good wishes we all offer them today.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that the £70 fee represents a very real <Col N="80" /> obstacle to entry to third level education by a number of students who would benefit enormously from such education? Will the Minister accept that, while she said she does not have authority, she has a moral responsibility to talk to the National University of Ireland, pointing out to them that there is no justification for the imposition of this fee?</P>

      <P>While Deputy Quill and I accept that I do not have the power or authority to issue instructions to the universities, this is not a new imposition but one which has been in operation for some time.  Of course, it applies only to those who apply for places in the National University of Ireland and not to any of the other colleges.  Deputy Quill may wish to advance that moral argument to the universities.  As I said, I am at present refraining from making a comment on fees or any amounts of money which will become available to universities within the next year.</P>

      <P>Under the School Attendance Act, 1926, the appointment of school attendance officers and provision for their remuneration are matters for the appropriate council of the county borough, in this case Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>If the corporation proposed the appointment of officers to fill current vacancies I would be happy to sanction such appointments.  Of course it would be a matter for the corporation to fund the posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Green Paper proposes a review of the working of the School Attendance Act, including an examination of the roles and responsibilities of the various <Col N="81" /> agencies involved.  This review is under way and there will be consultations with all the interested parties.  The outcome of the review will be taken into account in framing the forthcoming White Paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, while the city council pays, her Department reimburses it for the service? Furthermore, is the Minister aware that 119 schools in Dublin do not have school attendance officers; that 43 of the 119 schools in Dublin are located in the Dublin 8 postal area, with huge social problems, caused by drugs and so on?  Is she aware that, in such circumstances, in which both parents may be drug addicts, which is quite common in this area, there is no interest in education?  Is she also aware that non-attendance at school is a major problem in this area and that the only solution is to appoint qualified school attendance officers to ensure the requisite level of service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will probably be aware, in particular within the Dublin Corporation area, that there is a number of vacancies.  There have been talks between my Department and Dublin Corporation within different committees.  The hope is that, instead of committees within Dublin Corporation dealing with different areas, there will be just one which would allow the Minister to deal only with the committee concerned with that area.  If there was only one committee &mdash; and the city manager understands that the city council is in agreement with such proposals &mdash; the city manager has indicated we could deal with the specific problem in the Dublin city area.  I should emphasise that my Department has no interest in hindering such appointments because such officers have played a useful role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although, as I indicated to the House, the school attendance committee system is being reviewed, as promised when the Green Paper was published, and as will be dealt with in legislation which has been promised, if Dublin Corporation agrees that five committees should be replaced <Col N="82" /> with one, the Department would be delighted to see that committee and indeed other committees working. School attendance committees have responsibility in the areas covered by Cork, Dublin, Limerick and Waterford corporations and in the Blackrock and Dún Laoghaire urban areas while in county council areas the Garda have responsibility for enforcing the provisions dealing with school attendance.  In certain areas the Department is making greater use of the home-school liaison service.</P>
    <P>When children fail to turn up at school &mdash; in this regard one may consider that the Garda should enforce the provisions and that it pertains to a wider social problem &mdash; the Department makes use of this link so that the matter is addressed in an informal way between the school authorities, the teacher and the parents.  We all agree that this is one of the most successful services in areas in which there are major social problems which lead to children not turning up at school and parents not pursuing the matter.  It would be welcome if Dublin Corporation decides to establish one committee and I have no intention of hindering that process.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 15, 100, 101 and 112 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of promoting the health and well-being of young people has received significant attention in the Green Paper on Education and the <Col N="89" /> implementation of these proposals will be dealt with in the White Paper on Education.  In the meantime, I propose to continue to support and develop action in this area of education and to provide the resources required by such development.  For example, the Department issues literature every year about the national alcohol awareness week which is organised by the National Parents Council.  My Department cooperates with the Department of Health and its agencies and with voluntary groups in a range of initiatives which seek to support schools in developing education programmes on substance abuse, including alcohol abuse.  My Department has not carried out a survey as to the extent of this problem, although I am aware of surveys that have been carried out by other groups.</P>
    <P>A close lisison has been established with the Department of Health in developing health education in schools. This has led to particular initiatives at national level as well as to the encouragement of a wide range of cooperative projects at local level between health boards and schools, and between voluntary groups such as the Irish Cancer Society and schools.  Involving parents of pupils has been an increasingly important feature of such co-operation.  In addition, various projects have been linked to others in European countries leading to cross-communcation and funding from the EC for projects.</P>
    <P>At primary level, the Primary Curriculum Review Body recommended that health education be included in the curriculum. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has been asked to advise on the curriculum for primary schools arising from this recommendation. As discussed in the Green Paper, the whole area of health education has been broadened and includes the following areas: a positive school climate which supports the well-being of staff and pupils; a school curriculum which includes health education programmes with supporting resources and in-service and an opening up of the school to the involvement of parents and co-operation <Col N="90" /> with agencies in the community.  This is in line with thinking throughout Europe, and Ireland has been one of the pacemaking countries in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply is futuristic in nature.  Will the Minister consider setting up specific courses in schools to educate children about the dangers posed by the abuse of alcohol and other dangerous substances?  Is she aware that a recent survey carried out by my colleague, Deputy Higgins, showed that children are starting to drink, smoke cigarettes, sniff glue and use other substances as early as ten and 12 years of age?  If the present trend continues these children will be confirmed alcoholics by the time they reach their mid-teens.  Will the Minister agree that such activities are detrimental to these children's schooling and that this problem could be dealt with both successfully and promptly in a structured fashion with a properly monitored programme in primary schools?  In view of the fact that it is only a minority of children who behave in an unruly and unacceptable fashion, will the Minister agree that immediate positive action could safeguard the reputation of the vast majority of young people who behave in a responsible and dignified fashion both at school, festivals, sporting occasions and many public occasions?</P>

      <P>The Primary Curriculum Review Body recommended that health education should be included in the curriculum.  That recommendation has been passed to the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, which will put forward its recommendations on how health education could be included in the curriculum.  Close liaison has been established with the Department of Health in the development of specific health education programmes in schools. Courses have been developed by the North-Western Health Board, the Western Health Board, the Mid-Western Health Board and the South-Eastern Health Board.  Other health boards have begun to organise seminars to help develop their ideas.  All these initiatives <Col N="91" /> are very important and the more locally based they are the more effective they will be.  Specific programmes are operated under the disadvantage youths progrmmes. People at local level can avail of information and resources and follow courses under these programmes.</P>
      <P>I would not for a minute suggest that enough can be done in this regard.  The recommendations which have been made are being worked on.  Ireland is highly regarded in Europe for the courses and projects we have put in place.  Eight pilot projects at post-primary level will commence in 1993-94.  We are aiming in these projects to ensure that there are adequate support mechanisms within schools to enable parents, teachers and pupils to deal with such problems and provide the means through which these concerns can be communicated.  We are responding as positively as possible &mdash; all possible recommendations are being put in place. While waiting for the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to put forward its recommendations on the curriculum content, we should not underestimate the great partnership which exists between sections of the local community, particularly between those involved in education and the local health authorities.  I have accepted all the invitations I have received to launch specific projects in order to indicate my support for what I regard as very successful local projects.</P>

      <P>To what extent does the Minister think the advertising of alcohol in a glamorous way has led to an increase in the number of children using alcohol? People are warned that cigarettes can damage their health and similar warning should be issued in regard to alcohol. With regard to co-operation between the Department of Education and the Department of Health, does the Minister think that the Department of Education can make a contribution in the development of initiatives which are proposed at local level?</P>

      <P>The purpose of the <Col N="92" /> programmes in place is to teach young people how to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to alcohol, cigarettes and so on.  These programmes are being developed and monitored.  I am very open to any changes recommended by the experts in this area.  On the question of co-operation between the Departments of Health and Education, information and courses are available at local level.  My Department has responded positively to any requests from health boards to participate in specific health programmes &mdash; I referred to the health boards which have set up programmes. The Department is doing a good job in this respect from the point of view of the schools.  I wish to emphasise the need to involve parents in such projects. If the parents work together with their children and the health agencies we can feel confident that the children are being minded throughout the day.  The Deputy is aware that there is a limit to the length of time young people spend in the school system and it is important therefore that parents and the wider community are involved in any initiative.  As I see it, the community would respond to initiatives so that the direction is not coming from the top down &mdash; as health education in my time came from the top down &mdash; but from the bottom up, and involving the students the teachers, the health agencies and the parents, who I think would get the main instigators of the initiatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I was disappointed with the Minister's initial response to my question which acknowledged in one line of a very lengthy reply that her Department has not conducted a survey of this problem.  This comes on a day when hundreds of thousands of pupils are sitting the first day of their leaving certificate and junior certificate examinations.  This is a widespread problem and it is causing great concern in schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should conduct a survey on the effects of alcohol consumption on school children.  It was welcome that she indicated, in response to supplementary questions, that parents have a role in this area because they have a responsibility <Col N="93" /> to know where their children are and what they are doing at any time.  Will the Minister state when a survey on the abuse of alcohol by school children will be conducted?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>The findings of two well considered surveys are available to the Department and if we were to stop to carry out another survey it would appear to be a delaying tactic.  I prefer to advance on the initiatives already in place.  For the information of Deputies, an ESRI survey in this respect was carried out in 1986 in the Dublin post-primary schools.  Another survey by a Galway based voluntary group suggested that pupils attending school had used alcohol and some had used it in what could be described as a heavy manner.  As a result of that information, the Department has responded in a positive way by working with the Department of Health to develop resources for the schools, including a programme on the abuse of alcohol.</P>
      <P>I suggest that to stop at this stage and set up a survey might question the validity of previous surveys and I do not think we should do that.  We need to continue to respond to the problem in a very positive way and to work in conjunction with the Department of Health so that the abuse of substances, including alcohol, is part of a health education programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that despite all her assurances this is not happening?  Recently I carried out a random survey of nine schools in Dublin in which there was substantial evidence of substance abuse &mdash; including alcohol, Tippex, polish, glue, butane gas and petrol &mdash; and in five of the schools there was absolutely no substance abuse programme whatsoever; of the remaining four, there was a substance abuse programme in only one, in which the health board is only marginally involved.  The initiative is not working on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in Deputy Higgin's findings.  In the schools I have come across &mdash; but perhaps people are inclined to tell the Minister the good <Col N="94" /> news rather than the bad news &mdash; the programmes are in place.  Such programmes should be available not only in schools but at local level.</P>
      <P>The Stay Safe programme which was put together by the Eastern Health Board on a pilot basis is now widely accepted and welcomed in primary schools.  We have now asked them to up-date that programme with particular reference to young people in second level schools. That work is ongoing this year because it is not simply a question of making minor changes to a programme that was aimed at the five to 12 age group; indeed, it is quite challenging to put together a programme and text for this age group.  The Eastern Health Board has accepted the Department's invitation to build on the Stay Safe Programme, which was part of a programme for healthy living for young children, and provide a package for the post-primary level.  I am sure that when it becomes available it will be widely welcomed.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the information Deputy Higgins has supplied, I ask the parents with children at second level schools to inquire whether programmes are in place in their schools.  If parents indicate to school management that such programmes would be welcome, I am sure the schools would respond positively. Perhaps the Deputy will join with me in extending that invitation to parents.  I welcome any additional information that the Deputy has in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be an assumption in the Minister's reply that drinking is confined to school pupils but what about the teacher &mdash; albeit they are limited in number &mdash; who may have a problem with drink?  When is it intended to introduce the welfare service for teachers, which was promised by her predecessor, which will address this and other problems in the teaching profession?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>In responding to questions, I am answering them in the context of the text of the questions tabled.  In the body of my reply I referred <Col N="95" /> to a healthy environment for the well-being of pupils and teachers and under that heading it would be possible to concern ourselves with adults in the school who may have that problem.  At present there are leave provisions and counselling services in place and it is a matter for individual schools whether there is somebody with responsibility in this area for those seeking help.  I would not like to develop my response further.  If the Deputy were to table a more specific question it would be possible for me to talk to the teachers' representatives, who are always willing to talk to a Minister, and to ask them to highlight this area. Perhaps the Deputy might ask them also to highlight this matter.  If the Deputy were to table a specific question it would give me time to elicit the information he requires.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that all the surveys and solvent abuse programmes will come to naught unless action is taken against the godfathers and godmothers of drink pedalling.  Is there a liaison between the Minister for Education and the Minister for Justice in regard to the lack of enforcement and paucity of convictions for the supply of drink to under-aged persons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be fair to say that there would be support for all measures that the Minister for Justice would put in place to ensure that the laws relating to the sale of alcohol to minors would be upheld.  If the Minister for Justice felt she needed co-operation from the Minister for Education she could have it without asking.  I take the point that the programmes put in place will not resolve all the problems but if we tackle them on a multi-base we will be more successful than in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="96" /> There is a role for parents.  Where they fail in their duties as parents we have an obligation to ensure that courses are provided in parenting skills to alert them to their responsibilities.  I am not suggesting we can cover all eventualities but I hope that, as more information is made available and as more innovative programmes are put in place, the Department will play a very positive role. Formerly, this role was left solely to the Department of Health.  There has been great co-operation between the Departments of Health and Education.  If the Department of Justice want my blessing for their proposals in regard to the drink licensing laws they can have it.  At local level in the health services this is being most successful.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept that the current post-primary curriculum provides very little scope for the regular usage of daily newspapers. Media studies, (including the specific study of newspapers), is an integral part of the English courses at junior certificate level.  The leaving certificate programme in English allows ample scope to teachers to use newpapers as sources of suitable material.</P>
      <P>Newspapers carry articles from time to time on topics of direct relevance to other subjects in the post-primary curriculum, for example current affairs, history, economics, business organisation and so on.  Teachers are free, and indeed, encouraged to draw on these articles in class work.  If the Deputies would like to suggest areas within the curriculum where more newspaper coverage would be useful to students I would welcome their suggestions.</P>

      <P>The question refers to daily newspapers.  The question was tabled by Deputy McGahon and I should like to ask the Minister what educational use could be gained in classrooms from the Sunday newspaper for which Deputy McGahon is a columnist?  If she cannot think of any use for it in the classroom does she see a use for it in any other room in the school?</P>

      <P>In media studies I would hope there would be a cross-section of newspapers, not newspapers which are read in particular constituencies. A very interesting project in which a class might involve itself would be to take a national story and examine how it is dealt with in different newspapers and then to ask the pupils to form <Col N="98" /> opinions on how reliable are newspaper stories.  I use that as an example and I know it is not a new suggestion to teachers.  That is happening in the media module and in the junior certificate.  In addition students are invited to produce their own newspapers, prepare their own headlines and write their own editorials. The mass madia module is very exciting. We have more experience of the junior certificate in the school system and this is something which will be encouraged at leaving certificate level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept, in the context of media studies and the teaching of English, that a certain amount of use is made of newspapers in the classroom?  Does she accept that in any modern democracy there is scope for further and more extended use of newspapers as vehicles of learning the tools of democracy?  In a country where we have no formal political science course or civics education in any structured form there is an overwhelming need, under some umbrella, for the further use of newspapers in the classroom. It is not unusual to find extremely well educated students in Ireland today who obtain a high number of points for entry to university&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have no hesitation in agreeing with the Deputy that there is plenty of scope for a further extension of the use of newspapers.  As we become familiar with the junior certificate module we will make further use of newspapers through the school system.  I take the point made about the tools of democracy. It is accepted that there is not the political division in the newspaper industry here that we see in other countries. The way newspapers handle various crises and problems, and how editorials are written in response to the behaviour <Col N="99" /> of Members of this House, should be studied.  It saddens me to think that there may be students, who will achieve a high number of points in the examinations who have not been introduced to newspapers. Following the introduction of the promised civics programme there will be a role for the study of news reporting.  In regard to the tool of democracy, newspapers and media generally have a role to play.  We should prepare our young adults to scrutinise this role in as free and open a forum as possible.  There is a use for an examination of the reporting of the political aspects of our life in the civics programme.</P>

      <P>I see the National Education Convention, which I announced recently, as a potentially historic event in the history of education here.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in Malahide on 19 May, when I announced my intention in this regard, I will be issuing a paper later this month which will set out a detailed scheme for the convention and will cover many of the issues raised by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My overall objective is to provide an <Col N="100" /> opportunity for all the partners in education to engage in a full exchange of views on the future direction of Irish education, taking account of their own particular concerns and objectives while in addition, very importantly, taking account of the objectives and concerns of the other partners in the process.</P>
    <P>I wish to take this opportunity to further expand on the announcement I made in Malahide.  I am actively addressing this at the moment and will issue a paper shortly setting out my detailed views.</P>
    <P>I can say the convention will have an independent chairperson, and a secretariat headed by an independent secretary general and an independent report, prepared by the secretariat, under the authority of the chairperson, will be published following the convention; the format will seek to maximise constructive dialogue among the partners; key issues will be discussed, particularly those where there are significantly divergent views in order to explore fully the possibilities for real consensus; it is highly likely that papers will be prepared by the secretariat to facilitate the work of the convention and, on the question of participation, I hope that all the major partners will take part.</P>
    <P>This convention represents a very important development of the debate which has been taking place.  Organisations and individuals throughout the country have invested an enormous amount of time in debating the issues and making formal submissions to me and my Department.  This is immensely helpful and has significantly advanced the climate for real reform of our educational system.  I wish now, through this initiative, to offer the partners the opportunity to engage in meaningful multi-lateral dialogue taking account of each other's positions. This holds considerable potential to significantly influence the future direction of Irish education.</P>
    <P>Following the convention, I will proceed without delay to publish the White Paper, taking full account of the deliberations of the covention and, of course, of the hundreds of submissions received.</P>

Will the paper she intends to circulate deal with policy issues which have been the subject of submissions for the Green Paper?  In view of the fact, that the National Education Convention will have a secretariat, is it intended that it will be a permanent body and continue to meet?  Is it intended to invite all those who made submissions for the Green Paper to participate.  Finally, it was originally intended that the White Paper would be published by the end of this year.  As the National Education Convention will not meet until September, does she expect the convening of the National Education Convention to delay the publication of the White Paper beyond the end of this year?</P>

      <P>I do not anticipate a delay in the publication of the White Paper, which is promised for the end of this year.  I set myself a timetable which will allow me to publish a White Paper within a year.  Although I have not announced the format for the running of the convention, I do not see the secretariat as being permanent.  There have been approximately 1,000 submissions and if we are to move forward in a multi-lateral way, nobody could expect that all those who made submissions would be invited.  There are what I would call the partners in education who deliver education at the coal face, the parents, teachers, management and owners. There should also be a role for students who are not in the school system but who are below the age acceptable to make a contribution to the dialogue.  The management groups, teachers, owners, trustees and patrons are the basic partners delivering education at the coal face.  I hope to spell out within a fortnight the format for the convention and the specific groups who will be involved.  I made the initial announcement in this regard on 19 May and therefore, even within the time frame I set myself, I still have more time.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister <Col N="102" /> confirm that the date for the publication of the White Paper has been rescheduled? It is my understanding that the White Paper was to be published in September, but the Minister is now talking about publishing it within a year.  In relation to the submissions, has she or the committee met with any groups individually in regard to sensitive issues?  In relation to the Minister's promise to take on board the social partners &mdash; the division A players &mdash; she should ensure that none of the people who might be perceived as division B players but have a legitimate input is left on the education sidelines.  A national debate on education should involve everybody; people who were not involved until now have a legitimate input to make.  Finally, could I ask the Minister to have a debate in this House before the publication of the White Paper?  We had an excellent all-day debate on the Green Paper on Education and, as most of us have access to many submissions, I would ask the Minister, before she puts pen to paper regarding the heads of a White Paper, to provide time for another debate here on education from the point of view of reaching a consensus.</P>

      <P>Of course, I have met with individual groups.  Any new Minister is inundated with invitations to meet with many people.  I met with as many groups as was feasibly possible. In regard to the social partners and the division B players, it will not be possible to invite more than 1,000 people to participate. We must be reasonable if this initiative is to be successful.  Many concerns have been expressed, some in very short submissions, and this is where the <Col N="103" /> secretariat will come into play.  The concerns of organisations that have been expressed publicly should be raised with those participating in the convention through the secretariat.  It will be possible to do that and I do not see anybody as a division B player.  However, some people deliver education at the coal face and they are what I would call the partners in education.  All taxpayers have an interest in the education system.  The Minister has bilateral discussions but that does not foster debate; we need to have multi-lateral discussions.  Once the debates on the Green Paper throughout the country were completed there were no proposals that those debates should be continued in a new forum.  This is a new step.  I am satisfied that I have fulfilled the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government that the discussion on the White Paper would be open and democratic.  This forum will involve various partners and will allow consensus building to take place if that is what the partners want.</P>

      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Tánaiste, who is on his way home from Luxembourg. Since the deterioration of the security situation in Mogadishu on 5 June there has been regular contact with the Irish agencies who have personnel in Somalia and the United Nations.  I understand that the Irish agencies have now withdrawn <Col N="105" /> most of their personnel from Mogadishu and that only five Irish citizens remain.</P>
      <P>The agency personnel are in direct contact with the UN authorities in Mogadishu and are in the best position to assess the security situation.  There are, in addition, some 16 Irish agency staff in other parts of Somalia in particular, Baidoa.  The question for their security is being kept under review.  The Tánaiste has emphasised to the United Nations the priority which we attach to ensuring adequate protection for aid workers and will continue to stress this.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the Minister of State for her reply.  Like the Minister and many other people in this country, I am deeply concerned for the safety of our excellent Irish personnel working in Somalia.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister of State satisfied that it is safe for the remaining personnel to stay in Mogadishu as I understand that an offensive is planned for tomorrow against the militia?  Is the Minister of State satisfied that the few people who are remaining will get sufficient protection?</P>
      <P>Second, is the Minister of State satisfied that the Irish personnel working with the UNOSOM are safe?  Finally, is the Minister aware that Concern alone, as one of the agencies, is feeding 15,000 people a day in Mogadishu with dry rations and that these people have not received any of these rations for about six days now?  Will she ensure that as far as is possible there is a speedy return of all these excellent personnel to assist in the feeding programmes in Mogadishu?</P>

      <P>There were three supplementaries there.  First of all, the Tánaiste and the Department of Foreign Affairs are in regular contact with the agencies concerning the situation in Somalia. The question of whether personnel should be withdrawn is a matter for the agencies and for the individuals concerned and the people who are there have chosen to stay.  The Tánaiste would not wish to issue directives on the matter and, indeed, does not have the power to <Col N="106" /> instruct people to withdraw.  We are very supportive of the efforts of the UN, and in Luxembourg the Tánaiste got the European Ministers to issue a declaration in relation to the situation in Somalia.</P>
      <P>In relation to Concern, all I can say is that I will convey the Deputy's concerns to the Department of Foreign Affairs and ensure that that point is taken up and is followed up.  We would all share the wish that the situation would calm down.  An Irish transport unit will be joining UNOSOM shortly, and the legislation will be going through this House soon. We hope the situation there will stabilise so that the Irish relief workers, who have done such a terrific job in helping the people of Somalia, will be able to go back to that task and be able to carry it out in a peaceful environment.  I have no information in relation to Irish personnel with UNOSOM.  My understanding is that there were no Irish personnel.</P>

We all know that one Irish aid worker, Valerie Place, has already lost her life in the service of starving people and we would hope that that would not happen to anybody else.

      <P>I am wondering if the Minister is aware that the United Nations has now given notice to the relief workers that they can no longer be afforded any protection.  Although the Minister of State says that the Tánaiste would not see himself as being in a position to issue directives, would she not agree that he has a responsibility in the context of this country being a member of the United Nations to ensure that the United Nations protects aid workers in that country since the united nations compound is 200 metres away from the main relief workers' compound?</P>

They are there to ensure that the work of peace, of trying to feed these hungry people can go on and to ensure that that is done in safety.  I understand that the number of Irish aid workers in Mogadisu includes three Concern workers, one GOAL worker and one Red Cross worker.  Outside Mogadishu there are 16 workers including eight or nine Concern workers, six or seven GOAL workers, one Red Cross and one Trocaire worker.  Their agencies are in touch with the situation out there.  I do not know what has happened in the last couple of hours in response to the call by the UN, but again I am sure that the sponsoring agencies have the safety of their personnel very much at heart and will be doing everything they can.  I will convey the concerns of the Deputy to the Department and ensure that they are followed up with some speed.</P>

      <P>The refurbished railway station in Cobh is a modern example of an interpretative centre.  It is an emigration museum which will be officially opened on Friday by the Taoiseach.  It is a good heritage centre.  It is built in the town in the midst of the local population surrounded by an infrastructure of shops and workshops.  Another good example of a heritage centre is King John's Castle in Limerick, the interior of which is a historic wonderland.  It provides a panoramic view of Limerick city and is of historic interest in regard to its sieges. The extension to the castle is controversial and has been the subject of favourable and unfavourable comments. Recently, one disgruntled Senator sought my views in this regard but he would be better advised to look after his own bailiwick because he was arrogant and foolish in his attitude to Mullaghmore.  I know more about interpretative centres and stone than that Senator.</P>
      <P>It is time we had a national debate on planning.  In the past there were shallow arguments in this House to justify certain buildings.  They were bogus and spurious arguments based on the fact that the construction of buildings provided employment. That is a useless argument and could be used to justify the building of a nuclear power station.  We have too many gombeen men here who would erect any type of building to make money.  That argument has no merit in this debate.  I say that having been a building worker for more than 30 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his speech referred to the role of local authorities in the planning process.  That is an important part of the Minister's speech and an important part of the Bill.  Local authorities in the past have not been blameless for bad planning.  There is a need for constant vigilance by public representatives and informed citizens.  The fact that people do not live in an area should not debar them from commenting on something just as not being born in Limerick does not stop anyone from coming to see the Shannon.  We cannot be too parochial because good planning laws and regulations are national issues.  Good buildings, <Col N="243" /> materials and design are also broad issues.  We can be too narrow and parochial in our attitude to planning, as if people living in certain areas have great wisdom and knowledge concerning it. Planning laws should be accessible so that people can discern between good and bad planning.  It should not be a matter of great wisdom.  Intelligence, eyesight and experience should guide people in this respect.  The countryside is full of buildings that disgrace and disfigure it.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill will be interpreted in a democratic manner and that it will be a useful contribution to a national planning process.  However, there is too much piecemeal legislation in this regard and there is a need for one Bill incorporating all the amendments and legislation on planning introduced in the last decade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to address the House on this Bill.  For many years it has been clear that a planning process was required to regulate development by and on behalf of the State authorities.  I welcome and support the Bill which goes some way towards setting up such a framework &mdash; which we should acknowledge was prompted by the Supreme Court judgment on the Mullaghmore and Luggala interpretative centres.  I welcome that judgment, because planning is about community involvement and it is vital to have full community participation in planning.  The judgment echoes my view that State bodies or agencies acting on behalf of the State should not be allowed carry out developments without consulting local communities.  As an example, I wish to refer to a location in my constituency, St. Margaret's, where people have been campaigning over the past three years for an adequate insultation system in their homes to protect them from noise pollution.  Whenever this issue was raised with Dublin County Council we were told the State was not obliged to provide such a scheme.  In fact, for a considerable time Aer Rianta was hiding behind the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="244" /> Recently we have had a Bord Pleanála decision in relation to the Kerry airport at Farranfore where it decided, in the interests of proper planning and for the purpose of protecting people directly affected by planning decisions, that certain conditions should have been included in the planning permission.  This represented the breakthrough that the public was seeking.  Hopefully, this situation can now be brought to a conclusion. It was, in fact, brought to a conclusion by a decision by An Bord Pleanála.  I hope the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, for example, will be included in the requirements of this legislation and I look forward to the comments of the Minister in this regard.</P>
    <P>There are certain aspects in this Bill that need further clarification.  Section 2 allows the Minister to provide by regulation that the planning process should not apply to certain State authority developments.  Perhaps there is a need for such a provision but I would ask the Minister to explain in more detail the categories of development to which references are being made.</P>
    <P>Section 4 stipulates that plans of a proposed development should be made available for inspection by members of the public.  Would the Minister clarify how he envisages local authorities will meet this requirement?  Two aspects of this are the giving of public notice and the availability of public inspection of detailed and proposed developments.  A number of these are mentioned in the report but I ask the Minister how the local authority housing programme will be affected by this?</P>
    <P>In regard to halting sites, my understanding is that in the past if agreement was not reached by the public representatives the opportunity existed for the Minister, or the manager on behalf of the Minister, to intervene.  Would the Minister clarify what the implications of this would be for the location of halting sites?</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, this Bill is typical of the history of Irish planning legislation going back to 1963.  In many ways it is a fire <Col N="245" /> brigade reaction to problems that occur on an ongoing basis.  I would like to highlight certain areas of the planning process which this legislation does not cover and which should be addressed as a matter of urgency, if not by means of amendments to this Bill then by means of comprehensive planning legislation which is long overdue.  After 30 years we must critically examine the position in the light of recent developments and bring our planning laws into the 21st century.</P>
    <P>There is an element of planning which should be included in the Bill.  In this regard, I compliment the Minister for the Environment for the public stand he has taken against the rezoning lobby in Dublin County Council.  There has been public outrage in Dublin County Council at what has been allowed to occur and people have taken to the streets on this issue.  The Minister has taken a stand against the rezoning lobby which includes the vast majority of his own councillors and a sizeable majority of Fine Gael councillors who have come together to set up a coalition lobby in the council in relation to the development plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been very supportive of the idea of a development plan for the county stating that it is time to take proper account of the cost of providing roads, water and sewerage schemes before rezoning decisions are made.  Water charges and lack of finance are issues that must be taken into consideration. In the light of this, is the Minister and this House not concerned about the major differences that have emerged between the county manager, his staff and some councillors in Dublin County Council?  This is a matter of concern which must be addressed.</P>
      <P>In the Dublin County Council area alone thousands of acres have been rezoned for no apparent reason other than the hardship plea of a landowner and in many cases this was completely at variance with the views of senior planners, people who have professional expertise in these areas.  I do not take the advice of planners on an ongoing basis.  I am prepared to assess a situation on an individual basis.  It is totally illogical to state that the professional planners are always wrong.  This aspect must be examined critically.  Given the increase in land prices &mdash; in some cases land prices can increase ten times as a result of rezoning decisions &mdash; there is an urgent need to review the whole mechanism.</P>
      <P>During the course of the development plan in the Dublin County Council area we have witnessed the introduction of a new mechanism by some developers and landowners whereby they used the legitimate needs of sporting and community organisations to apply pressure on councillors in order to secure rezoning of their lands.  While acknowledging the needs of these sporting organisations this type of enticement is totally out of place in the planning process and must be eliminated before it gets out of control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As public representatives we must highlight the needs of local people.  I have already made representations to the Minister about the need to amend the current planning legislation to enable a <Col N="247" /> planning authority to require local submissions regarding the provision of amenity and recreational facilities.  This aspect must be examined to ensure that we move away from the mechanisms currently being used.  I could debate this issue in greater detail.  Many areas of planning need to be updated.  We must bring a comprehensive planning Bill before this House so that our planning laws can be updated and I look forward to that in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>He made a point about the County Dublin development plan and it typifies what is happening in this House where people come in and make statements and then disappear before anyone has an opportunity to answer the various charges made.  This used to be a debating chamber.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to some of the people who gave their views about the County Dublin development plan over the past few months.  I would like to bring some balance into this debate.  Much has been said about rezoning, the value of land and so on, but there was no mention of my area in south County Dublin where land is at a premium and vast sums of money change hands when land is deemed suitable for development.  The officials being lauded by some Members endeavoured to rezone hundreds of acres of land in south County Dublin but there has been no mention in any debate about the effect this would have had on the most beautiful part of Dublin.  There was talk about increasing the population in that area by between 20,000 and 30,000. That gives some indication as to the rezoning that would have taken place had that proposal gone through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who receive most criticism, the elected public representatives, prevented the rape of south County <Col N="248" /> Dublin.  Literally thousands of new houses would have been built in that area were it not for the efforts of the elected public representatives who put a stop to the rezoning.  While people have various views about rezonings, the elected representatives represent the views of the people, whether for or against development. I would like to put some balance into this argument and point out the facts.</P>
    <P>I listened with great interest to Deputy McManus who in the course of the debate on the proposed tax amnesty referred to rezoning in County Dublin, condemning members of certain political parties for their activities.  However, what Deputy McManus failed to tell the House and the public is that in my area while I fought, and succeeded, against the rezoning of the famous Monarch Property lands in Cherrywood, Deputy McManus' colleagues voted to put a 25 acre shopping centre on one part of those lands.  Some people are very selective in their discussions and when it suits them they condemn members of the council for certain actions.</P>
    <P>I would say to the Labour Party that before it makes statements it should check the records as to who voted for what.  On some controversial issues, the absence of certain members when it came to making hard decisions was interesting. There were reports that commitments were given that certain people would not be present when the vote was taken.  I ask those who make accusations to check their facts before doing so and to start bringing some balance into this argument. The statutory duty of each elected member of a county council is to review a development plan every five years. Having done so, there is a statutory function on the local authority to listen to objections to the proposed review of the plan.  Each objection must be dealt with separately.</P>
    <P>Hundreds of objections made to the proposed development plan in County Dublin have been rejected by the elected members who on a number of occasions disagreed with officials who endeavoured to have certain lands rezoned.  I have always believed that the statutory function <Col N="249" /> of elected members should not be interfered with regardless of whether their actions might increase the profits of landowners.  It is the function and duty of the people who sit on that side of the House &mdash; the Government &mdash; to ensure that there is in place an equitable tax system whereby those who gain windfall profits from the actions of a planning authority are dealt with under the tax system.  The statutory function of planning cannot be combined with the taxation system.  You cannot say we will not rezone that property because X, Y or Z will make a profit.  It is not the statutory function of an elected member of a local authority to make a judgement as to whether somebody will make or lose money as a result of his or her action.  It is a matter for the Government to decide on taxation policy.  We should get away from the nonsense of putting money into speculators' pockets.  The tax system should deal with speculators who make profits and each planning decision should be judged on its merits.</P>
    <P>The public in County Dublin are fighting against a decision taken by the so-called professional planners in the late sixties and early seventies who bulldozed through three new towns in County Dublin &mdash; Tallaght, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown. The public has rejected Mr. Myles Wright's plan because on social grounds it has not worked.  People say that plenty of land has been rezoned in County Dublin and that is quite true, but it happens to be in places where people do not want to live.  I am not going to tell people who were born and reared in my area that they must live in Tallaght, Clondalkin or Blanchardstown simply because Mr. Myles Wright decided 20 years ago that is where they should live.</P>
    <P>I would equally make the argument for land rezoning for industrial purposes. Can anybody explain how a person would travel from Finglas to Tallaght, Clondalkin or Lucan to take up low paid employment?  What public transport system exists to service these people? These are the cold hard facts involved in the making of a development plan. Planning is about people, not about profit <Col N="250" /> or decisions which are solely and simply the prerogative of an elite group of people who call themselves planners.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister and other Deputies where were the planners and professional when the villages of Dalkey, Dún Laoghaire, Blackrock, Malahide and Howth were developed? There were no professionals in those days.  It is no accident that the most sought-after properties are in Dalkey, Dún Laoghaire, Blackrock, Malahide and Howth.  The reason is that these villages have a heart and above all they have a community.  Problems would not exist in County Dublin today had the so-called professionals listened to the advice of ordinary members in the late sixties and early seventies when some of us spoke out against the planning concept of developing new towns of 100,000 people.</P>
    <P>We are now facing social problems &mdash; not only in this country &mdash; because the same geniuses proposed the same solutions to planning problems in Britain and Northern Ireland.  How long did it take to get Craigavon on the move?  Hundreds of houses were built in Craigavon as a result of the same type of planning concept and they were boarded up for years because people would not live in them.  What about Telford in Britain? All these concepts failed and when the elected members, the voice of the ordinary people, asked the authorities not go ahead with this mad proposal it was bulldozed through.  Why?  Because we were zoning according to pipes and sewers, because money had been ploughed into major drainage into these three new towns and the Department and the officials would not say &ldquo;stop&rdquo;.  That is what is wrong in County Dublin and that is why there is controversy.  We have ploughed resources into sewers and whether or not people like it, that is where the houses will be built.</P>
    <P>When I take a decision on planning I think of people first and sewers second. Is it not an accident that the most sought after properties are in places where there is a good community spirit.  A decision should be taken to develop Tallaght, Donabate and Malahide to a certain level <Col N="251" /> but we should not proceed with this mad proposal to continue development.  What has happened the proposal for the new town of Clondalkin which the Minister had the courtesy to visit?  What about Neilstown and Ronanstown about which we hear so much?  These places are a total disaster.  They were designed and promoted by the same professionals who insist that we continue down this road. We have taken human beings from a community in the centre city and dumped them in green fields in County Dublin and told them to stay quiet, because now they have houses.  We have huge social problems being dealt with on a daily basis by every agency in the city and county and it is costing the taxpayer a fortune, and all because there is a drain or a sewer into the place.  Those people have been left there without work or basic facilities, without a shopping centre or a community centre.  The people who have condemned what has gone on in County Dublin should see the letters I have received from parish priests and others working in the community pleading with us to stop this nonsense and give people some hope.</P>
    <P>Planning should be about people and not about this so-called professionalism that has crept into everything which means that people have to be in little boxes.  In the early sixties Pete Seeger sang a song called &ldquo;Little Boxes&rdquo;.  He was a man ahead of his time.  He foresaw the authorities putting people into little boxes and assuming they would be happy and would stay quiet.  The people will not stay quiet.  They want a community and they are rightly rejecting this so-called professional plan which was produced in the seventies.</P>
    <P>I would not condone a lot of the decisions taken and when I object I vote against the decisions.  That is democracy, the way it should be.  The people should be able to take informed decisions in the local elections, having regard to the performance of the local representatives. Deputy Ryan suggested that this function should be taken from elected representatives. By saying that he is saying <Col N="252" /> that democracy is a bad thing.  At the end of any term of office people should have the right to vote their agreement or disagreement. That is what democracy is all about.  However, we should not have this nonsense asking elected representatives to draw up a development plan and when they do, every Tom, Dick and Harry can have a say as to what elected represenatives are obliged to do by law.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that a lot of land in County Dublin has been rezoned. Land has not been rezoned in County Dublin because the 1993 development plan has not been adopted.  All the proposals that have caused so much concern have to go back on public display for a month and the public will have the right to lodge objections.  Will the Minister explain why out of the 26,000 objections to the original development plan which was displayed for three months, not one objection was agreed to by the officials? Is that not extrordinary?  The plan was not changed at all on foot of the 26,000 objections that were made.  When the officials wanted to rezone Carrickmines, Cherrywood and all that area they tried everything, but some of us stood up against them and against the development. All these procedures have become farcical.  The public are not told, nor do they understand the technicalities attached to the making of a development plan.  Will the Minister take a personal interest and ask for a report on the number of objections lodged against the County Dublin development plan and why the officials could not find one single case with which they could agree?</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that three county councils for Dublin will be established on 1 January 1994 I ask the Department and the Minister not to pressure Dublin County Council to finalise the 1993 development plan.  It should be left to the three new councils to adopt their own development plans.  As a representative of Glencullen electoral area, which stretches from the Bray boundary to Glencullen and to Foxrock, I would not claim to be qualified to vote on issues which will affect Baldoyle, Donabate or Swords.  Neither do I accept that representative <Col N="253" /> of Swords, Donabate or Baldoyle will be in the position that I am in to vote on plans affecting the Glencullen electoral area.  The Minister for the Environment should write to Dublin County Council recommending that the development plan should be left to the three county councils.  Nothing will happen anyway.  Land that was rezoned in 1982 and 1983 is only being built on now.  Land zoned in the early seventies has not yet been built on.  There is no rush in this.</P>
    <P>I am very strongly of the view that, for smart political gain, the public should not be given the impression there is something radically wrong with the democratic process which allows them object whenever a development plan is drawn up and put on public display.  Whether the person objecting happens to be the owner of the land or an ordinary member of the public, he or she has that statutory right. They should be heard and their objections listened to carefully and a decision taken.  I would strongly urge the Minister to inquire of both sides of the House whether the County Dublin development plan is being properly dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Michael Ahern.  This Bill was introduced to enable certain actions already taken to be legalised.  This affords me an opportunity which I will not get on any other occasion in coming weeks to raise a question about a planning application now before the local authority in my constituency, namely, the application of the ESB to erect 170 feet pylons across a 56-mile track of land.  These are the types of applications that come before members of local authorities and about which they have little or no say in their rejection or otherwise.  This application is on the part of a semi-State body who state that their requirements in another part of the country warrant the erection of these pylons.  I consider that they have not given the proposal any real constructive consideration, that is, the provision of alternative sources of power in the relevant areas, north-east Donegal. They are actually submitting an application <Col N="254" /> which totally contravenes the county development plan put in place by the local authority.  Indeed, they are using the big stick, maintaining that under the ESB Acts they have power to impose this proposal if they wish.  That is not democracy.</P>
      <P>I must agree totally with what Deputy Barrett had to say on the subject of democracy, in particular, that members of local authorities are best able to decide what is best for their part of a county or region when it comes to planning, and outside forces should not be able to contravene local people's wishes.</P>
      <P>In the case of the application to which I have referred one must examine also the incalculable material damage that will be done to property and farms in the area which will greatly exceed any compensation paid.  If a full economic assessment was undertaken by the ESB, and if they were forced to pay full compensation, they would seek other alternatives in this case.  They have prepared an environmental impact statement in regard to their proposal in which they refer to such things as electric and magnetic fields.  They give their side of the story but do not publicise independent views expressed from northern Europe on the erection of some of the power lines, their effects on people's lives and their general health in the areas in which they are erected.  These are the types of issues that should be publicised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes we in this House are regarded as cranks, as being anti-progress, anti-this, that or the other, whenever we object to planning on environmental grounds.  No outside body has the right to despoil the natural beauty of an area such as that of north Leitrim, about which I am talking, an area which already has two 110KV lines erected right down the middle.  Now the ESB are talking about erecting another 220KV line alongside it.  If there had been proper planning I am sure one line would have been sufficient to cater for the overall needs of the area concerned.  But people, for their own selfish reasons, with the long term objective of obtaining Structural Funds from European agencies, <Col N="255" /> tend to create an ideal atmosphere for themselves but one which will affect the lives of the ordinary people of the area.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister of State present to ask the Minister to intervene in this case.  It constitutes a crisis on a number of fronts, one of these being health, and on the basis of the potential damage of the landscape, something that has been handed on to us and which we should hand on, unharmed, to future generations.  Elected representatives have a duty to defend the natural beauty of the areas we represent.</P>
    <P>While this Bill deals with actions already taken and decisions to be taken in the future, semi-State bodies must fulfil the same conditions and/or planning requirements as in the case of a private company or individual.  I am sure that if anybody from the area about which I am talking were to apply to erect a silo 170 feet high he would be told he could not, that it would totally destroy the landscape. These are the types of issues with which we must deal.  I believe such power should continue to be vested in local elected representatives whose decisions in all such matters should be final.  We should remember that if they do make a wrong decision the electorate have redress.  They have a remedy for dealing with people who make wrong decisions in any sector of political life.  Democracy is the greatest protector of the people and always has been the plain man's mode of expressing his views.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to some people who feel they have a right, without obtaining planning permission, to suppress others' rights of way.  This is a practice that is becoming prevalent in rural areas, where people are tending to suppress what have been public rights of way for many years. This is something that needs to be addressed legislatively.  We shall be debating a Private Members' Bill later this evening with regard to public liability. When that subject is being dealt with by way of Government legislation I hope there will be another legislative provision alongside to deal with public rights of way and access which people <Col N="256" /> have tended to suppress knowing that they would be responsible for any third party claims.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have had this opportunity to express my reservations and fears with regard to the proposed ESB action in the case I have mentioned and also in regard to private individuals suppressing public rights of way because of their worries about public liability insurance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>While welcoming the introduction of this Bill I cannot allow this opportunity to pass without commenting on the events leading up to its introduction.  Over very many years we have heard nothing but criticism of the Office of Public Works from some sectors of the community.  I take this opportunity to laud them on the tremendous work they have undertaken in recent years and which is continuing.  In Dublin alone we can look to buildings such as Dublin Castle, the Custom House, the refurbished Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Industry and Commerce and Kilmainham, as examples of their excellent work.  Indeed, we can see examples of their work nationwide as the Government's decentralisation programme comes to fruition in towns stretching from Letterkenny to Cork, from Ennis to Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Office of Public Works have not suddenly become environmental ogres as some environmentalists would have us believe.  I use the latter description with tongue in cheek.  I would remind such environmentalists that the Office of Public Works were green before that became fashionable.  They are in charge of and do an excellent job with our national parks, nature reserves, wildlife sanctuaries and refuges for fauna.  While the identification and conservation of our natural and cultural heritage must remain a priority, we must build on this even further.  It is vital to inform and educate the public so that all will be aware of the importance of conservation.  Indeed, interpretative centres are a key element in informing and educating the public on heritage matters.  There are over 30 such centres in existence at present and they <Col N="257" /> have been welcomed by some environmentalists. They have also been praised by the people who visited them.</P>
    <P>We are now faced with a group of environmentalists who not alone do not live in the immediate area but many of whom do not live in the country.  For far too long we have been listening to expert environmentalists lecturing us about how we should look after our heritage.  We are perfectly capable of fostering our own heritage and providing safe access for the public.  It was the intention of the Office of Public Works that interpretative centres would mirror one element of our natural and cultural heritage, convey the importance of that element and the conditions necessary to enable it to survive for other generations to see, experience and learn from.</P>
    <P>The Irish natural and cultural heritage is one of the most remarkable, beautiful and educational in the world.  We should share this experience with the many visitors to our country and those of us who have an interest in learning where our ancestors came from how they survived. When we travel abroad other countries take great pride in outlining their heritage and explaining, through interpretative centres, their individual landscapes. We have been slow to build such centres mainly because of an attitude which presumes that people know of our heritage. Now that we realise the potential of our tourism industry we must nurture it and try to provide a wide range of activities and facilities for tourism groups as we cannot sell Ireland as a sun holiday destination. We need to expound our virtues to tourists and highlight the many benefits we have to offer.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Dempsey, officially opened the interpretative centre at the Ceide Fields in north Mayo.  The area encompasses 400 square miles of mountain and low-lying coastal bog, some of the oldest and most spectacular rock formations on these islands, the greatest concentration of stone age tombs in Europe and the intact farms of the tomb builders preserved in the bog.  The farms <Col N="258" /> date back approximately 4,500 years. This is an example of what we have to offer.  We are steeped in history and we should be proud to show this to visitors.</P>
    <P>The recent Supreme Court judgement in the Mullaghmore case highlights the need to provide for the regulation of development by State authorities in future.  The Bill deals with those regulations. Section 6 provides for the repeal of section 84 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963. Section 84 states that a State authority, before undertaking the construction or extension of any building, should (a) consult the planning authority to such extent as may be determined by the Minister and (b) if any objections that may be raised by the planning authority are not resolved shall, save where the construction or extension is being undertaken by the Minister, consult on the objections with the Minister.</P>
    <P>The interpretative centres were built under this section.  At no stage did the Government as some have mistakingly suggested, try to rush the work on these centres without proper prior consultation with the relevant planning authority. Subsection (2) (a) will empower the Minister to make an offer provided that neither the planning Acts nor the requirements of regulations apply to development which is required because of an accident or an emergency or which is otherwise in the public interest.  It is envisaged that this section will be used where development must be undertaken as a matter of urgency.  This power will be used infrequently and in an emergency such as storm damage, the reconstruction of buildings or housing projects for refugees.</P>
    <P>While the Bill states that this section will be used only in cases of emergency I have no doubt that some people will find fault with it, but they never seem to bother about the human element. Interpretative centres have been welcomed by the local communities and it is recognised that jobs would be created in areas where, up to now, people have witnessed mass emigration because of lack of employment.  Tourists' numbers <Col N="259" /> would increase substantially with the result that employment would be generated and our flagging economy boosted, especially in rural areas.</P>
    <P>In my constituency of Cork East two heritage centres have helped to transform the towns of Midleton and Cobh.  The Jameson Heritage Centre in Midleton and the Queenstown project in Cobh, with which I am glad to have been associated, have been visited by thousands of visitors, foreign and local, since they opened, with the result that those towns have been transformed.  Instead of gloom and unemployment there is new found wealth.  Another example in the Cork area is Fort Camden in Crosshaven in which the Office of Public Works has done tremendous work during the past few years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to share my time with Deputy Dukes.  The decision of the High Court and subsequently, the Supreme Court is the essence of commonsense. One can only wonder why it was not made 30 years ago when the 1963 Planning Act was implemented because some of the greatest abominations in regard to planning in the intervening period have been constructed by State bodies, including local authorities. Having said this, it is ironic that work on the two sites in question at Mullaghmore and Lugalla in County Wicklow is being carried out by the Office of Public Works which has not been the worst offender among the State and semi-State bodies involved in planning and building. Invariably, work carried out by the Office of Public Works is exacting but it takes great care and shows consideration.  It is ironic that the case in question arose from works which were being carried out by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure if the two buildings in question deserve the fate destined for them, whereby work will cease immediately and they will be ultimately destroyed.  Interpretative centres are exactly what is needed when there is something of beauty, for example, the Burren and the Glens of Wicklow.  We <Col N="260" /> need explanatory material to show visitors what is at their disposal.  I am sure if they were adequately camouflaged they could be used as interpretative centres and perform the functions for which they were intended.  This is an unfortunate episode.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that Deputy Bhamjee is not present as he advocates the decision not to proceed with the Mullaghmore interpretative centre.  I would have thought he would have been here for the duration of the debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Ellis pointed out, the ESB can erect massive pylons throughout the country without having to comply with planning laws or regulations.  There is a moot point to be made in this regard.  I have been a member of a local authority for many years and I remember questioning why the ESB had to apply for planning permission.  The sheet given to county councillors referred to applications <Col N="261" /> cations by the ESB to erect a certain number of pylons.  The county manager told us that the ESB had to apply for planning permission as a matter of course but there was no way a member of a local authority could interfere with that application.  The entire process was a charade.  The application had to be put on paper, but the company was not subject to any of the conditions of the Planning Acts.  That was an amazing situation. Obviously, the ESB will now have to conform with the Planning Acts.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to an abomination in Kildare Street, a house where I spent some years as Minister &mdash; Agriculture House.  This building is located in the middle of a beautiful architectural area, which includes such buildings as the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Leinster House and the Shelbourne Hotel.  Agriculture House should never have been built.  However, as it was a State building the Office of Public Works did not have to apply for planning permission.  Agriculture House is an abomination in the midst of many fine buildings.</P>
    <P>Some of the worst cases of planning in the country are the ghettoes being built by certain local authorities.  Deputy Barrett referred to Neilstown, Ronanstown and other areas where there are massive numbers of houses and no facilities or infrastructure.  These huge estates, which should not have been allowed under any planning laws, were built because the local authorities were not subject to the planning laws.  The Ballybeg housing estate in Waterford contains miles and miles of houses, yet it does not have any facilities.  This estate should never have been built.  I welcome the High Court decision because it will make local authorities and semi-State bodies subject to the planning laws just like everyone else. I hope that the body which adjudicates on the plans submitted by local authorities will be sufficiently independent.  I am not satisfied that this will be the case. Will the adjudicating body be sufficiently independent to ensure that local authorities and semi-State bodies do not get <Col N="262" /> their own way as they did in the past? Is the legislation sufficiently strong to ensure that there is a truly independent adjudication of the work which it is proposed to carry out?</P>
    <P>The Minister said that State authorities would have to consult with the planning authorities before constructing or extending a building other than a building in connection with afforestation by the State.  Some of the worst planning I have seen relates to afforestation.  There are many magnificent scenic views of the sea, mountains and valleys in this country. Coillte, the old Department of Forestry, was allowed to plant trees <i>ad nauseam</i> which, when they grew after ten, 15 or 20 years, blocked many magnificent scenic views.  This body was subject to no planning controls.  Some of our best scenic views have been obliterated by trees. Trees, like water and mountains, are beautiful; but if they are grown in areas where they destroy scenic views then they too can become an abomination.  I ask the Minister to ensure that trees or any buildings which give rise to problems affecting scenic views are subject to the planning laws.  That point has not been dealt with.  I will leave my remarks at that.  Deputy Dukes will need his full ten minutes.  Obviously, he has many valid points to make.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Deasy for sharing his time with me.  If the Minister wants an illustration of Deputy Deasy's last point, I invite him to visit Mullaghcreenan, which is between Athy and Castledermot, and follow the forest walk to the top, where he will find a spot from which one used to have a very fine view of Counties Kildare, Wicklow, Laois and Offaly.  Seats have been put in this very pleasant little spot, but for the past year one can see nothing from there but trees. The trees planted on that side of the hill have grown to the point where they now obscure the view.  There was no planning involved in that.  It is a nonsense.  There are other points which could be made about this issue and no doubt Deputy Kavanagh, like most of us, has a few <Col N="263" /> more skeletons in the cupboard in that regard.</P>

      <P>We will drag some of them out in a few minutes.  When I heard this Bill was to be brought forward I felt somewhat encouraged because it seems to start from a perfectly good principle and one which, as Deputy Deasy said, should have been enshrined in legislation 30 years ago.  However, once I started to read the Bill things started to go downhill very fast.  The Bill is far too tentative in its expression in legislation of this principle. Most of the Bill seems to be concerned with making exceptions to this principle rather than putting the principle into effect.  For example, there is no provision in the Bill for any authority other than a local planning authority to have any control or say over what that local authority does.  As Deputy Deasy said, the Minister knows perfectly well that local authorities have perpetrated some of the worst planning sins we have ever seen. There is nothing in this Bill which gives me any confidence that this will change. It seems that the reason this had happened is that the Government has actually reneged on its commitment to the original principle.  So far as I am aware, before, during and after the general election the two parties in Government said that they wanted to make sure that local authorities and State authorities would be subject to some outside scrutiny. There is no outside scrutiny of the activities of local authorities provided for in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tragedy is that there is already a body in existence which has the expertise to do that; it is called An Bord Pleanála. For most ordinary people this body is the court of final appeal in planning decisions.  It is the final arbiter of the shape of planning decisions in this country. It is a mechanism which is almost ideally suited to the job of keeping control, applying standards and applying some kind of sense to what local authorities do.  However, this is not provided <Col N="264" /> for in the Bill.  It is not provided for anywhere I can see in the Government's current intentions.  Nothing in the Bill will make any difference to the fact that local authorities can make very bad planning decisions.  I am not criticising all local authorities indiscriminately for this. The fact of the matter is that &mdash; members of local authorities know this full well &mdash; local authorities have made some very bad planning decisions in the past.  There is nothing in this Bill which will stop them from doing this in the future.</P>
    <P>There are some very worrying exceptions in the Bill.  These can be referred to in more detail on Committee Stage. The exception in section 2 (1) (a) (i) is very widely drawn.  It states that the Minister may decide that the provisions in this Bill &ldquo;shall not apply to any specified class or classes of developments if such development is, in the opinion of the Minister, in connection with&rdquo;&mdash; what does that mean?  &mdash;&ldquo;or for the purposes of&rdquo;&mdash; what does that mean?  &mdash;&ldquo;public safety or order, the administration of justice, national security or defence&rdquo;. That can mean an awful lot of things.  I have no confidence whatsoever that future Ministers will not justify the widest possible exceptions on the basis of that provision on its own.</P>
    <P>The final paragraph of section 2 states that the exception will apply &ldquo;for so long as such regulations are in force&rdquo; and that the provisions of the Principal Acts &ldquo;shall not apply to the said class or classes of development&rdquo;.  That could mean that a particular development is exempted forever from the provisions of the Bill which on reading do not amount to a thraneen.</P>
    <P>Everything after the first line of the Bill limits the application of what has been put forward.  It is a joke to have this process for State bodies to consult the local authorities.  The local authority members, as the Minister should know, are tired of being consulted about things that they have no power to determine. They do not want to be consulted, what they want is control over developments in the area for which they have a responsibility. This Bill is not giving them anything <Col N="265" /> of that kind and when it is passed the State authorities, with the backing of the Minister for the Environment, can continue to ride roughshod over what local authority members believe should be the shape of development in their area.  There will not be a blind thing they will be able to do about it.  Once they have been consulted the provisions of the Bill will have been respected and they can go and whistle after that.  They can have all the ideas about the harmonious development of their area but they will not be able to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>I was amused to hear Deputy Ellis talk about democracy in the context of this Bill which I consider to be thoroughly anti-democratic.  There is no provision in it for control by a local authority but there is an even more insidious evil because the Minister will have the power to decide certain matters by regulation.  An expression of the purpose of the Bill is given in section 3 which states:</P>
    <P>The Minister may by regulations modify or adapt any provision of the Acts that is the planning and development Acts, 1963-92 for the purpose of securing or facilitating its application to development by or on behalf of a State authority</P>
    <P>That gives the Minister <i>carte blanche</i> in respect of these types of developments and it is where the anti-democratic nature of the Bill resides.  The Bill sets out to give the Minister powers which the High Court and the Supreme Court said he does not have at present and this section sets out to reverse what our courts have done and what the Government said it wanted to do in their so-called partnership for Government proposal.  That section guts this Bill, takes all the meaning out of it and brings us back to what has been a hobbyhorse of mine for some time, the business of Government by regulation.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals with important matters, both the exceptions and the few things that are not exceptions are important. The Bill sets out to give the Minister for the Environment powers to make regulations governing all these exceptions, <Col N="266" /> consultations and so on.  If one reads carefully through the local government planning and development Acts, 1963-92 one will find almost without exception, that the procedure under which the Minister makes regulations is that he promulgates the regulations, which are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and they come into effect immediately unless they are annulled by a motion of the Oireachtas within 21 sitting days.  I challenge any member of the Government to show me any case in the past ten years where any provision has been annulled under that procedure.</P>
    <P>We now know the Government's view of that provision because my colleague, Deputy Doyle, has been trying to get the Government to give time in this House to debate a regulation being made by the Minister for the Environment to give effect to an EC regulation on access to information on the environment.  That regulation can be annulled only if the Houses pass a motion annulling it within 21 sitting days and the Government will not allow Government time to discuss a motion to annul.  The Government is subverting the very limited latitude that is left for this democratic institution under the provisions of that kind of regulation.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill the Government is proposing that they should be allowed to do more of this.  Every development by a State or local authority can be sanctioned by the Minister for the Environment under that provision and if the Minister does not want to this House will never have the opportunity of admitting any contrary opinion on any one of those things.  For a socialist who pretended he was worried about planning law, who pledged himself to be part of an open government to come here with two jackboots on and try to ram this through the Government shows the disgusting level of apostasy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Government and the Minister are setting out to make this House, and every county council and planning authority in the country, a tame creature of the Minister for the Environment.  That is not what the Labour Party campaigned for in the election but it seems it has decided it does not matter a damn what it campaigned to do because to hell with democracy and let it get the powers it wants.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister on the speed with which he introduced the Bill.  I welcome this legislation which provides for the future regulation of development by or on behalf of State authorities, taking account of the recent Supreme Court ruling in the Mullaghmore and Luggala cases.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that this Bill does not fully address the question of the rezoning of land that has taken place.  I say that based on my experience as a public representative in a constituency which regularly witnesses rezonings and proposed rezonings.  Over the past months a number of attempts have been made to rezone lands which the planners in Dublin County Council recommend should not be proceeded with.  Indeed, last month in a speech to the Tallaght Chamber of Commerce, the Minister said he would not be making grants available to service lands which have been the subject of ill-considered and haphazard zoning decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is correct in his assertion that much of the capital's and the country's planning has been conducted in a non-co-ordinated and haphazard fashion.  All too often, for whatever <Col N="269" /> reason, councillors vote in favour of proposed rezonings without taking into account the need for the necessary infrastructure. All the necessary decisions concerning infrastructure, such as roads, water and sewerage, should be an integral part of the consideration of the development plan.  In the nineties, Mr. Myles Wright in his long term plan for the greater Dublin area recommended, for the better development of our capital city, the development of three satellite towns.  Since then the Dublin city and county planners have taken the Myles Wright plan as an integral part of the basic framework of the city and county development plan.</P>

      <P>Land use and transportation policy for the region has also been based on the same long term strategy. The Dublin Transportation Initiative &mdash; of which I am a local authority member &mdash; is moving towards its final report and it is the kind of planning exercise we should all applaud and encourage. This initiative is taking a long term strategic view and it has involved a process of comprehensive public consultation and participation.  In its main recommendation the DTI interim report, published last February, called for a light rail system and public transport quality bus corridors between the centre city and the satellite towns.  It stresses the importance of pursing a coherent land use policy for the greater Dublin area to support and reinforce the DTI transport strategy.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to say that the Programme for Government includes a commitment to implement many of the interim recommendations of the DTI which includes up to four light rail lines, the introduction of ten quality bus corridors, the extension and upgrading of DART and the provision of parking facilities at public transport terminals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present the development plans are very much a controversial issue in the Dublin region.  In December 1991, Dublin City Council &mdash; of which I am a <Col N="270" /> member &mdash; adopted its second development plan.  As Lord Mayor I had the honour of being at the final council meetings which adopted the development plan.  This process included public displays of the plan, consideration for the public submissions in detail and the evolution of a wide cross-party consensus which culminated in the adoption of the Dublin city development plan with the support of all the major parties and groups on Dublin City Council.</P>
    <P>At present Dublin County Council is considering its development plan.  The picture that is beginning to emerge from the deliberations of Dublin County Council in relation to that council's development plan is riddled with utter confusion and a total lack of coherence. Decisions are being made almost on a daily basis to rezone large tracts of land against the advice of the county council's professional planners and engineers in relation to the cost of servicing the rezoned lands.</P>
    <P>I welcome the statement by the Minister for the Environment on 26 May in Tallaght when he warned those members of Dublin County Council, involved in the rezonings that they could not bank on State funding to finance the implications for the taxpayer of their willy-nilly rezoning activities.  I support the Minister in his stand and I hope his warnings have not fallen on deaf ears.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency of Dublin North-East, one-third of the constituency, is within the administrative area of Dublin County Council.  This includes Baldoyle and Howth where some of the worst examples of rezoning are being attempted.  In March 1993 a rezoning motion was submitted to a special meeting of Dublin County Council to rezone the high amenity east mountain area of Howth for residential use. This part of the Howth peninsula was an amenity and recreation area going back to the days of Fionn Mac Cumhaill. Opposition by local environmental groups and an Taisce led to a last minute withdrawal of the motion by its movers.</P>
    <P>In Baldoyle one of the most breathtaking rezoning motions is still before <Col N="271" /> Dublin County Council as part of the review of the development plan.  The existing Dublin county development plan has, as one of its principles, the preservation of green belt areas to provide a green lung between built-up areas and towns to prevent an ever expanding urban sprawl.  The Baldoyle racecourse, comprising 250 acres, was designated as a green belt to provide a lung between Baldoyle and Portmarnock, to safeguard the amenity of Baldoyle estuary, as a bird sanctuary in the present development plan.  A motion to rezone this green belt was submitted to a number of special meetings of Dublin County Council. Again, because of overwhelming opposition, this motion was defeated on 26 April 1993.  Since then attempts have been made to raise the matter both by way of procedural wrangling and by seeking legal opinions on rulings of the Chair. A widespread view exists that the last has not been heard of the encamp proposal.</P>
    <P>In Dublin County Council there is a practice known as &ldquo;sand bagging&rdquo;.  This device works as follows: councillors from outside the area support the rezoning and local councillors oppose it, although in the Baldoyle case it was the exception that proved the rule.  Two local councillors proposed the rezoning motion in Baldoyle which was defeated.</P>
    <P>The Minister has rightly stated that planning matters should be based around an approach which responds to the demands for systems of public information and involvement which lead to greater transparency.  I commend the Minister for implementing such a system. Eventually I hope it will lead to a tightening up of the rezoning process.  Section 2 provides that former Local Government Acts from 1963-92 shall not apply to a limited range of specified categories of development by or on behalf of the State.  I hope the Minister will be vigilant in applying this rule.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister is empowered to establish an alternative procedure of public notice and consultation for any development for which regulations are made.  I welcome the provision <Col N="272" /> in section 4 which obliges a local authority to prepare a report in relation to a proposed development and to submit this report to the elected members of the local authority.  As a councillor I believe this provision will introduce a greater degree of democracy into the planning process.  I urge the House to support this Bill as it will induce a greater measure of transparency into the planning process for State and local authority developments and I ask the House to support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is not about Luggala or Mullaghmore.  It is not a rehashing of the arguments for or against those two interpretative centres as that has been decided, up to the planning stage, by the Supreme Court decision. The Supreme Court has ruled that the application of the 1963 Planning Act has to apply to the decisions made by the Office of Public Works.  Therefore, the Government has accepted that both of these interpretative centres should be subjected to the planning laws.  To that extent, we accept that decision.  It was not a unanimous decision but in another context, in a different part of Europe, if today we get the same results we will be very happy.  As on all other occasions we accept the decision of the Supreme Court and we must get on with the shambles in which the Planning Acts have been left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has accepted demands from all sides of the House and has reacted to the position of the Planning Acts and the Government controlled areas, such as the Office of Public Works, and how they are left at present.  The buildings which have been constructed since 1963, without planning permission would, except for the introduction of this Bill, have to seek planning permission in retrospect in order to be regarded as within the law of the land.  I do not think any of us want to see all the schools, the Garda stations, other interpretative centres and a whole range of buildings which were the responsibility of the Office of Public Works dragged into the planning sections of our local authorities. It is just not practical.  Therefore, there was an urgency to introduce this Bill to <Col N="273" /> ensure that those buildings were properly brought under the law.</P>
    <P>All of us in the House pay great tribute to the Office of Public Works.  We owe them a great debt of gratitude for the work they have done over the years, for the splendid constructions for which they are responsible, not only schools, Garda barracks, Army barracks etc., but the other interpretative centres which have been built throughout the country and which provide splendid amenities.</P>
    <P>My position about Luggala has been clear from day one.  I am interested only in Luggala and I have never involved myself with the Mullaghmore controversy. The design and the position of Luggala is ideal.  Anybody who has taken the trouble to visit the site or to examine the plans would agree that it was an acceptable and sympathetic proposal. We are not here to fight that battle, that will take place at local level in the planning area.  The situation at local council level will make it difficult for this proposition to receive support because of the requirement, under the material contravention rule, for three-quarters support to change the development plan. Nevertheless, I hope An Bord Pleanála will examine matters without any influence from either side and will make its decision on the basis of what is put before it.  The Bill is a direct result of the Supreme Court decision and the commitment in the Joint Programme for Governement that planning laws should apply to the Office of Public Works and other State and semi-State bodies not previously covered under the Planning Acts. Local authorities will be covered also under this Bill.  While the section in the Bill dealing with local authorities may be weak, there will not be a transfer of managerial powers to directly elected councillors.  This will involve a consultative process and we must wait to see if it will be effective.  As the Minister of State said the managerial role will have to be considered if more powers are to be transferred to local councillors.</P>
    <P>Those who argued against the interpretative centres at Mullaghmore and Luggala appear to consider it as a <Col N="274" /> victory that planning laws should apply to both those centres, but I would remind them that local planning is not very democratic and fair.  Local planning is an executive function and 99 per cent of cases are decided by the county manager with the advice of planning officials. Local councillors may implement section 4 of the Planning Act, which will be much more difficult to do following recent changes in Planning Acts, but this does not mean that councillors will suddenly have a greater say in the matter.  The county manager and his planning officials will continue to make decisions.  Those of us who are members of local authorities and attend planning committee meetings will be aware that decisions are made and members are then advised of those decisions.  We may make an input into such decision-making, make special appeals for certain cases and try to convince the manager and his planners that decisions are not always even-handed, but at the end of the day it is a managerial function and not one for local councillors.</P>
    <P>The main exception to this relates to development planning where local councillors have complete control.  My colleague, Deputy Séan Kenny, spoke about the development plan which is being reconstructed in Dublin County Council at present.  Development plans can be brought into effect for a term of five years and not be reconsidered for ten years. Material contraventions are introduced and changes are made, but the day-to-day control over planning lies in the hands of county managers and all local authority members are aware of that.</P>
    <P>I would like local county councillors to have more powers but we should be honest in regard to the pressure under which they come when asked to provide refuse or incinerator facilities or travellers' halting sites.  We are told that if such facilities are placed in a certain area the land and property surrounding it will be devalued.  We should be fair and state that under the present system the manager has a say in those matters.  If we want more powers given to local councillors we must demand that local councils are elected for a shorter term, say, four <Col N="275" /> years.  We should consider having by-elections to local councils.  If councillors are given more responsibility and the public elect them they will see that electing urban councillors for periods of ten years without change and county councillors for periods of seven years is undemocratic.  If we want democracy we should have it at local level and I hope the Minister of State who is examining that matter will consider those facts.  If we want more power we must be responsible to those who elect us and if we are responsible to them we must be elected at regular intervals and such elections should not be altered because of European or general elections.</P>

      <P>It is exactly two weeks since the former Green Party TD for Dublin South, Mr. Roger Garland, and I attended a press conference in Buswell's Hotel following the historic Supreme Court decision which requires the Office of Public Works and other State bodies to seek planning permission before carrying out developments such as the interpretive centres at Mullaghmore and Luggala, not forgeting those in the Boyne Valley and in Dunquin, County Kerry.  At that press conference on behalf of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, and the public at large, I thanked Mr. Roger Garland for all his work in helping to bring about this change for the Office of Public Works and the Minister.  On that day I looked forward to the introduction of legislation to validate in law the court's decision to force the Government and its agencies to be accountable to the same planning criteria and procedures as govern the private and commercial sectors at present.  Unfortunately, we are still waiting for equality in the area of planning as this Bill bestows on the Minister enormous <Col N="276" /> powers to regulate the law.  I hope the Minister considers the power he has given to himself in this Bill as an unacceptable starting point and that he will accept serious judicious amendments to ensure that the spirit of the Supreme Court decision is implemented in law. Pragmatically speaking, I can see the whip being used to make the majority in Government support this Bill.</P>
      <P>Effectively, the court primarily took on board the widespread concern over Mullaghmore and Luggala and section 5 (2) (a) of the Bill permits the Minister to ignore this decision and allow the two centres to be completed with no further comment.  Section 5 states:</P>
      <P>Permission under Part IV of the Principal Act shall not be required for&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  any development commenced by or on behalf of a State authority during a period of one year beginning on the commencement of this section, or ...</P>
      <P>What is the Government playing at?  All its printed words are a veritable charade if it exempts Mullaghmore, Luggala and the Boyne sites from the normal planning procedures with which ordinary citizens must comply.  Any other points made here today, while uncertainty hangs over the controversial centres and festers, are little more than a deckchair on the <i>Titanic</i>, as it were, unless the Minister can ensure that the spirit of the court decision on 26 May is fully adhered to.</P>

      <P>Apart from specific developments being undertaken by the Office of Public Works, some general aspects of the Bill and related comments by other Members need to be referred to.  Like Deputy Gilmore, I am sad that the Office of Public Works is the focus of such discontent among the public because of the careless omissions and inequalities in our planning laws to date, <Col N="277" /> particularly as they apply to State sponsored developments.  The Office of Public Works has a very good reputation in canal restoration, maintaining historic buildings, protecting certain areas of importance for wildlife and educating the public in aspects of our common heritage through various media.</P>
      <P>The real problem, which this Bill worsens rather than solves, is that the Minister is allowed to be the judge and jury in the context of certain planning laws for State bodies.  The Minister can, where he considers it necessary, arrange for the preparation of an environmental impact statement and he may make it available for inspection on purchase by members of the public.  Such powers in the hands of one person are excessive to the point of being autocratic.  There should be a statutory body to oversee such far-reaching decisions.  For instance, in the context of section 31 of the Broadcasting Act, the Dáil has a role in reviewing the <i>status quo</i> on a regular basis.  Without an informed and democratically accountable process to oversee planning decisions the court battles will be repeated again and again. Ordinary people exercising their right to challenge autocracy will become poorer as the legal profession thrives on legal fees earned resolving disputes caused by anti-democratic laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government pays lip service to the principle of subsidiarity, but this is an opportunity to open up the planning process and allow every citizen to have a say in protecting and developing our resources in a sensitive, ecological way. I suggest one simple amendment to facilitate this democratisation process.  I refer to section 2 (2) (c) which provides that a notice of the making of an order be published in a newspaper circulating in the area of the development concerned. I ask the Minister to follow the example of the Office of Public Works when it places an advertisement.  We have seen some of these magnificent advertisements which do not rely solely on words, it uses pictures to tell us what it is doing at Newgrange and Cashel.  It is not just any newspaper in the area in which it chooses to advertise, certain <Col N="278" /> newspapers in Cork city are national newspapers but they are not widely read, and application notices or advertisements are placed in them.</P>

      <P>Certain newspapers are not, and the circulation figures bear that out.  Advertisements should be placed in the newspapers with the highest circulation, that could be easily written into the law so that we do not fall between two stools.  The notices the Offices of Public Works places are not just in the most popular paper but are often graphically and tastefully displayed on a prominent hoarding on the site of the development.  If the Minister would care to cycle out by the North Strand after a long day here he will see a clear example of the work of the Office of Public Works at a bridge over the Royal Canal where a very beautiful sign tells anyone within 100 yards of the canal that work is ongoing.  These are the signs we need before developments begin to encourage consultation and to avoid wasting the time of the courts.

      <P>Some parts of the Bill are beyond redemption.  We are all, effectively, wasting our time here because under section 3 the Minister may modify or adapt any provision of the Bill for the purpose of securing or facilitating its application to development by or on behalf of a State authority.  This Bill is not just about reducing the Minister's powers.  It is and should be about giving people a decisive say in the development of their own area and, indeed, their own country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not just the State which has thwarted the people's wishes as with Mullaghmore and Luggala, a few infamous developers have cost many people sleepless nights, expensive legal fees and loss of amenities.  I spoke about this problem <Col N="279" /> during last week's debate on the Protection of Occupiers of Land Bill and it is also relevant in the context of this Bill. The disappearance of rights of way is a very controversial issue in my area of Dublin north, specifically in Portmarnock. Infringement of rights of way is also an issue in Kinsale, Mayo and elsewhere.  Will the Minister again look at the issue of protecting these rights of way?  The Bill should protect communities from the affluent developers and their greed.</P>
    <P>The Bill, unfortunately, still copper-fastens a double standard in our planning law.  One example relates to Dublin north as well as to County Kerry.  Farranfore airport applied for planning permission for a runway.  Permission was granted with very strict conditions relating to noise insulation and the effect on the local area.  On the other hand Aer Rianta, a much bigger body, can hide behind immunity from State planning laws and build a runway but it has yet to deal with the effects on its local area. The people in St. Margaret's will tell the Minister how their lives have been disrupted.  I hope this matter will be dealt with as it is more urgent than others which have received attention.</P>
    <P>The double standard still exists where an ordinary person is told that his development is not appropriate to zoning while on the other hand those with money, power and influence can use them to appeal against a decision that goes against them when they want to build golf clubs &mdash; which do not need planning permission &mdash; extinguish rights of way or build large scale residential areas of a speculative nature.  These people can offer sports clubs, football pitches, club houses and other facilities. They can offer to build roads for the local community and the council, which is often strapped for cash.  The people themselves can turn on their own community and regard these offers as a good deal which should be accepted.  Unfortunately, if it is not accepted, as in the case of Baldoyle, there are threats of legal action because these people also <Col N="280" /> have money to go to any court in the land and take a case if the decision is not to their thinking.  We must live with the results.</P>
    <P>The development plan in Swords, County Dublin has brought that area to the attention of the public.  Regarding the decision in relation to Brackenstown Road, people on one end of the road have requested a bus service but the other end of the road is too narrow to take a bus.  People are almost faced with a riot on the streets.  People on one end of the street do not want the bus service while those on the other do.  This conflict goes back to the planning omissions which allow rezoning to take place in a piecemeal fashion.  Another example of bad planning is the housing scheme built near a sewage treatment plant in Swords.  It has cost the council a large amount to treat the resultant odour in the area.  I agree with Deputy Killeen's remark that it would have been easier if planning permission had been compulsory for Mullaghmore initially.  If this Bill provides exemptions in this regard, all the interested parties will be back in the High Court or the Supreme Court and I am sure nobody wants that to happen.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Sargent for sharing his time.  Already our spokesperson, Deputy Doyle, has outlined clearly and cogently her general principles in relation to this Bill.  However.  I wish to refer to a problem in my constituency and one which is relevant to the Bill before us.  The ESB is now seeking planning permission to erect a 220 KV transmission line from Flagfort near Carrick-on-Shannon to Drumsallagh near Bundoran.  It proposes erecting a double circuit transmission line carried by pylons for 70 miles.  Those pylons range in height from 110 feet to 170 feet. There is no building or trees in the north west the height of those pylons which are proposed to be erected over a 70 mile distance through some of our most beautiful scenic territory.  Often when people object they exaggerate the position, but there is no exaggeration in this case.  Those pylons will cause massive <Col N="281" /> scenic pollution in this area.  The Minister of State comes from that territory originally and he is aware that it is beautiful countryside, perhaps unsung.  It does not get the same hype as Killarney, but it is a beautiful area.  However, those pylons will cause massive scenic pollution.  The area will be ruined; it will be raped by those pylons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment should talk to the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to ensure that this proposed planning permission will not go through.  I can do my share by raising the matter here but I ask the Minister of State to do his share.  I am sure he will do this and that is why I raise this issue so confidently now.  We have been told that those pylons may be a health risk.  I will not go into that as I am not an authority on that matter and I will not put the case for something which I cannot cogently argue and back up with facts and figures.  Those pylons will cause damage to farmland.  Anyone who travels through Barnesmore Gap in County Donegal can see the damage caused by pylons in that area.  There must be an alternative to the pylons.  It is necessary to provide power but there should be a moratorium on erecting those pylons until all areas are investigated.  Perhaps there could be a link up with the inter-connector from Northern Ireland.  I appeal to the Minister of State and the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to meet representatives from the ESB to consider this matter.  In recent times the ESB has been sensitive to such issues.  It had aberrations in its earlier days, but under the management of Dr. Moriarty and others it has been sensitive to such issues.  I am sure the ESB will reconsider its proposal.  The Minister can make a difference in relation to this matter and he could do good work <Col N="282" /> for the part of the country from which he comes.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to welcome this Bill.  It is necessary legislation in that it effectively addresses the issues raised by the Mullaghmore controversy and the broader issues of transparency and consultation.  Before addressing the Bill I will turn my attention to the recent controversies regarding interpretative centres.</P>
      <P>I can well understand the passions unleashed in recent debates on this issue. The Irish landscape is one of the most remarkable and beautiful on the face of the earth.  No one wants to see it despoiled. It is an integral part of our natural heritage, a precious legacy for future generations. No one has a monopoly on caring for this landscape.  I care deeply for this landscape and I also believe in the value of interpretative centres.  These two areas are not mutually incompatible, but from recent speeches and addresses one would imagine they were.  To say that this is otherwise is a crude caricature of this debate.</P>
      <P>In this regard I have been dismayed by the posturings of some of those who have opposed interpretative centres and who have portrayed themselves as the only true defenders of the Irish landscape.  I find this smug piety most offensive.  It seems that those individuals have a particular view of Ireland; it is an Ireland they wish to see preserved in amber for their own pleasure, irrespective of the feelings and concerns of the people who inhabit the landscape concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems the group that was most ignored in the recent controversy was the ordinary people who live in the localities concerned.  Those are the people who have a deep and ingrained knowledge of the landscape they inhabit.  They do not need to be preached to about the world they inhabit; they know it very well.  It is <Col N="283" /> they who have to make a living in an often economically deprived community, with high levels of unemployment and emigration.</P>
    <P>These local people must have been bemused by the sight of flying squadrons of self-appointed environmental guardians descending on their localities.  I wonder did these local people feel honoured to have such wisdom among them, preaching to them about the landscape they inhabit, telling them of its value and beauty &mdash; things that as natives they supposedly could not possibly know? There is something deeply paternalistic and patronising in the attitude of some of those self-appointed guardians.  It presupposes ignorance on the part of the areas' inhabitants.  It smacks of old time landlordism.  Those people have lived in those areas for generations.  They know and respect the landscape they inhabit, and it is deeply insulting to them to suggest otherwise.  The people of those communities will continue to live in those areas long after the self-appointed guardians have returned to the leather armchairs of their urban dwellings.</P>
    <P>Local community groups wish to foster growth in their areas.  Indeed, the growth of community-based initiatives has been a most positive trend in recent years. One way to foster such growth is through a respectful relationship with the landscape. One way to achieve this is through the construction and development of interpretative centres.  I know of course that this will come as heresay to the tender ears of the self-appointed guardians. Like all dogmatists they have no time for anyone who does not subscribe to their particular creed; the importance of jobs and enterprise does not enter into their fossilised view of Ireland.  They would rather see a landscape inhabited by rocks and stones, beautiful but empty, than by families and communities, with no pesky natives to get in the way of their aesthetic enjoyment when they pop down for a visit.</P>
    <P>It also appears to me that there is an irony at the heart of the argument of the <Col N="284" /> self-appointed guardians.  They oppose interpretative centres yet insist on imposing their particular interpretation of the landscape on the people who live there.</P>
    <P>In recent times the Office of Public Works has come in for much criticism.  I know from experience that much of this criticism was unjustified, ill-informed and, I am sad to say, perhaps deliberately so.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the tremendous contribution which the Office of Public Works has made to Irish life since it was founded over 160 years ago.  There is not a parish that has not benefited from the works of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>It is important to bear in mind the breadth of the work carried out by the Office of Public Works in the areas of public sector accommodation, arterial drainage, development of inland waterways, conservation of national monuments and historic properties, management of national parks, the protection of flora and fauna and the operation of the Government Supplies Agency.  It is important to be aware of this context and temper our comments accordingly.  To listen to some of the comments regarding the Office of Public Works in recent times one would envisage it as some sort of ruthless bogeyman trampling around the country despoiling the countryside at will.  This gives a completely erroneous impression and those who were trying to create that impression were aware of it.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned the Office of Public Works was green long before environmental issues were placed on the political agenda.  I know from personal experience that it pursued an enlightened and imaginative approach to the protection of our environment, built and natural.  The Office of Public Works has always been conscious that conservation of the resource is the primary objective. However, this must be carefully balanced with the need to provide some access to the monument or landscape through the provision of appropriate infrastructure which may entail an interpretative centre.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="285" /> I believe in public access to our landscape. As a matter of course this must be carefully managed.  I do not accept the view that the landscape must be somehow sealed off from ordinary people.  Landscape does not exist in a vacuum, it is not a museum piece.  People are part of an interactive landscape.  The work of the Office of Public Works reflects the fact that heritage belongs to the people.  It is not the preserve of elitists.  The public should be informed and educated as to the importance of conservation.  Interpretative centres are a key element of this strategy to inform and educate the public. Contrary to what has been said, interpretative centres can be used as an effective tool for conservation and education. In such centres the public can be given an experience of elements of our natural or cultural heritage, conveying the importance of this heritage and, most importantly, communicating what conditions are necessary so that this heritage will survive for other generations to see and experience.  The Office of Public Works has done an admirable job in preserving our national heritage and long may its work continue.</P>
    <P>I would also like to use this opportunity to highlight another aspect of the valuable work of the Office of Public Works, namely, decentralisation.  Over the years, many provincial regions suffered considerably from the effects of emigration of its people, particularly the younger generation, to Dublin to work in the public sector.  The Office of Public Works' role in the decentralisation process has helped to reduce regional imbalances and the pressures on the Dublin region.  As a rural Deputy I cannot over emphasise the importance of this process.</P>
    <P>In essence the men and women of the Office of Public Works are public servants in the truest sense of the phrase.  I wish some other Members of this House could have been less begrudging in their praise of these men and women.</P>
    <P>Consultation is an important part of the democratic process.  In particular, this applies to local communities.  In the case of recent controversies this would have clearly indicated the support of local <Col N="286" /> people for the projects concerned and put the objections of elitist groups in their correct perspective.  Therefore, I welcome the provisions in the new Bill which allow for procedure of public notice and consultation for local authority development.  I have no doubt that this will lead to greater openness and transparency in relation to development in a local authority's own area which is not already subject to public consultation through environmental impact assessment requirements.</P>
    <P>As a result of this Bill we will in future be spared much of the bitterness that has characterised environmental debates. The new provisions will allow for both sides of the argument to be clearly outlined and for the pros and cons to be scrutinised in detail.  This is a healthier proposal than that which exists at present.  It could be something of a learning process for the different sides of the argument sensitising them to the views of others.  In particular, it might lead some of the more elitist opponents of interpretative centres to a greater awareness of the problems and concerns of ordinary local people, concerns with which I doubt they are faced with often in their daily lives.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the Bill's provisions to allow for greater transparency in the whole planning process.  I believe in transparency as a basic democratic principle that should be extended to other areas of Irish life which are often obscured by bureaucracy.  Part and parcel of this process is making development by State authorities subject to the planning Acts.  I have no problem with this &mdash; it is a logical extension of the principle of transparency and openness and I welcome it.</P>
    <P>We should always be examining new ways to preserve our heritage and to communicate and share its richness.  In time this will lead to a more open, mature and, above all, tolerant debate.  The Bill marks a turning point in that it allows this debate to take place in a more open and accessible forum.  My final wish is that the concerns of the local people who inhabit the areas involved are placed at the centre of <Col N="287" /> the debate and that these concerns and aspirations are not brushed aside by individuals who obviously believe themselves to be their betters.</P>
    <P>I am happy to commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. B. Fitzgerald Mr. B. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  It is welcome legislation and I hope it will take the planning process out of the courts and back into the hands of the planning authorities.  Judges and lawyers are employed to carry out judicial tasks, they are not employed to make planning decisions.</P>
      <P>The recent changes in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1992, were a major improvement and are welcome, particularly in relation to section 4 and its clarification of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955.  The reforms give the public more information about planning decisions.  Local authorities must make available reports and documentation on all planning applications for public scrutiny prior to making a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, this does not apply to An Bord Pleanála.  It is not required to comply with the same conditions applying to a planning or local authority.  This was never more evident than in the Radio Tara case with which the Minister is well acquainted.  Radio Tara was a subsidiary of RTE and went through the full rigours of the planning process, from a section 4 at county council level to the overturning of the decision of the councillors by the county manager to an oral hearing by An Bord Pleanála over a four day period. An inspector was appointed by the board to hear the evidence and an expert from Eolas was employed to advise on the technical information.  After that period it made a recommendation to the board which decided to grant permission and to uphold the county council's decision. Unfortunately for it, the residents in the area appealed the decision to the High Court having sought a judicial review. On the discovery of documents it was <Col N="288" /> found that the 126 page report issued by the inspector came out strongly against the decision.  The board in its wisdom granted permission and when the case was appealed to the High Court the decision of An Bord Pleanála was quashed. However, the Supreme Court overturned that decision and judged there was no obligation on the board to reveal the documentation or material it took into consideration in making its decision.</P>
    <P>To make matters worse, when the decision was made the same inspector who recommended refusal was advised to set down whatever conditions he felt necessary to allow the decision to go ahead.  If we are to have any confidence in the planning process An Bord Pleanála must be completely overhauled.  It should be required to comply with similar conditions to those with which the planning authority has to comply.  Why should an area engineer or a planning officer have to write a report which may be in conflict with that of the county engineer and make it available to the public when the members of An Bord Pleanála do not have to do so?  Reports may be obtained only on the production of domements, for which one must go to the High Court. In this case all documentation was not made available and there was no shred of evidence or minute to suggest that the report was considered by the board in making their decision.  That is there for all to see.</P>
    <P>If this legislation had been in place a few years ago the difficulties we are now facing would not exist, particularly that of the interpretative centre in the Boyne Valley.  Seven years of consultation have taken place in relation to that project, during which time the Office of Public Works co-operated with the planning authority, members of the county council and experts.  Unfortunately, at the end of the day ten people, on the coat tails of others, were able to take the case to court to have the project stopped.  As a result 70 people are without work.  We should never allow such circumstances to develop again.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to a matter in relation to An Bord Pleanála which <Col N="289" /> affects local authorities.  If a local authority refuses planning permission for a house in a rural area and on appeal An Bord Pleanála upholds the decision of the local authority, stating the reason that it would be a traffic hazard, it appears as a result of a High Court decision that under section 4 of the 1955 Act the planning authority or local representatives cannot overturn that decision.  It is time that aspect was considered.</P>
    <P>In a recent case planning permission was refused to a person living in a mobile home and farming 30 acres of land, even though a unanimous decision was made by the local authority members that permission should be granted.  On legal advice the manager was not allowed to grant permission, because of the decision of the High Court in relation to a case in Galway.  It was not the intention under the 1963 Planning Act that all cases would be decided in the courts.  The 1992 Act clarified a number of aspects in the 1955 Act, but it is unacceptable that cases continue to come to light such as that I have mentioned.  I and my colleagues in the local authority advise applicants not to appeal to An Bord Pleanála lest the decision of the planning authority is upheld on the basis that to grant permission would create a traffic hazard.  I appreciate that that reason is given because it would exempt the authority from claims for compensation.  However, it is unacceptable that local authority members have not the right, if they see fit, to change the decision at a later stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes proposed in this legislation but I ask the Minister to consider very closely the whole Planning Act, particularly the appeals section, as it relates to An Bord Pleanála.  I do not want to see similar circumstances as those which arose in a rural community, of which the Minister is well aware against which the inspector and the Eolas expert warned.  It is unacceptable that people sitting around a table could overturn the recommendation of experts without any evidence to suggest that they took into consideration the report before them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like first to extend my thanks to all Deputies who have taken part in today's proceedings.  We have had a detailed consideration of the Bill and I hope, in so far as time permits, to respond to the various points made and issues raised by Deputies.  It would be useful, however, before going on to deal with particular matters to restate briefly the purpose of the Bill and the effects it will have.</P>
      <P>As regards state development, the Bill will bring about a situation in which most development by or for State authorities will need planning permission in the same way as development generally.  The only qualifications on the general application of normal planning controls will be those set out in section 2 of the Bill and the one year transitional period provided for in section 5.  It will be seen that the exclusionary power under subsection (1) of section 2 can be exercised only in limited and clearly-defined circumstances. It is clear also that the power in subsection (2) of that section is of a reserve nature and would be used only in wholly exceptional circumstances.  The one year transitional period is vital to ensure a smooth start-up for the new regulatory process if we are to avoid disruption to projects now ready to proceed or currently at an advanced stage of planning. We are moving, therefore, from a position in which State authorities have engaged in a closed process of consultation with planning authorities about certain development to a new era in which State authority development will generally go through development control procedures under the Planning Acts in the same way as any other development. This will, of course, bring about significantly greater openness and transparency in relation to the State's development proposals and will allow extensive opportunities for public involvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to comment on Deputy Dukes' contribution.  I am not sure if the Deputy was sitting in the sun during the lunch-break or if he had a special lunch, but the extraordinary language he used in the House contrasts greatly with the <Col N="291" /> reasoned debate that took place.  He described my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, and myself as fascists and used words such as &ldquo;jackboots&rdquo;.  The Deputy asserted that the Bill is anti-democratic because it allegedly allows the Minister to provide by regulation that any development by the State will not be subject to planning controls.  This is based on a total misconstruction of the purpose, intent and effect of the Bill under which most development by the State will require planning permission.  His colleague, Deputy Doyle, taking a much more reasonable and realistic approach, accepted this morning that certain exceptions are needed to cater for accidents, emergencies and developments regarding security, the only type of development which will be covered by the clause of the Bill under which there will be certain exceptions to the full permission requirements.</P>
    <P>As for local authority development, the new regulatory power which section 4 gives the Minister for the Environment will be used to create requirements of public notice and involvement for development not subject to any requirements of that nature at present.  This will lead to greater public awareness of local authority development proposals and will give people a say on matters which may affect or concern them.  The new process of public notice and consultation for local authority development will culminate in the submission of a report to the elected members of the local authority.  This report will give details of the proposed development and set out the views expressed in the public consultation process. It will therefore facilitate the councillors in arriving at a view on whether a development should go ahead and or whether to use their powers under the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955 to direct that work not proceed.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the assertions by some Deputies that the Bill is a reactive or piecemeal measure.  It was not put together hastily in response to the recent <Col N="292" /> Supreme Court ruling.  It was clearly explained that the Government had decided upon the framework for the future regulation of State authority development as long ago as last March well in advance of the Supreme Court ruling.  It is clear from what has been said today that the Bill will establish a rational and effective regime in which there will be greater openness and extended public involvement.</P>
    <P>I am particularly disappointed by Deputy Gilmore's decision to oppose the Bill's Second Reading.  This stance is not justified by the Bill's objective merits or by his comments on it.  There was a certain degree of common ground in the comments and queries of Deputies and the best way to address them is to look at the sections of the Bill in sequence.</P>
    <P>In the case of section 1, Deputy Doyle commented on the absence of any definition of the term &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>A number of separate issues were raised about section 2 (1) (a).  The first of these is what is meant by the term &ldquo;security&rdquo;.  As was explained earlier, the type of development which this embraces is Garda stations, courthouses, prisons and military installations.  There is nothing more wide-ranging than this involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Doyle, McGrath and others said that they detected certain sinister overtones in subparagraph (ii) of subsection (1) (a).  However, I want to give the House a categoric assurance that there is nothing sinister involved.  All that it will permit the Minister for the Environment to do is to remove a particular form of development from planning control if there is already in place a statutory procedure through which that development must be authorised.  It is not an <Col N="293" /> automatic exception, and the power under this provision to take particular State development outside planning control will not be used unless we are entirely saisfied that the existing authorisation procedure has adequate provision for public notice and involvement.  I am astonished by Deputy Gilmore's claim that this provision could give rise to a new immunity from planning control for private development.  It is self-evident that section 2 as a whole is concerned only and exclusively with development by or for State authorities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doyle and others suggested the possibility of keeping State development which will not be subject to normal planning controls within the planning process, on the basis that it would be subject to outline planning permission requirements.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to the statement being circulated as widely as possible, along with any other comments I make.  I will circulate it to Members immediately if that can be arranged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should explain, however, that outline planning permission as currently provided for in the planning code is just that. It simply involves the planning authority <Col N="294" /> giving its agreement in principle to a particular type of development at a particular site.  Outline permission does not, of itself, authorise the carrying out of any development.  A person who obtains outline planning permission for development must afterwards submit detailed plans and particulars and obtain full planning approval before any works may be carried out.</P>
    <P>If a State authority was to obtain outline permission in its present form for development which, for example, raises security considerations, it would still be necessary for the authority to submit full plans and particulars for the approval of the planning authority or An Bord Pleanála in the event of an appeal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

      <P>Outline planning permission would give rise to the same problems of disclosure of sensitive and confidential details.  I take the point the Deputy made earlier, that outline planning permission should be sufficient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>It is for this reason that it is essential to have a mechanism which allows development which raises security issues to be taken outside the scope of planning controls.  I hope that it has been made clear, however, that use will be made of the regulatory power under section 2 (1) (b) to ensure that there is as much public information and consultation as possible, consistent with bona fide confidentiality requirements for development of this kind.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGrath mentioned that public notice regulations under section 2 (1) (b) will not be compulsory for all development taken outside planning controls by regulations under section 2 (1) (a).</P>
      <P>Strictly speaking, this is true.  It has been made very clear, however, that it is intended to have the greatest degree of public information and involvement, consistent with security needs, for any development which is removed from the ambit of the planning Acts.  Regulations under section 2 (1) (b) will, therefore, be made for any development brought outside the planning process, unless we are satisfied that there are very compelling reasons as to why complete confidentiality is needed.</P>
      <P>Looking briefly at section 2 (2), I wish to comment only that it has been made clear that this power is of a reserve character.  It is to be used only in very exceptional circumstances and will not constitute a means whereby a significant element of State development can be brought outside of planning controls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a good deal of comment on section 3 and the power it gives the Minister to modify the planning Acts by way of regulations.  We are advised, however, that a power such as that proposed in the section is legally permissible. The Oireachtas will, in the other provisions of the Bill, have laid down the <Col N="296" /> general policy as regards the application of planning law to State development. This is that such development will be subject to normal planning controls, save to the extent that the Bill provides otherwise. The power under section 3 will not permit the policy established by the Oireachtas to be altered or modified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The aspects of the provisions of section 4 which seemed to concern Members most was the absence of a right of appeal against a local authority decision as to whether a development should go ahead.  A similar concern was expressed in relation to the process of public notice and consultation which the provisions of section 2 (1) (b) would empower the Minister to initiate.  Taking local authority development first, I have indicated that the new procedure of public notice and involvement of the public to be established by regulation under section 4 will culminate in the submission of a report or any proposed development to the elected members of the local authority.  The final decision will rest with the elected councillors, who are already empowered by the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, to give a direction to managers that works are not to proceed.  I consider that <Col N="297" /> that process will contain sufficient internal checks and balances and will be democratic in nature so that it will not be necessary or appropriate to have an external appeals mechanism.</P>
      <P>Turning to development on the part of State authorities, the first point I want to make is that in future most such developments will be subject to normal planning controls.  This means that any person will be entitled to make a submission to the relevant planning authority and appeal against that planning authority's decision to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
      <P>When the transitional arrangements provided for in section 5 are terminated, the only development on the part of State authorities which will remain outside normal planning controls will be categories to which regulations under section 2 (1) (a) apply or particular projects for which an order is made under section 2 (2).  However, I want to reiterate that we are talking here about a relatively small portion of the overall programme of State authority development. Orders under section 2 (2) will be made in exceptional circumstances only. Regulations made under section 2 (1) (a) may bring development outside the ambit of the planning Acts only where security considerations arise or whenever there is already a statutory authorisation process.</P>
      <P>As has been stated, provision will be made also, through regulations under section 2 (1) (b) of the Bill, for public notice of and involvement with development taken outside the scope of the planning control.  These regulations will not provide for appeals because it would not be possible to reconcile an appellate process with the confidentiality requirements which exist in relation to developments with a security dimension.  However, the intention is that there will be an opportunity for the public to make submissions in relation to a proposed development as well as an express legal duty for the State authority concerned to take account of such submissions when deciding whether a development should go ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moving on to section 5, first I want to make the general point that the provisions of this section take the necessary <Col N="298" /> step of rectifying the position of developments which State authorities, acting in good faith, carried out without planning permission over the years.  The section also establishes what I consider to be the minimum necessary transitional period for bringing about the orderly and effective application of normal planning controls to the bulk of State development.</P>
    <P>I must correct Deputy Gilmore's evident misconception as to the possible effect of the operation of the provisions of that section in relation to the developments at Mullaghmore and Luggala.  It is quite clear that the proviso in section 5 (1) excludes these developments from the retrospective validation conferred by that subsection.  It is also evident that these developments cannot benefit from the transitional period which section 5 (2) will establish since that subsection states quite clearly that permission will not be required where development is commenced during a period of one year beginning with the coming into operation of the section.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doyle and others sought clarification as to what is meant by the commencement of development.  Quite simply, it means the physical start-up of a project on site and nothing before that.</P>
    <P>More generally a number of Deputies suggested that it would be desirable to have included in the Bill an express provision applying normal planning controls to State development.  However, we are advised that a provision of this nature is not necessary, given the conclusion of the Supreme Court that the provisions of the Planning Acts apply already to State development.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the need to simplify and codify planning law generally.  I sympathise with those views and will examine various ways of introducing improvements in this area.</P>
    <P>Given that I have more time than expected, there are a number of points raised by Members to which I might refer.  For example, a number of Members referred specifically to the quite disastrous &mdash; and I agree with them &mdash; housing developments built by local authorities, particularly in larger urban <Col N="299" /> areas.  I might point out to the House that, outside of the planning process, policy decisions have already been taken in my Department that these types of developments, built mainly in Dublin and other larger cities, will not be allowed in future, that we simply will not authorise funds from our Department to local authorities who insist on that type of development. Rather we shall be encouraging local authorities to develop infill spaces in cities, thereby bringing people back into living in cities, filling the vacuums created when people were moved out of cities, leading to the anti-social elements now filling such vacuums&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister of State disapproves of the new town centre concept?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily, dependent on where a town centre may be located. I would not take blanket exception to all such proposals.</P>
      <P>Another point raised at some length by two Members was that concerning an ESB proposal, or application for planning permission, for the erection of power lines and/or pylons.  I should point out that in the first instance that it is a matter for the relevant local authority who must take a decision on such planning application and who can, if it wishes, refuse such application.  The next step in the planning procedure is to An Bord Pleanála.  As I understand it, I am excluded by law from intervening in any way on the side of either an applicant or anybody objecting to an application.  I contend that is as it should be.  Therefore, I would have to say to Deputy Nealon that I cannot intervene in the actual planning process to which he referred at some length.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Members referred to the County Dublin Development Plan and rezoning there.  In this respect I might reiterate what the Minister himself has said on a number of occasions, which is that it is not acceptable that large tracts of land should be rezoned, willy nilly, simply to enhance the welfare of substantial <Col N="300" /> landowners, without reference to the need for such rezoning or the cost to the public of servicing such sites when rezoned.  I strongly support what the Minister has said: that the Department of the Environment, in funding such services in future, will look with a very jaundiced eye at that type of zoning when they apply for servicing, preference being given to areas that are properly zoned.  I would hope that councillors and elected members involved from all sides will take out the message loudly and clearly that they simply cannot any longer expect the public to pick up the tab for irresponsible rezoning of lands wherever there is more than adequate land already rezoned. That message must be got across.</P>
    <P>I take the point made by Deputy Barrett and see its validity.  I have not yet examined it further, so I shall not make any specific comment.  But I do see validity in allowing the three new Dublin Councils to actually deal with there own county development plan rather than have one greater one now rushed through in Dublin and imposed on them by the greater council.  There is merit in that.  It is something I will certainly examine.</P>
    <P>The Bill with which we are dealing here was not introduced simply as a result of the Supreme Court decision.  There was a commitment in the Programme for Government to introduce legislation of the nature of that with which we are dealing today.  In fact the Bill before us today goes beyond the point of commitment in the Programme for Government and meets the full case made arising from the Supreme Court judgment.  I am satisfied that the Bill before us has received a general fairly positive welcome from the far side of the House with the exception of Deputy Dukes, who, as I said earlier, sat out in the sun at lunchtime, and went overboard in his comments.</P>
    <P>Certainly, the Bill before us meets the Supreme Court decision and goes beyond the commitment given in the Programme for Government.  There is provision for exclusions in a limited number of cases. It has been recognised widely that these will be required in the planning process <Col N="301" /> in a limited number of cases.  We will have a new system at local authority level under which local authority members will be more involved and the public kept informed.  There will be transparency. This is a positive step with which I am happy to be associated.</P>
    <P>In regard to major developments by the State outside the security area, full planning permission will be required. This is the way it should be.</P>

While the Bill may have its shortcomings and difficulties may be encountered in the future the matter can be reviewed.  A number of my colleagues and speakers on the Opposition benches made the point that there is a need to review the existing planning legislation in its entirety to see if it could be made easier to understand.

      <P>This Bill proposes to update the outdated law on landowners' liability by protecting farmers and landlords from liability to entrants where there is no charge for entry to land.  I am <Col N="305" /> referring mainly to people who enter land without authorisation.  Many farmers have been forced to protect themselves from liability by closing off access to their lands.  This is most unfortunate and will have serious knock-on effects both on tourism revenue and employment in rural areas.</P>
      <P>Various Ministers and Governments have made promises to deal with this issue over the years.  Yet farmers and other land owners still remain seriously exposed to paying crippling costs for injuries sustained by people while on their lands.  People have been injured after gaining unauthorised access to lands and this had led to litigation against the landowner.  This is an unfortunate situation which must be addressed.  I hope that good will come out of the debate on this Bill, the provisions of which are worthwhile and should be recognised.</P>
      <P>If the Government and the party I represent are serious about developing the potential of tourism there is no doubt that a Bill like this which has merit must be taken on board and the Law Reform Commission will need to put forward the necessary recommendations quickly to put a Bill in place that will be in the best interests of rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farming is very important in rural areas.  However, farm machinery and other aspects of farming life pose risks. It is hard to prohibit children, whether from the city, town or neighbouring farm entering land or property because they like to see the animals and crops on the farm.  For that reason we must recognise the problem.  It is very serious when law abiding citizens are refused entry to a farm holding.  I come from a rural area and I am opposed to depriving others from entering my land because this is a right we enjoyed down through the years. We have a right to walk and enjoy the natural beauty of our countryside.  It is part of our heritage and one of our many attractions too numerous to mention.  If the problem is not addressed, however, it will create a greater divide between urban and rural people.  Many townspeople <Col N="306" /> drive out to the country on a Sunday afternoon and it is not reasonable to prohibit them from entering property.</P>
    <P>Field sports are also very important &mdash; indeed, a coursing Bill will be introduced shortly in this House.  We have open coursing meetings and many people come in a group to hunt and shoot.  In many cases while the members of the group may have cover others accompanying them to participate in the sport may not, which leads to problems.  The clubs have informed the farmers that they have indemnified themselves for a large sum of money but the odd person who is not a member of a club participates and this creates a problem.  I understand also that it is becoming prohibitive to get insurance cover to indemnify the club or organisation against the problems that can arise.  When I spoke the last evening I mentioned that many farmers and property owners have insurance cover to the tune of £2 million but I understand that is not sufficient.</P>
    <P>I wish this Bill success.  I hope the better parts of the Bill will be incorporated in the new legislation when it is introduced and I look forward to seeing it at an early date.</P>

      <P>The whole question of farmers and other occupiers having a liability for accidents to people who may come on to their land uninvited has been under discussion now for far too long and cries out for immediate action to deal with the situation once and for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats Party recognised the urgent need for action in this matter when we proposed its inclusion in the Programme for Government 1989-1993.  Unfortunately, the Minister responsible failed to bring forward the necessary legislation on public <Col N="307" /> liability and it remained as an unfulfilled commitment when the life of that Government was brought to an abrupt end by the outrageous and unfounded allegations by the Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds last October.</P>
    <P>With the increase in the number of claims against farmers by people who were in effect trespassing on their land, the situation became intolerable and has resulted in farmers in many areas now erecting signs forbidding people to cross their lands.  This is indeed an unfortunate development as it has been traditional over the centuries that farmers welcomed people on to their lands who wished to enjoy walking in the beautiful country side, or hunting, shooting and fishing.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats Party fully supports the Fine Gael Bill which we believe would be very effective in achieving the desired objective of protecting all land owners from any claims that might arise.  There is no doubt that the law in this area is outdated and archaic in giving illegal trespassers and others the right to claim compensation for any injuries that might befall them while they are on a farmer's holding even though, as in most cases, the farmers would not even know such a person was on their property, not to mind the fact that they would be there without his permission.</P>
    <P>The current position is indefensible, it defies logic, it may not have mattered in the past when the courts took a different view but now that the courts have decided that a real liability rests with the farmer in certain circumstances, it is clear that immediate action will have to be taken to alleviate the situation.  Every day lost in amending the law in this area leaves tens of thousands of farmers open to serious liability way beyond their personal capacity to meet the type and size of claims that might be taken against them.  Instant legislation can be produced by the parliamentary draftsman and approved by Cabinets in certain circumstances when it is desirable to do so, so there is really no justification for delaying the bringing forward of urgent legislation now required in this area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="308" /> Too often in the past, good Bills such as this have been rejected by Governments on the grounds that they were going to bring forward their own Bill to deal more comprehensively with the issue in question.  We know from experience, however, that the promised legislation is often delayed for years or does not deal with the matter as expected when it is brought forward or indeed is never dealt with at all.  I compliment Deputy Deenihan and his Fine Gael front bench colleagues for taking this initiative.  It is timely and effective and deals satisfactorily with the issue.  The Progressive Democrats Party will support this Bill and will vote for it at the conclusion of the debate.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government parties to support this Bill and not to play the old political game so beloved of parties in power and so scorned by parties in Opposition, of voting down Opposition Bills on the pretext of pending legislation being prepared by themselves.  The most recent example of this is the voting down of the Progressive Democrats Party Bill combating vandalism, loitering and unlawful assembly.  Yet the promised Government Bill has not yet appeared.  People have been injured and communities have been living in fear because of the lack of adequate Garda powers to deal with certain situations as was proposed in the Progressive Democrats Party Bill. However, the Government rejected the proposal when the vote was taken.  Let us hope we will not have a repeat of that small minded attitude when the vote is taken on this Bill tonight.</P>
    <P>Last week the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy discussed the Estimates for the Department of Tourism and Trade in a very unreal atmosphere because of the inability of the Minister for Tourism and Trade to indicate to the committee whether this Bill would be accepted by the Government at tonight's vote.</P>
    <P>It is a well known fact that access to the countryside by tourists for sporting and recreation activities contributes about £200 million to the Irish economy, a great part of which is actually spent in rural communities.  This major section of <Col N="309" /> our tourist industry is immediately under threat because of the decision of many farmers to refuse access to, or crossing of their lands, by third parties who do not have personal liability insurance taken out.</P>
    <P>The tourist season of 1993 is already upon us and still no action from the Government to protect farmers against these liability claims.  It is clear that there will be widespread chaos particularly if the action of Clare farmers in the Burren region is repeated nationwide.</P>
    <P>This whole question of public liability has already become a nightmare for other owner-occupiers in the State who have been faced with massive insurance premiums to protect themselves against injury claims.  One cannot blame individual farmers therefore if they refuse access to their lands in order to avoid similar heavy claims from potential trespassers.</P>
    <P>The solution is clear as set out in this Bill &mdash; farmers and other land owners must have no liability for any person who comes on to their lands or trespasses for a purpose for which the farmer has no commercial interest.</P>
    <P>With Common Agricultural Policy reform introducing set-aside, it is clear that more and more farmers are going to have to turn to agri-tourism to supplement their incomes.  Agri-tourism by its very nature offers an invitation to people to enter onto farmland, so the inevitable increase in third party liability will occur at a faster rate.</P>
    <P>The farming organisations have been expressing serious concern about this matter for a long time now and, as I understand it, the IFA position is that they require; first, that no duty of care be owed to trespassers; second, that licensees &mdash; invited visitors, picnickers, casual hunters, fishermen etc. in whom the farmer has no economic interest &mdash; be treated as trespassers; and, third, that invitees &mdash; postmen, shopkeepers, etc. &mdash; be afforded a reasonable duty of care, subject to certain conditions.</P>
    <P>The position regarding licensees is of particular interest because a more complex situation arises where the claimant <Col N="310" /> is of a category that farmers have traditionally welcomed and wish to continue to welcome on their lands, such as hunts, shooters, fishermen, tourists, sports bodies, ramblers, walkers, etc.  However, these groups may unintentionally represent a major financial threat in the case of an accident.</P>
    <P>The IFA have expressed the view that this area needs to be clearly defined so as to give a solid basis for the infrastructure of farm business and agri-tourism in the future.  Among the features they list as being required are: first, notices and signs pointing out dangers should include liability even towards children; second, voluntary assumption of risk be accepted in practice and in law by all participants as in English law; third, protection from mischievous legislation from men of straw; the costs of defending such cases can be penal especially in cases where the litigant has small means or is sought after by certain solicitors; and, fourth, duties of care by the occupier should be balanced by duties of responsibilities by the third party.</P>
    <P>The IFA have also highlighted the need for new legislation to cover voluntary assumption of risk, children trespassing and historical buildings specifically excluded from commercial insurance.  There is a need to ensure that there is an onus of self-responsibility on the public in general while ensuring that land owners adequately warn potential trespassers of real dangers.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats believe the time has come for a different balance to be struck between the &ldquo;rights&rdquo; of trespassers and the rights of landowners.  The law, in our view, has parted company with commonsense when landowners are held liable to foreseeable trespassers, whether children or adults.  In our view, a landowner should owe no duty to trespassers, expect the duty not to create intentionally a man-trap.</P>
    <P>For licensees, those entering lands or buildings with permission but not in the economic interest of the owner, the law should merely impose a minimum duty of care, to warn them against known and unusual dangers where such a warning is <Col N="311" /> reasonable.  I urge the Minister and his colleagues to support this Bill when it comes to a vote here tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say at the outset that the law in this area is so unusual and ridiculous that many people simply do not believe it.  It is completely out of balance and cries out for reform.  That is why the Progressive Democrats fully support the Fine Gael initiative and I deplore the intention of the Government parties to vote against it.  It is only commonsense to state that if I enter somebody's land I do so at my own risk and must accept responsibility in the matter. Clearly, that is what the law should state. The existing situation is totally unfair to landowners in general and to farmers in particular.</P>
      <P>As a farmer, I know the sense of outrage and frustration felt by farmers up and down the country because of this totally out of date legal situation.  It is unbelievable in this day and age that if somebody forcibly enters my land I would be liable for any injury he may sustain.  For example, if a trespasser or poacher were to break a leg while trespassing on my land, I would be liable under existing law to compensate them. Could any law be more stupid or unfair than that?</P>
      <P>In certain parts of the country there are particular problems.  For example, there are many national monuments which the general public rightly wish to visit.  In my own constituency an archaeological site, a prehistoric site, is visited by approximately 8,000 people per year, including archaeological students.  It was stated by Professor Kelly to be older than Jerusalem.  Visiting such areas will have to stop because farmers will be forced, or will be requested by their insurance companies, to erect trespass notices.  To deprive the youth of our country and those from overseas from visiting such areas is something I cannot agree with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers who have public liability insurance to cover accidents which may befall members of their own family or people who are legitimately on their <Col N="312" /> lands find that the premiums are increasing all the time.  The same applies to gunclubs and angling clubs; insurance cover for their members is increasing on an annual basis.  Imagine the ironic situation facing a farmer where people may shoot or fish on his lands.  The person legally entitled to be on the land will be covered under the insurance policy of the gunclub, or the angling club, but the poacher will not be covered and is entitled under our existing crazy law to claim off the farmer for any accident he may have there.  The situation has now become so serious that it is also affecting the holding of field days and other events to help raise money for charitable and other purposes.  Quite simply, the public liability insurance costs which the organisers of these events face are so high that they make the running of these events uneconomic.</P>
    <P>For all those reasons the Progressive Democrats have long supported major reform in this area so as to strike a reasonable and fair balance, in effect to have a law whereby people who enter lands accept full responsibility for their actions and are liable to look after any costs they may incur by doing so.  That was the reason we included a specific section in our agricultural policy document prior to last November's general election where we proposed that members of the public entering farmland should accept the consequent liability.  We made clear that we supported legislative reform of the law on occupiers' liability to safeguard farmers and landowners.</P>
    <P>It is easy for people to say &ldquo;We will bring in our own Bill&rdquo;.  This is a straightforward Bill and I congratulate Fine Gael on introducing it.  There are very few ways one can get around it.  I appeal to the Minister to consider accepting this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The casual dismissal of this Bill by the Government is a further example of the creeping arrogance of Fianna Fáil and Labour that has emerged in recent weeks.  It is regrettable that the massive majority on the Government benches will crush this positive initiative <Col N="313" /> undertaken by Fine Gael in response to a very serious defect in the law of occupiers' liability.  The response of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, last week is remarkable only in its similarity to that of his Fianna Fáil predecessors &mdash; let us await the report of the Law Reform Commission.</P>
      <P>The extraordinary sequence of delay in this matter proves beyond doubt that the Government has no commitment to the reform of the law.  This Government stands indicted for, on the one hand, refusing to accept the urgency of law reform in this area while, on the other, kicking the rural community in the teeth by the introduction of an across the board 2 per cent probate tax and preparing to deny the farming community access to Structural Funds, placing the whole concept of headage payments in jeopardy. Landowners, and farmers in particular, were instructed for years by the former Commissioner, Ray MacSharry, and his successive mouthpieces in Agriculture House to curtail farming activities and seek a living off the land outside mainstream agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CAP reform will have the effect of divesting many farmers of sufficient income to command a viable holding. One of the most attractive methods of all farm income is from agri-tourism.  Any farmer permitting the public on to his land under the present legal system is courting disaster.  How can the Government, Ministers McCreevy, Walsh and Hyland opposite, promote rural tourism, call for increased numbers of people to enter private lands for the purposes of visiting monuments, resorts of historical or archaeological significance, or in pursuit of hunting, shooting or fishing activities in the knowledge that the owner of the land has an unduly high burden of responsibility towards such visitors or uninvited guests?  For generations members of the farming community have welcomed the public on to private lands. High insurance premia and a genuine fear of claims is changing that position beyond recognition.  Unless action is taken to change the law our tourist industry will suffer, sporting, leisure and recreational <Col N="314" /> clubs will fail to flourish and expand and the already high level of frustration being experienced throughout the country will give way to helplessness and bitterness, fostering an unhealthy climate of aggravation between urban and rural communitites.</P>
    <P>How many claims against landowners will it take to spur this Government into action?  The Fine Gael Bill eminently promoted by my colleague, Deputy Deenihan, is a perfectly reasonable and sensible response to the fears of the rural community.  The official footdragging in this matter is sharply focused when contrasted with the speedy introduction of a tax amnesty, the 1 per cent levy, or the all round availability of condoms, all of which were agreed and introduced by the Government without delay on the part of Fianna Fáil or Labour.</P>
    <P>By rejecting this Bill tonight the Government is sweeping the matter under the carpet and sending a blunt and dangerous signal to farmers and those in rural areas.  In the dying minutes of this debate I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Hyland, and the senior Ministers, Deputies Taylor and Walsh, to accept this Fine Gael Bill as it stands.  If there are defects&mdash;which I doubt&mdash;they can be thrashed out on Committee Stage. This matter has been festering for a number of years.  Successive Ministers for Agriculture have neglected their duty to take on board the need to change the law in this regard.  How long more are members of rural communities and land occupiers going to suffer this matter without an adequate Government response?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfair that farmers must lie awake at night worrying about being sold out of home and farm because of accidents that may occur on their land.  It is daft that trespassers who come on to other people's property can haul such property owners into court if they hurt themselves while tresspassing. It is crazy that a country which prides itself as a leading tourist destination will not change its laws so that free access can be gained to scenic and other areas without exposing the landowners to huge <Col N="315" /> risks.  They are the basic principles on which Fine Gael proposed this Bill.</P>
      <P>Our law on occupiers' liability is an ass and this did not happen overnight.  Court decisions over a number of years have highlighted the problem.  The people in the front line &mdash; the landowner and the farmer &mdash; are crying out for a solution and yet again the Government is paralysed into inaction and, worse still, is prepared to shoot down with its massive majority an attempt by Fine Gael to resolve the problem.  My colleague, Deputy Deenihan, has proposed a reasonable solution to this problem and this Government merely gives us sympathy and excuses but no action.</P>
      <P>It is an indictment of our democratic and legislative process that every Member of this House can agree on the need for change in our law and yet a Bill proposing such change can be voted down without any alternative being put in its place.  What in the name of goodness is this House for?  What are we elected for?  We are elected to legislate and the Government should not give us the excuse of waiting for a Law Reform Commission report.  Talk about &ldquo;Waiting for Godot&rdquo;, the Law Reform Commission is overloaded with work.  It covers everything from murder and rape cases on the cirminal law side to the procedures for debt collection on the civil law side.  The need for change is evident.  We do not need the Law Reform Commission to tell us of the need for change.  The Government is using the Law Reform Commission solely as an excuse because it has not the will, the wit or the initiative to come up with a counter proposal nor has it the sense of fair play to accept Deputy Deenihan's Bill and, if necessary, amend it on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, with the continuing delay proposed by this Government, farmers will remain at risk.  Not unnaturally, many of them will bar access to the coastline and other scenic areas.  I do not want to see that happening as I come from a tourist area.  I want to see tourism develop.  It hurts me to see tourists or locals refused access to our coastline or <Col N="316" /> scenic areas, but it is understandable that if a farmer believes he is exposed to risk he will refuse people access to his lands. I have had experience of this in a number of instances in my constituency &mdash; if Deputy Deenihan will forgive me &mdash; the leading tourist spot in the country.  Apart from our coastline, we have many historical monuments, castles and archaeological sites access to which in many instances is doubtful.</P>

      <P>The tourist season is just getting into full swing and the Government refuses to take a totally cost free step, a step which would not involve a cost to the Exchequer.  It would be a major boost for tourism if the Government was prepared to take this step.</P>
      <P>By refusing to accept the Second Stage of this Bill and working out any necessary amendments on Committee Stage, effectively, the Government is condemning our farmers to a further period of uncertainty. In a booklet entitled &ldquo;The Farmer and the Law&rdquo;, published by the IFA in 1990, the position of farmers was summed up in the words of Séamus Heaney in &ldquo;The King of the Ditchbacks&rdquo; as follows:</P>
      <P>As if a trespasser unbolted a forgotten gate and ripped the growth tangling its lower bars.</P>
      <P>I am haunted by this stealthy rustling the unexpected spoor the pollen settling.</P>
      <P>Our farmers will continue to be haunted by this fear unless and until the Government is prepared to substitute action for words and unless and until this Government is prepared to follow the example of Fine Gael in putting a Bill on occupier liability before this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It can easily be said by Government speakers that the answer for farmers is <Col N="317" /> to take out insurance, but people have problems in paying insurance premiums which are high because of the high level of claims.  A farmer on whose land is an archaeological site to which access is over stony territory, or an ancient castle that is crumbling, will be greatly concerned at the possibility of a claim against him; and there have been such claims.  In many instances farmers in such circumstances cannot get insurance.  A constituent of mine told me that his premium for public liability insurance had increased by 300 per cent in the last couple of years and he just could not afford the increased premium.  Asking farmers to take out insurance is not the answer to the problem. It may be possible in some instances, but some risks will not now be covered by the insurance companies.  In other instances farmers cannot afford to pay the premium.</P>
    <P>Another aspect that has not been touched on to any great degree in this debate is the fact that it is not just farmers who are at risk, but every householder.  Every person who owns anything is at risk.  If somebody comes into one's garden in the town or the city and happens to hurt themselves then the question of occupier liability also arises.  Although the focus is on farms, which is natural because of the kind of terrain one can meet with on farms such as Deputy Sheehan and I have down in our constituency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>As long as Deputy Sheehan and I do not get too congested we will be all right.  I want to emphasise that the ordinary householder is also at risk when people come into his or her house or garden.  Accidents happen and in certain circumstances the householder could be exposed to claims.  I am a bit rusty on the law now, but I recall some years ago a case where a burglar breaking into a house suffered injury and had the audacity to bring a claim in court that a trap had been set for him in the house. How long are we going to allow this question of litigation, of not being prepared, <Col N="318" /> to continue without dealing with these ridiculous situations that can arise and have arisen and certainly will arise in the future unless we take steps to prevent it?</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Deenihan, has produced a very sensible Bill.  He is not a lawyer, but he has taken this issue by the scruff of its neck and proposed a reasonable solution.  He has openly said that he is prepared to listen to reasonable amendments on Committee Stage.  How much more reasonable can Deputy Deenihan and the Fine Gael Party be? People on all sides of this House will compliment Deputy Deenihan, but the best compliment that could be paid to Deputy Deenihan is to ensure that this Bill goes through its Second Reading tonight and then we can give an answer to those people throughout this country who are worrying about the continuing problem of occupier liability.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As a young man I used to go off hunting every Saturday morning with a couple of dogs trying to catch a rabbit or a fox.  I was never greatly successful but I got some exercise and was welcomed by the farmers and my enjoyment of rural living was tremendous in those years.  As a landowner today I extend the hand of friendship to anyone who wants to cross my land, to anyone who wants to hunt on my land, to anyone who wants to shoot on my land.  Until recently the problem of claims did not arise.  I am sorry Deputies <Col N="319" /> Flanagan and O'Keeffe are leaving because I want to say something about them.</P>

      <P>This problem did not arise until the legal profession started touting for business and advertising in newspapers and on radio that if people have an accident they should go to see their solicitor and that they will make money and take the landowner to the cleaners.</P>
      <P>I am sad to think that this is also the case in schools today.  If I broke my arm at school or on the football pitch it was an accident, a fact of life and part of growing up.  It was part of the risk one took.  Unfortunately today the barrack room lawyers in the pubs and communities will tell people to sue, that farmers, schools etc., have insurance.  Not once did I hear Members of the Opposition, from Fine Gael or the Progressive Democrats, mention the legal profession as being to blame because of their public touting for business.  I know that remarks about the Judiciary are not welcome in this House, but the decisions of some of the judges leave a lot to be desired.  It is ridiculous that last week a dog was awarded £4,000 because he had suffered trauma after a car accident.  The hypocrisy of the outburst against the proposed tax amnesty last week is exceeded only by the hypocrisy of those in our society who go around looking for reasons to claim.  The legal profession top even that hypocrisy by touting for business.  On my way out here I saw on the South Circular Road an advertisement telling people that, if they had an accident, the solicitor's office was across the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many responsible bodies who use land at the moment, including the gun clubs, have their own insurance.  My understanding had been that no claim could ever be made against a landowner unless a plough or some other item of machinery had been left across a pathway.  Thankfully, many claims have failed in court; but the fact that these claims are being <Col N="320" /> brought means that we will have to ban people from entering our land if this threat continues.  I admire Deputy Deenihan for bringing forward this Bill, but I am worried that the people dealing with this, the Law Reform Commission, are the people who will make recommendations to the Government; and the commission is made up of solicitors and barristers, the £2,500 a day men.  Naturally it is in their interests to insist that there may be a legal problem if, when crossing somebody's land, you put your foot in a rabbit hole and break your ankle.</P>
    <P>As a person involved in the equestrian area, my understanding was that anybody who got up on a horse for their own enjoyment did so at their own risk and if they fell it was part of the action, part of the excitement associated with the sport. If somebody breaks an arm or leg while playing on a GAA field the attitude is to sue the club for damages.  The club is made up of ordinary people within the community who have to pay extremely high insurance costs.  I do not blame the insurance companies for charging high premiums because the payment of damages in respect of public liability is much greater than the amount collected by way of premiums.  However, I blame the legal profession who have mounted a campaign to bring claims in respect of public liability to court.  It was unheard of if one injured oneself on a rural farm to sue the owner for damages.  There is a mentality whereby people who have accidents automatically consider they are entitled to compensation, regardless of negligence on their part.  Deputy O'Keeffe said that if a burglar slipped on a loose roof tile and broke an ankle while trying to gain entry to a house, even though the burglar intended a grave injustice to the house owner and family the onus for damages rests with the owner.  From that viewpoint I was delighted recently to read that a number of judges here throwing out claims against publicans, where a person slipped on a wet floor in a public house, on the basis that the person had consumed too much alcohol.</P>
    <P>It is time for corrective action in regard <Col N="321" /> to the legal profession.  Legal fees make up 25 per cent of court costs and that is why insurance companies wish to settle cases out of court.  In court cases the solicitor and barrister take their share of the costs.  There is a famous saying in my area.  A man while working on a site fell into a hole in Aughinish, County Limerick.  He received an award from the court, he later received his solicitor's fee and said to him: &ldquo;Who fell into the hole, you or me?&rdquo;.  That is part of the legal scene at present.  The costs involved include the payment of the solicitor's fee on the defence side and the money for the solicitor is on a &ldquo;no foal no fee&rdquo; basis. There is no cost to the plaintiff.  Plaintiffs who approach their solicitors may be encouraged to take cases to court as they will be guaranteed they will not incur any costs.  The attitude has developed to take the individual or the insurance company to court and make everybody pay.  We are becoming a dishonest nation in regard to claims.  Illegal claims resulting from damage through negligence are being made.  I will continue to open my lands to anyone who wishes to cross them for pleasure, hunting and shooting, etc., although I have been advised not to by the insurance company because of the criminal claims made against farmers in the area.  It is sad that this practice should continue.  I am sorry that our island, a nation of people who enjoy all types of sport and access to all areas should be restricted in this way.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will introduce legislation in this area when the Law Reform Commission makes its recommendations. However, I am suspicious of the Law Reform Commission and TDs because they have a vested interest in this area.  We should have a simple law such as that proposed by Deputy Deenihan stipulating that one has no right to make a claim if one enters someone's land, back garden, or house voluntarily.  The risk of public liability damages will prevent farmers being friendly towards people wishing to gain access to their lands.  I lay the blame for this on the legal profession and judges who have made very strange decisions.  It is not possible <Col N="322" /> to trust people proposing law reform &mdash; when they have a vested interest in the outcome.  Perhaps a group of ordinary citizens should propose reform in this area.  I hope the Government will ensure that the illegal, unjustified and immoral claims against people who allow others access to their lands will cease.</P>

      <P>The Minister also said that when he received the report from the Law Reform Commission if it was in line with the Bill proposed in Private Members' Time by Deputy Deenihan he would be prepared to take this Bill on board, amend it and proceed accordingly. Because this Bill like many others, was mentioned in the Programme for Government it is open to the Opposition at any time to address the issue and to introduce a Bill which may meet our <Col N="323" /> requirements.  We would like Bills introduced by way of Private Members' Business to be adequate.  The Minister has suggested that instead of putting this Bill to a vote as Fine Gael wish, it would be better to adjourn the debate on it at the appropriate time and reactivate it if it meets the requirements of the Law Reform Commission.  Perhaps that is the right way to proceed.  I do not have any disagreement with the need for reform in the law in this area.</P>
      <P>We have had discussion with many people in our constituencies, members of the farming organisations and the National Association of Game Councils, a responsible body with over 22,000 members throughout the country, who are concerned about the present position which has arisen as a result of landowners' predicaments.  There is uncertainty in this area as a result of recent court decisions.  It is important for the Government to bring forward legislation as soon as possible to clarify the rights and duties of landowners and occupiers in respect of injuries to people who use their land.  Not all land users can read warning signs or are aware of dangers. As the House is aware there is a commitment to reform the law in respect of occupiers' liability.  While I share the concern expressed by occupiers, much of this legislation needs clarification.  I am surprised the Opposition wish to vote on this Bill as it will be defeated.</P>

      <P>I do not like people preaching to me, especially when they had an opportunity to address this problem but did not.  Let us consider the publication of this Bill if that is the wish of Fine Gael. Let us consider the report put forward. Deputy Ahearn is probably consulted by the same group of people in South Tipperary as I am.  All of these people are aware of the problem.  They know also that a simple Bill such as this does not really address the issue.  How could it if the Minister who has the responsibility for bringing the legislation forward is required to go to the Law Reform Commission irrespective of the vested interests which Deputy Davern says that body has.  At least it has a competence in the area of private property of the rights to private property and the rights of other people to use land for recreational and sporting purposes etc.  What is involved here is a wide area.  It is not simply confined to farm land.  What it means is that the greater the benefit accruing to the occupier of land from the person who comes on to the land, the greater is the liability of the occupier.  That is the present position.  It applies to people who enter land which is categorised under various headings such as the contractual entrant, namely, a person who enters land under a term of contract between himself or herself and the occupier or an invitee, a person whose visit to the land confers a benefit for the occupier, or a licensee who is permitted also on the land but how, during his or her visit, does not benefit the occupier.  Finally, there is what has been identified as the trespasser. Who are trespassers?  Are they children?  Do Fine Gael consider that every child of school going age or younger is able to read warning signs about danger on land?</P>
      <P>My understanding, following consultations with representations from the farming organisations and the National Association of the Game Council, is that they are extremely concerned about this matter.</P>

      <P>Molaim an Teachta Deenihan as ucht an Bill seo a chur faoin ár mbráid.  Tar éis go mbeadh lochtanna agam air, tá an-áthas orm go bhfuil an t-ábhar á phlé agus go bhfuil sé tugtha os comhair an phobail, mar is le ró-fhada go bhfuil ceist an árachais i gcoitinne sa tír seo fágtha ar leataobh.</P>
      <P>I welcome this debate, and I am sure all Members of this House feel it is about time we grasped the nettle of the whole insurance problem.  I had hoped that the broader spectrum of the problem relating to insurance here would be tackled once and for all.</P>
      <P>As a Member of Seanad Éireann I tried many times to raise this issue, not to have it dealt with in a piecemeal manner but in the form of a total review of the present position.  We are now pricing ourselves into a position whereby it is vital to have reform in respect of employers' liability, of the liability of those running shows, football clubs and playgrounds, of householders' liability, general public liability and occupiers' liability.  This also extends to the area of car insurance.</P>
      <P>We had a debate in the Seanad on insurance in which both sides of the argument were put forward.  We addressed the question of the right of a person on the one hand to genuine compensation in cases where the fault lies with the owner-occupier employer, etc and, on the other hand, the need to provide cover at a reasonable cost for those people who make their premises available, who provide employment and who give their time voluntarily to football clubs, etc. was addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="327" /> In order to tackle this problem we must first reform the law in this area.  Many of Deputy Davern's comments ring true with me.  A compensation culture has been created whereby if someone gets hurt in an accident they automatically assume they are entitled to compensation. If one were to do a vox pop one would probably find a general belief that proof of negligence was not required in compensation claims cases.  Most people do not understand that one must prove negligence in such cases, at least in theory.</P>
    <P>If we fail to address this problem now the protection available to the public may not be available in the future.  We must ensure that those who genuinely suffer injury due to the negligence of another person are protected also.  This is where the problems arise.  No Member of this House would disagree that an award should be made in court in respect of a child who had fallen from a playground barrier at night and sustains injury.  I have always believed that concept of not having to prove negligence, as understood by the ordinary person, is a nonsense.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether the fault lies with the law or with the interpretation of the law.  When we change the law we change also the culture that goes with that law. People should be encouraged to take out personal accident policies to cover themselves against risk of injury while those charged with the responsibility of applying the law should take note of the changes in culture that follow changes in the law.</P>
    <P>Comprehensive reform in this area is required, I would like to see this reform span all aspects of insurance because the amount of money paid out by way of insurance costs is astronomical.  The amount of &ldquo;dead&rdquo; money that every person in business must carry due to insurance costs is huge.  When I was engaged in the saw-milling industry the difference between insuring the same <Col N="328" /> liability here compared with Northern Ireland would have been of the order of £12,000 to £15,000 per year.  That aspect must be addressed also because it involved a competitiveness and the problem arose where one jurisdiction was providing to be more hospitable towards employment than the other.  When we address this problem we must do so thoroughly.</P>
    <P>Ag an am céanna níor mhaith liom go bhfágfaí an t-ábhar seo ar an méar fhada agus go mbeimis ag teacht arais arís i gceann trí bliana nó níos luaithe agus gan réiteach ar an bhfadhb.

Caithfear na pointí seo ar fad a scrúdú.</P>
    <P>Arís, molaim an Teachta Deenihan as ucht an t-ábhar a thabhairt ar aghaidh. Creidim go bhfuil obair mhaith déanta aige le cur leis an díospóireacht seo ar chúrsaí árachais.</P>
    <P>This debate is very worthwhile. However, it would be peculiar for any Government, having asked the Law Reform Commission to provide a report, to proceed with a change in the law in one area while not dealing with other areas.  The matter should be dealt with in a thorough, comprehensive way when the report becomes available &mdash; I hope it will be published soon.  The Minister should ensure that there is a deadline not only on dealing with the matter of occupiers' liability but on the question of liability insurance in general so that there will be a reasonable balance.  The pendulum should not be swung too far to the other side, with people who genuinely suffer an injury due to the negligence of an occupier or employer being unfairly <Col N="329" /> treated.  That would require us to come back here in a year's time to change the law again.  We all want to ensure that reasonable insurance is available and compensation paid.  The concept of liability and negligence should be more clearly defined and the persons making the claim should be clearer as to their responsibility.  This matter should be dealt with in a thorough manner so that at the end of the day this huge problem is resolved.</P>
    <P>In the 1987 election, the first one in which I took part, on the doorsteps I said this was an issue that would have to be tackled by whatever Government came to power because it affected everybody directly or indirectly.  Comprehensive consideration should be given to the matter, a time limit should be set and liability insurance legislation should be enacted in the near future.  It would be more acceptable to deal with the matter comprehensively rather than piecemeal as proposed here.  However, that is not to say that the sentiments, ideas and concepts promoted here are not very worthwhile.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important Bill and I compliment Deputy Deenihan on introducing it.  The Minister should take on board what has been said by Members on both sides of the House.  A serious problem exists and I hope, following the contributions here, the Minister realises the real concern in rural Ireland in regard to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate has been broadened, with contributions about public liability and so on, but we are talking here about landowners' liability.  The Minister will be aware that for generations goodwill existed and the countryside was open to visitors from towns and cities.  Farmers never asked questions as to where people were going but were always helpful in <Col N="330" /> pointing the way to good fishing spots. Goodwill existed in regard to fishing, game shooting and hunting and farmers enjoyed meeting people.  Unfortunately, that practice has changed because of the growing trend of people who are injured seeking compensation.  I do not always see eye to eye with Deputy Davern but I take on board much of what he said.  We must move with the times and protect the people who have shown goodwill in abundance.  No Member can say that landowners should be held liable for people who are of no benefit to them and to whom they offer their facilities.  That people are prepared to abuse that privilege is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Requests have been made by Deputy Ferris and the Minister to postpone the vote on this Bill and await the report of the Law Reform Commission.  I have no doubt the Minister means well but I take what he said with a grain of salt.  When I was elected to this House in March 1987 I asked the then Minister for Justice a question as to landowners' liability arising from a judgment against a small farmer in my constituency.  At the time the Minister appreciated the position.  He told me in October 1987 he was referring the matter to the Law Reform Commission and said he would ask them to report forthwith &mdash; the Minister broadened the matter to include business and other liability under this complex law.</P>
    <P>Since 1987 nothing has been done. Surely it does not take six years for legal eagles to investigate the matter and suggest a law to remove liability from landowners? I cannot accept that position, nor will farmers.  If the position was reversed it would not take six years to deal with the farmer.  How serious is the Law Reform Commission about reporting on this serious problem?</P>

      <P>Six years ago the tourist industry was not too well developed but today it is now a major industry.  My constituency is visited by many people on fishing holidays.  Lands must be crossed to gain access to lakes and rivers but, unfortunately landowners are now liable for injuries to people who cross their land uninvited.  City and urban dwellers should not think they are not welcome in the countryside but they should understand the position.  Successful cases have been taken against farmers.  In one case a man who was game shooting with his friend was accidently shot in the heel when his friend tripped with a loaded gun.  The man's friend did not have the money to compensate him and he sued the farmer.  The farmer was found negligent and the judge reprimanded him for being careless and not keeping his fences in proper condition.</P>
      <P>That was an outrageous decision as the farmer did not invite these people onto his land.  I am sure he was not expected to take them by the hand and show them where to go.  People visiting the country must accept the pitfalls involved.  In the case I mentioned £75,000 was awarded. That case was before the courts about seven or eight years ago.  I have no doubt that the person involved was severely injured but the farmer should not have been required to compensate him.  That is the nub of the problem.  I hope this incident will bring home to the Minister the extent of the problem.  If it is not dealt with immediately rural Ireland will be closed off because people want to protect themselves and their families. This is a very serious matter.  It goes further than the protection of the farmer. It also relates to the development of tourism, which is a major industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know there are complex issues in <Col N="332" /> communities.  Trustees have to be appointed when the communities wish to develop a play area for the children. People are reluctant to become trustees because they can now be sued.  A lawyer told me that if he wanted to sue a trustee he would single out the person with the most property and let his friends rally round him.  When a person is in trouble the friends soon leave.  I appeal to the Minister to take this Bill on board in order to clear the farmer of liability.  If the Minister does that he will be doing great good not only for the landowners but for tourism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this Private Members Motion and I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, for taking the initiative of bringing this Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform indicated to the House last week that he and the Government would not support this Bill. The Minister acknowledged the need for reform in this area &mdash; but alas, he is not ready for it just yet.  The Minister in his speech said:</P>
      <P>There is consensus on the need for change in this area and representatives of the farming community, in particular, have been seeking such change ......... the Government is not, therefore, in a position to give its support to this Bill at the present time.</P>
      <P>Their failure to respond to the need to protect the rights of landowners is another sign of this Government's weakness. The Minister further stated last week:</P>
      <P>...... The occupier is now regarded as owing a duty to trespassers</P>
      <P>and, he further stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inevitably, this uncertainty has caused landowners, farmers in particular, to fear that they may become the focus for a substantial damages claim, not only in relation to trespassers, <Col N="333" /> but also in relation to other categories of entrants.</P>
    <P>The farming organisations also recognise the need for reform.  Alan Gillis has said:</P>
    <P>Occupiers liability must be put in the fast-track to legislative reform if the danger of high losses in tourism revenue and disruption to visitors, is to be averted.</P>
    <P>Mr. Donal Murphy of the ICMSA has said:</P>
    <P>Our position is that we want the legislation to exempt farmers, and indeed, all property owners, from any liability, or any duty of care to any person on their land, of other property, without the owners permission.</P>
    <P>The National Association of Regional Game Councils, with approximately 22,000 members, also calls for a change in the law.  Not only do these people enjoy their sport through the goodwill of the farming community, but they also provide a valuable service in relation to vermin control.</P>
    <P>By rejecting this Bill the Government are flying directly in the face of the requests for law reform in this area from the organisations referred to.  Because of this Government decision farmers will continue to prevent access to their lands, access to national monuments, access to observe our shy wild mammals in various parts of the country and access to walkways and pathways that have the potential to attract much-needed tourism revenue.  Who can blame a landowner for such a decision when, the consequences of an accident on the land can pave the way for compensation claims from even trespassers, claims that could put these landowners out of business.  Surely this law needs to be amended quickly.  The opportunity is before the House tonight. As the Minister, Deputy Mervyn Taylor, said, the Law Reform Commission is to report within a month.  Why not accept this Bill and amend it as necessary on <Col N="334" /> Committee Stage and get on with the business of providing the necessary framework to protect landowners throughout the country?</P>

      <P>Interestingly, this Bill has not been considered in the light of Leader projects. The emphasis on Leader projects is in rural Ireland.  We support those projects. In my constituency we have a very successful project.  On 2 June I received a letter from that project, as I am sure did other Deputies in the area, in relation to the law on liability of owners and occupiers of land and the difficulties it was creating for them.  Much is being said about the impact of this law on tourism. A particular problem relates to equestrian activities and the use of woods owned by Coillte.  This vexatious issue of occupiers liability spans a wide area and should be addressed.  There is a commitment to expand Leader projects over the next few years and to facilitate that expansion I would like this Bill to be accepted.</P>
      <P>Many people have referred to the simplicity of the Bill and spoken about the coming report from the Law Reform Commission.  It is amazing that this Bill, which seeks to address the pertinent problems in relation to occupiers liability, is not accepted.  Surely amendments could be added afterwards to enhance the Bill.  The acceptance of this Bill would encourage the development of sporting activities in the tourism area and I endorse what many speakers have said about this.</P>

      <Col N="335" /> In modern times the Irish farm can be a dangerous place.  We can appreciate the concerns of farmers in relation to people who would use their land without permission. The hazardous nature of many of our farms is due to modern plant and machinery.  In many cases farmers may have to leave gates loose on hinges because the stone wall might not be as effective as it should be.  All these things create potential hazards.</P>
    <P>When I was growing up I looked with a certain amount of trepidation on signs saying &ldquo;Trespassers will be prosecuted&rdquo;. Those signs were usually confined to the lands of the gentry and one stayed out of those areas.  In recent times those type of signs are re-emerging because society has grown litigation conscious.</P>
    <P>I was perturbed at the tone of Deputy Davern's speech.  It was an attempt to target the legal profession and tarnish them with the blame for all the ills in society in relation to this vexatious problem of occupiers liability.  I am sure the Minister, who is a member of the legal profession, would not endorse the sentiments of Deputy Davern.</P>

This is a <Col N="336" /> Government that has spoken about transparency, about blowing away the cobwebs, letting in the light and so on.  Yet when something imaginative is introduced it is blown out.</P>

      <P>The protection of the occupiers of land and property is of paramount importance.  If tourism is to prosper and play its part in this country, as we are told it will over the next decade, surely priority must be given to access to our beaches and other tourist facilities, generally ensuring that no responsibility will be laid on the shoulders of the owners of such property or land.  If activity holidays and the development of recreational facilities, such as beaches, picnic places, forestry walks and even playgrounds, are to be promoted here, this Bill must be accepted by the Minister and his Government this evening.</P>
      <P>I am most disappointed that the Minister and Government are adopting delaying tactics, playing politics with such an urgently needed Bill, particularly since the issue involved has been a bone of contention for decades past.  Yet no Government has had the courage to face up to its responsibilities in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ferris in his contribution advocated <Col N="337" /> postponement of this legislation until the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission has been announced.  I should like to ask Deputy Ferris whether he is so naive as to think it is beyond the bounds of capability of this House to pass legislation which will put an end once and for all to this anomaly and injustice?  If the Minister considers the Bill is not sufficiently comprehensive, which I doubt, what is to prevent him tabling amendments on Committee Stage to safeguard against any loopholes discovered?</P>
    <P>It is clear that the postponement of this Bill will have a number of adverse effects. First, the potential liability constitutes an unfair burden on the farming community and on property owners in general.  In addition, it will hamper the creation of employment through the development of activity holidays and traditional access to recreational facilities such as forest walks, playgrounds and so on.  All of this will be placed at risk.  The importance of an immediate change in the law is clear to everybody in this House and country this evening.</P>
    <P>In his contribution last week the Minister said that the issue was what form such change should take so that the right balance could be struck between the interests of the occupiers of land and those of other persons who enter such land.  Surely it is clear that the owner of any property should not be liable for any damage done by uninvited guests who trespass on that property or enter thereon?  Speaking of previous court decisions, the Minister had this to say:</P>
    <P>The bulk of those decisions have dealt with the position of trespasser and, for the present at least, may suggest that trespassers could be entitled to a higher duty of care than other more lawful entrants onto land.</P>
    <P>Surely that spells out a demand for immediate action.</P>
    <P>Responsible bodies, such as the IFA, the ICMSA, and regional game councils <Col N="338" /> nationwide, have been clamouring for this legislation.  Yet for some unknown reason the Minister and his Government are not accepting this Bill, the provisions to which would safeguard the interests of all concerned.  That begs the question: is it petty party politics the Minister is playing here this evening, or does he want to look after the interests of people who are scourged by this problem in rural areas today?</P>
    <P>The time is long overdue to allow commonsense prevail.  I know the Minister is man enough, big enough and has sufficient heart to accept this worthy Bill here this evening.  I warn him that if he does not do so he will be doing a serious injustice, not alone to himself and his Government but to the country at large.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank all Members who contributed to this debate over the past two weeks and compliment them on the quality of their contributions. It was a very lively debate, especially this evening.  I should like to thank the Progressive Democrats, Democratic Left, The Green Party and Independents for supporting this Bill and, indeed, speakers from the Government side of the House.  I would never have thought I would have thanked a Deputy de Valera in my lifetime, but I must say I appreciated Deputy Síle de Valera's contribution, which was very positive, just as was that of Deputy Ó Cuív.  However, I must say I was disappointed with Deputy Ferris's contribution here this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have expected more of Deputy Ferris.  The provisions of this Bill are concerned with the position and rights of landowners and with the obligations and penalties being imposed on them.  I set out the position clearly in my introductory remarks last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his contribution <Col N="339" /> referred to other aspects of this problem, such as injuries occuring on vessels, vehicles or aircraft.  I should say I did not set out to resolve those problems.  I was concerned about the problems arising for landowners in regard to their obligations to people who enter their lands.</P>
    <P>Criticism of this Bill on the grounds that it is not sufficiently comprehensive or does not cover those other aspects is totally unfounded.  There is here a problem we can grasp, which we can resolve, in the manner set out by the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Apart from some reservations expressed by the Minister present and by the Minister of State, this Bill has received widespread support from all sides of the House.  Members have been very strong in their support for change along the lines suggested in this Bill.  I am convinced that if allowed a free vote this House would vote overwhelmingly in favour of this Bill this evening.  The Minister for Justice, together with the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, must take responsibility for this shortsighted decision to reject my proposal.</P>
    <P>This Bill has received widespread support outside this House from the main farming organisations, the IFA, the ICMSA, the Association for Adventure Sports, the National Association of Games Councils and so on.  This is the approach they want adopted.  Why not accept it?</P>
    <P>In his criticism of the Bill the Minister stated that no exception is made for children. Children have been involved in a number of celebrated decisions in which the courts have held that a duty of care owed to all entrants, including trespassers, is akin to the general duty in the law of negligence, that is, the duty to take reasonable care.  The cases which gave <Col N="340" /> rise to these decisions were tragic and involved children who wandered into electricity sub-stations or onto railway tracks and received severe injuries. While one could not quarrel with the decisions in certain cases the problem is that the principles laid down in these cases applied far beyond the circumstances of a seriously injured child. As a result a trespasser, arguably, is in as strong a legal position as the person lawfully on land.</P>
    <P>Concern for children is the first reason given by the Minister for not supporting the Bill and his second is to be found in the reference to the Law Reform Commission. He asked us to wait until the process has been finalised.  However, this could take a long time.  In the near future a consultation paper will be published on which the commission will invite comments. Those comments will be considered before the final report is published.  If the Government decides to act on this report a Bill would have to be drafted.  This process could take up to three years to complete.  In the case of the consultation paper dealing with the law on defamation more than one year passed between the time the paper was published and the report was presented. That report is now almost one year old; yet nothing has been done.  I am convinced that it would be better therefore for the House to accept this Bill to meet an immediate need and, if necessary, to amend it in the light of the proposals of the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>The law on occupiers' liability is yet another monument to inactivity on the part of this House.  I appeal to the Minister to accept this simple, yet comprehensive Bill which has been designed to take the terror out of this question.</P>

      <P>We are given to understand that the Government will shortly submit to the European Community authorities in Brussels its proposals for the use of EC Structural and Cohesion Funds, for the next phase of EC action in this area.  According to Government sources, the proposals will concern £8 billion of European Community money, £4 billion of national funds &mdash; apparently there is some doubt about the £8 billion of European Community money and the £4 billion of national funds will, of course, come either from the taxpayer or will be borrowed &mdash; and as yet unquantified amount of private capital over the period of this action.</P>
      <P>Despite the size of these amounts and the fact that that programme will commit a very large proportion of our public capital programme for the period in question, it seems that the Government wants to avoid any parliamentary or public debate as to how we go about making these decisions, the strategies we should adopt and the programmes we should follow.  It gives the lie to the Government's contention that it believes in open Government because the Government does not intend to tell us anything about how it will spend this money before it engages in a programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as we know the only systematic <Col N="344" /> attempt made at the preparation of a coherent new programme took the form of a study carried out by the ESRI.  So far as we know &mdash; we are dealing with rumours on this matter &mdash; this study covered the 1989-93 programmes and the consultants' reports which were prepared on those programmes and on the multitude of individual projects which they comprehended.  Any such study could only be incomplete since it would obviously be far too early at this stage to have any kind of a proper assessment carried out on the later funded projects. Rumour has it that some serious and rather arbitrary restrictions were placed by the Government on the ESRI in the way it carried out that study.  Whatever the truth of that may be, so far as I know the ESRI study is the only basis that exists for drawing any lessons from the 1989-93 programme and therefore for designing the next phase of the action. It seems however that the Government wants to keep it under wraps.  We must ask why?  Whom does the Government distrust?  Is it the ESRI, the public service, this House or the general public? Or is it perhaps, more accurately, that the Government has very little confidence in itself and this makes it very reluctant to bring this issue forward?</P>
    <P>Parts of that report have been leaked; it must be one of the most open secrets in public administration today.  Significantly, the parts of the report that have been leaked have to do with proposals to remove moneys from the agricultural side in order to apply them elsewhere.  If the leaks are accurate, both the ESRI and the Government have the wrong end of the stick in relation to agricultural payments and the headage payments in particular.  The proposal seems to be to criticise headage payments because they are an income support measure.  That is not a criticism.  They are an income support measure and that is what they were intended to be from the very first day in 1977.  The danger I see is that there is no automatic guarantee, <Col N="345" /> should the Irish Government by its own decision remove funds from the headage payment side, that those funds will automatically be available for another use. Those funds are earmarked&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Col N="346" /> As part of the work on preparing the National Development Plan, which will set out the Government's proposals for the use of EC Structural and Cohesion Funds in the period 1994-99, it was considered desirable to obtain an independent external view of the operation of the existing Community Support Framework for Structural Funds and on the strategy that might underpin the National Development Plan.  Accordingly the Department of Finance decided to engage consultants to undertake an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Community Support Framework 1989-93 in contributing to Ireland's economic development and to make recommendations on: the strategy that should underpin the next National Development Plan; following from that strategy, the optimal mix of national programmes and measures to implement the strategy; and practical ways of providing for greater integration and complementarity of measures within programmes.</P>
    <P>A number of firms and bodies were invited to put forward proposals to undertake the assignment.  After a selection procedure, the Economic and Social Research Institute in conjunction with DKM Economic Consultants, G. Boyle, Centre for Agriculture and Food Policy Research, Maynooth College and Brendan Kearney and Associates were engaged in October 1992.  This consultancy assignment has been completed recently and I am arranging to have a detailed summary made available publicly to facilitate the widespread debate on the preparation of the plan.  Of course the ESRI study is but one input into the Government's preparation of the plan. Considerable work has been undertaken to date, both in Government Departments and State agencies and by the many other groups and organisations with an interest in this area.</P>
    <P>In May 1992 I invited the seven sub-regional review committees, set up to review implementation of the Structural Funds, to make submissions containing <Col N="347" /> their views on the content and strategy of the next plan, the Community support framework and operational programmes in so far as they would affect each subregion. These submissions have all been received.  Each sub-regional review committee's submission takes into account a wide range of proposals from local authority, agriculture, trade union, community development and business sector interests at local and regional level.</P>
    <P>The social partner organisations represented on the Central Review Committee &mdash; that is, ICTU, IBEC, IFA, ICMSA, ICOS and CIF &mdash; as well as the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland and the Council for the Status of Women were also invited to make submissions on the content and strategy of the plan.</P>
    <P>A large number of other groups and individuals have made submissions to me, to the various Ministers with sectoral responsibilities relating to the plan, to the Department of Finance or to other relevant Departments.  The different views outlined in these submissions and in the various seminars and conferences held nationally on the topic are an important input into the whole planning process.  The various Government Departments have drawn up detailed proposals in relation to programmes and measures with which they deal.</P>
    <P>Dialogue with the EC Commission provides another input.  A further aspect of plan preparation, but far from the least important, is the potential of the plan to assist cross-Border co-operation and there have been discussions with the Northern Ireland authorities about this aspect.</P>
    <P>When discussing the ESRI report it is appropriate to recognise the limitations there are in developing an objective scientific approach to this complex area. Generally, criteria for assessing the relative worth of projects can be established in a sector or programme area.  The difficulties involved in doing so vary from sector to sector.  It becomes much more difficult to assess the relative merits of <Col N="348" /> projects across sectors &mdash; for example, to compare the return from a roads project with an industrial investment or a training scheme.  Similarly, it can be difficult to assess the relative return from a certain level of investment in a variety of sectors. Furthermore, the determining of priorities for a development plan involves important policy considerations that can go beyond the purely quantifiable.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, it will be a matter for the Government to decide on its priorities for the plan, taking account of all the inputs made &mdash; in this instance there were approximately 100 of the evaluations and quantifications carried out and all the other policy considerations arising. However, in making the difficult decisions involved, the consultancy study is one valuable input and I hope in making it publicly available that it will also be a useful input into public debate on the plan.</P>
    <P>The Government envisages that the Dáil will have an opportunity to have a full discussion on the plan and this will allow for an exchange of views on all aspects including the consultants' recommendations.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Whips that it has been agreed that the House will debate the plan on Thursday week.  I hope to have the summary, which is a very long and detailed summary, circulated before or just after the weekend. I will do this as quickly as possible.  This is just one of a huge number of documents that have been submitted to Government by different groups. However, we commissioned it.  It was one of the documents we considered before finalising the national plan.</P>

      <P>There has been a fundamental change in the way the Garda <Col N="349" /> are required to deal with offenders which I believe is seriously obstructing them in the battle against crime.  Until recently the position was that when the Garda arrested a person suspected of being involved in a criminal offence, he was charged by the garda involved, appeared in court either that day or the following day and was either remanded in custody in the case of more serious offences or released on bail, as a court considered appropriate.  A circular has been issued by a Deputy Commissioner of the Force to the effect that as a general rule charges should not be preferred until an investigation has been completed and that suspected offenders should be released without charge or without being granted bail and be summoned to appear in court at a later date.</P>
      <P>I understand that the circular issued by the Deputy Commissioner was based on advice offered by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The new procedure has caused concern to members of the Garda Síochána who believe that it effectively ties their hands at a time when the public demand is for stronger action to combat crime.  It has also angered members of the public who feel that the interests of offenders have been put before those of the victims of crime.  While the offender may be virtually caught in the act, the completion of an investigation may take some time, witnesses have to be interviewed, fingerprints taken and other forensic evidence prepared.  Offenders now caught in the act are released without charge pending the completion of the ensuing investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that after a recent armed robbery in a bank in Dublin three men were arrested.  During the course of questioning they are understood to have admitted their involvement in a series of other raids, including one in which an innocent bystander was wounded.  They were released within hours pending the completion of the investigation, the submission of a file to the DPP and the decision as to whether there was sufficient <Col N="350" /> evidence to bring charges.  In another incident in Dublin a garda was stabbed with a syringe.  Although the alleged assailant was arrested and taken to the local Garda station he was released pending the preparation of a file for the DPP.</P>
    <P>There is a delicate balance to be struck between the right of a suspected offender to be presumed innocent until such time as proven guilty by a court and the need to give the Garda adequate powers to protect society from criminal activities. The new directive tilts the balance unreasonably in favour of the criminals. I have always supported the principle that persons charged with offences should have reasonable access to bail, particularly as it can take so long for a case to come to trial.  When bail is sought a charged person has to put up his own bail in minor cases or, more usually, find someone to put up independent bail.  The bail set can be substantial and there is, therefore, a financial incentive for the person who goes bail to ensure that the charged person turns up for trial.  What is likely to happen now?  A suspected offender who is released and who knows he or she is guilty is not likely to wait for the decision of the DPP.  He or she is likely to go to a new address or to leave the country.  Everyone agrees that crime is one of the most serious problems facing modern society and that there is an unacceptable level in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Within the past few weeks we have had a series of highly publicised attacks on tourists which, apart from the injury, loss and distress caused to the victims, has the potential to do serious damage to our tourist industry.  What will be the reaction of a tourist who is attacked and robbed, who learns that the Garda have arrested a suspect but that he has been released without bail or charge pending a decision by the DPP?  Should we be surprised if the tourist never returns?  This is not an acceptable situation, it gives the wrong message to criminals and to victims of crime that our society takes a less serious view of crime than it should.  The Minister <Col N="351" /> for Justice must now intervene to sort out the situation and to revert to the old system where suspects were charged as soon as possible.  If legislation is required to achieve this then I urge the Minister to provide it as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>Tá mé buíoch den Teachta De Rossa as ucht an cheist seo a ordú agus tá mé buíoch díot féin, a Cheann Comhairle, as ucht deis a thabhairt dom an cheist a fhreagairt.</P>
      <P>I should make it clear that the instructions issued to members of the Garda Síochána in November 1992 followed an advice received by the Commissioner from the Director of Public Prosecutions. The DPP was concerned to ensure that charges would not be preferred in a case until the relevant investigation had been completed, and to avoid problems which can arise if charges are preferred prematurely. These include the following matters: A premature charge could result in an injustice to the accused if fresh evidence, hitherto unchecked, comes to light which cast doubts on the guilt of the accused or perhaps shows him or her to be innocent.  The preferring of a charge effectively puts the accused out of reach of further investigation and questioning, therefore reducing the chances of procuring further evidence.  The DPP also clarified the circumstances where the directions of his office should be sought before a charge is brought.</P>
      <P>The Director of Public Prosecutions is by statute responsible for the prosecution of criminal offences and prosecutions are initiated by the Garda Síochána acting on his advice.  As the Director of Public Prosecutions is independent in the exercise of his functions, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on any advice given by him in relation to the initiation of prosecutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implementation of the November 1992 instruction based on the DPP's advice, inevitably means that charges will not be preferred immediately in more <Col N="352" /> cases than heretofore, but will await completion of a Garda investigation, and directions from the DPP's Office as necessary.  These cases will proceed at that stage and the accused persons will be brought before the court, whether by summons or by the charge procedure &mdash; it will not necessarily be by summons &mdash; and then processed in accordance with the law.</P>
    <P>Apart from these instructions there are standing instructions from the Garda management dating from August 1989 concerning the day to day procedures to be adopted in the Dublin metropolitan area relating to the processing of summary offences, and minor indictable offences, which would not normally require directions from the DPP.  The instruction is that such offences should be brought before the court by summons rather than by a charge procedure, except in cases where the defendant's name and address are not known, cannot be ascertained, or there are good grounds for believing that the person arrested would not appear on summons.</P>
    <P>These arrangements have been in operation since 1989 but I understand that there has been increasing use of the summons procedure in connection with minor offences in recent months.</P>
    <P>There are significant benefits for policing arising from the policies being pursued by the Garda Commissioner in relation to these matters and I want to refute the argument which has been made in the media, that the purpose of the changes is to reduce costs.  The present policies have the effect of reducing the time spent by gardaí in multiple court appearances to deal with remands, and makes more gardaí available on the street, where they are most needed. Public policing is thereby enhanced.</P>
    <P>It should also reduce pressure on the courts and allow both the prosecution and defence time to prepare for the hearing of cases before the courts.  It should be possible, where a summons procedure has been used as an alternative to a <Col N="353" /> charge, to process most cases at the first hearing.</P>
    <P>It has been represented in the media that the effect of the policy changes has been to allow offenders to be released back on the streets to commit further offences with impunity, and that this would not happen if they were charged and brought before a court.  This is based on a misconception of how the judicial system works in practice.  It is very rarely, if ever, that where a person is charged and brought before the District Court that the case is disposed of at the first appearance.  Invariably the accused is remanded for eight days and released on bail.  Further remands are usual until the prosecution is ready to proceed with the case.  So, in effect, the end result of using the summons procedure or the charge procedure is the same &mdash; the release of the accused person.  He is not taken out of circulation.</P>
    <P>The Commissioner is satisfied that the present policies being pursued in relation to the procedures for bringing alleged offenders before the courts, are the best one from the point of view of policing. They are releasing more Garda resources on the streets.  He believes that the success of these policies will be reflected in an improved service to the public.  There are indications that there was a reduction of 3 per cent in the overall crime rate in the first four months of this year.</P>

      <P>Our happiness at the success of the Garda Síochána in seizing the £5 million of drugs being imported into west Cork last weekend is tempered by the knowledge that this consignment may have been only the tip of the iceberg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="354" /> All credit to the Garda Síochána for their success and particularly to Garda Tim Murnane who sustained gunshot wounds during the course of duty.  I am glad the news about him is good and I hope he will be back on duty soon.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it is now very clear that the hundreds of miles of rugged coastline in west Cork have become a honeypot for drug smugglers.  We had the huge £7 million haul in Courtmacsherry in 1991 and a further haul of over £1 million in Roscarbery last month.  The question that needs to be addressed is how many of these shipments have got through.  Certainly I am aware of a substantial landing a few years ago on an island near Schull which was never traced.  There is considerable evidence to suggest that there were many other such landings &mdash; mainly with drugs from the Mediterranean region.</P>
    <P>There is also some evidence that because the United States is more successful in disrupting South American drugs supply routes that drug producers are turning their attention to the European market.  West Cork is, of course right on the shipping line between Europe and the Americas and is particularly vulnerable as a possible access for drug traffickers to the UK and mainland Europe.</P>
    <P>These drug traffickers are very unwelcome visitors as far as the people in west Cork are concerned.  However, it is not a west Cork problem in that their supplies are intended for elsewhere.  It is not even solely an Irish problem.  There is a major European dimension in all this business. Accordingly, if it is accepted that we have a European problem we are entitled to support from the EC for the measures necessary to tackle it.</P>
    <P>I would hope for agreement from the Minister on the following measures. Resources and equipment of the Garda Síochána, the customs and other regulatory agencies in west Cork should be strengthened and improved.  I accept that from the point of view of what is termed <Col N="355" />&ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; crime, my area thankfully is not as badly affected as the cities.  On the other hand, adequate manpower is needed to police such an enormous stretch of coastline.  I should mention that we now have cause to miss the light keepers from the Old Head of Kinsale, The Galley, the Fastnet Rock, the Mizen and elsewhere since all these lighthouses have become automated.  Furthermore, in relation to equipment, we must have available to the Garda top class modern gear which is as good as if not better than anything available to the drug smugglers. I am talking of high powered binoculars, night sight equipment, infrared cameras and scrambler radios.  I know that such items cost a great deal of money but that money must be provided.</P>
    <P>Funding must be made available to the national drugs team.  I understand there is a proposal to provide them with three high powered sea going vessels and surveillance equipment at a cost of £13 million. These are considered to be necessary and must be provided; and in addition the necessary backup must be provided by the Navy and the Air Corps from the point of view of ships, helicopters and planes for surveillance.  Again if a large sum of money is involved and there is an EC dimension, there is a case for EC support.</P>
    <P>A coast watch service should be established. This service would be the eyes and ears of the Garda Síochána and the Customs service.  There is every reason to seek EC support for such a coast watch service, which again would have a European dimension.  Apart from tracking down drug smugglers, it would also have a role in assisting in search and rescue operations.</P>
    <P>Above all, there needs to be a development of public awareness about the extent of the problem and the absolute need to pass on information about suspicious activity to the Garda Síochána. Essentially every person has a role to play.  The locals in any area have a much <Col N="356" /> better knowledge of their own coastline. Tourists have time on their hands.  All should be encouraged to play their part in combatting this growing evil.  Furthermore, we want to put the drug godfathers behind bars.  Evidence is necessary to secure convictions.  Anybody with a scintilla of such evidence has a patriotic duty to take it to the authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Drug smuggling appears to be rampant along our coastline today. The coves and bays on the coastline of south-west Cork and south Kerry are ideal locations for that purpose.  The automation of our lighthouses played into the hands of the smugglers.  Nothing could replace the human eye as far as deterring such crimes is concerned. Gardaí and Customs officials must be congratulated for the manner in which they are handling the situation.  What is needed in this country is a coastguard cutter service which should be provided through EC funding so that our waters can be guarded.  In fact, I would impress on the Minister the necessity to call in our Navy, pending the provision of such a coastguard cutter service, to counteract the serious situation that appertains along the entire coastline of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to congratulate the men and women of an Garda Síochána and the officers of the Customs and Excise service for their excellent surveillance work and co-operation which resulted in last weekend's significant seizure of cannabis resin in west Cork.  I am very much aware that this haul and other recent hauls in this region were the culmination of a joint Garda and customs exercise and the pooling of information and intelligence.  While the operation was very successful in terms of the amount of drugs seized and all concerned deserve our special congratulations, I would like to avail of this opportunity to express my wish that Garda Murnane, who was <Col N="357" /> unfortunately injured during the haul, will shortly be restored to full health.</P>
      <P>The main drug of abuse in this country is cannabis resin, which accounts for about 75 per cent of all seizures of drugs. Importation of cannabis resin to Ireland usually comes in consignments in the region of 100kg, which have been detected by the enforcement agencies on car ferries from mainland Europe.  The indications are that the majority of these drugs are for consumption on the home market.  Notwithstanding the size of some recent seizures, I am satisfied, as are the Garda authorities, that Ireland is not an international drug trafficking route.  The amounts of heroin, cocaine, and ecstasy imported are small by international standards and are invariably for consumption on the Irish market.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that the south west coastline has received special attention in recent years regarding the illegal importation of cannabis resin.  This coastline is very long, with many remote piers, coves and other secluded areas.  There is a strong emphasis in both the Cork west and Kerry Garda Divisions on the problem of drug trafficking and gardaí in both divisions have in recent years received training in various aspects of drug law enforcement.</P>
      <P>The allocation of man and woman power and other resources to specialist units such as drug enforcement is of course a matter for the Garda authorities. They have informed me that they are satisfied that the resources available to them and the strategies being adopted by them are effective in dealing with the problem.  In 1992 the drug squad based at Anglesea Street, Cork, was increased substantially to its present strength of 17.  This unit is responsible for drug law enforcement in Cork.  In addition, as the necessity arises, the Crime Task Force based at Anglesea Street is deployed to areas with particular drug related problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Cork west every Garda district has adequately trained personnel to deal with <Col N="358" /> drug related law enforcement and, as the occasion demands, an inspector based at Bandon utilises specifically trained gardaí in certain operations.  The situation will, however, be kept under continuous review.  I can assure the House that the Garda have the Government's full support in their efforts to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>The success of the Garda drug squad in Cork can be measured by the fact that in 1990 there were 391 drug seizures which resulted in 351 persons being charged.  These figures had increased to 450 seizures in 1991 while the number of persons charged rose to 409.  This is a significant indication of the success of the enforcement agencies in the Cork area.</P>
    <P>It is of course very important to ensure that illicit drugs cannot be easily smuggled into this country and for this reason the Garda maintain a high level of ongoing liaison with Interpol and with police and customs authorities throughout Europe.  This co-operation is vital to effective action against drug trafficking and has been instrumental in many successful and important seizures in the south west of the country and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The implications for policing arising from the abolition of customs controls on 1 January 1993 have been under examination for sometime.  EC Ministers of the Interior and Justice in agreeing to set up the Trevi Group in 1975 affirmed their common will to strengthen co-operation in the fight against organised international crime and terrorism.  At a meeting of Trevi Ministers in Copenhagen last week I, together with Ministers from the 11 other EC member states, signed an agreement to enable the first phase of Europol &mdash; the Europol Drugs Unit &mdash; to be established.  This unit will be of great practical benefit in combatting the international trafficking of drugs.</P>
    <P>Work on measures to combat drug trafficking at European level is also being undertaken by the Mutual Assistance Group (MAG), the EC wide customs group.  There is close co-operation and <Col N="359" /> co-ordination between Trevi and the Mutual Assistance Group in order to ensure that there is no overlap in the work being done by the two groups.</P>
    <P>Drug law enforcement efforts in this country are co-ordinated by the Garda National Drug Administration Office, which was set up in 1990 and which is located in Garda Headquarters.  The Revenue Commissioners have also recently established a National Drugs Team with more than 70 staff consisting of intelligence units, maritime units and sniffer dogs units, which will be strategically based at import and export points throughout the country, including Cork.  To complete the task of the Revenue Commissioners in relation to tackling illegal drugs trafficking more effectively, the Minister for Finance is also pursuing with the European Commission the possibility of obtaining Community funding in order to enhance the existing Customs infrastructural resources allocated to the prevention of drugs smuggling through our ports, airports and land and sea borders.  The Garda authorities have assured me that these inter-agency liaison arrangements are a practical and effective way of dealing with drug-related crime here.</P>
    <P>I hope I have made it abundantly clear that everything possible is being done to ensure that the problem of drug trafficking on the South West Coast and elsewhere in this country is being tackled effectively.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It gives me no joy to raise this matter this evening.  Dennison Ireland Ltd., have had a plant in Youghal for some time and employ a total of 110 people. <Col N="360" /> There are two manufacturing plants, one of which manufactures discs and the other plastic documentation folders.  The parent company is Avery Dennison Corporation which came into existence in 1990 as the result of a merger between Avery International and Dennison Manufacturing Inc.  Since then many decisions have been taken which were definitely not in favour of the company. Twelve months ago when the disc plant was running at full capacity the then managing director sought investment of £250,000 by the parent company.  I am asking the IDA here this evening, through the good offices of the Minister, to ensure that this capital investment is made in the company.</P>
    <P>Youghal has suffered severely because of the economic decline over the years. It is a seaside and manufacturing town with textiles as its base industry.  At present 1,045 people are claiming unemployment benefit.  This is too high a number and the last thing we need is to add to this figure.</P>
    <P>Dennison Ireland Ltd., is a competitive and efficient plant.  Last year it had a turnover of £10 million.  However, this Friday 16 people are being made redundant, 35 are being placed on short time and others are being encouraged to take leave of absence.  It seems quite clear that every effort is being made to wind the plant down with an overall loss of over 100 jobs.  This would be a tragedy for the seaside town.</P>
    <P>It also seems that every effort is being made to transfer the business of the Youghal plant to its sister plant in Troyes in France despite the fact that the Youghal plant is the more profitable.  It is clear that there has been a lamentable lack of consultation between management and the workforce and the parent company abroad.</P>
    <P>It would be a tremendous loss for Youghal if this factory closed.  It would also be a huge loss in terms of IDA and training grants and low taxes for the past 12 years.  I urge the Minister to take every <Col N="361" /> possible action to ensure that these jobs are saved.  I also call on the relevant State agencies, including the local representatives of the IDA, to take any action necessary.  Part and parcel of this is the opening up of negotiations between the Youghal plant and the parent company Avery Dennison.</P>
    <P>No investment has been made in the past 12 months.  The arrival of a new manufacturing unit assigned from France has been awaited.  It is sad that there has been no change of heart on the part of the French parent company.  Youghal's loss will be France's gain.  For a small investment we could secure the future of the company in this very important town that has suffered economic decline.</P>
    <P>There is no joy in talking about job losses tonight.  I thought there had been an upturn in our economy, that it was on the way to success with growth rates of 2 per cent.  That does not seem to be the case although interest rates were never as attractive.  There is a lack of investment to allow the French company to continue.  It is winding down and that is sad.</P>

      <P>The dark and menacing clouds of economic recession have been steadily gathering over the coastal town of Youghal for some time, in particular, they have been looming over the Avery Dennison factory in Youghal.  I have already contacted the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, as I am concerned about the future of the plant. I expect to meet the Minister again tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Youghal is one of our finest towns with a fine beach and coastline.  Unfortunately, its people cannot live on scenery alone.  East Cork has been very badly <Col N="362" /> hit in the past by unemployment. Verolme Dockyard at one time employed 1,300 people but it closed a number of years ago.</P>
    <P>I was one of its employees at one time. The dockyard was taken over by a Dutch company, Damon Shipping, who at that time promised 400 jobs but, to date, it has not delivered on its promise.  I now call on the Government to ensure that east Cork survives as its people are badly in need of employment and economic investment.  In particular, the Government should use all its powers to ensure the future of Dennison Ireland Ltd., in Youghal.</P>
    <P>Quite a lot of money, £107,000 was invested in the Cork dockyard by the IDA, but despite all this investment no jobs have yet been created in the constituency. I earnestly ask the Minister to investigate this matter in Youghal as the town is crying out for employment.</P>

I assure the House that I share the Deputies' concern about the proposed loss of jobs at Dennison Ireland Ltd. and the serious consequences for the workforce. However, the situation to date is unclear and, as I understand it, no final decision has been made.  The House will, of course, realise that in all such cases a decision in respect of any proposed redundancies is essentially a matter for the company involved.</P>

    <P>Dennison Ireland Ltd. is a wholly owned subsidiary of a major United States multinational company &mdash; Avery Dennison Corporation based in California, USA.  The company has been in Ireland since 1981.

Doret Manufacturing manufactures a range of office products, ring binders, protection covers, display items and computer accessories.</P>
    <P>At present a comprehensive review is being carried out on all Avery Dennison's operations.  The IDA met local management and workers as well as the Avery chief executive at national level and, in conjunction with the company, is doing <Col N="364" /> its utmost to preserve jobs in the company.  It is important that while confidential and delicate negotiations and discussions are underway nothing is said that might prejudice the situation at this time.</P>
    <P>Let me reassure both Deputies that everything possible is being done by the IDA with a view to a positive outcome.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 21, 35, 53, 75, and 110 together.</P>
      <P>There are currently 79 primary and 26 post primary schools in the scheme, with the services of 71 locally based co-ordinators working under the direction of a National Co-ordinator.  Each co-ordinator is responsible for an area and acts in support of local schools in establishing contact with parents, encouraging parents to become involved in their children's education, organising locally based activities which contribute to closer contact between parents and teachers and establishing links with pre-school and other voluntary and statutory groups in the area.  The scheme currently caters for a total of around 40,000 pupils.</P>
      <P>A representative National Steering Committee advises on the overall direction and focus of the scheme.  The scheme is also being evaluated on an ongoing basis by the Educational Research Centre, of St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra.</P>
      <P>Early indications are that the scheme represents a valuable enhancement of educational provision for disadvantaged young people and fits well with thinking and stratagies in this area in other countries.</P>
      <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to developing a nationwide Home/School liaison service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a first step in this process.  I have already announced the inclusion of an additional 27 primary schools and 12 <Col N="110" /> posts primary schools in the scheme from the start of the 1993/94 school year.  My Department will shortly be in contact with the schools in question to make the necessary arrangements.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 24, 31, 66 and 92 together.  I am very much in favour of parental involvement in the education of their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputies know my Department supported the establishment of the National Parents Council with its Primary and Post-Primary Tiers in 1985.  Since then, through the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> (PESP), the Government and the Social Partners <Col N="111" /> have formally recognised the promotion of parental involvement in the education of their children as an essential strategy of educational policy and practice.  Under the terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress </i> an annual grant of £25,000 is paid to both the Primary and Post-Primary tiers of the National Parents' Council.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned that there should be parental involvement in their children's education in disadvantaged areas.  Through the Home/School/Community Liaison Scheme which operates in urban areas affected by severe economic and social disadvantage local schools are supported in establishing contact with parents and encouraging them to become involved in their children's education. Nearly 150 Primary and Post-Primary schools situated in disadvantaged areas will be participating in this scheme in the 1993/94 school year.</P>
    <P>During 1992 the National College of Industrial Relations, at the request of my Department, delivered a programme aimed at facilitating parents effective participation and involvement in supporting their children's educational development in 20 post-primary schools situated in disadvantaged areas of Dublin.  Arrangements are being made for the delivery of a similar programme in 27 primary and post-primary schools in the Dublin area during the 1993-94 school year.  A total of £55,000 is being provided by my Department in respect of these courses.</P>
    <P>As well as the above direct intervention within the educational sphere course in life skills, including parenting, are provided by Vocational Educational Committees under the Adult Literacy and Community Education Programmes on an annual basis.  Information is not, however, readily available in relation to the number of parenting courses nor has their cost been disaggregated from the overall expenditure of Committees.</P>

      <P>It is the Department's policy that Adult Education be promoted as widely as possible whether in special centres or in schools or colleges.  There has been a dramatic increase in identifiable funding for adult education and training programmes in recent years.  This year alone it has increased to £17.88 million compared with £9 million last year, an increase of almost 100 per cent.  The funding is almost entirely for programmes for the disadvantaged, particularly for the VTOS (£7.15 million last year £15.3 million this year) and the Adult Literacy and Community Education Scheme (£1 million last year £1.57 million this year). At present although general adult education is intended to be provided on a self-financing basis, my Department is providing substantial funding for support structures and special programmes for disadvantaged people mainly through the vocational education committees.</P>
      <P>My Department does not provide funding for adult education centres as such. Two prime examples of these special programmes are the Adult Literacy and Community Education Scheme (ALCES) and the Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme for the long term unemployed (VTOS).  The funding for ALCES has been increased from £1m in 1992 to £1.57m in 1993 and the VTOS from £7.15m in 1992 to £15.3m in 1993.</P>
      <P>All aspects of adult education are under review in my Department at present.  While this review is being done in the context of the forthcoming White Paper on Education, my Department plans to make as much ongoing progress as possible in the interim in addressing various issues.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 43, 47 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>1.  There are 63,235 candidates entered to take the Leaving Certificate this year of whom 58,314 are school candidates and 4,921 are external candidates.</P>
      <P>2.  It is estimated that 41,000 of the 58,314 school pupils sitting the Leaving Certificate to-day had access to an ex-quota career guidance teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>3.  Three hundred and ninety schools out of a total of 784 schools do not at present have an ex-quota career guidance teacher.

    <P>There are a further 103 schools in the 350-499 enrolment category, with total enrolments of 40,873 pupils, which will be allocated 0.5 of a wholetime post for guidance over the next two years.</P>
    <P>In addition to this allocation, 0.5 of a whole-time post is being allocated to VECs on a scheme basis in respect of schools with enrolments of less than 350 over the next two years.  Therefore all pupils attending VEC schools will have access to career guidance.</P>

      <P>The Elliot report, Report of the European Parliament Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media on the EC Commission's Memorandum on Higher Education in the EC of which Mr. Michael Elliot was the rapporteur does not in fact project that the numbers of EC university students will fall by 25 per cent in 25 years.  The report notes that in its Memorandum the Commission identifies two parallel trends within the EC.  One is a continuing growth in the demand for highly trained and skilled people to meet the needs of an increasingly complex and technologically based European society.  The second is a demographic decline in the numbers of young people available for entry into higher education on a community wide basis. The decline will vary from one member state to another and the figure of at least 25 per cent is an overall forecast over the next 20 to 30 years for the community.</P>
      <P>But this does not necessarily mean that there will be a decline in the numbers of students attending higher education.  In fact the Memorandum predicts that an overall increase in demand for higher education is likely in the future.  This is in line with the situation in this country where student numbers in higher education have more than trebled from 21,000 in 1965 to almost 80,000 at present and are projected to increase to over 100,000 by the end of the century.  In its booklet &ldquo;Europe in Figures&rdquo; which the Commission published in 1987 it notes that whereas there was a slump in the birth rate between 1960 and 1985 the numbers of students attending higher education increased by 77 per cent between 1970 and 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its Memorandum the Commission proposes that all young people should be <Col N="116" /> encouraged to pursue higher education to the maximum of their potential and that the necessary courses and placements for them to do so should be provided. This is in line with the assurance I gave the House in March regarding the Government's commitment to investing in higher education to a level where sufficient places would be available for all able to benefit.  The Government recognises with the increasing sophistication of the world economy, the capability and knowledge of the workforce becomes more and more critical to providing the impetus for economic growth and job creation.  Clearly investment in education is the key to future prosperity and to equality and equal opportunity for all.</P>
    <P>I would like to inform the Deputy that a review of the provision of higher education in Ireland and of future needs in higher education has been announced by me and that I will be in a position to announce its terms of reference shortly.</P>

      <P>I have now sanctioned the appointment of an additional 86 remedial teachers with effect from September 1993.</P>
      <P>Allocation of remedial support up to now tended to focus on large urban areas, where remedial requirements were more pronounced and where the existence of large schools facilitated the provision of such support.</P>
      <P>When allocating these new posts, I gave priority to schools which had no remedial suport at all.  Among these were a large number of rural areas where there was still no remedial provision for pupils, particularly in the smaller schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="117" /> In line with my INTO Congress address I have now rectified this situation by assigning a sizeable majority of the remedial teaching posts to the small schools and to rural schools.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the school mentioned by the Deputy has not been selected on this occasion.  However, I should point out that four of the new posts are being allocated to County Cavan, resulting in a further 18 schools receiving the service. As a result of this allocation, 62 per cent of pupils in County Cavan will have access to a remedial service, as compared with 41 per cent to the allocation.  I will be keeping the question of further need in this area under review as part of a broader commitment to appoint additional remedial teachers.  The needs of all schools, including the school mentioned by the Deputy, will be considered in this context.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 65 and 99 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="118" /> While it is my policy to encourage the maximum possible level of integration of handicapped children into ordinary schools, including the mildly and mentally handicapped, the pace of development and the degree to which integration can be achieved will very depending on the specific and evolving needs of the children concerned.</P>
    <P>Children with special needs are provided for in a number of ways.  Depending on their abilities they can attend special schools, special classes in ordinary national schools or can be integrated into ordinary classes in national schools.</P>
    <P>Children with special needs who are capable of attending mainstream classes have access to a range of supports.  The largest category of such pupils, those in need of remedial tuition, receive the support of 945 remedial teachers operating within the primary school sector.</P>
    <P>A particular instance of integration occurs at the post-primary level where, in Dublin and Cork, particular schools have been designated as focal schools for pupils with physical disabilities and provided with additional resources.</P>
    <P>The visiting teacher service, which traditionally dealt only with visual and hearing impaired children, was expanded in 1992 as part of a development aimed at meeting the needs of other categories of handicapped children in ordinary schools.  An additional eight visiting teachers were appointed for this purpose and, as a first step in the process, the service has been extended to embrace 44 Down's Syndrome children, identified by the Down's Syndrome Association as requiring support.</P>
    <P>As part of a further initiative in this area, my Department has already appointed seven special resource teachers in selected primary schools to support ordinary teaching staff in dealing with children with special needs.  Within the general allocation of additional resources to the special needs area, I hope to make a further 7 such appointments with effect from September, 1993.</P>
    <P>I should point out that I am currently awaiting the Report of the Special Education Review Committee which is giving <Col N="119" /> particular attention to the question of integration of children with disabilities and the support services required in this area.  I expect to receive the Committee's report by the summer and I will be giving careful consideration to its recommendations. Pending, receipt of the Committee's report I am not in favour of specifying an exact time-frame for integrating children with a handicap into mainstream schools.</P>

      <P>The unit cost study assembled a considerable body of factual data on the current expenditures of primary schools. Because of the variety of school types and sizes, of expenditure headings and of school programmes involved, the study is a complex one and requires careful consideration.  The study is being examined at present and the data it contains will form the basis of further discussions on school funding with school managements. As indicated the study is largely one containing factual data and comment and does not make any recommendations either in regard to unit costs per pupil or otherwise.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>The terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provide for a six-year cycle of post-primary education &mdash; which will involve a three-year senior cycle &mdash; for pupils entering the senior cycle in September, 1994 onwards.</P>
      <P>The Leaving Certificate will continue to be a two-year course.  Pupils may spend three years at senior cycle, however, through a variety of options.  The intention is to provide maximum flexibility in the senior cycle in catering for the different aptitudes, abilities and needs of pupils.</P>
      <P>Final decisions on the content and structure of the senior cycle must await completion of consideration of the responses to the Green Paper on Education &mdash; including that of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment which was contained in their document &ldquo;Towards the New Century&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, my Department will issue guidelines to schools, which will operate on an interim basis, on the options available for a three-year senior cycle from 1994-95.</P>

      <P>The total allocation for the Youth Service Grant Scheme in 1993 is £11.452 million which represents an increase of 6 per cent on the 1992 allocation.  Before deciding on how this money should be allocated to the various Youth <Col N="128" /> Organisations and Disadvantaged Projects my Department examined submissions from the various bodies involved.  I will immediately make a copy of the actual breakdown of the 1993 allocation available to the Deputy.  I do not accept that the system is <i>ad hoc</i> as suggested by the Deputy.  Each organisation makes as strong a case as possible for funding and the available funds are allocated equitably and fairly having the fullest regard to the terms of the Youth Service Grant Scheme and the Disadvantaged Youth Grant Scheme.</P>

      <P>The number of candidates entered for the Leaving Certificate 1993 is 63,235 of which 58,314 are school candidates and 4,921 are external candidates.</P>
      <P>The number entered for Junior Certificate is 68,426.</P>
      <P>The number entered for Senior Certificate is 1,845.</P>
      <P>On the general aspect of the Deputy's question I am aware that in some cases there is undue emphasis on examination results.  This can arise from the pupils themselves, their peers, teachers, parents, schools, media comment and competition for places at third level.  In exceptional cases the undue stress can lead to nervous stress and depression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of these exceptional cases I am uneasy about some of the comment on examinations which can exaggerate the importance of results.  My impression, this year, is that media comment has been restrained and I welcome this development.  The most important outcome of education is that the pupils grow in knowledge and understanding, in useful skills and in, developing their <Col N="129" /> own values and appreciating those of others.</P>

      <P>The survey to which the Deputy refers was carried out by the Northside Research and Development Company as part of its role in developing strategies aimed at addressing educational disadvantage in the north side area of Cork city.</P>
      <P>I understand that the survey revealed a high incidence of pupils leaving primary school with serious literacy and numeracy problems.  There were also significant indications of older pupils leaving school without formal qualifications.</P>
      <P>I am of course concerned at the picture of educational disadvantage presented by this survey and I can assure the Deputy of my commitment to addressing such need wherever it arises.</P>
      <P>In this regard, I would refer to a number of initiatives which I have already taken and which are targeted specifically at areas of educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>As recently announced to the House, I have approved the appointment of an additional 86 remedial teachers at primary level with effect from September next.  The Deputy will wish to note that 11 of these posts are being allocated to the Cork area and will result in the extension of the remedial service to a further 38 schools in that area.  As a result of this allocation, 79 per cent of primary school children in Cork will have access to a remedial service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also approved the appointment of an additional 15 co-ordinators to the Home/School/Liaison service at primary level.  The Deputy will be pleased to learn that 2 of these posts are being allocated to the north side of Cork city to facilitate <Col N="130" /> the inclusion of 4 additional schools from the area in the service.</P>
    <P>As a result of this development, 9 primary schools in the area will have access to the home/school/liaison service.</P>
    <P>At second-level, 4 schools from the area are already included in the home/school/liaison scheme and I have now decided to extend this coverage by including another post-primary school in the area within the scheme.</P>
    <P>Decisions regarding the schools to be selected for receipt of further concessionary posts will be taken shortly and I can assure the Deputy that the needs of Cork city will be fully taken into account in this process.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the measures I have outlined will make a significant contribution to combating educational disadvantage both in Cork city and elsewhere.</P>

      <P>A survey aimed at identifying the extent of disability in ordinary national schools was undertaken by the Special Education Review Committee in 1992. The survey focused on a large representative sample of schools and sought details of children across a wide spectrum of special needs.</P>
      <P>There was a 100 per cent response to the survey and its findings were evaluated by the Educational Research Centre on behalf of the Special Education Committee.</P>
      <P>The outcome of the survey will inform the committee in recommending what future support services are required to meet the educational needs of the children in question.</P>

      <P>At present, continental languages do not form part of the approved curriculum for national schools.  At primary level, emphasis, is placed on the development and use of the two official languages of the State, Irish and English, with a view to facilitating the introduction of further languages at an early stage of post-primary education.</P>
      <P>The Green Paper on Education proposes that awareness of European languages be introduced for senior classes in primary schools.</P>
      <P>French, German, Spanish and Italian are taught in post-primary schools.  Of these, French, which is the language of TV5, occupies the dominant position.</P>
      <P>While the availability of TV5 as an aid to learning French is to be welcomed, I would be keen to encourage the use of foreign-language TV channels that can be received here to promote the study of German, Spanish and Italian.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62, 76, 77 and 108 together.</P>
      <P>I am very familiar with the problems referred to recently in the media which are confronting not just guidance counsellors but also many other teachers and school principals.</P>
      <P>Through my meetings with parents, teachers and school managements I have a clear picture of the kinds of problems which are presenting in schools.</P>
      <P>The study referred to in the question set out the sources, the nature and the extent of these problems.  Their sources are in unemployment, deprivation, marriage breakdown and increases in crime. They present as physical, emotional, sexual, religious, and educational in character.</P>
      <P>In so far as dealing with this at school level is concerned, I should say at the outset that we cannot expect our schools, on their own, to solve these problems. However, they are very often the first point of contact for young pupils in trouble of whatever kind.</P>
      <P>I believe that support for pupils in difficulty should be seen as an across the school activity.  While the presence of a trained guidance counsellor is essential for the ideal guidance service, the involvement of many other teachers is also essential.  This would include teachers with a particular interest in pastoral care and teachers with experience of counselling in areas other than guidance counselling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to assure you that my Department has been actively involved, over a <Col N="140" /> number of years in projects of a preventative nature which are aimed at the problems in question.</P>
    <P>In relation specifically to the allocation of posts for guidance in post-primary schools, the position is that all schools with enrolments of 500 or more pupils are allocated an ex-quota post for guidance. In addition, in accordance with the provisions of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> a phased programme which started in 1992/93 and which is due to be completed in 1994/95, was introduced for the recognition on an ex-quota basis of 0.5 of a wholetime post for guidance to secondary and community/comprehensive schools in the 350 &mdash; 499 enrolment category with a similar provision being made for vocational schools on a vocational education scheme basis.</P>

      <P>Local authorities are grant-aided each year for the provision of a school library service.</P>
      <P>This arrangement has been in place since 1971, and is operated through the Library Council.  The grant is paid in respect of all primary school pupils in each local authority area.  The money is distributed to the Chief Librarian of the local authority area and, supplemented by other funds at the disposal of the Chief Librarian, is used to buy books for lending or distribution to schools.</P>
      <P>All local authorities participate in the scheme so every school has access to a lending and reference library service.  In some rural areas the local authority provides a visiting library service for schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The library grant was increased in 1992 from 38p to 47p per pupil and I secured <Col N="141" /> a further increase in 1993 which will bring the rate of grant to 50p per pupil.</P>
    <P>In 1989 an allocation of £1 million was provided through national lottery funds for the replenishment of the stock of books used for the national schools library service.</P>
    <P>In the case of second-level schools, my Department makes grants available for the running costs of the schools and it is open to schools to buy books for their libraries out of these grants.  There is no specific library grant scheme in the case of these schools.</P>

    <P>These figures indicate that there is an unequal distribution of the sexes at principal level.  This is one of the areas which has been identified in the Green Paper on Education as a gender equity problem and a 6-point programme has been put forward to redress imbalances which exist. Appointments to the post of principal, of course, are generally made through competition, on the basis of the best qualified and most competent applicant. It is the policy of my Department that, where possible, both sexes should be represented on selection boards for teaching posts.  I am particularly anxious that there be gender balance on school staff selection committees as well as on Boards of Management themselves.</P>

      <Quest>the arrangements, if any, that will operate in the coming school year to assist needy pupils with the purchase of school books; the amount that will be allocated at primary and second level; the amount per pupil this represents; her views on whether this amount is adequate; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The scheme of aid towards the cost of school textbooks for needy pupils this year is unchanged from previous years.  The scheme is administered through school Principals, who have discretion in the selection of pupils to be assisted, the amount of assistance to be given to the pupil and the form such assistance will take, subject to the amount of money made available to each school which is based on the number of pupils defined as needy.</P>
      <P>At first level the rates of grant for 1993 are of the order of £10 per needy pupil in classes I-IV and £5.50 per pupil in Infant Classes.  At second-level, there is no fixed amount per pupil.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of the financial demands made on parents of school pupils in providing school textbooks for their children.  In an effort to alleviate this burden I obtained an increase of £200,000 in the provision for this scheme at primary level, bringing the allocation for 1993 to a level of £1,647,000.  At second level I secured an increase of £212,000 bringing this year's overall allocation at second level to £2,809,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conjunction with this scheme my Department has issued guidelines to school management authorities to assist in the implementation of loan/rental schemes, in co-operation with parents, which would ensure the efficient use of school books and minimise the cost for parents.  School authorities have also been advised that selected textbooks should be changed only to the extent that is absolutely necessary. <Col N="145" /> My Department, in consultation with the Partners in Education, is continuing to review the operation of the scheme.</P>

      <P>The terms of the third level student support schemes do not require differing academic attainments on transfer from a Regional Technical College to a University degree course, and I am not aware of such an anomaly in the treatment of any individual cases.  However, if the Deputy wishes to supply particulars of any such cases I shall be happy to have them investigated.</P>
      <P>Currently, a student who has completed a course at sub-degree level in a Regional Technical College and who transfer to a degree course in a University is subject to the terms of either the 1992 Higher Education Grants Scheme or the relevant vocational education committee scholarship scheme. These schemes stipulate that such a student must have attained a Grade C or Higher Level Papers in two or more subjects in the Leaving Certificate Examination, irrespective of the year in which she sat that examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of a student with a Regional Technical College Diploma who is accepted into the second year of a degree course, I wish to explain that for the purpose of payment of grant the student is required to obtain exemption <Col N="146" /> from either the first or the first and second years of the degree programme depending on whether the course previously followed was at Certificate or Diploma level.  The grant is then payable in respect of each of the additional years necessary for the completion of the degree.</P>
    <P>The schemes are currently under review and I am committed &mdash; within the constraints of Exchequer resources &mdash; to the elimination of inequities and anomalies from them.  In that regard I have set up an Expert Advisory Group to recommend appropriate criteria for means assessment and to make proposals for the most effective and efficient organisational arrangements for the administration of the schemes.</P>

      <P>The actual cost of ESF-aided programmes is calculated by schools/VECs at the end of each calendar year on the basis of an apportionment technique, extracting the ESF programme costs from overall running costs based on the proportion of teaching hours delivered on the particular programmes, and applying the resulting apportionment factor to both pay and non-pay costs.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="152" /> The position is that in enacting the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974 the Oireachtas decided &mdash; wisely, in my opinion &mdash; that the Director of Public Prosecutions should be independent in the performance of his functions in order to guard against undue or inappropriate pressures being brought to bear in particular cases.  Such pressures would be equally wrong whether they were directed to having the director prosecute somebody or not prosecute.  I do not see how that independence could be maintained under such a system as the Deputy proposes because in essence it would amount to a review of the director's decision.  I would also see considerable practical difficulty in devising a system for selecting the cases which were to be referred to the proposed assessors and those which were not.</P>

    <P>The proposed EC Directive on working hours provides that an individual should not work on average more than 48 hours per week, the average to be calculated over a four month period or, under certain circumstances, over six or twelve month periods.  As such it is not likely to have significant impact on the number of hours of overtime worked in my Department or in the Central Statistics Office.</P>

      <P>At present, no special arrangements exist in relation to the VAT treatment of supplies of second-hand goods generally, including musical instruments: thus, the supply of second-hand musical instruments is also currently liable here to VAT at the standard rate.  However, the draft EC 7th VAT Directive proposes that, in future, special arrangements will apply to the subsequent resale of second-hand goods which will take account of any residual VAT from the initial supply of the goods.  The principle which would apply to such sales is that VAT, at the standard rate, would be charged on the dealer's margin.  Following discussions at yesterday's ECO/FIN Council meeting, it is hoped that the draft Directive will be adopted shortly.</P>

      <P>In so far as my Department is concerned, the total number of overtime man hours for the period 1 January &mdash; 31 December, 1992 was 24,210 hours.  With regard to total man hours worked, my Department does not maintain its records in this manner.  To answer the Deputy's question fully would necessitate examining all personal records to establish the number of man hours worked in each case.  This would mean that more urgent and pressing work would have to be put aside. In addition, the information sought could not be provided in the time available. However, an estimated figure for total man hours worked in 1992 has been calculated, on the basis of conditioned hours of work, at 1,120,000 hours.  (This figure does not take account of sick leave or annual leave hours as this data is not readily available).  The proportion of this figure represented by overtime man hours worked in 1992 is 2.16 per cent.  In money terms, the amount of overtime <Col N="157" /> worked in my Department in 1992 amounted to 1.89 per cent of salaries paid.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain local authority officers receive <Col N="158" /> a Gaeltacht allowance under regulations set out in Statutory Instrument 221 of 1966.  Under these regulations, a local authority may pay an office holder additional remuneration, not exceeding 7½ per cent of the annual basic salary of the office holder, where her/his duties are performed mainly or entirely in the Gaeltacht and the local authority is satisfied that he or she posseses a sufficient knowledge of the Irish language to enable him or her to perform the duties of the office competently through Irish.</P>
    <P>The same arrangements apply in the health service as in local authorities.</P>
    <P>Teachers giving instruction in all subjects (except English) through Irish in schools situated in the Gaeltacht receive an allowance of £1,191 per year.</P>
    <P>In the Gárda Síochána, a Gaeltacht allowance equal to 7½ per cent of basic pay is payable to members up to and including Chief Superintendent.  The allowance is payable only in areas where Irish is the general medium of speech and where all the members of the Force are proficient in Irish and are required to perform their duties through Irish.  The areas where the allowance is paid are organised on the basis that they form a Superintendent's District as it is not regarded as practicable to arrange for members of the Force to conduct all their duties in Irish if Irish is not also in use at the District Headquarters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The rules in relation to receiving Invalidity Pension are to be relaxed for people with serious illnesses.  Under new regulations which I laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas recently, 25 May 1993, people who are diagnosed as seriously ill will have immediate access to the higher rate invalidity pension payment of £60.80.  In addition they will <Col N="160" /> receive the &ldquo;extra&rdquo; benefits which the pension attracts such as free travel, and gas, electricity and telephone rental allowances.  Up to now people in this situation depended on the lower rate disability benefit, £55.60, because the rules required that they had to be receiving disability benefit for at least a year before they could be considered for the invalidity pension.</P>
      <P>The new Regulations will help people who are facing a difficult period in their lives and will give them the security of the higher rate payment and &ldquo;extra&rdquo; benefits. There are other advantages for invalidity pensioners.  People receiving disability benefit are paid weekly by cheque and are normally required to submit weekly medical certificates from their doctor. Invalidity pensioners receive their payment by book of Personal Payable Orders and are only required to submit medical certificates periodically.</P>
      <P>The regulations in question are the Social Welfare (Invalidity Pension) Regulations 1993 (S.I. No. 132 of 1993), which were laid before the House on 25 May last.</P>
      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for Invalidity Pension is that the claimant must have been incapable of work for at least 12 months before making his or her claim.  The new regulations also entitles to invalidity pension a person who is incapable of work for less than 12 months but where evidence is adduced to establish to the satisfaction of a deciding officer or an appeals officer that the incapacity for work is of such a nature that the likelihood is that the person will be incapable of work for life.</P>
      <P>In addition, the regulations consolidate a number of existing provisions relating to invalidity pensions.</P>

      <P>In relation to my Department's sphere of activity, the Culliton report drew attention to the need to achieve a closer integration of the tax and social welfare systems.  The Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to examine this and the Minister of State for Social Welfare has been given special responsibility in this regard.  The question of specific legislative proposals in this area will be considered in the light of the outcome of this examination.</P>

      <P>The total number of hours overtime worked for the 12 months period of 1992 by persons employed in my Department was 250,300.  This represents some 3.5 per cent of total man hours worked in the Department during 1992.</P>
      <P>There are two public bodies under the aegis of my Department &mdash; the combat poverty agency and the pensions board. No overtime was worked in the combat poverty agency during 1992 while 114 hours overtime was worked in the pensions board.  This represented some 0.6 per cent of the total man hours worked in the board during 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impact of the proposed directive is dependent on a number of factors, yet to be clarified, but it is not expected to have any significant effect on reducing the level of overtime either in my Department or in the public bodies attached to my Department.  I will, of course, be attentive to any developments on the <Col N="162" /> Directive which might affect the situation.</P>

      <P>The Government today accepted my proposal that the weekly earnings limit for entitlement to the adult dependant allowance be increased from £55 to £60 with immediate effect.  This increase will benefit many low paid workers and in particular, contract cleaners and other part-time workers.  The necessary regulations to give effect to the increase are being drafted for immediate signature by me.</P>
      <P>At present, a person can earn up to £55 per week and still qualify as an adult dependant on their spouse's social welfare payment.  The earnings limit allows spouses of social welfare recipients to take up part-time employment without suffering a loss in the total household income.  The earnings limit was last increased in May 1990 to take account of pay increases for part-time workers, particularly those in the contract cleaning industry.  Following a recent increase in hourly rates of pay in accordance with the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> many contract cleaning workers would now exceed the present limit of £55 for their typical working week.  Consequently, their spouses on a social welfare payment would lose the adult dependant allowance of £34.30 per week.  The increase to £60 will ensure that the situation will be avoided in most cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="163" /> I am examining in the context of next year's budget the question of tapering the earnings limit so that the adult dependant allowance can be reduced gradually as earnings increase, thus avoiding what can be the severe impact of the cut-off point for the allowance at present.  This approach is broadly in line with the recommendations of the Review Group on the Treatment of Households and of the Commission on the Status of Women.</P>
    <P>Decisions in relation to the application of the earnings limit to individual cases are open to appeal to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>

      <P>A grant of £300 is paid on the birth of triplets at present.  In this year's budget, I introduced a similar grant of £200 on the birth of twins.  I also introduced significant increases in child benefit. From September, the monthly child benefit payment will increase to £20 for each of the first three children and to £23 for the fourth and each subsequent child.</P>
      <P>Under existing legislation double payments of child benefit are made in respect of triplets and other multiple births. These arrangements are in acknowledgement of the special nature of such births and the additional costs associated with them.  The introduction of similar arrangements in respect of twins would have financial implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>His wife is in receipt of invalidity pension at the weekly rate of £66.00.  The person concerned has been advised that it would be more beneficial for the couple for his wife to apply for an increase of invalidity pension on the basis that her husband is an adult dependant.  This would result in an increase of £46 per week in the invalidity pension and the cessation of the disability benefit. Accordingly the total amount payable to the couple would be restored to total payable before the person concerned entered hospital.  If applied for, the adjustment will be backdated and there will be no loss.</P>
      <P>The reduced rate of disability benefit, £31.25 in this case, is based on the entitlements payable to persons with low earnings.</P>

      <P>The detection of fraud and abuse of social welfare expenditure is an integral part of the work of my Department. All officers involved in the processing and payment of social welfare entitlements are concerned with the prevention and detection of abuse of the schemes and the elimination of fraud. There are also specific investigation units, which work at local, regional and national level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Investigations generally comprise inspections of employers in relation to their PRSI obligations, investigations of <Col N="165" /> cases of concurrent working and claiming of social welfare benefits, reviews of claimants, means for assistance payments, and the monitoring of ongoing entitlements to social welfare payments. Last year a total of 222,230 cases were reviewed by my Department.  It should be stressed that investigations generally have a monitoring role.  A visit to an employer or a review of a claim does not indicate that abuse is suspected in the particular case.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of people are honest in their dealings with the Department and are entitled to a modern and dignified service whether they are employers or receiving a payment.</P>
    <P>The Department has built up a wealth of knowledge and skill and claims selected for review may be in categories known to be relatively high risk.  Last year, the total savings to the taxpayer as a result of my Department's activities to counter fraud, abuse and unwarranted claiming amounted to £84 million.</P>
    <P>Staff of my Department are having considerable success in the ongoing drive against fraud and abuse in social welfare. To add impetus to this campaign I have recently announced an amnesty from criminal prosecution and other penalties for persons or companies reporting irregularities in their dealings with the Department.  The amnesty will apply for the next three months, provided those concerned make arrangements to regularise the position.</P>
    <P>The amnesty gives people who may be defrauding the system a final opportunity to come clean and pay up what is due to the taxpaying public.</P>

      <P>The Government decisions on the Cullition report were set out in the document <i>Employment through Enterprise</i> published on 3 May 1993, copies of which were placed in the Library of the House and distributed to all Deputies.  These decisions cover a wide range of Government activity across different Government Departments and areas of Ministerial responsibility encompassing some 120 separate areas for specific action.  Many of these actions can be taken through normal administrative follow-up without recourse to legislation.  The appropriate approach will be a matter for each Minister with responsibility for the different areas of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my area of responsibility, I am moving immediately to introduce legislation to give effect to the Government decision on the industrial development and promotion agencies.  I have also recently signed on order setting out new regulations to increase the thresholds above which Ministerial approval for mergers is required.  The regulations already have statutory effect and will be <Col N="172" /> put before both Houses of the Oireachtas for resolution shortly.</P>

      <P>The information available in respect of working hours relates to the total hours worked including overtime.  There are no separate data available on overtime working.</P>
      <P>In relation to the proposed EC Directive on the Organisation of Working Time, the position is that the Council of Social Affairs Ministers reached political agreement on the proposals on 1 June, 1993.  However, before the directive can be finally adopted, the proposal, as agreed by the Council, must be submitted to the European Parliament for consideration. The Parliament's position, including any proposed amendments, will then be submitted to the Commission, which will resubmit the proposals to the Council for final adoption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="173" /> The existing text of the directive may be amended during this process.</P>
    <P>The proposed directive, which will apply to most employments, includes provisions on a range of working time issues such as maximum average weekly working hours, daily and weekly rest periods and annual leave and also includes special provisions in relation to night work.</P>
    <P>In relation to maximum weekly working time, the text of the directive, as it now stands, provides that the average working time, including overtime, for each seven-day period, averaged over a four month reference period, must not exceed 48 hours.  This four month reference period for averaging purposes may be extended to six months by legislation in certain circumstances and, in addition, may be extended to 12 months by way of collective agreement.</P>
    <P>Members states will have three years from the date of final adoption of the directive to implement its provisions. However, member states will have the option not to apply the maximum weekly working time provision, subject to a number of specific measures being introduced to ensure, among other things, (i) that an employer may not require an employee to work longer than 48 hours a week on average without his or her agreement to perform such work and (ii) that no worker is subjected to any detriment because he or she is unwilling to agree to perform such work.  This provision will be re-examined by the Council before the expiry of a period of ten years from the date of final adoption of the directive.</P>
    <P>The impact of the directive on reducing the level of overtime working will be dependent on a wide range of factors including, the provisions of the directive as finally adopted, the extent to which any individual worker might be working in excess of the permitted maximum average weekly working hours at the time of implementation of the provisions of the directive, and the extent to which the reference period for averaging the 48 hour week is extended by legislation or by collective agreements.</P>

      <P>In line with the Government decision on the Culliton report I propose to introduce legislation on the reorganisation of ports.</P>
      <P>The Government decision in respect of ports, as published, states that &ldquo;the Government accepts the need for the implementation of changes in the ports as perceived by the &ldquo;Culliton&rdquo; Group and advised by the &ldquo;Moriarty&rdquo; Task Force and it has decided already to establish twelve commercial State companies to manage and operate the twelve largest commercial ports&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The objectives of the proposed legislation are to provide the major ports of the State with more suitable organisational and administrative structures. This will result in ports being operated in a more efficient and effective fashion. This in turn will be reflected in reduced charges, better service and increased competition in and between the ports.</P>
      <P>The drafting of the proposed legislation, to be known as the Harbours and Pilotage Bill, is well advanced and the draft Bill will be circulated as soon as possible.</P>

    <P>Strict controls are maintained by the Department and by public bodies under its aegis of the level of overtime working. In general overtime is only granted in cases where work of an urgent nature cannot be postponed or deferred and where other staff are unavailable.  In all cases the number of overtime hours is kept to a minimum and would not in general reach such a level as to exceed <Col N="182" /> the maximum working week proposed under the EC Directive.  In addition certain activities, such as transport, work at sea and certain shift work arrangements will be exempted from the Directive.  The existing restrictions on overtime working together with the exemption of certain activities mean that the proposed EC Directive will have minimal impact on the Department and the public bodies under its aegis.</P>

      <P>At 08.30 hours on 28 May 1993 the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre of the Irish Marine Emergency Service was notified that a number of birds, coated with oil, had been washed up on the beach at Clogherhead, County Louth.  All the relevant Search and <Col N="183" /> Rescue &mdash; Pollution Control agencies were alerted.  Aircraft and shipping in the vicinity were asked to report any oil sightings.  An Air Corps Cessna aircraft and the UK Marine Pollution Control Unit carried out aerial surveillance. However, despite the intensive efforts made no trace of an oil slick was found nor no possible culprit identified.</P>
      <P>The circumstantial evidence point to the incident having been caused by an accidental or deliberate discharge of oil by a transiting ship.  The results of the surveillance operation indicate that the offending vessel was well out of range before the effects of the pollution came to notice.  Ireland pursues &ldquo;the polluter pays principle&rdquo; on the basis of which the culprit is required to pay for damage caused and clean up operations. Unfortunately, in this case those responsible for the travesty cannot be identified.</P>
      <P>Air surveillance of the Irish Sea is carried out by the UK and Irish authorities using sophisticated oil detection equipment. A Memorandum of Understanding with the UK authorities to formalise joint co-operation and assistance in the event of marine emergencies involving search and rescue and pollution control is being finalised at present.  The MARPOL Convention, which Ireland will shortly ratify, regulates the discharge of ships' waste at sea and the provision of facilities at ports for the handling of such waste.  As I have explained, however, the culprit in this case appears to have been a transiting vessel and not one calling to an Irish port.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, the EC Transport Council of Ministers adopted a Resolution outlining priority measures for a Community action programme on maritime safety and pollution prevention.  My main priority in this context is to press forward with comprehensive precautionary measures to protect the ecologically sensitive Irish coastline through the introduction of minimum exclusion zones for transiting tankers and other ships carrying dangerous cargoes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appointment of rangers is a matter for the Office of Public Works.  I understand, however, that the area in question <Col N="184" /> is covered by a ranger based in County Westmeath.</P>

      <P>The regulations governing the allocation of suckler cow quotas are Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2066/92 and Commission Regulation (EEC) No. 3886/92.  Regulation No. 2066/92 provides for suckler cow premium quotas to be based on the number of cows on which a producer was paid premium in one of the following reference years: 1990, 1991 or 1992.  Ireland has chosen 1992 as the reference year and this means that producers can claim suckler cow premium grants in 1993 and future years up to maximum of the number of suckler cows for which they were paid premium in 1992 less a deduction for the national reserve.</P>
      <P>This regulation also provides for the establishment of a national reserve equal to between 1 per cent and 3 per cent of the sum of the individual quotas allocated to producers and a special reserve equal to 1 per cent of the total of the individual quotas allocated to producers in the disadvantaged areas.  It is not possible to establish these quotas until applications for the suckler cow premium scheme submitted to my Department in November and December 1992 have been processed for payment.  My Department will also decide at a later date on the priority categories for the allocation of the reserve quotas and producers will then be invited to submit formal applications supported by appropriate documentary evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to on-farm inspections and validity checks, such checks have already been carried out on producers who qualify for a quota based on their application <Col N="185" /> in June 1992.  Applications submitted in November and December 1992 are currently being subjected to inspections and validity checks.  On-farm inspections and validity checks will be carried out on applicants for reserve quota.</P>

      <P>The first person named was paid the first, second and third instalments of his 1992 ewe premium scheme grants at the end of July 1992, mid-November 1992 and mid-March 1993, respectively, and his 1992 sheep headage scheme grant in mid-October 1992.  His 1992 cattle headage and suckler cow premium schemes applications were rejected when subjected to a computer validation check because one of the entries on the computer input document was incorrect.  The problem has been resolved and payment under both schemes will be made within the next forthnight.  He did not apply in the June-July or November-December applications periods for the 1992 special beef premium scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second person named withdrew his 1992 ewe premium and sheep headage schemes applications.  Further investigation is necessary to establish his eligibility <Col N="193" /> for grants under the 1992 cattle headage and suckler cow premium schemes as he has failed to produce the cattle identity cards for some of the cows for which he applied for headage and premium grants.  His application for June 1992 special beef premium scheme grants was delayed because of the cattle headage and suckler cow query described above but it was, however, paid at the end of May 1993.  He did not apply for grants in the November-December application period for the special beef premium scheme.</P>
    <P>The third person named was not an applicant under any of the 1992 sheep schemes.  He was paid part of his 1992 cattle headage and all of his suckler cow premium and June special beef premium schemes grants in early November, mid-November and early December 1992 respectively.  The balance of his 1992 cattle headage was paid in mid December 1992.  He did not apply for grants in the November-December application period for special beef premium scheme.  He was debarred from the 1990 and 1991 suckler cow premium scheme as he included in-calf heifers in his 1990 suckler-cow premium application.</P>
    <P>The fourth person named was not an applicant under any of the 1992 sheep schemes.  His applications for grants under the 1992 cattle and equines headage scheme and the suckler cow premium scheme cannot be approved as my Department is not satisfied that six of the ten animals on which grants were claimed as cows were actually cows at the date of application.  Unless he can produce satisfactory evidence that they were cows no grants can be paid under either scheme.  He was paid June 1992 special beef premium scheme grants in mid-November 1992.  He did not apply for grants in the November-December application period for this scheme.</P>
    <P>The fifth person named was not an applicant for grants under any of the 1992 sheep schemes.  Further investigation is necessary to establish his eligibility for grants under the 1992 cattle headage and suckler cow premium schemes as he did not present for inspection all the cows on <Col N="194" /> which he had applied for headage and premium grants.  He was paid June 1992 special beef premium scheme grants in mid-November 1992 and his November-December 1992 application is being processed and if found in order payment will be made as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The technical specification laid down by my Department for licensed MMDS systems require operators to comply with the safety guidelines laid down by the Non-Ionizing Radiation Committee &mdash; the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection since May 1992 &mdash; of the International Radiation Protection Association, IRPA, on the limits of exposure to radio frequency magnetic fields in the frequency range used by the operators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The limits which have been established by the IRPA are limits within which it is safe to work and live on the basis of all expert knowledge.  Furthermore these standards recognise that people can be <Col N="197" /> exposed to all sorts of radio communications transmitter signals 24 hours per day over a whole lifetime.  An independent assessment of the possible health impact of a transmitter outside Galway was carried out by the National Radiation Protection Board of the United Kingdom.  This study established that the level of signal from the transmitter in the worst case scenario would be at least 230 times lower than the safe guideline limits established by the IRPA.  Field tests carried out by the Department in respect of the same system confirmed that the exposure levels are in excess of thousands of time lower than the IRPA limits.</P>
    <P>Recent surveys of radiation levels at an MMDS transmitter site in Cork carried out by a division of EOLAS confirmed that emissions from the MMDS transmitter were well inside the IRPA guidelines.</P>

      <P>The position in regard to legislative proposals for implementation of the Government decisions on the recommendations of the Moriarty task force concerning the implementation of the Culliton report in respect of my area of responsibility is as follows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proposed legislative measures in the form of Statutory Instruments under the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1965, are at present being prepared in my Department for the purpose of transposing into Irish law EC Regulations concerning the single market in air transport <Col N="198" /> for passengers and freight which came into effect on 1 January 1993.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Government decision that competitive forces should operate efficiently to ensure that markets for goods and services function in the most effective way, it is intended to bring forward, as soon as possible, for consideration by the Government draft proposals to replace the Road Transport Act, 1932, with new provisions which would cater more effectively for the development of the bus industry and the needs of the travelling public.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Government decision on competition in the energy sector the Government has approved proposals for a major restructuring of the ESB to promote greater cost transparency and efficiency within the industry.  These proposals include the reorganisation of the ESB into five business units; the establishment of a central power purchasing function within the ESB; an end to ESB's monopoly on the sale of electricity and the introduction of a new regulatory framework.

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not available in terms of overtime hours worked.  However, the cost of overtime worked by staff of my Department during the 12 months of 1992 was £420,787.  This represents approximately 1.3 per cent of total payroll costs of £31.6 million in that period.  Overtime worked by staff of public bodies under the aegis of my Department is a matter for the day-to-day running of such bodies.</P>
      <P>At this early stage no major difficulties are foreseen in the implementation of the proposed directive on the organisation of working time.  However, it remains to be seen how reductions in overtime can be accommodated while maintaining operational services, particularly in shift work areas.</P>

      <Quest>the total number of hours of overtime worked, in the most recent 12 month period for which figures are available, by persons employed by his Department or by public bodies under the aegis of his Department; the proportion this represents of total man hours worked; and the impact the proposed EC Directive on working hours will have on reducing this level of overtime.</Quest>

      <P>The total number of hours of overtime worked by persons employed in my Department during 1992 was 5,800.  This represents less than 1 per cent of the total man hours worked.</P>
      <P>In so far as bodies under the aegis of my Department are concerned that is, health boards, voluntary hospitals, mental handicap agencies and so on, information on the number of hours of overtime worked is not readily available.</P>
      <P>It will not be possible to assess the precise impact of the proposed Directive on working time generally, including the level of overtime, until the Directive has been finalised and is implemented by national legislation.</P>

      <P>I am currently considering what representation the new Dublin county councils should have on the Eastern Health Board.  It is my intention that arrangements for such appointments will be included, with the agreement of my colleague the Minister for the Environment, in the local government Bill dealing with the establishment of the new counties.  In determining the representation to recommend to Government, I will be taking into account that this will be a short term interim arrangement pending the reorganisation of health structures in the Eastern Health Board area.  The latter issue will be addressed in the national health strategy which I will be publishing later in the year.</P>

      <P>The Youthreach programme for unqualified early school leavers is delivered jointly by my Department and the Department of Enterprise and Employment, through the vocational education committees and FÁS respectively.  New centres under the programme are established following examination of trends in early school leaving recorded on the social guarantee register and on the basis of feedback from FÁS and the vocational education committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is considered that there is a sustainable demand for the establishment of a Youthreach programme in a particular area, an approach should be made to the local vocational education committee.  I have no plans to extend the network of Youthreach centres in the education <Col N="222" /> sector during 1993.  However, any new demands could be examined in the context of the 1994 Estimates and the new round of EC Structural Funds.</P>

      <P>The approval of further remedial posts in a particular year is governed by the teaching resources available in that year.  An additional 86 remedial teachers are being appointed with effect from September 1993.  Decisions have now been taken on the allocation of these posts and the schools selected will be notified shortly.</P>
      <P>These appointments are being made on the basis of priority of need, following the collection of data from schools by my Department's Primary Inspectorate.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the schools mentioned by the Deputy have not been selected on this occasion.  However, I should point out that three of the new posts are being allocated to County Louth, resulting in a further 11 schools receiving the service. As a result of this allocation, 91 per cent of pupils in County Louth will have access to a remedial service.</P>
      <P>I will be keeping the question of further need in this area under review as part of a broader commitment to appoint 500 additional remedial teachers by September, 1996.  The needs of all schools, including the school mentioned by the Deputy, will be considered in this context.</P>

      <P>My Department has not issued regulations which require the removal of a student from a VPT programme after an absence of more than 15 days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may be referring to a circular which last issued in 1987 to schools advocating that the Department of Education <Col N="225" /> VPT certificate should not be issued to students who were absent from the programme for more than 20 days. This did not require the removal of a student from a programme and did not preclude the issue of other forms of certification.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the National Council for Vocational Awards (NCVA) in 1991 signalled a move away from participation-based certification for VPT towards the development of a national performance-based system operating to quality standards relevant to industry needs, with awards based on the outcome of assessment by programme providers operating to national criteria with external moderation.  The work of the NCVA will be progressed further through the Programme for a Partnership Government commitment to establish a National Education and Training Certification Board on a statutory basis for programmes within both the education and training sectors.</P>

      <P>However, these services are specialised and generally of a multi-disciplinary nature in relation either to the assessment of mental handicap or of severe emotional disturbance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to determine how a general psychological service for primary schools shoud be developed, pilot projects for a <Col N="233" /> psychological service have been established for primary schools in West Tallaght/Clondalkin and South Tipperary. I will consider the further expansion of this service in line with our proposal in the Programme for a Partnership Government following the examination of the report, expected earlier this year, of the independent evaluator appointed to review the operation of this pilot project.</P>
    <P>At second level, Department of Education psychologists are available to schools throughout the country to carry out assessments.</P>

Accordingly, school policy in relation to this issue is a matter for each board of management.</P>
    <P>I am aware that many educationalists attach considerable positive value to the wearing of school uniforms and also that uniforms can, provided appropriate arrangements are made, reduce expenses for parents.  However, in the final analysis, school authorities cannot insist on the compulsory wearing of a school uniform.</P>

      <P>I will be keeping the question of further need in this area under review as part of a broader commitment to appoint 500 additional remedial teachers by September 1996.  The needs of all schools, including the schools mentioned by the Deputy, will be considered in this context.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my replies to Dáil Questions Nos. 97 and 98, on 2 June 1993.</P>
      <P>There is no specific timescale yet for the establishment of this new school, but the needs of the area are being carefully monitored.  When detailed architectural planning is initiated inclusion of this project in the capital programme will be considered further in the light all relevant factors.</P>
