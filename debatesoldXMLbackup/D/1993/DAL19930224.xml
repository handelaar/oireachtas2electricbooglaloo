      <P>I have two questions to ask about legislation.  Will the Government introduce legislation so as to give open statutory authority to the health charges which it is surreptitiously sought to introduce in the budget?  Will the proposed Ethics Bill governing Members of this House deal with the use of Dáil privilege by Members who refuse information to a tribunal established by the House so that this issue can be dealt with here in the appropriate forum rather than in the courts?</P>

      <P>Is it the Taoiseach's intention to encourage Government backbenchers to table amendments to Bills such as the Finance Bill?  Given the propensity of Government backbenchers to put down parliamentary questions, this could have a serious effect at a later stage as almost half of all amendments are put down by the Government side, which indicates a lack of confidence in other Members.</P>

      <P>I received notice from your office this morning, Sir &mdash; a handwritten note, which reflects conditions in the House &mdash; informing me that an amendment was judged to be out of order.  Since this Bill proposes to amend the principal Act, the whole purpose of which was simply to set borrowing and share capital requirements and the manner in which the company would report to the Minister, it is difficult to understand why it is not in order to amend the Schedule of that Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We now come to amendment No. 1 in the names of Deputies Cullen and Richard Bruton. Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 are related and I suggest, therefore, that we discuss amendments Nos. 1, 4 and 5 together.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, paragraph (a), line 13, to delete &ldquo;&lsquo;£100,000,000&rsquo;&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;&lsquo;£82,500,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As I intimated on Second Stage, the funding the Minister proposes to make available to NET is too great and allows for a lack of responsibility on the part of the Department.  Problems will continue in this area and no decisions will be taken with regard to the future of NET.  That is very unsatisfactory.  Will the Minister explain how the £22.5 million share capital invested in the company will be used? How long will that funding be available to the company?  Will it be available for six months, 12 months, two, three or four years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>State guarantees are being increased from £180 million to £200 million, an increase of £20 million.  Again the funding being made available to NET is far too great in the context and allows for a lack of decision making.  I propose that the funding be reduced substantially, that an increase of £5 million be made available in terms of share capital and an increase of £7 million in terms of State guarantees.  That increase of £12 million would allow the company to overcome the difficulty we all accept exists at present.  The company would continue to <Col N="1320" /> be viable and would survive.  That sum would be sufficient for the company for at least another 12 months.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the Minister's colleague said last night in the debate on the gas Bill that the Culliton task force is examining the viability of the relationship between Bord Gáis Éireann and Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta and that a decision was awaited.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not refer to this in his speech and did not say it would be available to him in the next few months. Will he also comment on that?</P>
    <P>Concern has also been raised by published documentation which goes back to the relationship between NET and Irish Fertiliser Industries.  It was my understanding &mdash; and I am open to correction &mdash; that the assets of NET became the property of the new company, IFI, but when one looks at the figures in both companies, one finds that NET has retained assets of up to £132 million.  This does not make sense if the assets belong to IFI.</P>
    <P>Since NET's two main objectives are the management of their existing debts and the operation of their gas contract with BGE, is it fair to say that NET is depreciating all the plant which is fully available on some form of lease basis of £1 per annum to IFI in the Marino Point plant in Cork?  This does not appear as a depreciation charge in the IFI accounts and one can only conclude that it is under cost of sales.  If this is the case, it is obvious that there is massive subsidisation. When operating under Richardson Fertilizers, IFI, whose real beneficiary is ICI, was losing from £5 million to £6 million per annum.  Now they are making a profit &mdash; at least on paper &mdash; of £5 million.  It is easy to make a profit if you do not depreciate your assets and if there are no real costs.  IFI is benefiting greatly because NET is carrying all the costs.  Any reasonable businessman would be delighted to be involved in a deal of that magnitude because, no matter what they did, they would make a profit.  Will the Minister refer to this aspect of the deal?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael is happy to support this amendment, which is also down in our own name.  Its purpose is to show that the Dáil does not accept the notion of not questioning the continuous demands for extending loan guarantees and shareholding investments in NET. We have today a request for £40 million, between share capital and guarantees, for a shell company that operates debt. It seems there are other areas - Aer Lingus is a clear example - where the demand for equity is to create an ongoing viable business, but we are being asked to rubber stamp this situation.  It is clear the Minister is thinking of selling this company, or at least is considering it as a way of extricating the State from the problem.  If this is the case, then it is right that the Government should tackle the problem urgently and they should be obliged to come back to the Dáil if they are seeking more equity or share capital. Indeed, I would go further, there should be an obligation on the State to introduce relevant legislation if any change in the status of NET is envisaged.  However, this is beyond the remit of the Bill and would be ruled out of order.</P>
      <P>It is news to me that the Government is considering selling its shareholding in NET, because it was known that the other shareholder, ICI, was considering the same thing.  Is there a willing buyer? There was one, but it is no longer interested.  If that is the case, this request will be repeated for some years to come. What have we learned from this?  On the last occasion, the Minister told us that it did not matter because they were only paper transactions.  However, we are giving the green light today to £40 million of taxpayers' money, either by way of guarantee or share capital, for this operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A more sensible approach to this was advocated by the Culliton report and the National Planning Board proposals for the eighties which stated that if one took debt out of a State company in serious difficulty, it should be removed, wiped off and put back into Exchequer borrowing and the company left trading in a transparent, open market fashion.  This <Col N="1322" /> does not exist in the Bord Gáis-NET-IFI relationship.  There are most extraordinary pricing arrangements between them, to which the public are not privy and it is strongly believed that they are not on the basis of arm's length market arrangements.  It is also known that the NET price is well below what the ESB is paying, and, it is suspected, also below the IFI price.  There appears to be not only open investment of equity and loan guarantees into the shell company but also concealed subsidies given by other energy users and taxpayers to IFI.  The proper approach to this was that advocated many years ago.  Debt should be written off and absorbed by the Exchequer.  We should not create a distorted situation by taking money from one pocket and putting it into another or a third pocket and causing confusion as to whether there is social subsidisation and to whose benefit.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister describe in more detail the efforts in his Department to find a buyer for NET and how that will effect it in the long term?  At present, when the company has a bad year the taxpayer, as the lender of last resorts through NET shell, carries a substantial part of the losses.  We are carrying all the risks, and receiving few benefits.  What does the Minister think we have learned from this arrangement?  Why does he not feel that the simpler approach advocated by Culliton, where everything is clear and above board, is not more sensible?  Why are we not considering putting legislation in place to reinforce this approach?</P>
    <P>We indicated on the last occasion that the Culliton group have conservatively estimated the effective subsidy to be £250 million.  If one looked at other pricing available for the sale of gas that figure could be as high as £400 million in addition to sustained losses in NET of £212 million.  Those are enormous sums &mdash; £600 million in a company that employs 500 people.  What lessons can be learnt from this?  Why have we not come up with a more market related solution to these problems?  This would have been expected from the present Minister of <Col N="1323" /> State who has always advocated transparency in the manner in which the State conducts its business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies who quibble about the State guarantee to assist this company and who challenge the Minister's responsible approach to this matter, obviously have no idea of the situation on the ground or have no feel for the situation both in Arklow and Wicklow.  I have been involved with this company in the past and spent 17 or 18 years at senior management level.  I was responsible for the distribution of the product from the Cork and Arklow plants and I know exactly what this industry has meant to many parts of County Wicklow and Arklow, and many more in north Wexford and Cork.</P>
      <P>Since the rundown of NET, Arklow, the south Wicklow hinterland and the north Wexford area have been economically devastated.  The IDA put the problem in perspective by earmarking Arklow as one of the top three towns in the country requiring assistance in terms of job creation.  When one speaks, behind the scenes, with people involved in the IDA, they will state categorically that Arklow is one of their greatest problems. The problem is not only the company and the jobs lost following the rundown, it is also the spin-off situation.  CIE, private hauliers, shipping agents, dockers, sawmills, pallet manufacturers, engineering suppliers, plastic manufacturers, plastic bag manufacturers and many more spin-off beneficiaries benefited from the plant and the jobs that were there.  That is what the Minister has in mind and what he is examining.</P>

    <P>For over three decades our farmers have been assured of a constant supply of nitrogenous fertilisers, both straight nitrogen and compounds.  Without that guarantee they would have been in dire straits.  Without our own nitrogenous manufacturing unit in this country, agriculture would not have thrived as it did the last three decades.  Farmers would have been at the mercy of importers <Col N="1324" /> charging astronomic prices for the product.</P>

      <P>One of the points the Minister made &mdash; and it was a critical point in relation to the Bill &mdash; was the impact of the currency crisis.  It is having a major impact on business generally, quite apart from the outstanding debts of NET.  There is general agreement that the Government's handling of the currency crisis has been disastrous.  Would the Minister like to outline how the Government intends to reduce those interest rates which are having such a serious impact?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not support the amendment. Would Deputy Cullen explain why these particular figures were put forward? Deputy Cullen questioned the Minister's <Col N="1325" /> figures in relation to this Bill and he then produced his own figure and said he believed it to be the correct one.  He has made no attempt to explain to us why it is this figure and not another.</P>

      <P>The jobs in Aer Lingus are vital to this country but so are the jobs in Cork and Arklow.  We cannot afford to lose employment in these areas particularly now when the company is making a profit, and trying to provide a service and provide jobs on a secure <Col N="1326" /> basis.  Anybody who under-estimates the importance of that success is not living in the real world particularly when one views Cork &mdash; obviously I have a particular interest in Arklow &mdash; which has been a blight area for employment.  I am concerned about privatisation.  I understand that the Minister made a firm commitment that the workers could feel secure for the future but I do not believe, if this business is fully privatised, that the Minister can deliver on that commitment. This is an unrealistic commitment.  I would seek clarification in relation to the future of those jobs because we cannot afford to lose jobs in either Arklow or Cork.</P>
      <P>Finally, we are all here to represent constituencies.  I have heard Fine Gael and PD Deputies making special cases. They do not deserve to be criticised for that in any way.  I will be making special cases from time to time where I think there is merit for County Wicklow and east Kildare but there has to be consistency. The idea of criticising Deputies for that kind of special pleading is really nonsense when one considers that much of what we are doing is representing the people who elected us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I welcomed the Minister's statement that this Bill would secure the jobs in both Wicklow and Cork.  In his reply last week he said that the money being made available would ensure continued employment in both of these areas for the foreseeable future.  I welcome the swift action of the Minister in introducing this Bill to secure these jobs.  If the Department of Finance found it necessary to raise the share capital and the borrowing by £42 million, they would have looked very closely at this Bill to ensure that the money being made available was the minimum amount necessary to carry out the requirements under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I enter this House on a Tuesday, sometimes I find it strange to listen to Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats pleading on behalf of the Digital workers. I am delighted that so much concern is shown.  In that case, they maintained that <Col N="1327" /> the Government had not moved fast enough.  In this case where the Government has moved, there is something wrong.</P>
    <P>One of the first Bills brought into the House by this Government was enacted to maintain IFI and NET in operation. IFI has operated profitably over the past five years, since it was set up.  It has made profits of about £70 million.  The company deserves to be supported.  The IFI company is not responsible for the heavy debts being carried forward since the beginning of the operation of NET. IFI was brought into operation in 1987, and has carried out its business efficiently and with great sacrifice, because almost 1,000 people have lost their jobs in this operation since then.  The small amount that is been asked for under this Bill to maintain employement in IFI, so that NET, the holding company, can get on with managing its debt, is very welcome.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable to ask in what way the company will operate in the future.  Is it to be privatised?  I would be concerned if privatisation was part of the long term future for this company and I would resist it.  The argument against giving the amount required to ensure the continuance of this company does not make sense.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage Deputies Bruton and Cullen argued about the cost of producing a bag of fertiliser from NET, and asked about the agreement made between Bord Gáis Éireann and NET on subsidised gas.  It is reasonable to ask that question.  It was highlighted that if the gas was sold in the domestic market, Bord Gáis could get five times the price for it.  A very limited number of people benefit from the operation of Bord Gáis Éireann and it is reasonable that industry should be given preferential treatment in the gas contract.  I know that the city of Dublin and the domestic users of gas in Dublin got a very big subsidy against their costs for fuel, by having the ability to use gas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>If they had to buy turf, coal, timber or oil, as people in my constituency have to, they would be quite willing to pay six times the price that is being paid for gas by IFI.  This is a very limited operation where gas is available to very few areas here.  If one lives in rural parts of my constituency, one will find that the price of basic fuel is very expensive.  Consider the price of bottled gas for instance.  That is the only method for heating and domestic consumption in some rural areas.</P>
      <P>This Bill is urgent and timely.  If £42.5 million is required to continue the operation of the company, it would be very dangerous to accept this amendment.  I know the Minister will oppose it.  Certainly the people on these benches will oppose it also.</P>

Over the last couple of days we have heard them making much noise regarding jobs in other parts of Ireland, but they seem to have changed their stance with regard to this Bill.  What they are recommending in this amendment is something that will require a Minister to come in here in a year or two with another Bill giving funds to NET.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This is enabling legislation and if the Deputy was on this side of the House he would be arguing to give the Minister the powers to give the money if necessary.  I agree with Deputy Kavanagh, and the other Deputies on this side of the House, that this organisation deserves aid from the State.  There are about 1,000 jobs directly involved with IFI, both in Arklow and in Marino Point. It would be a shame if we were to close our eyes to the necessity to keep those people in jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothwithstanding that, transparency is something that should be taken into account.  The time must come when the operation of companies such as IFI is <Col N="1329" /> let stand alone, and the debts that were incurred prior to the setting up of IFI are moved aside, as Deputy Bruton said.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to look at this aspect of the NET set-up, because it is important for the workers to see that they are producing profits and that they are getting credit for same.  We do not need to have headlines in the papers, as we have had recently, that NET is losing millions and costing the Exchequer money.  That has a demoralising effect on the workforce.  At the moment voluntary redundancies are being requested by IFI both in Marino Point and in Arklow.  If funding is not made available to NET, we will have more redundancies in those areas that have been very badly struck by unemployment over the last number of years.  I welcome the Minister's proposals. It is wise to give him the enabling power to provide the funding if necessary. The amendment is only a quibbling one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. S. Brennan) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. S. Brennan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies opposite for tabling their amendments, because it gives us an opportunity to discuss the future of the company.  The purpose of the relevant provisions of the Bill is to increase the share capital of the company from its existing £77.5 million to £100 million on the share capital side, and we do that by the issue of shares.  That permits the Minister for Finance, after he has consulted with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, to take up these shares which would not exceed £100 million.  It is an enabling provision.  The actual amount of new capital which will be subscribed by the Minister for Finance this year or in the following years will be a matter for the Minister to decide, after consulting the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  That will be done in the light of the company's needs, and, indeed, the priorities of the Exchequer at that time.  It does not mean that we are giving the company £42 million.  It means that, if the House passes the legislation, the relevent Ministers are enabled to provide £42 million &mdash; that is the Minister <Col N="1330" /> for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>
      <P>NET borrowings have now reached £180 million and it is faced with insolvency, in a technical sense, unless further support is provided now.  Its projections show that if the abnormally high interest rates persist, this requirement could be as high, for 1993, as perhaps £15 million. The amendments presented to me today would allow the relevant Ministers to provide £12 million which would be less than the projections of the company for the current year, so there is an immediate problem here.  The projections, incidentally, are less than £15 million, but our estimates are that they could go as high as £15 million on current interest rates.  It depends on current interest rates and other volatile factors such as exchange rates.  There is also the more deep-rooted problem that a proportion of NET's debt is a sunk cost and cannot be recovered, at least not within the normal income stream of the company.</P>
      <P>Over the five years to September 1992, NET had to service borrowings of some £176 million over the period, from income which proves in retrospect to have been insufficient.  It is only sufficient to service borrowings of £144 million whereas the borrowings were £176 million. This was the cause of the growth in NET's guaranteed borrowings over five years.  In seeking this legislation I have decided to address not only the immediate threat to NET's solvency but also to provide the enabling mechanisms to allow us to continue to address the situation over the next few years.  The Bill seeks to provide for the restructuring of NET's finances which it is important to undertake at this stage.  I will be having discussions with NET about the restructuring of their finances and this Bill is the first step in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December last, in order to keep the company afloat it was necessary to provide a grant of £6 million by way of Supplementary Estimate.  This money is already used up but it may be considered in any restructuring of finances to make the appropriate arrangements to effectively capitalise this sum.  I will also discuss <Col N="1331" /> this with the company.  This would reduce the new moneys which could be advanced to the company under the increased share capital arrangements proposed in the Bill to £16.5 million.</P>
    <P>The effect of the proposed amendment tabled by the Deputies would be to restrict the enabling mechanisms and increase the maximum additional money which can be put into the company on the capital side by as little as £5 million, and on the guarantee side by as little as £7 million, which is a total additional amount of £12 million.  As I have already mentioned, depending on interest rates the amount this year could go as high as £15 million.</P>
    <P>While this might be partly addressed by Deputies' proposals, I believe it is insufficient given the scale of the problem. It is practical, therefore, to reject amendments Nos. 1, 4, and 5 which seek to limit the share capital and the amount the Minister may subscribe to £82.5 million. It is not my normal philosophy to throw money at companies but this is a practical business problem and has to be dealt with in a practical way.  There are real debts and interest bills to be met and trying to deal with it in an <i>ad hoc</i> way will not solve the problem.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 2 is to increase the company's borrowings from £180 million to £200 million.  The power of the Minister to guarantee borrowings is covered by section 7 of the NET Act itself and the guarantee is extended to both principal and interest.  Unlike most State companies operating in the commercial sphere, NET's activities are now extremely limited.  As I mentioned the last day, it is a holding company and its main activities are the management of a gas contract and its borrowings.</P>
    <P>While the parameters governing NET are fixed, NET's room for manoeuvre is very limited.  It depends on very volatile factors such as oil prices, the dollar-punt exchange rate, fertiliser profits from an independently run subsidiary and interest rates.  If its income is inadequate to meet the interest on its borrowings and its cash resources are used up, the only option <Col N="1332" /> left is to call in the State guarantee.  The extension of the guarantee limit will provide extra leeway for rolling over debt and enabling the calling in of guarantees to be avoided.  The amendment tabled by the Deputies would reduce the increase sought in the guarantee limit to £7 million. This would not provide anything more than an immediate and very short respite with the possibility of further legislation very soon.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas is kept informed of NET's guarantee situation as statements detailing the guarantees are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas at the end of each year.  In seeking this legislation I wish to provide for the solvency of NET over the next few years, while at the same time maintaining some flexibility within budget constraints with regard to the funding of NET through equity.  The amendment proposed would not allow this and I therefore ask the House to reject amendment No. 2.</P>
    <P>In regard to the amendments, I accept the bona fides of the Deputies and I understand and have some sympathy for their position.  They do not wish to throw money at the problem.  As Deputy Ahern said, it is unusual for a Government to want to give out money and for an Opposition to wish to restrict it.  It is usually the reverse.  Anyone familiar with my legislative and policy record in recent years will know that I would be extremely reluctant to sign State cheques for State companies without very good reason. There is very good reason in this case because very important jobs are to be protected.  There is no blank cheque to NET in this legislation.  There are present limits which I want to increase by £42 million as a enabling measure and which the amendments want to limit to £12 million, which would be insufficient.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank Deputy Kavanagh for his support for the legislation.  I agree with the Deputy that a great number of workers have made sacrifices and it would be a pity to lose all that by not seeing this problem through.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus is concerned with the protection of the jobs in the plant and, to a lesser extent, privatisation.  As <Col N="1333" /> a shareholder the State has always to hold the sale option.  If it automatically rules out that option, then it is never really in the marketplace and accepts many things which are not sensible for the company to accept.  That does not mean that any decision is being taken to sell NET's stake in IFI.  There are no proposals to do that at the moment.  I have to tell the House that I regard it as weapon and as an option which any sensible shareholder will always retain and continue to study, to see whether it is in the better interests of the State and the workers to dispose of shares held by the State or to continue to hold them.</P>
    <P>A strategic study of the fertiliser industry, the cost to the State and the security of the jobs is needed before deciding on the future of the State's holding in IFI.  I reiterate that IFI is a profitable, successful company and it is my duty to continue to stress that NET is a separate holding company which holds the State's share in IFI.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will respond to that question in a moment.  It is important for workers to understand that IFI is separate and successful.  NET is a holding company which manages debt and is not a trading company.  If the workers in IFI felt they were locked into the NET box, as it were, it would undermine their confidence which would be a pity because they run a very successful company and it is important that they understand that. Incidentally, I agree with Deputy McManus in regard to TDs' rights for special pleading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us have duties and responsibilities, nationally, but we are each elected by people in our consituency and while we do not have to <Col N="1334" /> blindly repeat in a glib fashion what they ask us to do, we do have a responsibility to bring to the attention of the nation particular problems in our constituencies that sometimes seems to be against the national interest.  That circle has to be squared at Government level and I would stand over the rights of Deputies to plead for industries and problems in their area.</P>
      <P>I want to thank Deputy Jacob for his support for this legislation.  Deputy Bruton asked me if I would again expand on the sale option.  I have said that I regard it as just that &mdash; an option which I will continue to study.  I do not rule out a further study of whether it is more sensible to hold onto those shares or whether it is more sensible to offer them on the marketplace.</P>
      <P>In answer to the Deputy's question on depreciation, which Deputy Cullen is interested in, under the joint venture agreement, NET leases the Marino Point plant to IFI at a nominal rent.  While NET has retained the legal ownership to it, IFI has the legal right to purchase the plant for a nominal sum on 31 December 1999.  IFI pays the insurance costs and the rates at the Marino Point plant but &mdash; the Deputy is correct in this &mdash; NET charges the £10 million or so depreciation costs in its account.  The main reason for this arrangement is to ensure maximum dividends for NET. If IFI's profits are reduced by having to carry the depreciation, then the dividends to NET and ICI are correspondingly reduced, so both ICI and NET get a better dividend from IFI, so it enhances the dividend from IFI.</P>
      <P>Where the depreciation is carried is a matter of judgment.  It could all be charged on IFI but that would show a worse picture in IFI.  Two companies would them have problems instead of one.  Perhaps the better way to proceed at this stage is to confine the problems to NET.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must cast his mind back to the debates in this House in 1987 when there was near panic trying to find a joint venture partner.  A very sensible arrangement was arrived at.  The State had to give a lot but it got a lot.  It got ICI on board and it is one of the finest companies in the world.</P>
      <P>All matters, including this matter, relating to the joint venture are covered by legal shareholder agreements which were signed, sealed and delivered at the time of the formation of the joint venture. The arrangements relating to the Marino Point plant were agreed at that time.  The advantage to NET for carrying its depreciation on its books is that it gets a higher dividend.  It is not a complete £10 million write-off.  ICI also gets a higher dividend because the depreciation is not being carried there directly.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should cast his mind back to the near panic atmosphere of trying to put together a deal at that time when this House was faced with choosing between allowing close-downs on the scale we may be facing in Galway now, or else putting together the joint venture arrangement. It is not a deal which would be arranged in commercial peace time but it is certainly a good deal in commercial wartime.  It was the best that could be done at the time.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton asked me about publication of the gas price.  The consequences of publishing the gas price would, in our view, be commercially damaging to IFI.  IFI is one of our largest indigenous manufacturing companies.  It operates in a fiercely competitive European market, dominated by major multinationals who use their muscle to increase market share.  The gas price is the major cost component in the production of ammonia from which most of IFI's fertilisers and industrial chemical output is manufactured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Knowledge of a competitor's cost base is the essential information needed to attack that competitor's market.  That simply means knowing how far one company must push selling prices down to put the other company out of business. <Col N="1336" /> IFI would not have this information about its competitors.  In any event it would be less useful where the competitor is a dominant multinational with plans spread over different countries, and possibly one activity or business used to cross-subsidise others.  This is regarded as sensitive information in relation to IFI and they take the view that it would be tantamount to handing over their markets to their foreign competitors.</P>
    <P>We could consider putting the accounts of subsidiaries of NET before the Oireachtas but this does not happen in other State companies.  To my knowledge no other State company such as ESB or Aer Lingus, is required to lay subsidiary accounts before the Dáil.  Personally, I am uncomfortable with this.  I have argued strongly for transparency in all the Departments I have had the honour to serve in.  However, the future of those jobs must come first.  If it is IFI's view that the gas price and the gas deal is commercially sensitive information which can really only help their competitors, then why shoot ourselves in the foot?</P>
    <P>Most sensible economists can probably work out the deals anyway.  Perhaps the competitors know the deal.  That is a difficult problem to resolve, because it could be argued that if they know anyway, why not give the information out, or on the other hand, if they already have the information, what is the point in giving it out? If the companies make the point that it is commercially sensitive and that confirming it legally and formally would be tantamount to undermining them, then on balance we have a hard enough struggle in this country to hold onto jobs without being so bold as to shoot ourselves in the foot in that regard.  I am convinced there is nothing to hide there.  The amounts involved can be worked out and I am sure the competitors have already tried to do so.  I am convinced that we should stop short of confirming it to them, there is no need to do that.</P>

      <P>I know we are very constrained by time so I will be brief.  In my view this Bill is not really about jobs <Col N="1337" /> in IFI.  As the Minister rightly said, IFI is profitable because it is getting a favourable price for its gas and because NET has written off the plant and given it to IFI <i>gratis</i>.  The company is returning profits.  What I am proposing does not in any way jeopardise those jobs.  The Minister rightly said that anyone with a sharpened pencil could work it out.  I have not had the time to do so, but we know what the dividends of IFI are, we know what Bord Gáis gets for the gas, we know what NET receives &mdash; the Minister has published a figure which shows that NET has received £70 million from IFI. The information is all there.  The only people who do not have the information are the taxpayers and other energy users. Potential creditors are not in the dark about it.</P>
      <P>This debate today is about democratic control.  We just do not know what is going on in this company and we are expected to come into this House every second or third year to underwrite more share capital and guarantee more loans. The planning group some years ago recommended that where a debt is to be paid for a company, it should be done cleanly, the company should be told that the debt has been paid and that it is up to them to get on with the operation of the company.  In this case we have paid the debt but we have not made that clearcut. The company is not operating in a proper, transparent way.  The Minister's instincts are right and his advice is wrong. He should stick to his instincts and say these matters should be above board.</P>
      <P>The issue of democratic control also comes in in regard to the proposed privatisation of this company.  It is not satisfactory that we might discover some day that this company, for which we have provided share capital and loan guarantees, year after year, has suddenly been sold off.  That is not acceptable.  It is not in accordance with the terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> It is not in accord with what this House should do in relation to companies that the State owns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the real future for IFI when the gas interconnector comes into being? <Col N="1338" /> Is it not true that the price of gas will rise to at least three times what IFI are now getting from NET, when the gas interconnector comes into being in 1999?  How will this company cope then?  The year 1999 is not aeons away.  These are issues which we should be addressing in this debate.  We should have a proper debate and we should let the Oireachtas Joint Committee on semi-State bodies examine the way in which we are heading.</P>
    <P>If the Minister can produce figures to show that what we suggest by way of cash will not last a year, I can accept that it is not viable to press those amendments. However, I believe the Minister should give a commitment that this matter will not be put away in a box for three or four years to be forgotten about.  If that happens, the Minister will come back and we will have another debate of this nature, again in the dark, with talks of share capital to be pumped in and more loan guarantees.</P>
    <P>We really do not know anything about the success or failure of this company.  I find that totally unsatisfactory.  Is it doing well?  Is the State getting a good deal for its shareholding and what are the options?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on his forthrightness in handling this debate.  I appreciate the contribution he has made and the honest way in which he made it.  At the outset, I wish to make it clear that I am not against the workers in Arklow, Wicklow, Cork or anywhere else.  Each Deputy has the right to speak on behalf of his or her own constituents and my two colleagues Deputy Cox and Deputy Quill as Deputies from Cork, are only too aware of the situation.  However, I would be failing in my duty if I was not to come into this House to ask difficult questions and analyse the answers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to Deputy McManus, it is quite clear I am not taking an idealogical view when my views on Aer Lingus are considered.  I am looking at these issues on a case by case basis, which is a responsible attitude.  What this exercise is really about is to examine the scarce resources of the State and to try to maximise them <Col N="1339" /> in order to tackle the huge unemployment problem of 300,000 people.  In this context we need to look at the funding and assets that are available.  For example, are we getting the best value in return for our investments in NET?</P>
    <P>The world market is over-supplied in the context of fertilisers.  With the investment of major players in the fertiliser industry in Eastern Europe and the volume that can be produced there at a very low price it is going to continue.  It is unlikely that IFI will make a profit this year.  The Minister did not refer to that when he spoke about the requirement of £15 million, he simply spoke about interest charges.  Is this because the outlook, even in the current year, may be fairly bad, given world market prices?</P>
    <P>Secondly, 40 per cent of the fertilisers produced by IFI are being exported, so the Irish taxpayer is subsidising farmers in other countries throughout the world. I did not realise that 40 per cent of the production of the plants &mdash; and I am referring specifically to Arklow and Cork, I am not including the plant in the North &mdash; is being exported.  I am not against exporting and the revenue that it earns, but I am concerned about the massive subsidisation by the Irish taxpayer of farmers in other countries who are utilising these products.  It would be remiss of me if I did not put these questions to the Minister and ask for answers.</P>
    <P>To compare Digital with the Bill before us is disingenuous to say the least.  In terms of the investment of taxpayers' money, the position of the two companies is not comparable.  The figure I propose in my amendments was not pulled out of the sky.  I examined the enabling legislation for this company over the past number of years and I believe it was fairly reasonable to work out the type of moneys made available on each occasion, what the money was required for and how long it actually lasted the company. I believe it is a fair assessment to suggest that £42.5 million is about a three to four year run, nothwithstanding the exceptional interest charges which the Minister has outlined.  These are hypothetical at <Col N="1340" /> this stage and one can only make a guess at them.  I want the Department of Enterprise and Employment to come back into the House, through the Minister, to discuss, on a much wider footing, the future of this industry.  The situation should not arise whereby we will not hear a word about it for another three years at which point the pressure will be even greater.</P>
    <P>Finally I ask the Minister to advise us what life is left in the plant in Cork?  Are there four or five years left in it?  If the lifetime left in that plant is only another five or six years will further massive State investment be required to bring the plant up to capacity to be competitive in the years ahead?  There has been no reference made to this point at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 56:</P>
      <P>In page 23, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(h) take such measures as are necessary to limit noise pollution from a road, including the provision of adequate boundaries, walls and the provision where necessary of noise resistant windows and doors for houses affected by noise pollution from a road&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments deal with the effect of noise pollution from a road.  They have been prompted &mdash; and the Minister on Committee Stage indicated some sympathy with the thinking behind them &mdash; by the noise local people have experienced where new roads are being constructed. For example, in my own constituency, this has become a major problem.  The Shankill-Bray by-pass was constructed at considerable public cost, something in the order of £25 million was spent on it.  It runs very close to some dwellings in a number of areas, New Vale, Assumpta Park and Crinken Glen in Shankill, Parknasilla in Loughlinstown and Fassaroe in Bray.  Many of those houses are badly affected by noise pollution. One particular house is a mere 90 feet from the edge of the road and the occupants have repeatedly pointed out that their whole life has been transformed. Prior to the construction of the Shankill-Bray by-pass their house backed onto green fields and agricultural land, and it is now backing onto a major motorway.  At various hours of the morning, such as 4 a.m. and 5 a.m. convoys of trucks travel to and from Rosslare and they are woken by the noise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county council, of which I am a member, has examined this problem on a number of occasions and carried out a noise survey.  The survey established that there are no standards in this country with regard to noise pollution.  In the UK, a standard exists whereby remedial action is taken if the level of noise exceeds 68 decibels.  Although there are no specific standards here the Department <Col N="1342" /> of the Environment seem to regard in a loose way the British standard as the norm.  No official standard has been adopted in this country with regard to noise pollution from a motorway.</P>
    <P>A number of houses were tested for the effect of noise and it was found that several of them exceeded the 68 decibel limit.  The Department of the Environment took the view that the only houses that could be dealt with or where compensation could be paid were those where a compulsory purchase order had been made on land.  In one case a slice of a garden was taken for the construction of the motorway and it was possible for the Department of the Environment to provide funding for double glazing for windows and doors at that dwelling.  No compensation was available to those people whose land was not taken by compulsory purchase but who were as near, or in one case nearer, to the road.</P>
    <P>The county council has sought funding for some time from the Department of Environment for double glazing for a limited number of houses that are badly affected by noise in that area.  So far the Department has turned down the application for funding for a number of reasons.  First, because there is no noise standards here and the impact of noise is apparently not taken into account except in a very general way.  Secondly, the standards that appears to be applied is the UK standard and I would argue that it is inappropriate to this country.  Thirdly, the only compensation that can be paid is in cases where there has been a compulsory purchase order.  This issue is becoming increasingly urgent in this area because it is proposed to link the Shankill-Bray by-pass with another motorway. The proposed junction between the south-eastern motorway and the Shankill-Bray by-pass is precisely at the point where these houses are located and it seems to me that it will not be possible to secure an agreement on the junction unless the problem of noise abatement has been addressed.</P>
    <P>The purpose of these amendments is to require the National Roads Authority and the Minister for the Environment to <Col N="1343" /> make provision for noise abatement at the stage when a road is being designed and constructed.  I am also using this opportunity to appeal to the Minister to make immediate provision to deal with the noise problem that already exists.  I have cited an example in my constituency and I know that there are a small number of other cases where there is a similar problem.  I appeal to the Minister to address the situation.  It is not good enough that people's lives are completely transformed and disrupted by the noise that emanates from a motorway.  They are built at very considerable cost and the very least that can be done is for some provision to be made for those limited number of households who are badly affected by noise.  The provision of double glazing, screenplanting, walls and so on have the effect of drowning out the noise which comes from a motorway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Gilmore that this is a problem which requires a good deal more attention than it has received to date.  It is an area where possibly because our population density is lower than in most other countries in the European Community very little attention has been paid to it, but it is becoming a matter of major importance.  If one takes a trip along any of the major improved sections of our national roads, especially along the Naas by-pass and several others which are in gestation or are being built at the moment, one will notice that there are many dwellings that are now quite near to the new roads. Previously these were in the heart of the countryside which was very quiet.  In addition in a number of towns around the country where major road improvements were carried out or where by-passes were constructed, there are areas of the towns that were previously backwaters in terms of traffic, but which now have large volumes of traffic passing very close to them. That kind of change in the environment is very substantial for people living in those areas who have been used to nothing louder than the odd car or lorry <Col N="1344" /> passing.  They are now in a position where heavy traffic passes by, for 16 hours a day.  That is in rural areas, but in urban areas the problem is much greater.  It can be a major change for people who have been used to living in quite areas for years.  It can sometimes be very distressing and it can have both psychological and physical effects on people which is something our road designers should bear in mind.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Gilmore pointed out, there are no noise standards in this country.  It was a matter of great regret to me that when the Environmental Protection Agency Bill was debated, the Government side quite seriously put it to the House that there was no way of dealing with this problem.  I invite the Minister to consider the current state of knowledge on the damage that noise can cause. For example, it has been proven scientifically that if people are exposed for any length of time to unusual noise, even at very low frequencies, it can have an ill-effect on their health.  A person can be killed by exposure over a period of time, to strong low frequency noise.  People can be literally driven out of their minds by a lengthy exposure to high frequency noise.  Noise affects people's physical and mental health and we should take whatever measures are available to offset the detrimental effects of noise.  The science of noise reduction is not an arcane science by any means.  There are many techniques available to road builders.  The Minister need look no further than North County Dublin where there is an ongoing debate about noise reduction for people living in the vicinity of the new runway at Dublin Airport and its surrounding roads.  That is a fruitful source of inspiration to deal with this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section specifies the factors which the authority may direct roads authorities to take into account when operating roads.  The purpose of this amendment is to include noise among those factors.  The amendment does not require strict standards. It proposes that measures be taken as they become necessary.  If we had a comprehensive understanding of the <Col N="1345" /> effects of noise the amendment could be more specific.  Eventually we may have to introduce such an amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore discussed the effects of noise from new road construction in urban areas.  As more roads are built and more towns are by-passed the problem of noise will occur more often.  Even if this amendment is accepted, at a later stage it may be necessary to define more precisely what kind of noise levels should be permitted and what levels should be avoided.  This is a reasonable amendment to deal with a problem which we can ignore no longer, given the higher density of population and progress we hope to make on new road construction.</P>

      <P>We are aware of the difficulties for the people of Shankill caused by their proximity to the Shankill-Bray by-pass where noise pollution is a real problem.  The Minister should examine this amendment not only from the legislative point of view but also in the context of what can be learned from people's experience.</P>
      <P>There will be much controversy about the junction of the south eastern motorway and the Shankill-Bray by-pass unless we deal with the problem of noise.  People will rightly object to roads being built near them if, as a result, they will be victims of noise pollution and the legislation should anticipate that.  Having read the Special Committee Stage of this Bill I thought the Minister would look favourably on this amendment but nothing has happened in the interim.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Browne <i>(Wexford)</i>, to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the arguments being made for this amendment. The Minister of State and myself frequently travel on the Shankill-Bray <Col N="1346" /> by-pass and Newtownmountkennedy by-pass.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>We are aware of the volume of traffic on those by-passes but that volume of traffic previously went through the town of Bray and the village of Newtownmountkennedy.  The removal of noise pollution in those areas has been a great benefit to them.  Bray has become a pleasant place again and the removal of commuter traffic from Shankill has resulted in more road space for local inhabitants.  The number of people now affected by noise pollution is very small and it should not require an amendment to a Bill to provide double glazing for the few houses requested. That should be provided through the funding of these roads.  I am sure there are EC standards for noise levels that apply throughout the Community.  We should get an opinion on whether the standards are applied through the transport commission area or in the social affairs area and adopt them as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The Foxrock motorway was completed when I was Minister for the Environment and it may still be the most expensive road constructed in this or any other country.  I think a sum of £4 million was spent on less than a mile of roadway. When driving on that road one can see that expensive walls were built on either side because the people of the area, who are not short of a bob, could use considerable influence to ensure that the project was properly finished.  On the Shankill-Bray by-pass one will notice the effects of cutbacks; there is no central median safety barrier and little has been done for the people who live nearby although few people live in close proximity to the by-pass compared with the number on the previous route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should not oppose this amendment.  He should complete the work in the area and ensure that the huge expense of by-passes, which are three quarters subsidised by EC funds, is not a total cost on the State.  I hope the Minister <Col N="1347" /> will accept that the privacy of people's homes has been invaded.  If some of the leisure developments in the Shankill area were being built now the route would be taken into account and the Department would provide double glazing where necessary.  It is a small cost.  I hope the Minister will refer the issue back to the Department, investigate it and do something for the various localities.  Fassaroe, which is in my constituency, is close to the by-pass.  Dún Laoghaire Corporation has discussed constructing bridges in that area and I do not understand why this proposal was turned down.  The Minister should consider reviewing both the safety aspect of the Bray-Shankill by-pass and the noise pollution created for a few homes in that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to comment briefly on this amendment.  I look forward to the Minister's contribution given that he said on Committee Stage that he would look at the issue in detail between now and Report Stage.  I wonder what progress has been made.</P>
      <P>We should broaden the debate from a discussion of local concerns of the constituencies of Dún Laoghaire, Wicklow and Wexford, which seem to prevail in the House at present&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;lest the message go from the House that we are dealing merely with an east coast problem.  I am sure the Minister will concede, as did my colleague from Kildare, that we are talking about vast areas in the country. This is a national issue given the vast improvements to many of our arterial roads over the past decade and the potential for future improvements as EC funds come on stream.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is the Minister opposed to this amendment?  There has been considerable and probably sufficient amplification from this side of the House as to its merits.  I would like to hear why the Minister is refusing to accept it, if indeed he is.  He nodded about ten minutes ago <Col N="1348" /> to the effect that he was not prepared to accept it.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with major legislation on roads.  It is some time since we enacted such legislation and without doubt it will be a considerable period before we have further amending legislation.</P>
    <P>The title of the Bill specifies that we are dealing with matters connected with the construction and maintenance of roads as well as the setting up of the long awaited National Roads Authority.  If the Minister looks at the amendment he will see that it is merely an enabling amendment empowering the National Roads Authority &mdash; if if sees fit &mdash; to introduce measures to deal with this problem.  Are we to accept that we do not have a problem of the type envisaged by the amendment? Deputy Kavanagh, a former Minister, has stated that we do not have any regulations, that we are unsure of the position regarding the European Community and certain directives.  I ask the Minister to clear up this point before we end the debate on this amendment.</P>
    <P>Do we have noise pollution regulations? Do we have a problem of the type referred to by Deputies on this side of the House?  If so, what is the Minister going to do to alleviate the hardship and suffering of people living on the fringes of metropolitan areas?  This is a very important amendment and is one that the Minister should not dismiss lightly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> As one who travels that road five days a week, twice a day, I appreciate that Dublin County Council provided the Shankill-Bray by-pass to shorten my travelling time to Wexford.  I listened carefully to the contributions in the debate.  I felt the environmental impact assessment procedures in sections 50 and 51 of the Bill was the appropriate mechanism to deal with measures to avoid, reduce and, if possible, remedy any significant environmental effects of a proposed road development.  It is true that we have no noise standards in this country, we have operated, to a certain extent, the UK standard requirements.  The Shankill <Col N="1349" /> area was the subject of a Dáil question yesterday; obviously there are problems there and some have been addressed with the Eastern Health Board.  I understand that noise levels in excess of the UK standard were recorded at only two properties and that these have been satisfactorily dealt with.  Applying these standards to the whole country would have serious financial consequences. However, we could agree to ask the departmental officials to examine this problem before the Bill is sent to the Seanad to see what measures can be taken to deal with the concerns expressed here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing here with two issues.  First, we are including specific provisions in the legislation with regard to the design and construction of future roadways and we are seeking to include in the legislation that specific recognition be given to the noise dimension.  I know the Minister has stated that account can be taken of this in the environmental impact study.  However, the main impact of road construction on people who live nearby is noise pollution and it is sufficiently serious to merit specific recognition.</P>
      <P>Second, we are using the opportunity to ask the Minister to address a specific problem as it affects more people living near a road already constructed.  From the point of view of the Department's own road plans, there is an anticipated additional problem with regard to a proposed junction in an area which is already badly affected by noise.  It is in everybody's interest, the people who live nearby, the local authority and the Department, to deal with this issue speedily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister of State responded positively towards the case made to him.  What concerns me is that the Minister, Deputy Smith, on Committee Stage, responded in a similarly positive vein.  I do not have the Committee Stage report in front of me, but I recollect he undertook to have this issue considered before Report Stage and I <Col N="1350" /> had hoped it would have been addressed by now.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the two properties where the noise level exceeded the UK limit of 68 decibels.  The only people who have been compensated have been those whose land was subject to a compulsory purchase order.  My understanding is that compensation is only allowable under the existing legislation and regulations under which the Department is operating.  Would the Minister confirm that the only people to whom compensation may be paid arising from the construction of a road are those whose land has been acquired by compulsory purchase?  Would the Minister explain, in general terms if possible, how he proposes getting around that?  Does it require legislation?  If so, we should deal with it now as we are discussing the Road Bill rather than deferring it to a future date.  The people concerned are looking for a solution to the problem.  They want less noise in their living room.</P>
    <P>What we need to address is how that is going to be achieved.  The case has been made <i>as nauseam</i> for the past two years.  There must be a large file on this issue in the Department between the case which was made by the local authority and the case made by individual Members of the House asking for this problem to be addressed.  The Minister is now saying he wants us to wait and he might deal with it between now and the Bill being debated in the Seanad.  I would ask him, does it require legislation, does it require some change in regulations, and, specifically, is he considering some material means of providing relief for those households who are already affected by noise?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> It is true, as Deputy Gilmore has said, that compensation is only payable to property owners where property is compulsorily acquired and in such cases compensation in default of agreement is determined by arbitration under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment Compensation) Act, 1919. However, there is scope to carry out other works such as building walls, tree <Col N="1351" /> planting, installing lights, and other solutions to problems.  I give Deputy Gilmore an assurance that our Department will look seriously at the problem which exists as well as the concerns expressed by various Deputies.  Time will obviously be needed to see what solution, if any, can be put forward to resolve the problem the Deputy mentioned.  I am aware of similar problems with new stretches of roadway in my own county so, obviously, I have the same concerns as other Deputies.  The Department will report back and see what solutions, if any, can be found.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to be rude to the Minister, and I will wait to hear what he says to the Seanad, but may I remind him of what occurred on Committee Stage.  In concluding on this amendment on Committee Stage, the Minister, Deputy Smith said, and I quote from column 184 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>I will be as sympathetic as possible to whatever proposals are made and the Deputy will have time to consider my reaction before Report Stage.</P>
      <P>That was to Deputy Gilmore.  The Minister had previously made a number of comments about the noise problem.  For example, on Report Stage at column 181 of the Official Report, he said:</P>
      <P>Local authorities have been given greater powers in the Environmental Protection Agency Act to deal with noise.  However, it is envisaged that the provisions of the Act will deal mainly with fixed source noise.</P>
      <P>By and large, the provision of the Environmental Protection Agency Act will not cover traffic noise because that is not fixed source noise.  The Government seems to have ruled out recourse to the Environmental Protection Agency Act provisions to deal with this problem, so we are back to the Roads Bill as being the only source of dealing with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister then spoke about the Road Traffic Construction Equipment and Use of Vehicles Regulations, 1963 <Col N="1352" /> which, apart from requiring silencers to be fitted to cars, provide that vehicles should not be driven so as to cause excessive noise.  I do not know whether there is a Member of this House or anybody outside it who can consciously and deliberately drive a vehicle so as to produce excessive noise.  Therefore, I do not think we should bother to look for relief from that quarter.</P>
    <P>The Minister then referred to the EC Commission's proposal for a consolidated-type approval directive of noise emissions from new motor vehicles. Again, I do not see any great satisfaction coming from that because, even if we have vehicles which are quieter than those we have been used to, we are talking about cases where there is a concentration of traffic noise in areas where it did not happen before.  I am not happy with the idea that we should, in some sense, weigh the advantages that accrue to people living in areas of heavy traffic which will now be relieved by having traffic diverted onto a by-pass.  That is an argument which starts off from a notion of equality of misery.  It is no solution to say that because one person is suffering from more noise he or she should be consoled by the idea that people elsewhere are suffering from less noise.  We are trying to improve the environment for everybody, not spread the pain equally.</P>
    <P>From what the Minister said on Committee Stage and from what the Minister of State said here today, I cannot see immediately what sources of relief might be available to us or what the Minister might have recourse to when he comes before the Seanad with this Bill.  I say with the greatest friendliness to the Minister that if he is serious about considering this again in the Seanad, I hope a bit more consideration will be given to the matter between now and the Seanad debate than appears to have been given to it between the Special Committee debate last July and today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the amendment.  This is a matter which I and others have raised previously both at local authority level and in this House.  I <Col N="1353" /> am glad to see that a spokesperson for our party has tabled this amendment along with my colleague Deputy Gilmore. Being a member of Dublin County Council also I am aware of the trauma being caused to many people as a result of noise levels emanating from the construction of new roads and by-passes as well as from existing roads where the increase in traffic is making life intolerable for people.  Tackling the whole area of pollution is something which all Members support.  Noise, however, is a form of pollution which nobody wants to tackle.</P>
      <P>Speaking to the Minister as a fellow politician, the reality is that we are getting the run-around on this issue.  This matter has been debated in Dublin County Council over and over again.  We send letters to the Department of the Environment and get the same acknowledgement. Finally, we get a letter saying it is not normal practice, nor has it been practice, to provide funds for double-glazing. People are being ignored.  It is time we put a provision into law to protect the ordinary individual.</P>
      <P>We are now faced with a situation where we will have to use every avenue open to us as local authority members to prevent in the case of the Shankill by-pass the junction with the south eastern motorway proceeding at the point where it is intended to go.  That is the only avenue left open to us as public representatives. Our hands are tied because the council officials tell us they have not got the authority to spend the money. When we seek authority from the Department we are told it is not the practice. We are trying to get the legislation changed so that it will be a person's right to seek this type of compensation by way of protecting their health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not just a question of putting money in people's pockets.  There are people living in some areas who cannot sleep at night because of noise.  If we are going to spend millions of pounds building roads and motorways, then surely for the limited sums it would cost, double-glazing should be provided for people whose houses are very near these <Col N="1354" /> major motorways or by-passes.  We are not asking for much.  It is not going to affect large numbers of people.  They tend to be in isolated areas where there may be small group of houses, and usually one is not talking about large sums of money.  What we are talking about is natural justice.</P>
    <P>When it suits us we quote British standards applicable in relation to acceptable noise levels but we do not have any standards ourselves.  Examples are given of where British standards are applied, if a scheme is within the limits but when one happens to be outside the limits set by the British standards.  Therefore, we are not exactly playing the game on a level pitch.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to deal with this matter.  We should not be prepared to postpone it until another day.  We may not get a chance for many years to deal with this situation and if we let it slip from us now we, as politicians, will deserve the wrath that will fall upon us from those affected at present and future by continuous noise pollution.  They also face the ongoing problem of no-one being in a position to come to their assistance. The minimum we should do is provide compensation for the people affected. We should then devise standards at a European level which would be acceptable throughout the EC in relation to this matter.  We must not trot after the British when it suits us to apply their standards and then ignore their standards when they do not suit us.  We should be tackling this problem on two fronts.  But the only avenue open to us at the moment is this amendment.  I ask the Minister to support this amendment and deal compassionately with those who are suffering.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to reply to the discussion on the amendment.  The Minister has asked us not to press the amendment and said he will seriously examine the problem between now and when the issue is debated in the Seanad.  I am concerned that a similar promise was made <Col N="1355" /> on Committee Stage and has not been kept.</P>
      <P>I would like to make a suggestion to the Minister.  There are four amendments on the same subject.  The first is amendment No. 56 which will be decided upon now.  We are also dealing with amendments Nos. 101, 103 and 128.  I am prepared to defer consideration of this matter until we reach amendment No. 101.  I ask for latitude from the Minister and from the Acting Chairman on this matter.  That would give the Minister a week or two to consider it.</P>
      <P>The Minister should address himself to a couple of issues.  First, Deputy Barrett put down a question on this subject yesterday. The Minister in his reply stated he was satisfied the ameliorative measures already implemented by the local authority are adequate and no further remedial works are necessary.  That position is totally unacceptable.  The Minister would have to change&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my understanding that, as the proposer of the amendment, I am entitled to respond to the debate.  I do not wish to argue with the Chair, I am virtually finished.  I simply want the <Col N="1356" /> Minister to take a number of points into consideration.  First, simply applying the UK standard will not deal with the problem. Some of the houses worst affected were shown to be marginally below the UK standard when the study was carried out.  I ask the Minister to deal with this problem with a greater degree of flexibility rather than simply applying the UK standards.  Perhaps we have lower tolerance of noise than in the UK but the noise levels below the UK standards in this case are not acceptable.</P>
      <P>Secondly, in relation to the specific case mentioned, I ask the Minister to look at the inquiry conducted into the motorway scheme.  Some of the householders concerned objected at the inquiry stage on the grounds of noise pollution. The Minister should note the road was constructed almost one metre higher than the level confirmed by the Minister for the Environment following the inquiry. The householders concerned have made their case forcefully to me that if the Minister for the Environment does not address this problem soon they intend to seek legal redress.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, I ask him to consider the points made about difficulties that will arise concerning the design and the line of the south eastern motorway.  We would all like to see the ring around Dublin completed and the south eastern motorway is a key part of that.  None of us wants to have exceptional difficulties with regard to the line of the south eastern motorway.  However, I assure the Minister there will be difficulties if the problems that already exist regarding noise pollution are not addressed and resolved before the line of the south eastern motorway comes up for final decision.  It could be difficult to agree a line for the south eastern motorway at that stage.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to consider the matter before amendment No. 101 is addressed in the House and make a statement in the House before the question is put on that amendment.  On that basis I am prepared to withdraw amendment No. 56 and await the Minister's reply at a later stage.</P>

      <P>In page 24, line 11 after &ldquo;Authority&rdquo; to insert, &ldquo;after consultation with local authorities,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to the question of consultation between the new authority and the local authorities with particular reference to the programmes of European Community assistance.  It is entirely appropriate that any road building plan, be it over five or seven years, should involve adequate consultation between the National Roads Authority and the local authority, particularly where a road building programme will be carried out between different local authorities, for example, on the main routes between Dublin and Cork, Limerick, Galway and Sligo.  There are instances where, on some major routes, <Col N="1359" /> a number of different local authorities would be involved and the consultation process is of extreme importance particularly with regard to county engineers and local authorities.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 64 is in my name and deals with the same issue. The road construction programme of the National Roads Authority and the Department of the Environment and, indeed, the whole purpose of this Bill, is driven by the availability of funds from the European Community.  The application for funds for the 1989-93 programme was strongly criticised in this country and by the European Commission for the lack of consultation involved in the preparation of that programme and its submission to Brussels. What we are seeking is that the National Roads Authority, given whatever terms and conditions the Minister apply to it, should be the body responsible for submitting the roads programme for funding to the European Community.</P>
      <P>The National Roads Authority will be an appointed body not an elected body. The amount of money involved is enormous. The last programme in the 1989-93 period consisted of an EC investment in the order of £500 million.  Given the availability not only of Structural Funds but also of Cohesion Funds, which I understand would be available for this purpose, the amount of money the National Roads Authority will be applying for to the European Community will be very considerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments are seeking to have a requirement for consultation &mdash; no more than that &mdash; with local and regional authorities, which is a reasonable proposition. The local and regional authorities in whose areas the proposed road projects will be built should have the right to be consulted.  I would argue that is a requirement of the European Community. If the National Roads Authority may apply for funding without consulting the local and regional authorities, I believe they will be in breach of the <Col N="1360" /> requirement of the European Community. They would certainly be in breach of the principle of subsidiarity which apparently underpins the Maastricht Treaty and the process of European Union.</P>
    <P>We are seeking a simple requirement in this amendment.  It is one that is required by the European Community and, in the interests of at least a semblance of democratic consultation, it should be included in the legislation.  Before making its submission for funding for major road developments to the European Community, the National Roads Authority should have to consult with the local and regional authorties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms. Keogh Ms. Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms. Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a simple and straightforward amendment.  Underlining a lot of what we have been talking about on this Bill has been the theme of local democracy and accountability. I believe that asking that the National Roads Authority consult with particular bodies is a reasonable request and also relates to the acknowledgement of the input of local and regional authorities. One of the fears I have of this Bill which is coming up time and again, is that of ignoring the local authorities.  Even if there were consultation in relation to particular matters, there would at least be a feeling that there was a greater degree of accountability, that people would know what was going on.  There is a fear that applications will be made by the National Road Authority, and the local authority will not know the detail of the applications and feel that local democracy is a joke.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I am also anxious that the National Roads Authority prepare EC programmes in consultation with the local authorities. However, I do not think it should be a legal obligation.  Much of the documentation for EC purposes has to be prepared to tight deadlines and I do not think it would be wise to impose a statutory obligation on the National Roads Authority to formally consult with local authorities.  The programmes prepared <Col N="1361" /> for EC purposes will be based on the National Roads Authority's medium term plan and under section 18 there is provision for formal consultation with local authorities when that plan is being prepared.  On Committee Stage an amendment was accepted from Deputy Gilmore to enhance that consultation process.</P>
      <P>At a practical level there will be day to day contact between the NRA and local authorities.  The NRA will be well aware of the views of local authorities and will acquire information from them, when preparing documentation.  I do not agree, as Deputy Keogh has said, that the local authorities will be ignored; they will be involved in the consultation process throughout the preparing of the plan. The proposed amendments are not necessary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to delete the word national from the reference to roads in the section dealing with the application for assistance in funding from the European Community. I discussed this matter at length on Second and Committee Stages.  I am concerned that a two-tier system of funding for roads has developed in this country. We have a Rolls Royce system for national roads funded by the European Community yet, roads below national road status are ignored and not even routine maintenance is carried out on them. There is an exclusive concentration on new roads constructed to very high standards and funded by the EC, while the network of secondary country roads is falling into disrepair.  I do not understand <Col N="1362" /> why the submission made to the EC for assistance concentrates solely on national roads.</P>
    <P>National roads alone are not enough if, when one drives off a national road, one is on a glorified boreen.  There should be an integrated approach to road development when applications for EC funding are made.  They should not be confined to national roads.  If the reference in the legislation to the National Roads Authority's responsibility for applying for European funding is confined to national roads, then EC funding will only be sought for national roads. This means that other roads will be left in disrepair as the Department of the Environment will shift its resources from the maintenance and improvement of non-national roads to matching EC funding for the development of national roads.</P>

This is inconsistent with the mandate the Government envisaged for the National Roads Authority as proposed in the Bill and as recommended by various political parties and representatives of organisations throughout the country.  It was envisaged that the National Roads Authority would have responsibility for the speedy development of the network of national roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The responsibility for non-national roads should remain with the Department of the Environment which will continue to be responsible for submissions to Brussels for finance.  Contrary to a widely held notion, under the Community's current framework for Ireland EC assistance for non-national roads is available.  Rural roads are supported under the operational programme for rural development and roads in border areas are co-financed under the Interreg programme.  There are substantial funds to be acquired in Brussels and the Government sees that task as the responsibility of the Department of <Col N="1363" /> Environment and not, as Deputy Gilmore has said, of the National Roads Authority.</P>

      <P>In page 24, lines 40 and 41, to delete &ldquo;and any such recommendations shall be considered by the planning authority&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with the National Roads Authority and the planning process.  Under the Bill the Authority may make recommendations in writing to a planning authority as to the content of its development plan and such recommendations shall be considered by the planning authority.  I propose to delete the reference to the recommendations having to be considered by the planning authority, because running through this legislation is the theme that the National Roads Authority can tell the planning authority what to do.  This is of particular significance given the row we had in the House last week on the rights of State bodies to override the planning authority with regard to planning permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section has to be taken in the context that the National Roads Authorities will not have to apply for planning permission for any development it wishes to undertake.  It is interesting that on the last occasion the House divided on the National Roads Authority, it was to decide whether the NRA should have to apply for planning permission.  The Government defeated the Opposition on that issue and within 24 hours we had the <Col N="1364" /> High Court decision from Justice Costello in the Mullaghmore case.</P>
    <P>Amendment 60 which was discussed with amendment No. 53 dealt directly with the application for planning permission. The National Roads Authority not only will not have to apply for planning permission, but it will not even have to comply with any development plan drawn up by the members of a local authority. It will only have to publish a notice in the paper, allow one month for people to make submissions and then override the development plan if it sees fit.</P>
    <P>A further provision in the legislation allows the National Roads Authority to tell the planning authority what to put in its development plan.  This needs to be commuted from the bald way in which it is presented.  This is a dangerous development because roads are, effectively, being taken out of the normal planning process, and the process of the discussion leading to the formation of a development plan.  The National Roads Authority will be given the power to direct local authorities as to what they should include in their development plan.</P>

We talk about accountability, consultation, etc., but it seems that the role of the local authority is either ignored or overriden and I do not know at this stage what role the local authorities will have in the future.

      <P>While I do not wish to <Col N="1365" /> criticise the Chair it does not follow that amendments Nos. 70, 71 and 72 should be taken together because the import of Deputy Gilmore's amendment No. 70 is different to amendments Nos. 71 and 72. These two amendments have their own merits but Deputy Gilmore's amendment goes to the heart of the matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister must listen to the Opposition from time to time because, as Deputy Gilmore pointed out, the Opposition was vindicated the day after we last debated this matter by the judgment of the High Court.  It is no longer acceptable for the Government to act on behalf of the public without regard to the laws which we have put in place to ensure that the public interest is taken into account.</P>
      <P>I suppose the Minister will kick for touch on this matter.  I am sure his brief was rewritten after the High Court judgment in order to give him the opportunity to kick for touch.  I understand the Government intend to appeal this decision to the Supreme Court.  This is wrong because it represents a sort of bureaucratic pluperfect carefulness, often urged on Ministers to make sure that the belt and braces are in place before they decide to take off the trousers and jump into the river.  If the Minister is kicking for touch, he will not gain ground because he is kicking against the wind.</P>
      <P>I am happy that the Minister is pressing amendment No. 72.  He will not face opposition from our party on that amendment. He will need more than a feeble kick to touch in relation to amendment No. 70 because when in a hole one stops digging, and if the Minister resists that amendment he is digging himself further into difficulty.</P>

In relation to Deputy Gilmore's amendments, the first amendment would delete the planning authority's obligation to reconsider a recommendation from the National Roads Authority.  I do not understand why there would be any objection to asking a planning authority to consider <Col N="1366" /> a recommendation.  It is not obliged to accept or act upon it, no time limit is set for consideration by the planning authority nor is it obliged to respond to the National Roads Authority.  The second amendment would oblige the National Roads Authority to comply with the local development plan.  We have already debated this issue at length on Committee Stage and nothing further can be said.  This amendment states that the local authority view must prevail and we do not accept this.</P>
      <P>The National Roads Authority will act in the national interest, but is obliged to have regard to local issues, including the content of the local development plan and the potential environmental impact of a proposed roads project on the local area.  The National Roads Authority Bill strikes a balance between local and national interest.  Therefore, we cannot accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with two amendments in my name.  First, the National Roads Authority would have the same rights as anybody else to make a submission to a local authority in the discussion and consideration of its development plan.  The local authority is obliged, through the planning Acts, to consider submissions made to it in relation to a development plan.  There is no need for a statement in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, the fact that the Minister has rejected my amendment that the National Roads Authority should have to comply with the provisions of the development plan rather than simply have regard to them, as proposed in the Bill, shows what is the intent.  The intent &mdash; and the Minister's response confirms it &mdash; is that the National Roads Authority will not be bound by the local authority development plan.  The National Roads Authority, if it sees fit, can build a national road, irrespective of what is in a development plan or in an area amenity order.  We have already had a debate and a division on this issue.  The lie of the land is clear.  I have made the case in this House to the point of exhaustion.  I do not propose to press the amendment, <Col N="1367" /> but I regret the continuously negative response we are getting from the Government to these amendments.</P>
    <P>In this legislation there is a fundamental shift of power and control away from the democratically elected members of local authorities.  That power and control is now being placed in an appointed body which will be answerable to the Minister for the Environment.  It is a wrong development and I disagree with it.  I disagreed with it on Second Stage, on Committee Stage and now on Report Stage, because it is wrong and undemocratic. Since the Government has the numbers I do not propose to waste the time of the House by forcing the issue.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 74:</P>
      <P>In page 25, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;23 &mdash; (1)  The Authority shall carry out a road audit bi-annually on road works carried out by each local authority. Such road audits shall include comparisons of such matters as methods of construction and materials used in construction by each local authority.</P>
      <P>(2)  For the purpose of this section &lsquo;road audit&rsquo; means the carrying out of a cost-benefit analysis of all road expenditure by each road authority to assess efficiency and effectiveness in road works carried out by that Authority.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 74 is concerned with road audits.  We are not happy with the text of the Bill or the intentions of the Minister and his Department on this matter.  For that reason we want a biannual <Col N="1369" /> road audit on roadworks carried out by each local authority.  We want to specify some of the things which should be included in the road audit.</P>
    <P>In subsection (2) of the proposed section we make the point that this road audit should mean &ldquo;the carrying out of a cost-benefit analysis of all road expenditure by each road authority to assess efficiency and effectiveness in roadworks carried out by that Authority&rdquo;.  We have two concerns.  First, we want to clarify the scope and extent of roadworks being carried out by road authorities.  This information is required to enable both the National Roads Authority and each road authority throughout the country to do its job properly.  I will not engage in a long diatribe on what they will find in road audits because I know that, apart from my colleague, Deputy Boylan, there is no authority greater than the Chair on the condition of county roads.</P>
    <P>We are aware of the problem which the road authorities have with the Minister and the Department of the Environment while trying to improve road conditions in their areas.  We are concerned with establishing a system so that we will know the full extent of the problem when passing legislation and approving expenditure for roads in this House.</P>
    <P>There is a need for an analysis of the effectiveness and efficiency of expenditure. We distinguish between the two because we would like to see roads constructed and maintained to a proper standard and have a means of assessing the relative priorities of different roadworks. This is what we mean when we talk about effectiveness.</P>
    <P>There is always a temptation to undertake roadworks on the basis of what are perceived to be political priorities.  I intend no disrespect to any Member when I say that political perceptions of the relative priorities of different projects will not always be identical with economic needs.  I will not labour the point that those who shout loudest get most, even if their need is not the greatest.  I think the Minister knows what I mean.</P>
    <P>We want a means by which the National Roads Authority, the local road <Col N="1370" /> authorities and this House can decide what the priorities are when it comes to the allocation of limited expenditure for what are unlimited needs.  What we propose in this new section would help us to carry out that work.  There is always the temptation for Members to demand that the Government wake up to reality and provide money to solve each problem, without becoming involved in the prioritisation of expenditure.  What we are proposing is a tool which would allow the people concerned, and this House, to decide where the priorities should lie.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister to accept this amendment because Departments and Ministers &mdash; I have seen this on numerous occasions &mdash; never have enough money, especially in an area like this.  The temptation always is &mdash; I have seen this in the Department of the Environment and in other large spending Departments &mdash; to say with a mysterious half-knowing, half-meaning smile that &ldquo;your project is on our priority list&rdquo;.  They do not say where it is on that list.  It might be number 996 and there may be no prospect of the list getting past number 30 in the year in question.  The same applies to the Department of Education.  It would help if there was a wider appreciation of the length of the priority list.  I believe that if the Government made this information public there would be a great argument when people realised the length of the list.  At least then the people would not be left in limbo, being told they are on the list but would have to wait years to have the work carried out.  That applies to all spending Departments.  If we could recover from the initial shock, the argument could be conducted under more realistic conditions.</P>
    <P>I would not invite the Minister to be indiscreet about what he is proposing, so I will use the expenditure plans of another Department to illustrate what I mean.  The Department of Education has an acute problem.  There are schools throughout the country in a dreadful condition and need major renovation to provide the basic decent facilities children need.  The management of these schools are always told the problem is on the <Col N="1371" /> Department's list.  However, the Department has no realistic expectation that the work will be done within the next three years.  Therefore action groups, parent groups, Deputies, Senators and councillors lobby the Department in the expectation that if they shout loud enough they might get their project brought forward from next year to this year.  If they are lucky and make their case effectively, they might have it brought forward from four years to three years.  In the meantime, a lot of aggravation is caused and, in many cases, work does not take place which might alleviate the situation in the short term.  However, having recovered from the shock of getting realistic information on these matters, we might be able to deal with them more rationally, objectively and with less annoyance if we had clearer criteria and an idea of the extent of the programme facing us.  In this amendment we are proposing a modest beginning on the application of that thought to the work that faces us in regard to roads.</P>
    <P>It is curious that this amendment, dealing with the major area of expenditure on national roads, is the only place in the literature on this subject in this House where one will find reference to a simple and elementary tool of expenditure analysis, that is, cost benefit analysis. There is no reference to it in the brief of the National Roads Authority and no specific reference to it in the brief of the county councils or in the mountains of literature produced about public expenditure every year.  We are dealing with directing the use of scarce and mostly borrowed resources to unlimited ends.  I invite the Minister to make a name for himself in roads policy and a greater name for himself in public expenditure policy generally by being the first person in the history of this State to accept, in an expenditure type Bill, the application of this elementary principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> This amendment would require the National Roads Authority to audit local authority roadworks every two years.  The problem is <Col N="1372" /> that the National Roads Authority has a mandate in relation to non-national roads and we would not see it diverting into the county roads structure.  Their role is to develop a safe and efficient network of national roads.  The Bill should go a long way towards meeting the Deputy's concerns by placing the National Roads Authority under a statutory obligation, in section 17, to secure the provision of a safe and efficient network of national roads.</P>
      <P>In section 19 (2) it is provided that local authorities will normally carry out or arrange for the carrying out of road construction improvement and maintenance work on behalf of the National Roads Authority.  However, this is subject to a change in that the National Roads Authority can arrange to have road construction carried out in an expeditious, effective or economical way.  That in itself will sort out the situation eventually because if the National Roads Authority feel they are not getting value for money from the local authorities they will look to have the roads constructed through a different system.</P>
      <P>These legislative provisions oblige the National Roads Authority to keep the performance of local authorities under regular review to ensure that the tax-payer's money is well spent.  The National Roads Authority can also set standards for construction and maintenance works under sections 19 and 20.  They can issue directions to local authorities and these provisions enhance the National Roads Authority's power to ensure that works are carried out as cost effectively as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem with Deputies Dukes' and Flanagan's amendment is how one can surmount the problem that the National Roads Authority is dealing specifically with one area of road construction and have no authority to link into the other areas.  I would not be against looking into the value for money in road construction here, whether it be national or non-national roads because it has been a bone of contention over the years.  The National Roads Authority has <Col N="1373" /> no mandate in relation to non-national roads.</P>

I am sorry he is passing up my invitation to make a name for himself in the history of public expenditure by being the first Minister to accept the use of cost benefit analysis but I detect a slight opening in the Minister's mind.  I invite the Minister, between now and the debate on this matter in the Seanad, to consider a modification of this amendment, to cover only the work of the National Roads Authority and the work of the local roads authorities as agents in carrying out work for the National Roads Authority.  I invite him to restrict the scope of this to the national roads which are the proper bailiwick of the National Roads Authority.  If the Minister would consider that we will suspend judgment on this and I will speak to my colleagues in the Seanad to keep him to his promise.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(4)  The Authority shall make recomendations on Garda training on all matters pertaining to road safety.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to strengthen section 23 in order to ensure proper and meaningful dialogue between the Commissioner of the Gard Síochána and the National Roads Authority.  There is general agreement about the importance of a national road safety programme.  It was appalling to read the figures from the Department of the Environment for the month of January which detailed 15 fatalities on the road and numerous casualties. The degree to which accidents are occurring on our major roads is extraordinary. The amendment, which would give specific power to the National Roads Authority to advise the Garda Síochána <Col N="1374" /> on all aspects pertaining to road safety, is an important one and I hope the Minister will take its sentiments on board.</P>
    <P>In response, the Minister is probably going to say that the Authority may from time to time come in contact with the Garda Commissioner but it is important to augment this in the interests of road safety.  Greater consideration should be given to the traffic corps within the Garda divisions, particularly in areas where there are main roads.  It is important to increase the road safety aspect of the Garda traffic corps.  Allowing a body, such as the National Roads Authority, to make recommendations on Garda road traffic training and on aspects of road safety would enhance the position of the Garda traffic corps or traffic policemen within the Garda Síochána and would be of great benefit in regard to road safety. I urge the Minister to take on board the sentiments expressed in the amendment.</P>

I do not think that the National Roads Authority should trespass on this territory.  The Garda Síochána are responsible for safety enforcement and the National Roads Authority should not have any specific role in regard to this.</P>
      <P>Under subsection (1) the National Roads Authority has wide powers to offer advice to the Garda Commissioner in relation to his road traffic Act functions and this could be used to convey views to the Garda on any aspect of enforcement or road traffic law.  The Garda would only be too happy to listen to any constructive suggestions and would listen to the National Roads Authority if it has constructive suggestions.  I do not believe the Authority's mandate should be widened to encompass areas in which agencies such as the Garda and the National Safety Council have the expertise.  The National Roads Authority should not have a function in these areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be able to inform the Deputy that I have secured a 4 per cent increase in 1993 on the 1992 outturn of £7.835 million for inland fisheries and this at a time, as I think the Deputy will agree, when we are facing a very difficult budgetary situation.</P>
      <P>Of the total allocation of £8.173 million for 1993 £6.906 million is being provided to the central and regional fisheries boards.  While the demand for increased resources for all State services is ever present I am satisfied that the level of Exchequer funding available to the fisheries boards in 1993 together with own resources raised will be adequate to meet the present pay and non-pay commitments of the boards.</P>
      <P>I am, however, conscious of the decline in staff numbers in the fisheries boards in recent years and the effect this will have on the boards' ability to carry out their functions of protection, conservation and development.  Mindful of this, I have, since becoming Minister for Defence and Minister for the Marine, been examining all possible avenues to have a number of priority posts filled.  However, I have to point out that it would be wrong of me to raise expectations of a substantial increase in staff numbers for the fisheries boards in the present financial climate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1378" /> I would add that the Department is looking at ways of improving the protection service, including better co-operation with the Naval Service and between the fisheries boards to utilise in the most efficient and effective manner the present available resources.</P>

I concede that since, for example, 1982 the staff numbers have fallen by 124 or 31 per cent, from 404 to 280 at present. As an angler I am very conscious of the work of the fisheries boards.  In the circumstances this is an issue I will address very seriously in the context of my new manifestation as Minister for the Marine.

      <P>Both ferries hold valid passenger and ship safety certificates issued by their flag administrations, which certify that the ships have been surveyed in accordance with the provisions of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, as amended, and that such survey showed that the ships comply with the requirements of that convention as regards, <i>inter alia</i>, the structure, subdivision and stability, watertight bulkheads, loadlines, hull integrity, and so on.  These surveys are carried out annually.</P>
      <P>In addition, it is our policy that foreign-registered ferries, such as the <i>Havelet</i> and <i>Stena Hibernia</i>, providing a regular service to and from Irish ports are also subjected to inspections by the Irish authorities. Such inspections are carried out at least once a year, under the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control, which is operated by a number of European countries.  Both the <i>Havelet</i> and the <i>Stena Hibernia</i> have been so inspected by the Department's marine surveyors.</P>
      <P>I should emphasise that, in the incidents involving the <i>Havelet</i> and <i>Stena Hibernia</i>, the vessels suffered minimal damage.  All ships are subject to rolling and pitching in bad weather conditions. In these incidents the vessels rolled severely and then returned to the upright position as a result of the stability characteristics of the vessels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth noting that notwithstanding these incidents both the <i>Havelet</i> and <i>Stena Hibernia</i> have a good record of safe <Col N="1380" /> operation in Irish and European waters since 1977.  In light of recent incidents, however, public concerns about aspects of ferry operations and arising out of the Deputy's concern in the matter I have requested the National Ferry Safety Committee to consider the scope for additional measures to enhance on-board passenger and vehicle safety.  I have also asked the committee to review criteria for the operation of ferries in particularly adverse weather conditions.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that, when these findings become available, I will let him have them, if he so wishes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there have been two near disasters with these two ferries and that the passengers and crew on board were terrified by the experience?  Is it not the case that ferries in general, operating on the sea routes between Ireland, Britain and the continent are really not suitable for the type of weather we encounter occasionally and, because of their particularly high elevation out of the water, are prone to turning over?  Is it not likely that we could have a disaster of the nature of the Zeebrugge affair, albeit not in the very same circumstance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I concede that the Deputy has a point and the principle of an inevitable accident would no doubt arise.  In the circumstances of the type of ferries that ply between Ireland and Great Britain it is fair to say, so as to reassure the public and the fee paying passengers, that these ferries are known to be safe.  I would not necessarily concede all that the Deputy is saying.  One or two experiences do not necessarily condemn all ferries.</P>

      <P>In relation to the weather conditions, the question of whether a ferry should leave port would be entirely in the judgment of the master and his concern would be, in whatever priority he wished, for the passengers, the crew and for the ship.  Taking account <Col N="1381" /> of that, passengers using the seaways between Ireland and Britain can go abroad feeling safe and secure based on the judgments I have outlined.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 41, 60, 62 and 103 together.</P>
      <P>The current strength of the Permanent Defence Force is of the order of 13,000 personnel.  I regard this number as adequate to enable the force to fulfil its allotted tasks.  Specifically, as regards United Nations service there is no shortage of volunteers for overseas missions. The overall strength will be kept under review in the light of requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary reason it has not been necessary to have large-scale recruiting in recent years is that the numbers leaving <Col N="1382" /> the Defence Forces have been comparatively small.</P>
    <P>There has, of course, been recruitment to meet specific demands.  In 1992, the Department of Defence took 50 recruits for the Naval Service, 66 apprentices, 29 cadets and two medical officers.  Requirements for 1993 are at present the subject of urgent consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">

      <P>At a time when unemployment is widespread, with more than 300,000 people out of work, would the Minister consider initiating another recruiting campaign for the Defence Forces?  The average age of our private soldiers is much higher than in other countries engaged in peacekeeping operations throughout the world and, therefore, young officers leaving Military College find it hard to relate to men who are twice their age.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the average age is older.  In relation to unemployment, I would like to think that those who are unemployed would not necessarily join the Army for the sake of gaining employment.  I would like to think that those who join the Army would be committed to a military career.  Neverthless, there are vacancies in the Army to be filled by people who are anxious to join the Army.

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The <i>Celtic Pride</i> was inspected in March 1992, by two marine surveyors of my Department prior to the vessel coming into service on the Cork-Swansea route for the 1992 season.</P>
      <P>The survey was carried out in accordance with standard practice whereby all ferries operating into and out of Irish ports are inspected at least once a year. Irish registered ferries undergo an annual dry-dock and survey by the marine survey office for the renewal of their passenger and safety certificates.  Foreign registered vessels which provide regular services into Irish ports are inspected under the European Port State Control Memorandum of Understanding.  This is to ensure compliance with existing international safety convention standards for the construction, equipment and operation of ships.</P>
      <P>The inspection of the <i>Celtic Pride</i> identified a number of minor equipment deficiencies which were subsequently rectified by the ferry operators.  I have arranged for the list of these defects and the remedial action taken to be circulated to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that there are at present no international regulations governing the design, construction, installation or operation of sewerage systems in the passenger spaces of ships.  Examination of the sewerage system was not a requirement for the issue of statutory certificates and did not form part of the inspection of the <i>Celtic Pride</i> prior to the tragic accident in August last year.  In October 1992, Ireland urgently requested the International Maritime Organisation IMO to introduce standards in relation to the design and construction of sewerage systems on vessels.  The Maritime Safety <Col N="1384" /> Committee of the IMO accepted the need for action and referred the matter to a specialist IMO sub-committee on ship design and equipment, which is being attended by the Department's deputy chief surveyor this week.</P>
    <P>Following the accident a number of steps were immediately taken at national level to ensure the safe operation of sewerage systems on passenger ferries operating into this country.</P>
    <P>The <i>Celtic Pride</i> was taken out of service and the entire sewerage system was inspected and modified to the requirements of the Department.  The sewerage systems of all passenger ships on Irish routes were inspected and found to be in good order.  The sewerage systems of all such vessels will continue to be examined by the Department of the Marine as part of the annual inspection procedure from now on.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that we will continue to press at the highest level for the introduction of international standards in relation to sewerage systems at the earliest possible date.  I have also requested the Minister of State at my Department to attend a meeting with the Secretary General of the IMO tomorrow in London to underline to the Secretary General our concerns in the matter and to stress the need for action to be taken sooner rather than later.</P>

      <P>I had been hoping that Question No. 35 would be taken in conjunction with Question No. 5. Do I gather from the Minister that no defect in the sewerage system was discovered in the inspections which took place prior to the incident in question?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the log of the ship indicated that there were suggestions of bad smells.  Tragically, <Col N="1385" /> whilst they were logged, no complaints were made specifically in relation to the sewerage system.  There were bad smells but passengers did not sense the danger, and tragically these two Tomlins children died.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We all very deeply regret the accident.  I know that bad smells would have been recorded in the ship's log but is there any record in the Department of complaints from the travelling public about poisonous gases or obnoxious odours?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that question is a categoric &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  I agree that this was a tragic happening.  We have already expressed in a motion on the Adjournment our sorrow for the loss to the Tomlins family of their two children.  To return to the question of pre-knowledge, while there has been an ongoing problem with foul smells from the sewage system aboard the <i>Celtic Price</i>, as evidenced by passenger complaints, this was regarded as a matter of passenger discomfort and annoyance, and there was a lack of awareness of the possible danger.  The Department would not have been aware of such passenger complaints.  In September 1992 the Government approved the establishment of a ferry user's forum to deal with passenger complaints about safety matters on ferries in Irish waters. The forum, which represents the ferry company as well as a range of consumer and passenger interests, operates under the aegis of the Department of the Marine.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of repeated incidents involving submarines snagging the fishing gear of trawlers, the Government will seek international agreement for a ban on submarine traffic through the Irish Sea, or at least, a requirement that all submarine traffic would travel on the surface, especially in established fishing grounds; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern at the dangers posed by submarines to fishing vessels and their crews.</P>
      <P>As Minister with responsibility for safety of life at sea as well as for the fishing sector, I am committed to taking every possible opportunity to focus the attention of the international maritime community on the hazards posed by submarines and to highlight the need for constant vigilance on the part of those who operate such vessels.</P>
      <P>I would remind the House that under international law submarines travelling on the surface have the right of innocent passage, without notification, through territorial waters.  They may, on the other hand, pass freely through international waters on the surface or submerged.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless we have continued to make our concerns known at the appropriate international fora, notably the United Nations and the International Maritime Organisation.  Indeed, it was at the Irish Government's express initiative that the General Assembly of the IMO unanimously passed a resolution, in November 1991, on the avoidance by submerged submarines of fishing vessels and their fishing gear.</P>
      <P>I would like to restate for the House the terms of this resolution, which are as follows:</P>
      <P>Firstly, to ensure that submarines navigating through areas where vessels are known to fish use all available means for determining the presence of such vessels and their fishing gear; secondly, to ensure that a submerged submarine, if information on the presence of a fishing vessel and its fishing gear is available, will avoid that fishing vessel and any fishing gear connected to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IMO has requested member countries to bring these recommendations to the attention of authorities responsible for operating submarines and to develop <Col N="1387" /> local arrangements to promote safety in areas used by fishing vessels and submarines.</P>
    <P>I am keeping the situation under close review; should further action at international level be required, the Deputy can rest assured that I, in my dual capacity as Minister for Defence and Marine, and my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, will initiate all possible steps to ensure that the dangers posed by submarine movements in the fishing grounds around our coast are minimised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that assurance.  Since the motion was adopted by the IMO in September last year there was a further incident in the Irish Sea where a trawler from Kilkeel, the <i>MFV Lupina</i> was dragged as a result of its nets being snagged by a US submarine.  Will the Minister, as a matter of urgency, seek to have submarine traffic banned completely from recognised fishing areas?  There is a common demand on the British and Irish sides for this kind of ban, particularly in the Irish Sea.  One wonders why this traffic continues when we are told that the Cold War is over and, presumably, there is no longer a need for this subterranean traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with the Deputy's point and I will make our views known in this regard.  I understand the incident to which the Deputy referred related to the <i>MFV Lupina</i>.  On 16 September 1992 an American nuclear submarine the <i>USS Sturgeon</i> snagged the nets of the Kilkeel based fishing trawler <i>MFV Lupina</i> in the north channel off Scotland.  This incident is at present the subject of a US Navy inquiry.  In the unlikely event that I can get hold of that report I will let the Deputy have a copy of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand the position, submarine traffic is instructed to remain up to 1,500 metres away from where trawlers operate.  Without going into the details of whatever <Col N="1388" /> inquiry may be under way, it seems unlikely that a submarine could snag the fishing nets of a trawler if it was 1,500 metres away.</P>

Was what is known as &ldquo;sucker&rdquo; fishing being practised by the submarine concerned, where it lies under fishing vessels to avoid detection by satellite?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, penalties of up to £100,000 are prescribed under the Fisheries Acts for fisheries offences in Ireland's economic zone.  The Acts also provide for the forfeiture of the catch and gear.  Where persistent offenders are concerned, in addition to any other fines and forfeitures, the courts have discretionary powers to order the confiscation of the offending boats.</P>
      <P>I should stress that the fines under Irish legislation are among the toughest in the Community.  Within the framework of the legislation, it is, of course, a matter for the courts to decide the penalty to be imposed in individual cases.  To date, however, the penalty of confiscation of vessels has not been applied.</P>
      <P>Repeated transgressions by any fishing vessels of rules designed to preserve stocks and livelihoods are unacceptable. Flags of convenience vessels are particularly prominent offenders.  The matter is complicated by transfer of ownership after conviction in a number of cases.  I have asked that the provisions in relation to confiscation of boats convicted of serious fishing offences be reviewed.  At my direction the legal aspects of the matter are currently being examined in consultation with the Attorney General's Office.  On completion of this examination I will consider whether action along the lines suggested by the Deputy would be appropriate.</P>

Galway is one of the harbours to which patrol vessels bring captured vessels, and regularly, the vessels in port have been caught on a number of occasions.  Will the Minister ensure immediately that when Spanish vessels &mdash; or those of other nationalities &mdash; are brought in to be prosecuted here, those who are prosecuting on behalf of the State are given a briefing to seek the maximum penalty, because there is a feeling that they have been dealt with rather leniently and that our fishery resources are being raped by these foreign trawlers and nations who are breaking all the rules?</P>

Even last year <Col N="1392" /> the Minister, Deputy Woods, gave a furthere commitment.  However, no moneys have been made available in the last two years for repair work.  Renard Pier has a significant impact on the local community regarding the provision of jobs to the service industries such as providing fuel oil, ice and food supplies for the crews and boats.

A figure of £130,000 was mentioned in the context of whatever remedial work might be necessary to put it back into some sort of operation.  The Deputy is aware, of course, that Kerry County Council has an obligation in this regard.  Certainly, I will do anything I can to deal with the problem but I will not give any undertakings as to the allocation of moneys for it this year.  Arising from my travels around the island I have seen the type of pier mentioned.  Communities have been disenfranchised, as a direct result of the type of situation in Renard.  It is something that I am taking very seriously.  I am not certain that I have responsibility for this matter but, if small piers and harbours can be put back into operation for the local community, it would be to their advantage.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the concern among trawlermen about the reduction in quotas of certain whitefish such as hake and monk; and the steps, if any, he will take to rectify the problem.</Quest>

    <Col N="1393" />
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Quotas for the most important whitefish species are set each year in December at the Council of Fisheries Ministers in Brussels, by reference to scientific advice regarding the state of the stocks.  At the December 1992 Council, the scientific advice for monk off the west of Ireland was very poor, the stock appearing to be in decline.  Consequently, quotas were reduced to bring catches more into line with available fish. In the case of hake, however, I am happy to inform the Deputy that the quota for this species, which is of particular importance to the Irish industry, was in fact increased, not decreased.</P>
      <P>Moving back to the question of monk, the industry has made its concerns known to me on this and I fully appreciate the situation in which many fishermen now find themselves.  Accordingly, I have asked my Department to carry out a full assessment of the information available on this species to see whether a valid case can be made to have the quotas increased.</P>
      <P>In the interim, however, the Department of the Marine has negotiated a series of quota swops with its counterparts in other member states in an effort to obtain additional quotas for both monk and hake.  An extra 300 tonnes of hake and 100 tonnes of monk was obtained in this manner earlier this year, and I can inform the Deputy that a swop for a further 180 tonnes of monk has just been agreed with France.  This will go some way towards alleviating the very serious difficulties in which some of our fishermen find themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I do not know if he is aware that the global figure for our annual quota is inclined to be clouded by large tonnage of fish which are not commercial.  They are not whitefish, they are horse mackerel and blue whiting which is mainly, if not totally, used for fish meal.  Will the Minister bear in mind that the fish which provide wealth and jobs are whitefish such as hake, monk and plaice and that the stocks of these fish are being seriously depleted by the type of poaching Spaniards <Col N="1394" /> to which we referred earlier?  The Minister should not consider a global figure but should be extremely selective so as to take care of the white fish quotas.</P>

      <P>The development plan prepared by the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Board, which will serve as the blueprint for the future development of the harbour, was approved in principle by the last Government. That approval allowed the plans advancement to the next stage; accordingly, site investigation work, cost benefit analyses and other studies needed to justify the proposed expenditure set out in the plan can now proceed.</P>
      <P>A contract for the conduct of site investigations in the harbour will be placed shortly and work will begin three weeks thereafter.  The results of the investigations, the cost of which is being part funded by the technical assistance programme of the operational programme on peripherality, should take about four months to complete.  The investigation will assist in the accurate assessment of costs for the design of ferry terminal and marina facilities.</P>
      <P>I am awaiting the report of a study on ferry terminal requirements in Dublin Bay recently commissioned by the Department and I am confident that the study's recommendations will include the information necessary to support applications to the EC in the context of the next programme of structural funding for the development of both Dún Laoghaire and Dublin Port.</P>

      <P>An additional bonus for those who are anxious to see Dún Laoghaire improved, and properly so, is that in association with the improvements being undertaken to passenger facilities, applications were invited by public advertisement on 17 February 1993, for a suitably qualified individual or individuals, organisation or organisations, interested in operating a café facility on the Carlisle Pier.  I have also indicated that it is my intention to make available to the local bed and breakfast interests a small facility within Carlisle Pier which would open at 6 a.m.&mdash; in other words we want to greet people who up to now have arrived at a pier which gave them a poor introduction to this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 22, 24, and 26 together.</P>
      <P>All of the key recommendations in the Ballycotton report which relate to matters of operational safety have been implemented.  In 1990-91 the fisheries board were provided with an additional £450,000 to purchase personal and communications equipment and to cover the cost of training in order to comply with the recommendations of the Ballycotton report.</P>
      <P>In 1992 the regional fisheries boards were allocated an additional £130,000 to purchase additional semi-rigid inflatable boats, otherwise known as RIBs, to enable them to meet fully the recommendation of the report that RIBs should patrol only in pairs.</P>
      <P>Regarding staff resources for the fisheries boards, I am actively pursuing the recommendation that deputy managers be appointed to the regional fisheries boards as part of my efforts to secure additional staff for the boards in key areas.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that I am pursuing this matter against the background of a very difficult budgetary situation.</P>
      <P>As recommended by the Ballycotton report, consideration has been given to the provision of larger seagoing vessels to patrol the area of sea between the six and 12 mile limit.  Such consideration has, of course, to take account of the capacity of the Naval Service to police the salmon regulations within the 12 mile limit as a whole using the two fast inshore patrol vessels purchased in 1989.</P>
      <P>The Department is currently working on proposals for inland fisheries to be put to Brussels under the EC Surveillance Programme as part of which the question of the purchase of larger vessels for salmon protection will be addressed.  The operation of such larger vessels by the fisheries board would, of course, have staffing implications for the board in addition to those already being experienced and the making of such an application would in any event be contingent on matching Exchequer funds being made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to stress in <Col N="1401" /> the strongest possible terms that it has been emphasised time and again to the fisheries boards that the safety of their staff must come first and that services should be provided only where reasonable safety requirements are met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the South Western Regional Fisheries Board are not satisfied with the situation? They were the people primarily involved in the Ballycotton disaster.  Members of their staff died.  They repeatedly demand that a proper seaworthy, seagoing, all-weather, ocean-going craft be provided for fishery protection patrols.  They do not have one at the moment.  Can the Minister give them any hope that such moneys will be made available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to trivialise the Deputy's concern or the seriousness of the issue involved, but it is something I will look at.  I am working very hard to ensure that there will be decent vessels and staffing of the fisheries boards in the context of the Ballycotton inquiry report which suggested that deputy managers be appointed to all boards.  A deputy manager has been appointed in only one of the seven boards.  Much remains to be done.  I take account of what the Deputy has said.  If I do nothing else in my time in the Department of the Marine that is one issue that should be addressed.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that the best tribute we could pay to those who lost their lives in Ballycotton would be to accede as quickly as possible to the request from the fisheries board and officers that a seaworthy boat be provided, which will hopefully ensure that the kind of incident which occurred in Ballycotton will never happen again? Will the Minister assure us that all his efforts will be devoted towards ensuring that this vessel will be provided for the fisheries board at the earliest possible date and by that I mean this year?</P>

      <P>The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General acknowledges that considerable improvements have taken place in recent years in the stores area as evidenced by: a reduction in the level of stocks held in some areas &mdash; partly due to management initiatives; the provision of purpose-built stores accommodation; and information technology developments.</P>
      <P>Existing arrangements provide for annual stocktaking by the military authorities at all stores, with the exception of the main technical stores at which stocktaking is carried out on an ongoing basis over a period of two years.  A requirement of these stocktakings is the identification of any obsolete items with a view to their disposal.  In general, it is desirable for security reasons not to publicise particulars as to the value/quantity of defence equipment and military stocks, including weapons and ammunition.</P>

      <P>According to the report, new storage facilities had been provided but they were not used to the optimum and because of the failure to identify on an ongoing basis what was obsolete stock and what was necessary to hold, in some cases stock levels on what might be regarded as non-security items were as high as four years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions No. 39 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>The Efficiency Audit Group was established by the Government in 1988 to examine the working and practices of each Government Department with a view to recommending improved or alternative practices and methods which would reduce costs and improve efficiency.  In the defence area, two working groups have conducted studies on behalf of the group.  The first study focused on the civil branches of the Department of Defence.  A second working group was then established to examine administration within the Defence Forces. I understand that the Efficiency Audit Group has now completed its consideration of the report of its second working group and that the parent group will shortly make its report to the Taoiseach. It is intended to consider both reports together and any legislative implications involved will be taken into account.</P>
      <P>Regarding publication, it is my intention that when the report on the Defence Forces becomes available, the Dáil will be given the fullest possible information concerning any decisions taken.  Deputies will appreciate that the report may impinge on areas with security implications and that this factor will have to be considered before a decision is reached on the extent to which the results of the report may be published.</P>

      <P>Personnel serving with UNIFIL have been and continue to be entitled to free postage of letters and post cards under 10 grams, subject to a limit of five letters and cards per week.</P>
      <P>It became the practice for small parcels to be accepted without charge at the United Nations Base Post Office at UNIFIL Headquarters Naqoura.  This practice was unofficial and on 7 October 1992 the UNIFIL authorities directed that, due to budgetary restrictions, instructions regarding postal arrangements must be strictly enforced, thus effectively abolishing the unofficial free parcel post.  This direction applies to all UNIFIL contingents.</P>
      <P>The matter has been taken up with the United Nations with a view to restoring the parcel post concession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Is he aware of how important this concession was to the personnel serving under the United Nations flag with UNIFIL?  The Irish Army personnel felt it was of great value to them and there was great shock among the troops when the facility was withdrawn.  Would the Minister agree that this seems to be a penny pinching exercise which should very quickly be done away with and the concession restored at an early date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is rather pathetic penny pinching.  When I visit the Lebanon next month I will continue to address the problem.  I know people might, in a sort of sophisticated way, say that this is not important to the troops but, of course, it is important to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give a short history of what has happened to date.  On 16 December 1992 the Department of Foreign Affairs was requested to approach the United Nations with a view to restoring the parcel post concession between Lebanon and Ireland for Irish personnel serving <Col N="1406" /> with UNIFIL.  Following an approach by the Irish Permanent Mission to the United Nations, New York, the United Nations undertook to investigate the possibility of a more liberal interpretation of the UNIFIL directive regarding postal arrangements which would allow restoration of the free parcel facility.  The Irish Permanent Mission made a further approach to the United Nations early in February 1993 and was informed that Major General Furuhovee, the incoming UNIFIL Force Commander, who was taking up duty with effect from 23 February 1993, had been briefed on the matter and promised to investigate it.  Recent representations have been received concerning this matter.  People may not consider it an important issue but it is something I will deal with when I visit the Lebanon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister has undertaken to intervene.  I do not think this is a small matter.  It is important that our troops who are serving so far away from home are given the opportunity to avail of the service.  It is a particularly mean cutback.  It seems to be the United Nations who are at fault and it is not fashionable to criticise the United Nations.  Would the Minister not accept that the United Nations has a bit of a brass neck to apply this kind of restriction which affects our troops in the Lebanon when they owe the country upwards of $20 million arising out of the operation of our troops in the Lebanon?  It seems totally unfair on their part to apply this restriction in that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy. It is unfortunate that this important problem should be brought into a bureaucratic mish mash and that major generals, diplomatic missions, the United Nations &mdash; probably Boutros Boutros Ghali for all we know &mdash; are brought into this.  It should be solved now in order to give the serving soldiers and Army personnel the peace of mind to which they and their families are entitled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 45 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>At the outset I wish to express the Government's appreciation for the work of the members of An Forsa Cosanta Aitiúil and An Slua Muirí who give such a fine example of good citizenship to the youth of the country on an entirely voluntary basis.</P>
      <P>Resources available within the limits of current financial constraints are used to the best advantage to achieve a reasonable balance of expenditure in the supply of new equipment, uniforms, continuation of training, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The various components of the dress of members of An Foras Cosanta Aitiúil are reviewed regularly and modifications necessary to meet particular service requirements are carried out.  Members have recently been issued with a new working dress and sweater.  All articles of clothing on issue to the FCA are of the same pattern and quality as that on issue to members of the Permanent Defence Force.  The only difference is in the distinguishing <Col N="1408" /> markings/flashes worn by the FCA.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the normal annual training period that has applied for members of An Forsa Cosanta Aitiúil since 1983 as part of the Government's programme for achieving reductions in the level of public expenditure will continue to be necessary in 1993.  I am anxious to see the normal situation restored at the earliest opportunity. Deputies are aware that it was a fortnight but it is now only a week.  In the meantime it is my intention to continue arrangements for the payment of the full amount of gratuity to members who undergo annual training.  The fact that annual training has been reduced does not reflect a lack of appreciation of the voluntary efforts made by members and the contribution made by them in their regular attendance at local training.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>As someone who served for many years in the FCA I am not blaming the Minister for the cutback in the annual training.  It would seem to make a lot of sense that the two weeks that were previously available for annual training would be restored to the members of the FCA.  This in fact is the only money available to them for the predominantly voluntary service they give to the country.  Their efficiency as reserve soldiers would be increased greatly if the annual training were increased by 100 per cent from one to two weeks.  I strongly urge the Minister, when he can, to reinstate the annual training of two weeks instead of the present one week for the members of the FCA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately I cannot give the Deputy such an undertaking because by doing so I would be misleading the Deputy and the House, As soon as the budgetary situation improves I would like to see the situation improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To put the matter of annual training into perspective, Defence Force regulations provide that members of An Forsa Cosanta Aitiúil and An Slua Muirí may, with <Col N="1409" /> their own consent, be requried to attend in each training year for a course of training for a continuous period of not less than seven days and not more than 21 days in the case of the FCA and in the case of An Slua Muirí not more than 14 days, at such time and place as the relevant military authorities may determine. While members who wish to attend for such training are facilitated as far as possible, many, due to business or other commitments, are unable to make themselves available.  It was for not more than three weeks in the case of the FCA under the old regime and not more than 14 days in the case of An Slua Muirí.  Due to the budgetary situation, there are only seven days training available.  I will have a serious look at that because the FCA do a good job, as do An Slua Muirí.  It will inculcate a sense of discipline into our young people and the easier it is made for them the better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the difficulty in maintaining morale in the FCA with the reduction in the period of annual training from two weeks to one week?  Can we take it from his reply that there is no provision in this year's Estimates or in today's budget which would allow him to revert to the two-week training period?  Could he outline what proposals he has in regard to the uniforms?  What improvements does he propose to implement?</P>

In relation to what will arise in the budget, I will have to try an old legal principle which is the wait and see rule.

Would he not agree that the money would be far better spent encouraging people to join the FCA, instilling some discipline into young people and in affording them the opportunity of participating in rather than being a nuisance to society?</P>

      <P>The Naval Service currently has a total of seven vessels comprising of one offshore vessel with helicopter facilities, four smaller offshore patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels. They are based at the naval base at Haulbowline and are operationally controlled from the Flag Office or Commanding Naval Service which is located at Defence Headquarters in Dublin.  The current strength of the Naval Service as at 31 December 1992 is 1,021, comprising 128 officers, 879 other ranks and 14 cadets.  This strength compares favourably with strengths in previous years.</P>

      <P>There are 117 women serving in the Permanent Defence Force. Of this total 107 are serving in the Army and ten in the Air Corps.  This represents 0.91 per cent and 0.98 per cent respectively of the total strengths involved.</P>
      <P>There are 192 women in the FCA which is 1.24 per cent of the total strength.</P>
      <P>A decision in principle has already been taken to end the restrictions which have prevented women from serving in all areas of the Defence Forces.  The military authorities are engaged in the detailed planning necessary to implement this decision.  While it is not possible to say when this planning will be completed, the position is that women are now eligible on the same basis as men for employment on operational and ceremonial duties, for assignment to military courses and for promotion.  In essence the basis of selection in all of these areas will henceforward be suitability rather than gender.</P>
      <P>The question of further recruitment of female personnel is kept under review in the light of operational requirements.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply, which is largely the same one received in October last when I addressed a similar question to his predecessor, Mr. Wilson.  At that stage he was not in a position to tell us how many women were in the Naval Service.  Perhaps the Minister will be in a position today to tell us how many women are in the Naval Service and what proportion of the Naval Service they make up. Could he indicate if they are encouraged <Col N="1414" /> to join the Naval Service?  I understand there is active discouragement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is as follows: there are practical considerations which have prevented the enlistment of women in the Naval Service.  All members of the Naval Service are liable to serve at sea and the Naval Service vessels do not have separate accommodation and sanitary facilities which would be required by female personnel. The report of the board looking into the whole question mentioned that the question of enlistment of women in the naval service required an in-depth logistical analysis.  As a first step, a female Army officer has been assigned to the Naval Service to study at first hand and report on the problems involved but I would like to assure the Deputy that this matter is being very seriously addressed.  I would like to think that in the not too distant future women will be enlisted into our Navy.</P>

      <P>Before calling on the Minister for Finance to make his Budget Statement may I remind Members of the House that none of the confidential information which will be circulated in advance by the Minister to certain Members may be disclosed to anyone until the Minister has revealed it to the House.  Premature disclosure of the information is considered to be a serious breach of privilege and Members should not take from the House any part of the Budget Statement before that part has been read out in the House.</P>
      <P>I now call on the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, to make his Budget Statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1482" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>In last year's Budget Statement, I drew attention to the great challenges facing our society: the need for jobs and the need to step up our economic performance in a sustainable way.  My main concern at that time was the uncertain prospect for the world economy and how this might affect us.</P>
      <P>Unhappily, my fears of international recession proved well-founded.  Since then, we have also suffered a severe buffeting from the currency turbulence in the ERM, pushing up our interest rates. Although conditions are, I hope, stabilising in the currency and money markets and German interest rates have finally begun to fall, the situation remains difficult.  With only slow growth expected in most European economies this year and real domestic interest rates still at high levels, 1993 poses its own particular challenges.  Yet, our creditable economic achievements over recent years give grounds for cautious optimism about the future.</P>
      <P>This budget is framed on the principle that the overriding national priority is jobs.  We have got to do whatever is required to raise the pace of sustainable employment growth, short term and long term.  We have got to face hard choices. We have got to have policies that promote and underpin genuine, enduring economic progress &mdash; no populist &lsquo;quick fixes&rsquo;.  Those of us who have jobs must put the need to create jobs above our personal interests.</P>
      <P>The Government is determined to take action to bring about more employment. That is clearly stated in our Programme for a Partnership Government.  The programme also affirms our commitment to achieving a fair and just society.  Job creation is central to that: there is no greater inequity than joblessness. Achieving our goals will require a broad national effort, wider than Government. We, therefore, want to continue and extend the social partnership and consensus approach that has served us well over recent years in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1483" /> Fundamental to the success of the programme is sustained economic progress. Sound budgetary and financial policies are essential, as is reduction in the burden of debt.  That debt is an obstacle to social progress, soaking up resources badly needed elsewhere.  Our strategy has to put priority on firm control of our public finances so that the debt-to-GNP ratio comes down.</P>
    <P>The budgetary criteria laid down in the Maastricht Treaty represent sensible parameters from a domestic viewpoint also.  We can only implement measures which can be afforded from the resources available to us.  We will be able to implement many of those objectives this year, particularly the priority job-related measures, while ensuring that the less well-off in our society are protected.</P>
    <P>Everyone is aware of the particular difficulties facing us this year: the adverse effects on revenue of the measures necessary to implement the Single Market; the full year carry-over costs of public service pay increases deferred from previous years; the weak international economy with its effects on employment and tax revenues and the direct and indirect costs of unemployment.</P>
    <P>In framing this budget and recognising the particular constraints, the Government gave the highest priority to maintaining existing employment and creating new jobs.  I will, therefore, be outlining measures which, by improving the longer-term growth potential of the economy and by promoting local enterprise and wealth creation will generate and sustain employment.</P>
    <P>There was a careful balance to be struck in this budget.  We could not jeopardise the fiscal discipline so vital to investment and long term growth.  We had, nontheless, to try to maintain the underlying momentum of the economy and employment in the near term.  At the same time, there was a need to continue with tax reform and to improve our tax and welfare systems from an equity viewpoint. Getting that balance right was never going to be easy but I believe that the measures I am announcing today add <Col N="1484" /> up to a balanced, measured, but above all, fair response.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Review of 1992 Budget Outturn</i>
    </P>
    <P>As I pointed out in the context of the end-1992 Exchequer returns, while non-capital supply service expenditure was £240 million greater than the budget estimate, about £70 million of the excess derived from the bringing forward to 1992 of arrears of special pay increases in the public sector.  The current budget deficit was £110 million ahead of the budget estimate, equivalent to 1.8 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>Exchequer capital borrowing was £13 million above target, giving an overall excess of £123 million and an Exchequer Borrowing of £713 million, equivalent to 2.8 per cent of GNP.  The general Government deficit as defined for Maastricht purposes is estimated to have been about 2.5 per cent of GDP, while the debt-GDP ratio declined again last year. Accordingly, underlying budgetary discipline was maintained despite the difficult circumstances and we more than met the budgetary convergence criteria envisaged under Maastricht.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Economy in 1992</i>
    </P>
    <P>Recent indicators confirm that weakness in the international economy persisted through 1992.  OECD growth is estimated at 1.5 per cent, while growth in the EC economy slowed to about 1 per cent.  We should all be reassured by the resilience of our economy as shown by the outturn for 1992.  Although slackening late in the year, GDP growth was about 3 per cent, the highest in the EC. Overall employment for the year has held up well relative to general international performance, while of course falling short of our exceptional employment needs.</P>
    <P>Despite the unfavourable external environment and the undoubted difficulties in the final quarter of the year as a result of the currency turbulence, the results for the year as a whole were quite encouraging.  Manufacturing growth and agricultural exports showed strong gains, with a substantial increase in the trade <Col N="1485" /> surplus.  Retail sales showed an increase of over 3 per cent, while inflation was at an annual rate of 3 per cent for 1992.  The latest labour force survey indicated that overall employment was maintained between April 1991 and April 1992. Unemployment has been growing, but this reflects demographic changes, not a loss of jobs.  All this was achieved despite exchange rate development which contributed to an erosion of competitiveness and inhibited investment.  Our economic performance, overall, in 1992 was one of the best in Europe.  It certainly did not mirror recessionary conditions elsewhere. The strong features of the Irish economy reflected in these statistics will help us to weather the difficulties now facing us.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Economic objectives and strategy</i>
    </P>
    <P>Our biggest challenge is to increase the number of sustainable jobs in the economy and to tackle the rising trend in unemployment.  With a projected natural annual increase of about 25,000 in our labour force over the next few years, that is a hugely difficult task.</P>
    <P>We should bear in mind the achievements made under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress:</i> Budgetary deficits are substantially down; the growth of the national debt as a percentage of GNP has been curbed; jobs have been created which allowed for some overall growth in employment; take-home pay has improved in real terms as a result of the substantial income tax reforms undertaken.  Farm incomes increased in 1992 by 18.5 per cent, reflecting partly the headage payments made last year which are normally payable in 1993.  More might have been achieved had there been, as was expected when these programmes were negotiated, continuing reasonable growth in the major economies.</P>
    <P>More than the usual uncertainty surrounds economic prospects for 1993. Apart from the international downturn, we have undergone a currency and interest rate &ldquo;shock&rdquo;.  This will inevitably <Col N="1486" /> have repercussions on growth and employment for some months at least.</P>
    <P>Our exchange rate policy will continue to focus on maintaining the existing bilateral exchange rates within the narrow band of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. This offers the best prospect for long term economic growth within a stable low inflation environment.  Interest rates remain exceptionally high because of continuing tensions within the EMS. However, over the coming months I expect these tensions will ease and that interest rates will fall gradually to more acceptable levels.  This budget is based on this expectation, unlike normal years when rates current at budget time are adopted as a basis for calculation. Interest rate developments over the year will impact on the economy generally and, therefore, on the budgetary aggregates, in particular on the estimate for debt service costs.</P>
    <P>For 1993, I would expect to see GDP growth of about 2.5 per cent.  This would be a creditable performance in difficult circumstances and would be well above the projected average for the EC or the OECD generally.  Inflation should remain moderate by international standards. However, every effort must be made to confine cost increases to the absolute minimum if competitiveness and employment are to be sustained.  The balance of payments will remain in substantial surplus likely to be of the same order as in 1992.  Details are set out in the economic background to the budget being published today.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Finances</i>
    </P>
    <P>Despite our commitment to the Maastricht budgetary criteria and our exemplary budgetary performance of recent years &mdash; which was among the best in the Community &mdash; our currency was subjected to unremitting speculative attack in recent months.  The external and other pressures that arose as a result of our commitment to the Exchange Rate Mechanism have made strict adherence to the budgetary criteria in 1993 even more difficult than normal.  For different reasons, this situation is mirrored in practically <Col N="1487" /> every other country in the Community. In our case, the increase of over £800 million in the national debt, equivalent to about 3 per cent of GNP, resulting from the devaluation makes a temporary halt in the process of downward adjustment of the debt ratio to GNP unavoidable in 1993.</P>
    <P>We need to maintain confidence in the management of our public finances even in the most difficult of external circumstances. Confidence in our economy and, crucially, in our currency depends on our ability to live within the prudent budgetary parameters which I will outline later.</P>
    <P>While I am committed to maintaining downward pressure on public expenditure, it is clear that the difficulties facing us cannot be fully met by a combination of reduced expenditure and increased taxation this year.  Public expenditure will be kept under firm control, and some increase in taxation is inevitable.  However, there has to be some increase in borrowing.  An overstringent approach would have damaging effects on investment and employment. On the other hand, an excessive borrowing requirement would be even more damaging.  My strategy therefore is a balanced one of adopting a GGD/GDP ratio which will be as close to the Maastricht deficit guideline as is prudently possible in present circumstances, while not endangering the general economy or the significant headway made with the public finances in recent years.  Our budget deficit will be well in line with, if not better than, most of the other member states of the EC.  After the adjustments I will announce later, my target for the GGD/GDP ratio in 1993 will therefore be 3.4 per cent, the corresponding EBR being £760 million, or 2.9 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>It has to be accepted that, even allowing for extra borrowing, the lack of buoyancy in the international economy and the consequent pressure on our social services are such that it will not be possible to fulfil all our aspirations.  The better off in our society will have to make some <Col N="1488" /> sacrifices to help the unemployed and less well-off.</P>
    <P>The medium-term budgetary outlook will entail a continuing adjustment process involving a closer adherence to the Maastricht budgetary criteria, as some of the current pressures on the Government's finances ease and as steps are taken by the Government to achieve the necessary adjustment.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Employment Related Measures</i>
    </P>
    <P>In the conditions I have outlined, it is even more necessary than usual to point public expenditure towards those sectors and activities where it will most influence growth and employment prospects.  I am now going to deal with some of the employment-related measures in this year's budget.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Jobs Funds</i>
    </P>
    <P>In our programme for a Partnership Government we said that a jobs fund is needed now to promote recovery and job creation, and that an initial £250 million will be provided in 1993.  I anticipate that Cohesion Fund aid will enable us to undertake projects costing £148 million in 1993.  I am also providing today £25 million for the county enterprise partnership boards.  The summary public capital programme, published before the budget, provided for an increase of £88 million on the 1992 outturn for Exchequer capital spending, of which £20 million will increase the number of local authority house starts in 1993 to 3,500. These three items amount to a total of the order of £260 million.  We are more than meeting our objective in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Employment Policy</i>
    </P>
    <P>To maximise the employment potential of the economy, a number of aspects of employment policy will be pursued. These include: the new standards-based apprenticeship scheme; a review of training programmes in order to put a more effective national training scheme in place; the roles of the Department of Education and of Enterprise and Employment are being examined with a view to better defining their respective <Col N="1489" /> roles in the areas of vocational education and training, to enable a more structured approach, with appropriate certification, to be applied; programmes are being prepared for the substantial expansion of vocational training and employment schemes in preparation for the next phase of the EC Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>
      <i>County Enterprise Partnership Boards</i>
    </P>
    <P>There is a potential for enterprise, wealth and employment creation that exists at local level throughout Ireland but which cannot always be harnessed to the fullest extent under existing structures. In recognition of this, the Government is pressing ahead with the establishment throughout the country of the county enterprise partnership boards for which, as already indicated, I am providing £25 million.  These boards will have a mandate to support local initiative and development through assisting the start-up of small enterprises.  These will provide the seed-bed for more growth and employment generation.  The boards will have responsibility for the promotion of tourism locally.</P>
    <P>The boards will take over responsibility for promoting and assisting integrated local development plans in consultation with community organisations, the social partners and the public sector at local level.  The new structure will focus on enterprise creation and development leading to increased employment.  The boards will also initiate activity under a nationwide series of community development programmes. Under the programmes, the long term unemployed will be able to take up opportunities on quality projects which take account of each area's real strengths and potential.  The county enterprise partnership boards will ensure that a careful assessment is made of all forms of appropriate action.  This comprehensive but decentralised approach will have great advantage over programmes which were previously designed and implemented at national level.</P>
    <P>In addition to State funds, the Government has made, and is making, arrangements for contributions from the financial <Col N="1490" /> institutions to the county enterprise partnership boards.  I am satisfied that on the basis of commitments to date and of discussions to be completed, a total of more than £100 million will be made available by the financial institutions. Further, the institutions are committing staff resources to the enterprise initiative and have set up a liaison system with the existing and emerging area and county partnerships.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the new county enterprise partnership boards has been assigned to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to ensure that a high degree of effective co-ordination is achieved with the new agency for the promotion of indigenous industry and with FÁS.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Industrial Policy Review Group</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government will be following up vigorously the recommendations of the report of the Industrial Policy Review Group, and the task force reports on its implementation.  Our aim is to improve the way the State contributes in industrial and other policy areas to the encouragement of employment and investment. We will seek to strengthen Ireland's industrial, scientific and exporting base and will ensure that the needs of indigenous industry in particular are catered for.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Structural Funds</i>
    </P>
    <P>This is the last year of the existing community support framework which runs from 1989 to 1993.  By the end of this year, a total of over £3 billion in EC aid will have been spent in supporting national development measures.  By its nature, the full economic benefits of this investment will accrue in the longer term. However, it has already helped to sustain economic growth and increase employment and has led to a substantial improvement in the infrastructure of the State.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Edinburgh Conclusions</i>
    </P>
    <P>Following lengthy negotiations, the European Council meeting at Edinburgh agreed a financial perspective for the EC budget to cover the period to 1999.  This <Col N="1491" /> financial perspective includes provision for the new Cohesion Fund and for a substantial increase in Structural Fund resources for the less favoured regions of the Community, including Ireland.  The provision for the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund will allow total commitments of over £8 billion to Ireland over the years 1993 to 1999.  This is a very satisfactory result for Ireland and represents a major achievement by the Government in very difficult negotiations.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Cohesion Fund 1993</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Treaty on European Union provides for the establishment of a Cohesion Fund in 1993, to which I referred earlier. Further decisions on the fund, including its total amount, were taken at the Edinburgh Summit.  The fund is intended to provide aid for projects in the areas of environment associated with EC environmental objectives and trans-European transport infrastructure.  While the allocation of the fund between the four Cohesion member-states including Ireland has not yet been settled, I anticipate that a commitment of aid equivalent to £126 million will be available to Ireland in respect of projects costing a total of £148 million in 1993.</P>
    <P>Pending final decisions on national shares and other matters, I propose to allocate the expected aid between various capital investments in the environment and transport areas.  These allocations of aid may be subject to subsequent adjustment. The total cost of the projects involved will be about £58 million for environmental purposes including sanitary, water supply, waste disposal services and some measures related to the energy industry; and about £90 million for transport infrastructure including roads, rail, commercial ports, and airports. Further details are contained in the &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The necessary adjustments are being included in the public capital programme. As the bulk of the total expenditure on these projects will be additional to existing provisions, there will be a <Col N="1492" /> substantial boost this year to economic activity and employment in the area involved.  In combination with the large increase in public capital spending which I will outline later, the increased investment announced under this heading will represent a very significant stepping-up of infrastructural investment in 1993.</P>
    <P>
      <i>National Development Plan</i>
    </P>
    <P>A national development plan which will be the basis for the next round of Structural Funds programmes commencing in 1994 is currently in preparation. The focus of this plan will be the creation of sustainable employment and improved economic growth, ensuring that Ireland derives the maximum permanent economic development possible from the substantial increases in the Structural and Cohesion Funds agreed at Edinburgh.  There have been extensive consultations with the sub-regional review committees, the social partners at national level and other interested bodies.  In addition, considerable work has been undertaken in the various Government Departments and agencies. This work will continue with a view to the Government submitting their plan to the EC Commission within the next few months.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Opening Budget Position</i>
    </P>
    <P>The opening current budget deficit based on the published 1993 estimates of receipts and expenditure is £545 million, after allowing for the deduction of £25 million for Departmental balances.  The opening Exchequer Borrowing Requirement is £907 million.</P>
    <P>As already mentioned, I also have to have regard this year to the opening general Government deficit as defined for Maastricht purposes.  This is different from the Exchequer Borrowing Requirement in that what it measures is not actual Exchequer borrowing but the deficit incurred by the State, including such areas as local authority borrowing; on the other hand, capital transactions involving the commercial State-sponsored bodies are excluded.  The opening deficit on this basis is £1,055 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1493" /> Public expenditure comprises services which are met from the Central Fund and the ordinary day-to-day expenditures voted by the Dáil for public services.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Central Fund Services and Debt Management</i>
    </P>
    <P>The 1993 estimate for Central Fund Services is £2,903 million, an increase of 6.5 per cent over the 1992 outturn.  This estimate included £2,490 million for debt service costs and £388 million for Ireland's EC budget contribution.</P>
    <P>A sum of £50 million of debt service savings was set aside last year to fund the enterprise partnership boards.  As already indicated, I have today provided £25 million for the boards through the Vote for the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  The £50 million savings will serve to meet debt service payments in 1993.  After allowing for the effect of this £50 million, the underlying increase in debt service costs in 1993 is £231 million or 10 per cent.  This is significantly higher than in recent years and is mainly accounted for by: the increase in domestic interest rates; the effects of the devaluation of the Irish pound; and the servicing cost of the Exchequer's net addition to debt required to fund the borrowing requirements in both 1992 and 1993.</P>
    <P>The debt service estimate takes account of £100 million debt management savings to be achieved by the National Treasury Management Agency in 1993.  In the light of their record over the last two years I am confident the agency will meet this target.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Service Pay</i>
    </P>
    <P>A provision of £4,035 million is being made for public service pay and pensions in 1993.  This represents an increase of £279 million or 7.4 per cent over the 1992 outturn.  The 1992 figure in turn represents an increase of £364 million or 10.7 per cent over 1991.  The scale of this expenditure and its increase continue to be matters of major concern for the Government.</P>
    <P>The increased provision being made <Col N="1494" /> arises mainly from the Government's decision to honour commitments entered into in respect of deferred general and special increases.  Having provided in full for these commitments to maintain the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> consensus, there is absolutely no way the Government could ask taxpayers to carry any further additional pay costs for the public service in 1993. Neither can we live with a situation in which liabilities to further expenditure on this front would continue to build up for 1994, pre-empting decisions on resources next year.</P>
    <P>I am not making any provision in this budget for more improvements in pay or conditions for public servants this year, apart from those already fully committed. I appreciate this situation has implications for the operations of industrial relations across the public service and I have already today invited the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to discussions on this issue.</P>
    <P>True consensus requires that problems of the significance now faced by the Government should be discussed frankly with the parties concerned.  In these discussions, the Government will try to find solutions which will be fair and equitable and which, I hope, will not prejudice the negotiations of a further <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>There is an air of unreality in the expectations being voiced by some public service unions.  It is totally unrealistic that further claims should be pressed in a year in which the general increase being paid to public servants under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> pay agreement is subject to a ceiling of £6.50 a week, and many private sector employers are having to refuse pay increases provided for in the pay agreement.  To take further demands on board would require offsetting action by the Government to prevent the budgetary strategy going off course.</P>
    <P>Related to the question of pay increases in the public service in the issue of the public service pay determination systems.  The Government is totally committed to change in this area.  It is its <Col N="1495" /> intention, through discussions with the public service unions, to press forward in 1993 with the introduction of a new system which would be more transparent. It should operate on assessment criteria which, while being fair to staff, would be responsible to the interests of the Government and the community as taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The Government has also given consideration in the context of public service pay to the question of the PRSI status of public servants.  The Government is committed to work towards putting public servants on the same footing as other employees.  It acknowledges this is a complicated issue and intends to include it on the agenda for the proposed discussions with ICTU.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Administrative Budgets</i>
    </P>
    <P>The introduction in recent years of a system of delegated administrative budgets in Government Departments and offices has provided an opportunity for more effective and innovative management within the limits of available resources.  This change has yielded worthwhile improvements in the efficiency of Government Services.</P>
    <P>Within the budgetary constraints, the systems of administrative budgets will continue to operate.  My Department and, where appropriate, the efficiency audit group will, as heretofore, provide expert advice and assistance to enable Departments to improve their organisation, systems and procedures so as to secure optimum value for money and better service to the public within the parameters of the Government decision. As part of the incentive for better management of the administrative budget system, I am providing almost £7 million in respect of the carryover of savings on administrative expenditure.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Contributions towards State Security Service</i>
    </P>
    <P>In last year's budget, I announced that the Government was requesting the associated banks to make a contribution of £2 million towards the cost of security <Col N="1496" /> services, such as cash escorts, provided to the banks by the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>I am making similar provision in today's budget for a contribution of £2 million by the banks in 1993 to offset some of these costs.  The contribution will, as in 1992, be accounted for as Appropriations-in-Aid of the Defence and Garda Síochána Votes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Non-Capital Supply Services</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>1993 Supply Services Expenditure</i>
    </P>
    <P>There is normally a considerable gap between the publication of the abridged Estimates Volume and the White Paper on receipts and expenditure.  However, as this year's Abridged Estimates Volume was published within four days of the White Paper, the Estimates figures in both publications are consistent with one another.</P>
    <P>I will, of course, be making adjustments to the White Paper provisions in respect of the spending initiatives which I will be announcing today.  I will also be making minor adjustments to the published expenditure figures arising in the main from re-assessment of the 1992 end-year figures completed after the Estimates had gone to press.  All of these adjustments are set out in the Principal Features.</P>
    <P>I will mention some of the main features of the changes in the Government's expenditure provisions for 1993.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social Welfare</i>
    </P>
    <P>Despite the difficult budgetary position for this year, the Government has decided to adhere as closely as possible to the commitments in the Programme for Government to support those dependent on social welfare and to make further progress in the implementation of the Commission on Social Welfare's proposals. Within the limited resources available, the Government is giving priority to the support of families with dependent children, in accordance with the provisions in relation to child income support in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>I am providing for increases in weekly <Col N="1497" /> social welfare payments broadly in line with the expected rate of inflation.  I am also providing for additional increases for those on short term payments so as to bring those payments closer into line with the priority rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  All long term payments are, of course, already in excess of the priority rates and the increases I am providing today will ensure that they remain so.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Weekly Welfare Payments</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am providing for a 3.5 per cent increase, with effect from late July, in all weekly personal and adult dependant allowance payments, including health allowances.  In broad terms, this should maintain the purchasing power of these payments.  While I am providing for a somewhat lower increase for child dependant allowances, I am making significant improvements in child benefit which I will deal with shortly.  The 3.5 per cent increase will cost about £50 million this year and as much as £113 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Child Benefit</i>
    </P>
    <P>In recognition of the cost of rearing children and in line with the objective in the Programme for a Partnership Government and <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> regarding child income support, I am providing, with effect from September, for an increase of £4.20 per month in the rate of child benefit for the first, second and third child in all families.  This means that the monthly rate will go up from £15.80 to £20, an increase of nearly 27 per cent.  The rate for the fourth child and subsequent children is being rounded up to £23 per month.  The cost of the child benefit improvements this year will be just over £16 million.  The full year cost will be nearly £50 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Special Increases in Short Term Rates</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government's room for manoeurve regarding the Commission on Social Welfare's recommended priority rate in respect of short term payments is severely constrained by the overall financial <Col N="1498" /> position and the priority being afforded this year to child benefit.  In the circumstances, it is not possible to bridge the remaining gap fully this year.  A further step is, however, being made and, as from late July, all those on short term payments will receive an increase of nearly 5 per cent.  Also, as a special measure, I am increasing the carer's allowance from £53 per week to £59.20 per week, an increase of 11.7 per cent. This valuable increase will be of benefit to those people who, on a full-time basis, look after elderly and incapacitated people in our community.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Family Income Supplement</i>
      </P>
      <P>The family income supplement is an important scheme which supplements the incomes of those in low paid employment and in that way safeguards their incentive to take up available employment.</P>
      <P>I am again making further improvements this year in this scheme which are designed to secure its effectiveness in maintaining the incentive to work. Details of the improvements will be announced by the Minister for Social Welfare.  The cost of the FIS will be £2.5 million this year and more than £5 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Grants to Voluntary Bodies</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recognition of the valuable work carried out by voluntary and community groups the Government has decided to allocate an additional £1.37 million for the support of these groups in 1993.  This is on top of the £3.36 million provided <Col N="1499" /> for in the published Estimates bringing the total for 1993 to £4.73 million.  This provision includes a special allocation of £500,000 for the Respite Care Trust Fund.  The fund will be used to finance occasional breaks for carers who look after disabled people in the home.  I am providing also £25,000 to the national office of the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council, £25,000 to Marriage Counselling Services Ltd., and £30,000 to the Fountain Resource Group.  The balance of the moneys will be used to finance various other organisations working with the elderly, the disadvantaged, the disabled, the homeless and other deserving groups.  Further details of the organisations being assisted will be announced by the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Social Welfare Improvements</i>
      </P>
      <P>A number of important initiatives has been decided by the Government which will be of significant benefit to particular groups.  These will cost more than £1.5 million this year and more than £3 million in a full year.  Details of the initiatives will be provided by the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Total Cost of Social Welfare Package</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total cost of the package of improvements for social welfare is £75.5 million in 1993 and about £180 million in a full year.  At a time of exceptional <Col N="1500" /> budgetary constraint, this year's budget provision is a significant addition to the 1993 Estimates allocation for social welfare benefits and allowances.  It means that the total spending on social welfare in 1993 will be approximately £3.7 billion. This is a substantial sum and it shows the high priority which the Government continues to attach to the less well-off in our society.</P>
    <P>In accordance with our objective of improving the public health services.  I have provided £20 million in this budget for the reduction of hospital waiting lists. The priority areas are orthopaedics, especially hip replacements, eye defects, particularly cataracts, ear, nose and throat, heart by-pass, varicose veins and plastic surgery.  The aim is to reduce substantially all hospital waiting lists.</P>
    <P>In the health community care area, I am continuing the process of implementing the social aspects of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, begun two years ago.  I am providing an additional £8 million for services mainly for people with a mental handicap.  This will provide additional residential and day care places, emergency and respite care, support for up to 1,000 extra people caring at home for sons and daughters with mental handicap, as well as developing education and training facilities.  It will also enable residential facilities to be provided so that more people with mental handicap will be housed in local communities. These initiatives will help to meet the growing needs of people with mental handicap and those caring for them.</P>
    <P>Further, an additional sum of £4 million has been provided in the Estimates for the elderly in respect of subsidising the cost of private nursing home care for those who need nursing but who cannot afford to meet the full cost themselves. A provision of an extra £2 million has also been made in the Estimates for the development of the public dental services.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Education</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am providing an additional £3.3 million for improvements in the Education <Col N="1501" /> area.  This will provide particularly for measures to relieve disadvantage, allow for the establishment of a fund for guidance and counselling at second-level and, together with co-financing from the EC and the European Social Fund in particular will allow for an increase of 900 places in the vocational training opportunities scheme from September next.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Agriculture</i>
    </P>
    <P>Last year, I provided £1 million to Teagasc towards an advisory service in connection with the small farm development programme.  I am providing an additional £1 million for this purpose in 1993.  I am also providing £400,000 for a pig evaluation programme, £250,000 for research in the food area and I am restoring the grant to farm and rural development organisations.  I am conscious that the recent bad weather has caused considerable problems for the seed potato growers particularly in the Donegal area and I am providing £1 million to assist the affected growers to survive the disaster. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry will be making an announcement on the matter shortly.</P>
    <P>
      <i>CAP Reform Schemes</i>
    </P>
    <P>The reform of the common agricultural policy involves considerable administrative work in connection with the implementation of schemes introduced as a result of the reform.  I am providing approximately £4 million for additional staff and consequential costs in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry for the above mentioned schemes and also for additional controls required for intervention, export refunds and milk quotas.  Allowing for savings, I expect the net cost of this agriculture package to be about £3 million.  I will be referring to further measures affecting the agriculture sector when I come to taxation.</P>

      <i>RTE</i>
    </P>
    <P>The House will be aware that it is intended to introduce legislation to repeal section 3 of the Broadcasting Act, 1990 which put in place certain restrictions, known as the &ldquo;cap&rdquo;, on RTE's advertising revenue.  The Government has considered how RTE's accumulated income in excess of the cap, approximately £17.5 million, should be disposed of.  Faoi mar a ghealladh i gClár an Rialtais, tá ceithre mhilliún punt go leith a sholáthar ionas go bhfeadfar tús a chur le bunú Telefís na Gaeilge.  The Government has decided that the balance of £13 million should be paid into the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social Housing</i>
    </P>
    <P>Housing is a basic need.  I have therefore provided increased resources for social housing in the 1993 Estimates and the Public Capital Programme.  These extra resources should ensure that the total output of social housing units will increase significantly.  In 1992, 6,000 households were provided with social housing and this will increase to almost 7,000 in 1993 and 9,000 in 1994 &mdash; an increase of 50 per cent over a two-year period.  In relation to the remedial works programme, provision has already been made for expenditure of £16 million, and I am providing a further £1 million for the renovation of flats, mainly for the elderly in the Dublin inner city area.  This demonstrates clearly this Government's determination to make housing available to those who cannot afford to provide it from their own resources.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Official Development Assistance</i>
    </P>
    <P>The objective set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government of providing Official Development Assistance of 0.2 per cent of GNP was met by the provision in the 1993 Estimates published last week.  This represents a very considerable improvement on the 1992 figure of about 0.16 per cent <Col N="1503" /> of GNP and will give a substantial boost to the scale and impact of our assistance to the Third World.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Co-operation Agreement with European Bank for Reconstruction and Development</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am making £80,000 available to enable Ireland to participate in the funding of technical assistance to Central and Eastern European and former Soviet Union countries under the arrangements currently operated by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Irish consultancy firms may as a result be facilitated to avail of the opportunities for consultancy assignments in these countries.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Capital Programme</i>
    </P>
    <P>The summary Public Capital Programme published last week provided for expenditure of £2,216 million.  This represented an increase of more than £370 million or 20 per cent on the 1992 outturn and allowed for Exchequer-financed spending to rise by £88 million or 11 per cent, and non-Exchequer financed spending by £285 million or 28 per cent. All available EC funds under the Community Support Framework will be fully drawn down by the end of this year in line with the present Structural Funds programme.</P>
    <P>As already outlined, I am also providing an additional £148 million in respect of projects aided under the Cohesion Fund.  Part of this expenditure is non-Exchequer, and the net cost to the Exchequer, taking account of Cohesion Fund receipts expected this year, will be of the order of £27 million.  Including the Cohesion Fund addition, and miscellaneous other provisions to the Public Capital Programme, the year-on-year increase in capital spending will total almost £500 million, or 27 per cent.</P>
    <P>Expenditure affecting the construction industry in the Public Capital Programme is estimated at £1,367 million or about 22 per cent more than last year.  This increase is expected to contribute more than 6 per cent to construction industry <Col N="1504" /> output in 1993 and should generate up to 3,500 direct and indirect jobs in the construction industry.  Indeed, it is estimated that the building and construction component of the programme already directly supports more than 29,000 jobs, with many more jobs indirectly supported by this expenditure.</P>
    <P>The combination of the Public Capital Programme, the Cohesion Fund expenditure and the additional expenditure for the enterprise partnership boards is by any standards a very substantial investment stimulus to the economy and a considerable boost to employment.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Non Programme Outlays</i>
    </P>
    <P>The provision in the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure for non-programme outlays is £67 million.  This provision allows the Government to meet financial restructuring costs, such as increased State equity in State-sponsored bodies, together with miscellaneous capital payments.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Aer Lingus</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Programme for Government contains a commitment that the Government will ensure a commercial future for the national airline.  Like virtually every airline in the world, Aer Lingus is experiencing difficult trading conditions but it is a large and diverse group with a wide spread of interests and very substantial assets.  While not minimising the group's present problems, one should not exaggerate them.</P>
    <P>The board of Aer Lingus has put forward its recovery proposals and these are being considered by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications. Subject to the constraints on the national finances, which rule out very large injections of equity in the group by the Exchequer, the Government will be prepared to support a viable and convincing recovery plan.</P>

      <P>I come now to the subject of taxation.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Review of Tax Policy</i>
      </P>
      <P>The Government is committed, through the Programme for a Partnership Government, to continuing the process of tax reform.  Our guiding principle in that regard will be to shape the tax system so that it best supports our employment objectives.  We have defined a number of priorities with this, and the broad equity of the system, in mind.  Taxation reform, however, must be consistent with overall bugetary requirements.  It is possible, though many would prefer not to see it this way, to have reform without overall relief.</P>
      <P>The past few years have, of course, seen wide-ranging reforms, aided by the revenue buoyancy associated with growth.  Significant base-broadening and rationalisation measures were implemented across the tax code.  Tax collection and enforcement were considerably improved.  These factors, with a significantly increased contribution from the corporate sector, helped make possible notable improvements in personal income tax, particularly lower marginal rates on a broad front.  At the same time, we made substantial progress in restructuring VAT and excise duties in preparation for the Single Market, indeed to the extent that this event passed almost without notice last month.  Those reforms were pursued on a basis fully consistent with sound budgetary policy; indeed, they went hand-in-hand with a considerable improvement in the Exchequer finances and the debt to GNP ratio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Though the budgetary circumstances of 1993 require the raising of additional revenue, we have been concerned to raise <Col N="1506" /> these extra revenues in the fairest possible way.  A key concern was that the position of the low-paid should, if possible, be improved.  In striking a balance between the various tax-headings, we were conscious that a tax system supportive of employment is one which seeks to minimise its impact on incentives to work, effort, enterprise and productive investment.  For that reason, we have decided to rely on taxes on spending and assets for the greater part of the needed revenues.  We have also made a provision for a number of measures which should encourage business investment, in parallel with the emphasis on this aspect of public spending.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Personal Income Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>Significant progress was achieved in income tax reform during the period of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  Over that period, rates were reduced substantially on a broad front, the standard rate being cut from 35 per cent to 27 per cent and the higher rates consolidated into a single 48 per cent top rate.  Substantial improvement was also made in the exemption limits and the standard band was widened.  An integral part of that strategy was a broadening of the tax base generally so as to make the system more equitable and more consistent with the economy's needs and, of course, to provide funding for the tax improvements.</P>
    <P>The new Government programme defines our priority objectives.  I must emphasise, however, that this is a five-year programme; the objectives set must be seen both in that context and in relation to the programme's overriding commitment to budgetary discipline.  In this year's circumstances there is no choice but to seek a revenue contribution from the income tax area.  However, I have sought to keep it to a minimum, and to find room for some desirable improvements.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Income Levy</i>
    </P>
    <P>Despite the budgetary constraints facing them, the Government has decided not to increase income tax rates <Col N="1507" /> which would involve reversing some of the major progress made in the income tax area in the last few years.  However, it has decided to introduce a temporary income levy as a means of seeking an equitable contribution from all income earners in a position to bear such a burden.  The levy will apply to all income on a similar basis to the existing health and employment levies and not just to employment income.  The new levy will be at a rate of 1 per cent but with an income exemption in order to protect the lower paid.  In the case of the self-employed, exemption will apply where income for the year is not greater than £9,000.  In the case of employees, the levy will not be payable in any week where income is not greater than £173.  In setting the income threshold at this level rather than at the general income tax exemption limits, the potential full-year yield from the levy is diminished by some £20 million. However, by doing so, I have ensured that a further 217,000 taxpayers will not be affected by the levy &mdash; over and above the 290,000 who are exempted from income tax.  The resulting shortfall must be found elsewhere.  I believe that the higher exemption threshold is fully justified from the view point of work-incentives and general equity.</P>
    <P>In addition all medical card-holders, including those whose income is above £9,000 per annum, will be exempt from the levy.  Welfare payments will also be exempt from the new levy and such payments will not be taken into account in determining whether an individual qualifies for an income exemption from the levy.  Unlike the existing levies which applied in the early eighties, employers will not be required to bear the cost of the new income levy in respect of employees holding medical cards.  This will ensure that the new levy does not impose additional costs on employers.  The levy should yield £78 million in 1993 and £130 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the new levy has to be seen against the background of the income increases and tax improvements of recent years, which have produced a <Col N="1508" /> significant increase in real take-home pay and incomes generally.  I would again emphasise that the new levy is temporary and the Government is satisfied that all taxpayers, having benefited in recent years, would be prepared to make a small sacrifice now to help the maintenance both of a sound budgetary policy as an essential element in employment strategy and of adequate social services and programmes. The cost of the changes in the social welfare area alone this year amounts to about £75 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Allowances and other aspects</i>
    </P>
    <P>The income tax priorities set out in the Programme for Government are to remove the low-paid, especially families, from the tax net and to broaden the standard band.  In line with these priorities, I am proposing the following measures today:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the personal allowance is being increased by £150 for a married couple and £75 for a single person, with comparable increases in the widowed, single parent and widowed parent allowances;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the standard rate tax band is being extended from £14,950 to £15,350 for a married couple and £7,475 to £7,675 for a single person;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the general exemption limits are being increased from £7,000 to £7,200 for a married couple and from £3,500 to £3,600 for a single person. The exemption limits for elderly taxpayers are being increased by a similar amount.  The child addition is being increased by £50 per child for all children.  This means that, in future, the child addition will be £350 per child for the first and second child and £550 per child for the third child and subsequent children.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that these changes will remove 13,500 taxpayers from the tax net and will cost an estimated £37.6 million in 1993.  I am also renewing the PRSI allowance for a further year, at a 1993 cost of £36 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1509" /> Unavoidably, the new income levy will offset the benefits of these changes for middle and higher income taxpayers but the net outcome will be positive for taxpayers earning up to £9,000 per annum; in the case of those with larger families, there will be a net benefit up to higher income levels.</P>
    <P>Details of the mainstream income tax changes, showing their effect on different income categories, are contained in the <i>Principal Features of the Budget</i>.  As usual, the Revenue Commissioners will be sending an information leaflet about the exemption limit changes to low paid taxpayers over the coming weeks; the leaflet will also contain details of the improvements in the family income supplement scheme operated by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Mortgage Interest Relief</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Programme for Government states that mortgage interest relief will be maintained and that the Government will consider measures in the 1993 Budget to relieve the position faced by mortgage holders while the present high interest rates last.</P>
    <P>Mortgage interest relief is one of the most expensive tax reliefs and its cost to the Exchequer increases as mortgage rates increase.  The full-year cost to the Exchequer of a 3 per cent rise in mortgage rates, which is broadly what has happened since last September, is about £40 million.  The counterpart of the increased cost of the relief is that those with interest below the current ceilings are entitled, as matters stand, to the available relief on the increase in their outgoings.  By approaching the Revenue Commissioners, they can ensure that this higher relief is reflected in their 1993-94 tax free allowance certificates and also get relief in respect of 1992-93.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the Government recognises that people with larger borrowings, many of whom are heavily burdened, have got no such respite. Accordingly, it has been decided to increase the interest ceilings from £2,000 (single) and £4,000 (married) to £2,500 and £5,000, respectively.  The new ceiling <Col N="1510" /> for widowed people will be £3,600 compared with £2,900 at present.</P>
    <P>We have also decided on a further measure directed at first-time purchasers with effect from the 1993-94 tax year. The percentage allowable of such persons for the first three tax years in which they claim mortgage interest relief will be increased to 100 per cent, subject, of course, to the new ceilings, after which they will revert to the normal percentage rate.  In the case of people who start to claim mortgage interest relief on or after 6 April next, the 100 per cent rate will apply for the next three tax years.  People who started to claim mortgage interest relief in the tax year 1991-92 or later will also benefit as follows:</P>
    <P>(1)  people whose first claim was in 1992-93 will get the extra relief in 1993-94 and the following tax year;</P>
    <P>(2)  people whose first claim was in the 1991-92 tax year will get the extra relief in the 1993-94 tax year.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided that, because of the very high level of mortgage rates in recent months, some more general but temporary measure is also warranted.  Thus, for the coming tax year, the percentage of interest qualifying for relief will be increased exceptionally from 80 per cent to 90 per cent.  This will benefit those below the current ceilings as well as those assisted by the general increase in the ceilings; on that account, it adds substantially to the overall cost.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer could not support the full cost of this package, and it would be unreasonable to ask the general body of taxpayers, many of whom are not so fortunate as to own their own homes, to carry it.  Accordingly, it has been decided that a part should be met by a limited curtailment of the relief, affecting mainly those home-owners who, while benefiting from the new provisions, are not greatly burdened by higher mortgage rates.  To this end it has been decided to introduce a <i>de minimis</i> exclusion for mortgage interest relief of £100 for single and widowed persons and £200 for married couples.  The effect of this measure <Col N="1511" /> will be to disallow for the purpose of relief the first £100/£200 of interest currently allowable.  The cost of this measure for a married couple with an income under £20,000 or so would be confined to £54 per annum, at most.</P>
    <P>In fact, any married couple with more than £15,000 outstanding on their mortgage will gain overall from the new arrangements.  Obviously the greater the mortgage burden the more will be the benefit, subject of course to the new ceiling. The estimated net cost of the combined measures is about £17.5 million in 1993, and £29 million in a full year.  I am asking the Revenue Commissioners to publicise the arrangements for these changes as soon as possible, including the availability of additional relief which may arise for 1992-93 in certain cases.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Business Expansion Scheme</i>
    </P>
    <P>The business expansion scheme, which was restructured in the 1991 Finance Act with a view to focusing the support it gives to equity investments on smaller, riskier companies in sectors with the capacity to generate sustainable output and jobs, remains in effect until 5 April 1993.</P>
    <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government stated that, to encourage productive investment resulting in job creation, the business expansion scheme would be extended.  In fulfilment of that commitment and in view of the employment potential of the scheme, I propose to renew the BES for a further three years, that is up to 5 April 1996.  I believe that this renewal is justified on the basis of maintaining the scheme's current focus on economic sectors and firms that are both high-risk and offer a prospect of extra sustainable output and jobs.  From the standpoint of ensuring that essential focus, I propose to maintain the company limit at its current level of £500,000.</P>
    <P>I am also abolishing the £75,000 lifetime cap for individual investors in respect of subscriptions made on or after today though I would point out that the lifetime cap is not being removed in respect of subscriptions made prior to <Col N="1512" /> today.  This will mean that BES projects can immediately begin to raise money from investors who were previously excluded by the cap.  The cost of extending the BES is estimated at £5 million in 1993 and £13.5 million in a full year.  The extension of the BES and removal of the lifetime cap will provide a significant boost to business.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Special Investment Accounts</i>
    </P>
    <P>The BES scheme is designed to encourage direct personal investment in smaller companies.  To provide a further incentive aimed at generating employment, the Government introduced special investment accounts from 1 February. These accounts are designed to encourage collective investment in Irish companies and direct personal investment in publicly quoted companies and they can be offered by life assurance companies, unit trusts and stockbrokers.  They are taxed at a special low tax rate of 10 per cent which applies to all income and capital gains.  To ensure that the investments are in line with the needs of the economy, these accounts are required to have a minimum percentage of their total investments in Irish equities.  This minimum is 40 per cent in year one rising to 55 per cent over four years.  There is a further provision requiring that 6 per cent of the investment is made in smaller Irish companies in the first year, rising to 15 per cent over four years.  In addition, there is an extra tax incentive for investments in &lsquo;venture capital&rsquo; companies whereby both the income and capital gains on such investments will be ignored for tax purposes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Pension Fund Investment</i>
    </P>
    <P>The largest group of investors in Ireland are pension funds.  The total value of Irish pension funds is now over £9,000 million and their total annual cash flow and investment income is of the order of £750 million.  Occupational pension schemes obtain very favourable treatment in the taxation system.  While it has been suggested that these concessions warrant some form of taxation of the pension funds' income, I am not proposing <Col N="1513" /> to alter the present situation in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Government considers that Irish pension funds have a national responsibility to take the needs of the Irish economy, particularly the need for more jobs, into account when making their investment decisions, and that they should make a greater contribution to the development of employment.  These funds should, therefore, invest as much as possible of their assets in Ireland and should reverse the trend of recent years which have seen the Irish share of their total assets dropping from 79 per cent at the end of 1988 to 68 per cent at the end of 1991.  Given that employer contributions account for the bulk of the annual cash flows of the funds, there should be an obvious self-interest on the part of the pension funds to help Irish business.  This will be to the long term mutual advantage of both Irish companies and employees. In order to assist this process of increased Irish investment, I propose to enter into immediate discussions with the representatives of Irish pension funds.  The aim will be to set up a suitable mechanism for getting the pension funds to invest more in Irish job-creation projects, particularly in the manufacturing sector. It is my intention that this new initiative will come into operation within the next few months and thereby give an early boost to job-creation in the areas selected.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Small Business Start-up and Development</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the vital role played by small firms, especially those in the exposed sectors, in our economy and in the provision of self-sustaining employment.  If we are to make headway on employment, we need more people of enterprise.  One of the crucial elements in getting such business on their feet is &lsquo;seed capital&rsquo;.  Understandably, getting capital for business start-ups in high risk sectors is not easy, although the State agencies play an important role in that context.  In renewing the business expansion scheme, now focused firmly on the high-risk sectors, and opening it up to a wider pool of investors, my aim has been <Col N="1514" /> to improve the flow of equity capital to such business.  As I have indicated, I have also included in the special investment account arrangements and inducement, to the savings institutions to take more interest in this area.</P>
    <P>I am aware, however, that the crucial factor in many business start-ups is the owner's own capital injection.  This is an area at which I will be looking in the Finance Bill together with the question of incentives for employee investment.  It will be understood that, given the capacity for many well-intentioned tax incentives to be transformed into &lsquo;tax shelters&rsquo;, resulting in a loss of revenue for little real economic benefit, any action in this area needs very careful consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Disability Benefit</i>
    </P>
    <P>The 1992 Finance Act included a provision to enable specified social welfare benefits to be made reckonable for tax purposes.  To bring this into effect, a commencement order must get the approval of the House.  I propose that from 6 April next all disability benefit will be reckonable for tax purposes.  A draft commencement order is being laid before the House today and a motion on the order will be taken as soon as possible.  For those in employment, the system of taxation will involve their tax free allowances being reduced by the amount of DB paid.  It will also mean that no tax refunds will be paid while such people are claiming DB.  For those not in employment, arrangements are being put in place between the Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners to allow taxation, where appropriate.  Whether taxation liability will actually arise in a particular case will of course, depend largely on whether the recipient has any other income and the amount of that income.  The estimated yield from this change is £10 million in 1993.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Stock Relief for Farmers</i>
    </P>
    <P>The present system of stock relief for farmers is due to expire on 5 April 1993. I will examine over the next month the <Col N="1515" /> question of the possible continuation of this relief in the light of all relevant factors, including changes in the Common Agricultural Policy.  An announcement will be made on the matter prior to the commencement of the next year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tax Clearance for licences</i>
    </P>
    <P>In last year's budget I announced my intention to extend the tax clearance arrangements to applications for licences.  The measures in the Finance Act, 1992, which concentrated on liquor retailers' licences issued by the Revenue Commissioners, have proved very successful. I now propose to further extend the tax clearance requirements to other excise licences issued by Revenue.  The extension will apply in 1993 to bookmakers and certain gaming licences.  In the case of licences for auctioneers, hydrocarbon oil and LPG vendors and dealers in spirits, beer and wine and other gaming licences, it will not apply until 1994 as the legislation in the 1993 Finance Bill will not be passed in time to allow a smooth introduction in relation to the 1993 issue of licences.  This measure is expected to yield £2 million in 1993.</P>
    <P>The extension of tax clearance to other public licences is being considered in my Department.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Overall effect of Income Tax measures</i>
    </P>
    <P>In line with the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership in Government, I have made every effort in the income tax area to protect the low-paid, particularly families.  The personal allowance is being increased.  The standard rate band is being extended for the sixth budget in succession and is now 63 per cent wider than it was in 1987.  The increase in exemption limits will be of further benefit to the lower-paid taxpayer whose position has been substantially improved over the past few years.  Some 13,500 taxpayers with 12,000 children will be exempted by the changes, and a further 14,200 taxpayers with 14,700 children will be brought into marginal relief. We have thus gone some way towards <Col N="1516" /> meeting the income tax objectives set out in the Programme for Government.  The overall income taxation package I have mentioned will, notwithstanding the new temporary levy, cost £8 million in 1993.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the area of capital taxation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Taxes</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>Farm Transfers</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government wants to encourage the early transfer of farms to young farmers. To help meet this objective, I am allocating £1 million to finance the cost of the EC early retirement scheme this year. The rate of European Community part funding of the scheme will be 75 per cent. The details of this scheme are currently being finalised and will be announced by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, as soon as he has received the necessary EC approval for the scheme.</P>
    <P>In line with the commitment contained in the Programme for Government, I propose to increase agricultural relief in respect of capital acquisitions tax on gifts from 55 per cent of eligible assets with a ceiling of £200,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to 75 per cent of eligible assets with a ceiling of £250,000. All farmers with potential liabilities to capital acquisitions tax will be able to benefit from this change which should have a positive impact on the land transfer environment for the family farm.  The enhanced relief, which will be provided for in the Finance Bill, is estimated to cost £0.3 million in 1993 rising to an annual cost of £1 million after a number of years.  I am confident that these two measures will make a significant contribution to the structural reform of farm holdings and assist the early transfer of farms to the younger generation.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Taxation of Inheritance</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Programme for Economic and Social Progress contains a commitment <Col N="1517" /> to increase the tax yield from capital taxes.  A number of changes have been made over the last few years to rationalise capital taxes and ensure a fairer distribution of the tax burden.  However, it remains the position that many inheritances pass from one generation to the next without incurring any tax liability. While full taxation of these inheritances might not be warranted, it is certainly true that in current economic circumstances a small charge can easily be justified.  It is therefore proposed to introduce a 2 per cent probate tax to be payable on all estates valued at more than £10,000.  The tax will apply to all assets passing on inheritance, except the family home where that is inherited by the spouse of the deceased.  Hardship provisions, similar to those which already exist for capital acquisitions tax, will apply to this tax.  The tax will come into effect in respect of deaths occurring after the date of passing of the 1993 Finance Act and is estimated to yield about £6 million in 1993 and about £12 million in a full year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It has come to my attention that two significant avoidance schemes have been devised by certain wealthy taxpayers to reduce or eliminate the capital acquisitions tax charge which would otherwise arise on the transfer of their assets.  I intend to ensure that there is no possibility that such schemes will have the intended effect.  I am proposing therefore to make certain changes to counter these schemes which will take effect on and from today.  The detailed legislation will be included in the Finance Bill.  Firstly, the valuation method for shares in private non-trading companies for capital acquisition tax purposes is being changed from a &ldquo;winding-up&rdquo; value <Col N="1518" /> to a &ldquo;market value&rdquo; basis.  Secondly, the existing provisions which seek to ensure that capital acquisition tax on a gift cannot be avoided by incorporating a gift within a sale are being extended.  More details of the changes are contained in the Principal Features of the Budget.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Tax clearance for Residential Property Tax</i>
      </P>
      <P>The Finance Bill will provide for a system of tax clearance relating to residential property tax.  This is in order to ensure that persons selling a residential property which may be liable to Residential Property Tax have met their obligations in that regard.  From now on, anybody selling a residential property valued above the residential property tax threshold will have to provide the purchaser with a certificate from the Revenue Commissioners stating that the seller's residential property tax liabilities relating to the property have been paid.  If such a certificate is not forthcoming, the purchaser will be required to deduct an amount from the purchase price and remit it to the Revenue, where it would be held on account against the eventual settlement of the vendor's residential property tax liabilities.  The amount to be deducted will be the full residential property tax calculated on the purchase price multiplied by the number of years that the vendor has owned the property, up to a maximum of five years.  I wish to emphasise that this measure is directed at improved compliance, not at increasing any householder's Residential Property Tax liability.  It is expected that this measure will yield about £500,000 in 1993 rising to about £1 million a year subsequently.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Stamp Duty</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to make three changes relating to stamp duty.  The stamp duty levied on non-life insurance policies is being increased from 1 per cent to 2 per cent with immediate effect.  This change will yield an estimated £9 million in 1993 and £11 million in a full year.  This increase in the charge, however, will not mean a cost increase for policy-holders relative <Col N="1519" /> to the position in 1992, as the special 1 per cent levy on these policies in respect of the Insurance Compensation Fund terminated on 31 December 1992.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the stamp duty on new houses, there is an anomaly at the upper end of the new house market whereby estate houses with a floor area over 125 square metres attract a stamp duty charge on the full house price, whereas for individually constructed houses, stamp duty is usually payable only on the site value of the property. In order to rectify this situation, I am proposing to base the stamp duty charge for all new houses over 125 square metres on the site value only but subject to a minimum site value of one quarter of the total house value.  The stamp duty exemption for new houses up to 125 square metres will remain.  This change, which will take effect from tomorrow, will mean a considerable reduction in the duty payable on new estate houses in excess of 125 square metres.  This will be of benefit to families needing more spacious accommodation and should also give a boost to this segment of house building, thereby helping employment. The cost is estimated to be £1 million in 1993 and £1.3 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>I am also proposing a technical amendment to the stamp duty provisions in relation to ATM cards to ensure that the duty is payable by all banks in 1993.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Company Taxation</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As this House will be aware, one of the factors contributing to the budgetary difficulty in 1993 is the impact on Exchequer cash-flow of adjustments to certain features of our tax system necessitated by the single European market.  A measure taken to avert a possible outflow of funds from the economy on the abolition of exchange controls was the making available to companies of DIRT-free deposit facilities in Ireland.  This took effect from 1 January last.  While the liability <Col N="1520" /> to tax on deposit interest is not affected, the Exchequer is at a cash-flow loss arising from the fact that companies will not now be required to pay the tax until well after the end of the accounting period in which the income arose.  For the calendar year 1993, the tax revenue from the corporate sector as a result of this change will be down by some £35 million.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the VAT charge at point-of-entry on goods sourced in other Community member-states means a shortfall in Exchequer receipts in 1993 of some £200 million.  I have made it quite clear that a fall in revenues of this magnitude could simply not be countenanced and that I would have to look to other aspects of the VAT payment system to cover that cost.  However, even taking into account the intended replacement measures, there will be a net shortfall of some £25 million in VAT receipts at the end of 1993.  This figure, in fact, understates the repercussions in that it ignores the adverse effect on intra-year VAT cash-flow.</P>
    <P>Since the Exchequer loss is the business sector's gain, I feel that it is reasonable to look to the tax payment arrangements for the corporate sector as a means of securing a partial offset to these cash-flow losses.  Accordingly, it is now proposed to align the payment date for mainstream corporation tax, currently payable seven months after the end of the accounting period, with that for advance corporation tax which is payable six months after the end of the accounting period.</P>
    <P>The change will take place in respect of all accounting periods on or after 1 May 1993.  The once-off Exchequer yield from this new arrangement is estimated at £37 million for this year.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate that this measure, viewed in isolation, will add to the financing requirements of the corporate sector, I would emphasise that it must be seen in the context of the benefits flowing to that sector as a whole from the other changes I mentioned.  I would stress also that it does not entail any increase in the overall tax burden on business, merely <Col N="1521" /> an acceleration of payments; indeed, the great majority of companies will not be affected in 1993.  Moreover by aligning the payment dates for corporation tax and advance corporation tax, compliance costs will be reduced overall for the corporate sector as, balancing payments apart, all corporate tax liabilities will be accounted for on a single date.</P>
    <P>I should say, at this point, that I am not asking the corporate sector for any contribution, other than in respect of cash-flow, to budgetary correction this year.  I am sure that those affected will recognise that this course is clearly preferable to the alternative, namely a definitive increase in taxation on companies or otherwise, or an addition to the level of Exchequer borrowing.  Neither of these alternatives would be in the wider interests of the economy.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Urban Renewal Incentives</i>
    </P>
    <P>In regard to the urban renewal incentives, it has come to my attention that difficulties are being experienced in a number of cases in meeting the foundation-laying deadline of end-May 1993 in respect of new construction projects.  In the interest of assisting the construction sector and promoting urban renewal and employment in the areas affected, I have decided to extend the deadline for the laying of foundations by six months to end-November 1993.  To allow for the orderly completion of late-starting projects, I am extending the final deadline for the urban renewal incentives to 31 July next year.  I must emphasise, however, that there is no question of extending these deadlines further.</P>
    <P>
      <i>General Background to Indirect Tax Policy</i>
    </P>
    <P>I turn now to indirect taxation.  As well as responding to domestic requirements, recent budgetary policy in this area has had to have particular regard to the Community dimension.  To the extent possible, efforts were made to ensure that, in order to maximise the wide economic benefits which full and immediate participation in the internal market would convey, domestic action was broadly consistent <Col N="1522" /> with the emerging agreements at Community level.</P>
    <P>The combination of these past initiatives and the comprehensive programme of legislative and administrative measures put in place during 1992 meant that the changeover to the new internal market arrangements from 1 January last went smoothly and with a minimum of disruption.  Trade with our Community partners is now moving freely without reference to tax-related border checks. New systems are in place for charging and collecting the taxes involved.  Private citizens have virtually unrestricted entitlements when purchasing goods for their own use in other member states.  At this point, I wish to place on record the Government's appreciation of the co-operation and assistance received from the business community and their representatives throughout the economy. This greatly facilitated the entire process. A special word of thanks is in order for the officials of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners for the part they have played in managing these fundamental changes.  The contribution of the motor industry in the introduction of the vehicle registration tax is also appreciated.</P>
    <P>I will now outline my indirect tax proposals for this budget.</P>
    <P>In regard to VAT, the measures I am announcing, in addition to fulfilling their primary purpose in raising extra revenue for budgetary consolidation, will be consistent with the provisions of the Community Directive on VAT rates adopted last October, will effect a considerable simplification and consolidation of the rating structure, and will take particular account of our employment needs.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Reduced Rates</i>
    </P>
    <P>To alter the VAT system in a way consistent with these considerations primarily requires changes to the existing 10 to 16 per cent rate categories.  My intention is also to draw on the flexibility inherent in EC law to maintain reduced rating for the great majority of those activities currently at the 10 and 12.5 per cent rates.  However, it is necessary to look at this area for a contribution <Col N="1523" /> towards budgetary balance.  Accordingly, from 1 March, these two rates will be consolidated into a single 12.5 per cent rate.  Among the areas affected will be hotel and holiday accommodation, newspapers, building services and short-term car-hire.  I will have more to say about the latter two in a moment but, before I turn to them, I want to assure tourism interests that the increase in respect of accommodation and short-term car-hire will not affect contracts already entered into at the existing VAT rate.</P>
    <P>EC law requires a fundamental change to the VAT treatment of building services. A division has ultimately to be made between house building, which may continue at a reduced rate, and other building, which must become subject to the standard rate.  I do not, however, propose to introduce this distinction at this point.  Nevertheless, as part of the move to a single reduced rate, building will become liable at the 12.5 per cent rate from 1 March.  I will ensure that the local authority new house-building programme and the voluntary housing programme are not adversely affected by the rate increase.  Because of the effect that this increase will have on the cost of new homes, I am also increasing the first-time buyer's grant from £2,000 to £3,000. In addition, provision will be made to cater for situations where contracts have already been signed by new house-purchasers.</P>
    <P>Finally, in this area, I am proposing that poured concrete and concrete blocks will be standard-rated, also from 1 March.  This measure will be of assistance to building enterprises which meet their tax obligations and face unfair competition from black economy activity within the sector.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The 16 per cent rate</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Community agreements permit the application of only one rate in excess of an agreed standard rate minimum level of 15 per cent.  Accordingly, our current 16 and 21 per cent rates cannot continue to co-exist legally.  Since budgetary circumstances dictate that, this year, the <Col N="1524" /> national standard rate must remain at 21 per cent, a range of 16 per cent rated activities will be increased to that level from 1 March.  These include telecommunication services, adult clothing and footwear, auto-LPG and certain professional services related to farming.</P>

I regard it as inappropriate in the present difficult employment situation to increase these to the standard VAT rate, even though that is what Community law eventually envisages.  Accordingly with effect from 1 March, this group &mdash; which includes activities such as garage services, repair and maintenance services and various personal services, including hairdressing &mdash; will revert to the 12.5 per cent rate.</P>

      <P>We debated this issue recently.  I do not think it takes 10,000 people to make Marietta biscuits but it affects a huge number of jobs.  I need hardly say that I expect to see this substantial tax reduction translated into an early price cut for the consumer.  In taking this measure, I must also emphasise to the remainder of the business community whose food products are standard-rated that this is an entirely exceptional concession for the areas involved and does not represent a precedent in regard to their goods.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Car Hire Sector</i>
      </P>
      <P>The importance the Government attaches to the development of tourism, as a sector that can make a significant contribution to employment growth, is clear from our programme.  The role of the car hire sector in facilitating this expansion is also recognised.  Last year, I took an initiative which boosted the supply of cars available for hire to tourists in the peak season and I also ensured that this sector was not adversely affected by the introduction of vehicle registration tax.  On this occasion, I propose to address, in a more fundamental way, both the peak season shortage issue and the wider viability problems within the sector, while also respecting the EC requirement that the standard rate of VAT must be applied to short-term car hire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to introduce a scheme of partial repayment of vehicle registration tax or excise in respect of cars being disposed of from the short-term hire fleet from 1 September next.  This initiative will ensure that so long as vehicles remain within the hire fleet, they will effectively no longer bear any VAT or vehicle registration tax.  Full details of the scheme will be included in the Bill.  In association with this relief, I propose to increase the VAT rate on short-term car hire on a phased basis.  The consolidated 12.5 per cent rate will apply over the period from 1 March to 31 August 1993, thus covering <Col N="1526" /> the peak tourism season; the definitive move to standard rating will take place on 1 September next.  Pre-existing contracts for short-term hire will be exempted from these increases.</P>
    <P>This package, while it should eventually be broadly revenue neutral, will improve the fiscal environment for car hire operators significantly on an ongoing basis.  It means that the crucial business input for the sector will enjoy effective freedom from taxation, apart from normal road tax.  In terms of the economics of peak season supply, a situation where taxation is levied on revenue from hiring, while being effectively removed from the cost end of the equation, is the optimum.  Indeed, since the VAT treatment is governed by EC law, this represents the limit of what can be done in the fiscal area to underpin the viability of car hire.</P>
    <P>As far as 1993 is concerned, the arrangements I am proposing will involve an Exchequer cost of £3 million.  Of course, the counterpart of this cost is a similar cash injection for the sector. Given these additional resources and the fundamental improvement in their fiscal position, I expect the industry to respond by ensuring that capacity for the coming tourism season is sufficient.</P>
    <P>I want to make it absolutely clear that the Government is not prepared to entertain any suggestion regarding the temporary importation of motor vehicles for this sector.  Whatever apparent attractions this may have as a means of ensuring peak season supply, I am convinced that this approach is not in the interests of the car hire sector itself and is certainly contrary to those of the wider domestic motor trade as well as of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Farmers' Flat Rate Refund</i>
    </P>
    <P>The level of farmer's flat rate refund is reviewed annually on the basis of macro-economic statistics for the farming sector for the previous three years, as is provided for in EC law.  On this occasion, taking account of favourable VAT adjustments in recent years and movements in agricultural outputs and inputs, the refund falls to be revalued to 2.5 <Col N="1527" /> per cent with effect from 1 March.  This revised rate will continue to compensate farmers fully for the VAT borne on their purchases.</P>
    <P>
      <i>VPE</i>
    </P>
    <P>Finally, we have to face the fact that one consequence of the elimination of border checks on intra-Community trade is a £200 million cash flow loss to the Exchequer from the abolition of VAT at point of entry.  Measures with the aim of ensuring that this loss did not impact fully on the annual Exchequer accounts were announced by the Government last November but not proceeded with in the No. 2 Finance Act enacted in December. The main element in this regard was the introduction of an advance VAT payment for large remitters towards the end of this year.  I shall be including these measures in this year's Finance Bill as, more than ever, overall budgetary circumstances preclude the option of the Exchequer absorbing the shortfall.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Excise Duties</i>
    </P>
    <P>I now come to excise duties.  As with VAT, the principal legislative provisions of the Internal Market were put in place in 1992 and are in operation since 1 January last.  However, a number of rate related issues remain to be settled and I am taking this opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Heavy Fuel Oil</i>
    </P>
    <P>Excise duty rates on oil, tobacco and alcohol products must now respect EC-wide minimum rates of duty.  In the main, Irish duty rates are already compatible with these minima; an exception concerns heavy fuel oil.  In order to comply with the EC rules, I am replacing the current dual duty structure applying to this fuel when used by industry and in the generation of electricity with a single rate of duty set at the minimum EC rate.  In consequence, the duty on heavy fuel oil when used by industry will be increased by 1p per gallon, but will fall by 2.5p per gallon when used in electricity generation; this latter reduction will facilitate cost containment within the ESB.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1528" />
      <i>Pipe Tobacco</i>
    </P>
    <P>Internal Market rules dictate that a single rate of duty must apply to all pipe tobaccos.  This will require the amalgamation of our current three duty categories. The new rate will be based on the weighted average of the three current rates.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Low Alcohol Products</i>
    </P>
    <P>In the area of alcohol taxation, one side effect of Internal Market changes has impacted adversely on wine based coolers, spritzers and the like.  These products must now be taxed by reference to volume, as is the case for wine.  As things stand, they are charged with the same rate of duty as ordinary wine, even though they may contain only one-third the amount of alcohol for a given volume. In order to rectify this inequity, I propose to avail of an optional provision in the EC rules which allows member states to reduce rates of duty for certain low alcohol products.  Accordingly, I am introducing a reduced rate equivalent to one-third the standard wine rate for relevant products.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Liquified Petroleum Gas</i>
    </P>
    <P>In order to maintain the competitiveness of auto LPG with other road fuels in the context of the VAT increase I announced earlier, I am reducing the excise duty on the product by 5.5 pence per gallon from 1 March.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Gaming-Amusement Machines</i>
    </P>
    <P>The House will recall that a new excise licence for amusement machines was introduced last year.  In response to representations which I have received from trade interests, I propose to make two changes in order to reflect more accurately the needs of operators particularly in seaside resorts.  First, the commencement date for the three months' high season licence will be brought forward to 1 June. Second, a new category of licence will be introduced combining coverage of a six month period from 1 March and weekends and public holidays outside this period; the charge for this licence will be £60 per annum.  Finally, in the context of <Col N="1529" /> the Finance Bill, I will be looking at a number of technical issues in this general area.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Mainstream Excises</i>
    </P>
    <P>I cannot leave excise duties without looking to this tax head for some additional revenue contribution in the very difficult budgetary circumstances prevailing.  The increases which I will announce will take effect from midnight tonight.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tobacco Products</i>
    </P>
    <P>I propose to increase the tax on cigarettes by 10p per packet of 20; <i>pro rata</i> increases will also apply to other tobacco products, apart from the new rate of duty on pipe tobacco to which I have already referred.  I am very aware that, within the changed conditions of the Internal Market, the differences in taxation levied on cigarettes can give rise to cross Border trade diversion.  In order to protect this source of revenue and minimise the scope for commercial smuggling, it is proposed to introduce tax stamps on cigarettes. This method of controlling and collecting duty is permissible under Community law and is already in use in various forms in the vast majority of EC member states. The timing of the introduction of the stamps will depend on the completion of the necessary arrangements between the trade and the Revenue authorities.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Cider and Perry</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am also increasing the duty payable on cider and perry.  The tax on ordinary cider will be increased by 4p per pint. This will still leave those drinks taxed very favourably compared with beer and coolers.</P>
    <P>The excise duty rates for alcohol products generally have not been increased since 1989 in recognition of the heightened risk of cross-Border trade diversion within an open border environment. Regrettably, the restraint shown in taxation has not been matched on the retail price front, at least in so far as the off-licence sector is concerned.  I find it perverse in the extreme that the very group who appeal regularly to the Minister for <Col N="1530" /> Finance for leniency in taxing the products they sell should, by their own actions, consistently prejudice their own positions by their pricing behaviour over the counter.  Despite this, I will continue the restrained approach on this occasion by not imposing any duty increase on drinks other than cider and perry. However, if the industry continues to take advantage of this approach, the Government will feel fully justified in reversing the significant real decline which has occurred in the tax element of drink in recent times.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Budgetary Impact</i>
    </P>
    <P>It is estimated that the indirect taxation changes I have announced, combining VAT and excises, will yield some £81 million this year and will add 0.4 percentage points to the Consumer Price Index.</P>
    <P>
      <i>International Financial Services Centre</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that the development and success of the International Financial Services Centre continues. Already there are about 1,300 jobs in place, with many more committed. In addition, IFSC companies have also contributed to substantial employment in the accounting, legal and general services sectors in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>New entrants to the centre can be approved up to the EC deadline of 31 December 1994.  In recognition of the short time that is available to attract new entrants, a major marketing effort is under way by the IDA but also involving many IFSC companies themselves.  I would be very confident that this will lead to many more projects being approved in the two years left and that the centre will continue to grow thereafter as approved companies expand and develop.</P>
    <P>It is a measure of the success of the project that a very substantial proportion of the space in the existing buildings is now occupied.  We can look forward this year and beyond to a significant increase in the level of building and construction activity in the area, with a consequent increase in employment.  Further <Col N="1531" /> improvement in the take-up of potential and actual office space in the area can be expected as the building programme gets underway.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Post Budget Current Revenue Position</i>
    </P>
    <P>The net yield to the Exchequer in 1993 of the taxation measures I have outlined is £127 million.  When this, and the effects on revenue buoyancy of the totality of the measures announced today are taken into account, the post budget tax revenue estimate comes to £9,485 million.  When non-tax revenue of £473 million is added, total revenue comes to £9,958 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Budget Targets</i>
    </P>
    <P>On the basis of the various provisions which I have announced, the targets for borrowing for the coming year are as follows: current budget deficit: £522 million or 2 per cent of GNP; Exchequer borrowing requirement: £760 million or 2.9 per cent of GNP; and general Government deficit: £1,033 million or 3.4 per cent of GDP.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Conclusion</i>
    </P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, the Government in preparing this budget had to take account of many competing considerations and to confront many difficult choices.  It had to be a pro-jobs budget, a pro-business budget, a budget that cares for all our people, a budget that continues the discipline we have shown in recent years.</P>
    <P>It was a budget that had to be framed against an international backdrop that was generally unhelpful &mdash; in terms both of the fall-out from recent currency turbulence and of the many uncertainties on the external economic front.  As a trading nation, and especially one with a heavy debt burden, we are very exposed to the prevailing winds, which are very changeable at present.  At the same time, a strong trading performance is the ultimate source of our prosperity.  That is why, to achieve growth and the jobs that it brings with it, we must strive above all else to improve our productivity and maintain our competitiveness.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1532" /> The other crucial requirement is a set of domestic policies that are sound, consistent and clear.  We must, at the end of the day, take the world as it is and adapt our policies to suit world market conditions. To stay competitive and create a basis for future jobs we must, as a society, forego current consumption in order to finance investment.  That is the idea at the core of this budget.  The rewards from such foresight on the part of all players in the economy will be substantial indeed.</P>
    <P>This budget had, above all, to get the right balance between ensuring that economic growth is maintained at the highest level possible in the short-term and not putting at risk the conditions that are vital to long-term prosperity. Investment is the common thread.  If the business investment that is crucial to sustained long-term growth is to come about, there must be financial stability and confidence in the way our affairs are managed.  At the same time, investment represents an effective way of supporting activity in the economy.  The Government is showing a lead by the massive injection of additional capital resources this year aimed at improving many aspects of the infrastructure of the State. These projects, as well as giving many new jobs in the implementation phase, will also serve to underpin the longer term growth potential of the economy.</P>
    <P>The economic focus of this budget is firmly on what is needed to bring about a better employment performance.  This is reflected not only in its emphasis on investment but also in the methods of raising additional revenues.  By relying mainly on expenditure taxes, the need for recourse to income taxation, which is more relevant to incentive, was minimised. Indeed, within that area, I have found it possible to improve the position of the lower paid.</P>
    <P>We must never lose sight of the fact that it is only by generating economic growth that real sustainable employment can be created for our people and that the resources needed to care for the less well off in our society will be available. Nevertheless the budget has a definite and significant social dimension.  The <Col N="1533" /> position of the weaker members of our society is addressed in several respects, on both the expenditure and taxation sides.  Moreover, despite the constraints, I have been able to give significant relief to those families most affected by high mortgage interest rates.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this budget gives the highest priority to the creation and preservation of jobs, both short run and longer term; strikes an appropriate balance between fiscal prudence and maintaining <Col N="1534" /> investment and growth in the economy; gives the business community what it most needs to plan and undertake job creating investment, namely, a stable economic environment; looks to the long-term needs of the economy, in devoting very substantial resources to public sector investment; and is fair and equitable, in placing the burden of necessary adjustments on those who can bear it best, while protecting the less well of.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I commend it to this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> A Cheann Comhairle, I know it is customary for Deputies to leave their seats after the Minister's speech.  Today may I suggest, without any presumption, that this is one of those rare occasions when they might make an exception?</P>
      <P>I say this not on the basis of what I may say in this speech, but on what the Minister's speech reveals about the Government to which each of the parties has lent its name.  I suggest Deputies might make an exception not just in the interest of the democratic process, not just from the standpoint of the politics of perception, but because the Minister has by this speech drawn a number of historic dividing lines in Irish politics which may affect your and our future as Deputies, as members of our parties and as people who play a part in setting the direction which our country will take.</P>
      <P>Need I go so far as to suggest that in the future, Deputies will be adjudged as to where they choose to stand on the dividing lines, which wittingly or unwittingly, the Minister has drawn in this speech?  I know that this will not be true in the votes tonight because votes of this Government were pre-ordained in the negotiations which took place between the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, but in the minds of the Deputies on the opposite side, both Fianna Fáil and Labour, this budget will plant the seeds of doubt as to the validity of the political contract which was drawn up by their respective party leaders.</P>
      <P>Let me make it clear that I am not so naive to suggest that this is the budget that will break the new Government. However, for Deputies in both parties this, the first budget is the one which confirms and reaffirms their doubts, doubts which were based on the ultimate demarcation point of politics, i.e., whether to hold office as an objective in itself or whether to be in Government for some well defined purpose because there is no well defined purpose in this first statement of economic and social policy announced by the Minister today on behalf of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These dividing lines do not stop there <Col N="1546" /> for, in addition, the Minister's Budget Statement clearly draws a line between those on the far side of the House and on this side.  It draws a line between those who supposedly sought to break the mould of civil war politics and now find that those boundary lines define not only a question of party allegiance at the time of the Treaty, but most of all continue on the basis of a commitment shared between my party and others, to the concept of the ideal of a just society.  I do not mean, so early in this term of Government, to criticise the Tánaiste and his party, nor, indeed, certain elements of Fianna Fáil.  I merely suggest to the Tánaiste, to his Ministers and backbenchers that, for reasons which might have appeared appropriate before Christmas, they have done the wrong thing for the wrong reasons.</P>
    <P>They have gone into coalition with a party to which they owe no instinctive allegiance, a party who has operated on the basis of a corporatism based on the political thinking of the 1960s, who favour the haves, the possessors, those who are permitted to be involved in our society rather than on the totality of our citizens, which cannot be defined by class, sector, interest or involvement in institutions.  In short, the Labour Party has joined the party of the big battalions while professing to be the party of the small man and woman.  Not only did the Labour Party do the wrong thing, but, as I said, they did it for the wrong reasons.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Budget Statement clearly demonstrates again that we are living in a society which has been suffocated by a false consensus, where creativity and initiative are covered by a thin veneer of political platitudes which mask fundamental disagreement, where the reality of debate takes place outside the Oireachtas in bodies and institutions which are a product of the past.</P>
    <P>Most fundamentally of all, the philosophy behind this budget is one which treats ordinary people as subjects rather than as citizens, who must receive the policy rather than participate in its formulation.  Ultimately the fact must be faced that more than any other party or <Col N="1547" /> movement in this country Fianna Fáil is the party of democratic centralism.</P>
    <P>Perhaps most critical of all this budget makes no real concessions to poverty.  It is one that effects no real reform of the social welfare system.  Its provisions are mainly for those who are in the lifeboat rather than those who cling to the wreckage of our social welfare system.  It is a budget which caters for those who are sheltered, rather than those exposed to the storm.</P>
    <P>The Government in itself means well. By and large its principal personalities are nice people.  They mean well.  The Programme for a Partnership Government means well.  It is one of the longest catalogues of good intentions ever produced by a Government entering office. Yet this well intentioned group, with their well intentioned document, gives no impression whatsover that they will address in any way the mounting and frightening problems facing our people, which will have to be addressed over the next four years.  This is because the Administration lacks a sense of direction. Above all else, it lacks a coherent economic and social programme which will restore the country and its people to a proper sense of pride, which would provide the resources to begin to restore social justice and provide equal opportunities for all.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party in Opposition concentrated on style and on public relations, rather than on substance.  This led to electoral success, but left them at the negotiation table with Fianna Fáil without an economic policy.  As a consequence, the well meaning aspirations of the Labour Party were attached to the Fianna Fáil so-called policy &mdash; to maintain a strong currency; to refuse to devalue; to keep down borrowing; to introduce progressively lower Exchequer borrowing requirements; to reduce the debt/GNP ratio; to keep interest rates down; and to reduce tax rates.  Whatever were the merits of that policy in the past, it has now been jettisoned by the Government. The pound has been devalued. Unfortunately, on this question the Minister <Col N="1548" /> has added a veneer of a public relations <i>débacle</i> to the substance of a political and economic catastrophe.</P>
    <P>We are no longer regarded as having a hard currency, but one which is subject to the vagaries of sterling.  This budget doubles the implicit borrowing requirement to over £1 billion.  The debt/GNP ratio will rise by five or six points over last year.  The principal message of this budget is that, while well meaning, the Labour Party have no economic policy. They have joined a party that has abandoned their policy.  Just six weeks into the life of this Government, the country is already adrift.</P>
    <P>I should now like to look briefly at the fundamental targets underpinning this budget.</P>
    <P>On 1 January 1992 &mdash; just over 12 months ago &mdash; the national debt was IR£25,391 billion.  By 1 January 1993 this had grown to IR£26,345 billion.  After devaluation on the first day of this month, the national debt was IR£27.400 billion. Today's budget will add another £1 billion to that.  Having increased the national debt by IR£2 billion in 12 months, the Government now proposes to increase it by a further IR£1 billion. The Minister will argue that his total borrowing is less than the figure I am quoting.</P>
    <P>I do not trust the fundamental arithmetic of this budget.  Significant items of expenditure to which the Government will be committed in the course of the year are omitted.  Despite the promises made by the Government and the Labour Party, despite the fact that the Labour Party gained seats by the promises they made, there is no provision for extra equity for Aer Lingus either in the Book of Estimates or in this budget.  If the Government is to support Aer Lingus &mdash; whatever the total equity injection may be &mdash; at least IR£100 million will have to be provided in 1993, and, if the Government keep their word, this will be provided by way of a Supplementary Estimate, which will be added to the borrowing requirement.</P>
    <P>There is no provision for the Christmas bonus in these figures.  I presume the <Col N="1549" /> Government will pay it, another £35 million omitted from the arithmetic.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has informed me in reply to a parliamentary question yesterday and I quote:</P>
    <P>there is no agreement between the social partners not to make payments under the local bargaining clause of the pay agreement which forms part of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  If a 3 per cent payment was made across the public service it would cost the Exchequer £120 million annually.</P>
    <P>There is no provision in the Estimates or in the budget for any payment whatsoever under the local bargaining clause or for extra payments which will arise in 1993 from the decision of the European Court on equality.  A figure of IR£150 million is included in the budget, in a throw-away sentence, for the sale of State assets, as yet unspecified.  A figure of IR£100 million is inserted in the Minister's Budget Statement attributed to savings on the part of the National Treasury Management Agency, another throwaway sentence, means unspecified.</P>
    <P>I also suspect some of the provisions for capital expenditure in this budget.  It seems to me that the matching amounts of Government expenditure required to draw down the Structural Funds in 1993 have been artificially reduced by substituting the criteria for drawing down Cohesion Funds and applying this to the remainder of the Structural Funds.  I doubt very much if this is in accordance with what we have agreed with the European Commission.  Be that as it may, it is clear that the actual Exchequer borrowing requirement announced by the Minister in his Budget Statement today has been artificially reduced and does not cover the level of expenditure to which the Government is committed in 1993. This is a regression to the worst practices of the Fianna Fáil Government of 1981 when the Book of Estimates was rigged for political purposes.  It will not inspire confidence or encourage the markets to reduce interest rates.</P>
    <P>What else is included in this budget <Col N="1550" /> to reduce interest rates?  I welcome the provisions announced by the Minister to relieve mortgage holders.  I point out that the total cost is £17 million and the commitment of the Minister for Finance today is about one-third of what was promised during the election campaign. It is a quite restrictive provision, but it is welcome.  What provision is here for the business sector and the extraordinary interest rates they are currently suffering, which are having a detrimental effect on the economy?  What we need are not palliatives to relieve people under pressure but a strategy which will reduce interest rates so that the economy can thrive again.  There is no indication in the Minister's speech that the 3 per cent increase in interest rates imposed upon us last autumn will be out of the system in the near future.  We are still suffering in relation to the differential of over 6 per cent between the rates in the United Kingdom and the rates here.  All around us there are examples of business closing down, putting workers on short-time and on week on, week off basis mainly because the situation in relation to the exchange rate was mishandled by the Minister and the Taoiseach.  This has led to astronomical interest rates.</P>
    <P>It will become clear in due course whether the Minister is being economical with the truth; in the meantime, the good intentions remain.  The Don Quixotes of the Labour Party still ride forth every morning to combat evil and rescue maidens in distress, while the Sancho Panzas of Fianna Fáil still plod along behind, all tilting at windmills.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech is a sad document, a manifesto of despair, an open admission by the Government that it no longer has the faintest notion of how to restore confidence, to recommence growth and, most important, how to put 350,000 people who are now unemployed back to work.  In the business section of <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> last week Paul Tansey went into some detail in projecting unemployment figures for the remainder of the decade.  I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of his figures. He showed <i>inter alia</i>, that the numbers <Col N="1551" /> registered as out of work had risen by more than 68,000 in the past three years.  He also referred to a recent study by the economic consultants, DKM, which showed that additions to the domestic labour force would number 15,000 annually up to the year 2001 based on the assumption that the level of emigration would be 15,000 annually also.  They went on to say that if the rate of emigration is reduced to 10,000 a year annually, they calculate that the labour force would increase by 20,000 a year over that span. Mr. Tansey concludes that Ireland will reach the millennium encumbered with an unemployed register of more than 400,000 people and I defy anyone to challenge these figures.  It is a frightening prospect and this problem is not addressed in the budget.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Against that background of a projected colossal increase in unemployment figures, what has the Government done?  It has not shown any initiative.  The Government <Col N="1552" /> has reannounced the expenditure of Structural Funds, put it through the public capital programme announced last week and today by way of the jobs fund, but what has it done to encourage business? It has once again put taxes on jobs; a levy of 1 per cent will be payable on all income over £9,000.  This represents a payroll tax.  It has also raised the ceilings in respect of the employee and employer elements of PRSI from £19,000 to £20,000.  It has increased VAT rates and abolished the lower rate &mdash; the 10 per cent rate has been increased to 12.5 per cent &mdash; and abolished the 16 per cent rate while the standard rate of 21 per cent still remains.  Most of the goods and services which were subject to the 16 per cent rate will now be subject to the standard rate of 21 per cent.  Can the Government not see that if we put a tax on jobs, there would be fewer jobs and that if we increase VAT rates there would be a reduction in business activity?  The retail trade is already on its knees but what has the Minister done?  He put extra taxation on it.</P>
      <P>It was our hope that we would have a vibrant tourism industry but what has the Minister done?  Having regard to the fact that the brochures already have been published and circulated throughout the world, he increased the VAT rate on the fundamental tourist products from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent and said that if one has signed a contract, it will not apply. Who would have signed a contract at this time of year?  When similar changes were made in previous budgets they did not take effect until the autumn.  Certainly, there are identifiable measures in this budget which will lead to jobs being destroyed but there are no identifiable measures in this budget which will lead to job creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has rewarded the sheltered sector of the economy and punished the exposed sector in its Programme for Government, the Book of Estimates and again today.  I have great respect for the public sector but even it knows that government of the public sector, for the public sector and by the public sector is not possible, as it is self-evident <Col N="1553" /> that the resources on which the public sector relies can only be produced by a strong, energetic enterprising sector.</P>
    <P>An overvalued currency, extraordinary high interest rates, uncompetitive input costs, an inflexible labour market and a Government for all its good intentions, which has done more to destroy confidence in the first six weeks of its administration than any of its predecessors do not provide the environment for economic growth which is a prerequisite to the creation of jobs.</P>
    <P>We will prosper, as a nation, if we can produce more goods and services and sell them competitively abroad.  We will create more jobs if we put our people to work in producing more goods and services and selling them more competitively. A proper jobs policy would include everything that encourages this and exclude everything that runs counter to this objective.  Therefore, is it not self-evident that competitiveness must be restored to the export sector and that the competitiveness of all sectors must be improved?  Recent events, ranging from the relocation of a Hoover manufacturing plant from Scotland to France and the competition between Galway and Ayr for the main European Digital facility, which the Government handled abysmally, show that, despite the theory of the Single Market, economic nationalism is rampant again in Europe.  We can only improve our position by improving our competitiveness.</P>
    <P>There is no mystery about the way it should be done.  Like many of my colleagues, including Members on the other side of the House, I have set out the agenda on numerous occasions and it is to be found, in its most succinct form, in the Culliton report.  If the provisions of the Culliton report were implemented, with the Fine Gael proposal that the employer and the employee elements of PRSI would be reduced to 6 per cent, there would be an immediate cut in company costs over the next four years and at least 20,000 jobs would be created.</P>
    <P>It is no longer a question of the Government not knowing what to do; it is a question of the Government knowing <Col N="1554" /> well what it should be doing and what the problems are, but being too wimpish to take the necessary decisions at the Cabinet table to restore competitiveness.  In truth, this Government is devoid of any concept as to how to shape a society in which every person counts and in which the fundamental principles of social justice and equality of opportunity are the compass points by which to steer the ship of State.</P>
    <P>It is this lack of a basic philosophy, of coherence in policy objectives, a lack of objectives and the total admission by the Government that it has already, after six weeks in power, lost its way rather than the bric-à-brac of individual proposals which make up the bulk of the Minister's speech on this occasion which is most disturbing.</P>
    <P>The Government's admission that it is making provision for a further 30,000 persons on the dole sounds the death knell for the budget.  The unemployment figure is now heading, as I said, towards 400,000 and there is scarcely a proposal in the Minister's speech that will lead to an extra job being created.  How long do members of the Government think that this state of affairs can last?  At what level of unemployment does the coherence of society become undermined?  What level of unemployment must we reach before we say this is no longer acceptable, that this is a sin against justice and that fundamental radical change is necessary?</P>
    <P>Members of this House know the problems of unemployment better than most in our community.  We come across these problems every day in our constituency work.  How many of us have knocked on doors in the early afternoon to be answered by a man or woman, once a wage earner, who is now consigned to home &mdash; where the expectation of employment has faded to hope and where that very hope has been reduced to a vague aspiration?  No one in this House believes that society can be based on a foundation stone of defeat.  Yet, that is all that is being offered today, on this significant occasion, when the first budget of a Government which has the numbers <Col N="1555" /> to last a full-term is being presented to the House.</P>
    <P>While our Constitution guarantees each citizen the fundamental right to life and liberty and the ability to pursue the normal requirements of life we, as a society, have deprived many of our citizens of the most fundamental right of all: the right to a job and the right to hope they can attain a job.  Each of us in this House has had the experience during our normal constituency work, both in urban and rural constituencies, and at election time of moving from one house to the next &mdash; where poverty is a repeating pattern &mdash; an infectious disease which deprives our people of one of the pre-requisites of citizenship in a participating society, a sense of identity, dignity and self-esteem.  We are sometimes criticised for being a country which is comfortable with aspirations towards social justice which increase as they go further from our shores.  The Labour Party is particularly adept at adopting causes in far away places.  How will we justify our own apartheid society where a national jobless figure of 23 per cent is magnified to 70 per cent or 80 per cent in the urban wastelands we have created?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I have already mentioned the problems which the increase in VAT will present for the business community and I will deal with that matter again later in my speech. Against this background of poverty and unemployment the Minister, who spoke for two hours, did not address any of the fundamental issues facing our society in this fundamental statement today.  As in the Bible, the people ask for bread and the Government gives them a stone; they ask for a job and it gives them a scheme and when the scheme runs out it gives them the dole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us examine the social welfare provisions in the budget.  I notice that some new Members of the House are asking <Col N="1556" /> why I am not dealing with the items of the budget <i>seriatim</i>&mdash; one by one.  The answer is that there is nothing to deal with in this budget because it lacks fundamental philosophy and represents a bric-à-brac of disconnected policy initiatives, most of which are simply indexing measures already in the codes.  From the middle of this year social welfare payments will be increased by 3.5 per cent. I welcome the other social welfare measures, the increase in child benefit, from next September.  The Minister has disguised his intention by making a change in the child dependant allowance regulations to claw back some of the increase, yet he has not specified what this clawback will be.  That is the totality of the proposals on social welfare.</P>
    <P>Both the Minister and the Taoiseach made a great play of the fact that we will receive £8 billion in Structural Funds over the next seven years.  However, over the next seven years, according to the Minister's figures, the Department of Social Welfare will spend approximately £30 billion. Surely there is a better way to do business and to address the needs of our society?  Will the Government introduce a programme to put people back to work?</P>
    <P>Let me give some examples to show what the Minister could have done.  It has been estimated that if a proper single market was created on this island 40,000 extra jobs could be created.  It is inconceivable in circumstances where boundaries are breaking down all over Europe and where we have reputedly had a single market from 1 January that we still do not have a proper single market on this island.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a number of concrete suggestions to the Minister.  Why, for example, can we not have a clear commitment to construct a dual carriageway between Dublin and Belfast to reduce travelling time to an hour and a quarter between the two main cities on the island?  Does he not appreciate the effect this would have on the economy as a whole?  Why can there not be an agreement with the people of Northern Ireland to provide access to the natural gas which is to be brought ashore at Skerries? <Col N="1557" /> Why can there not be an agreement with the Northern Ireland authorities to supply electricity for the Border counties, particularly Donegal, from Northern Ireland?  Why did the Minister not address the discrepancies in PAYE and PRSI allowances on both sides of the Border?  For example, why is a person who lives in Dundalk and works in Newry, not given either a personal or a PRSI allowance?  Why has this partition mentality continued?  The studies which have been carried out show that if a proper single market was created on the island, an extra 40,000 jobs could be created.  The Minister has no idea of how to create jobs, yet that option is there.</P>
    <P>I make no apologies for raising these questions because we are frequently criticised in this House for not being constructive. I am making these constructive suggestions to show that the Minister could create jobs if he had the imagination to do so.  In particular, at a time when political boundaries are crashing down throughout Europe why is he not able to take the first steps towards economic pluralism on this island?</P>
    <P>One of the worst aspects of this Fianna Fáil led Government has been to deprive people in regional areas of any sense of being participating citizens.  Rather than being citizens they have been subject to decisions made in Dublin, Brussels or at the GATT talks.  This is a budget of division, not only in this House but also between urban and rural communities. There are great expectations that the Structural and Cohesion Funds will give this country the stimulus it needs.  Certainly large amounts of money will be provided and there will be an opportunity to make significant progress, but I hope when the funds are drawn down and the Structural Funds distributed, they will not be distributed totally in accordance with the diktat from Merrion Street and that we will allow those who hope to benefit from the disbursement of Structural and Cohesion Funds to participate in the decision-making process.  We had hoped that the Government, which places such great store by the county enterprise boards, would introduce <Col N="1558" /> measures today to show clearly how this can be done.  It is self-defeating to establish a county enterprise board structure when such boards should be regionally based.</P>
    <P>There is now a peculiar situation where we have a multiple layer of bureaucracy in relation to the decision-making process. The Minister for Enterprise and Employment had before him a recommendation from the Culliton committee that the IDA be divided into two agencies, one to promote inward investment and the other for indigenous industry.  He could have left it alone or followed the advice, but he has decided to split it into two agencies and to set up a third agency to monitor these two agencies.  Where it was intended to have one board and one chief executive we will now have three boards and three chief executives.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> In addition, county enterprise boards are being established everywhere, including corporation areas.  We have also been told that the regional committees in relation to the Structural Fund will remain in place.  Furthermore, the Minister for the Environment has assured us that he will introduce a regional tier of local government.  Once again, we will have three agencies in place.  What concept of participation can there be when rural people are being prescribed a deontas and have no real say in the future of their own societies?  This multiplicity of quangos which the Minister is introducing will not bring the decision-making process closer to the people.  There is no decentralisation of decision-making, there is no returning of power to the people, structures and layers are being formed which I have no doubt will provide more opportunities of patronage and nepotism, and all this fantastic super-structure of bureaucracy will have to be paid for by the ordinary taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Progressive Democrats Party was in Government there was a philosophy on tax reform.  We may not have believed everything that was said and <Col N="1559" /> done but at least there was a coherent and consistent policy throughout that Administration's budget.  This Government has departed from that policy and I do not know the Minister's intentions in respect of personal taxation.</P>
    <P>Those who work hard in the public and private sectors are entitled to expect the fruits of their labour to be translated into higher living standards for themselves and their families.  The personal income tax code is central to this objective and I am sure thousands of people listened with dismay to the Minister's speech today. The Government is tinkering with the tax code in a dangerous manner.  The Minister is introducing a 1 per cent levy on all income.  There should be equity in the tax code and it is fundamental that such equity is matched with an ability to pay.  I object to levies because they are not focused on those with the ability to pay them.  They apply to everybody regardless of circumstances.  Account is not taken of mortgage, family size, families with two or three children in higher education or ill-health.  Everybody earning more than £9,000 must pay the 1 per cent levy and the ceiling on PRSI will be increased for people who earn £19,000 or more.</P>
    <P>We are talking about a significant amount of money, £78 million in the present tax year or £130 million in a full year.  The Minister tinkers subsequently with the tax bands and personal allowances, but that will not compensate for the imposition of the levy.  The Minister's adjustment to the tax bands and personal allowances does not meet inflation.  They are not indexed and I have no doubt that when the <i>Principal Features of the Budget</i> is distributed we will see that the take on income tax will be at least £100 million more from the PAYE sector in 1993 than in 1992.</P>
    <P>This budget has been extraordinarily disappointing.  The Minister's economic policy was thrown into chaos three weeks ago, following a futile defence of the pound, he finally had to raise the white flag.  Our currency is soft rather than strong, our interest rates are 3 per cent <Col N="1560" /> higher than the very high level that pertained last September and there is nothing in the Minister's speech to indicate that he has any strategy to reduce them.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister introduced the most anti-business budget ever in this House and he has confirmed the worst fears of the business community by abolishing the lower VAT rate and applying the two higher rates.  That will affect the tourism industry, the retail trade and consumer spending power and will take demand out of the economy.  Even moderate economists are talking in terms of 400,000 people unemployed, which is about 30 per cent of the population. There are no measures in this budget to address the problem of unemployment or to give any indication to those at work or the unemployed, that the Government hold a firm view on how the problem should be addressed.  The Government is in the first six weeks of its period in office and, with its huge majority, could last for five years.  The Budget Statement indicates clearly that the Government hopes something will turn up because it has no idea how to address the problem.</P>
    <P>Further down the line it will see the poverty that goes with unemployment, a decline in living standards and lack of hope and confidence, as people drift into long term unemployment.  It is clear from the Minister's speech today on the Book of Estimates that between 170,000 and 200,000 people will be long term unemployed by the end of this year.  There has been no attempt to address the poverty which arises from long term unemployment, no coherent approach to social welfare or no new proposals to deal with the problem.  The Government simply decided that social welfare payments will be indexed from July as usual and next year the figure of £2.3 billion will have increased further with nothing being done to relieve the poverty contingent on unemployment.  The Government is ignoring all sections of the economy.</P>
    <P>We heard nothing today about the farming or food industries.  We heard nothing about a programme for film making or for arts and culture, where <Col N="1561" /> thousands of young graduates could have fulfilling economic and social lives.  Why was the film board not re-established? The tourism industry was not mentioned apart from an announcement of VAT increases which will have an adverse effect on it.  Not one sector of the economy was addressed in the Minister's speech today.</P>
    <P>The budgetary blueprint is supposed to set out the principles of economic and social policy of the Government for the next five years.  The Labour Party and Fianna Fáil do not have a policy and the Minister's speech today could have been delivered by an automated programme of the Civil Service.  There is no indication that anything in the Minister's speech went through the political process or that there was any real decision-making involved.  The Government has no general or sectoral policies, and the Minister made no attempt to address the frightening problems with which we are faced.  This is the first time we have had a Coalition Government made up of the Labour and Fianna Fáil parties.  What are we getting?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Today marked a significant event in the lifetime of this new Government because it is the first opportunity this Administration has had to place before the Irish people and before the House a hope for the future.  It was an opportunity for the Government, with the potential of a reasonably long term in office, to spell out the direction in which it hopes to lead Irish society.  Since we have not had evidence of anything but drift until now, I had hoped today the Government would come in here with a political clarion call marking a radical new direction for the economy and society.  There was not the slightest hint today of an attack on dependency in society and not even a hint of an appetite to attack it in future.  Overall this budget marks time.  It tinkers with the system, has no radicalism, no appetite for change and is not what the electorate voted for last November when they believed they were voting for radical change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has been adrift up to now and the budget confirms that that process will continue.  This Administration has found it difficult to work out <Col N="1563" /> who should do what in terms of basic jobs.  It has spent more time indulging in differences about Mullaghmore, ethics and registers of Members' interests than on important matters such as devaluation, Digital or getting their act together from a political point of view.  Sterling was in trouble on the money markets at the time of the election, the Irish pound had again risen to £1.04 sterling and the Dublin inter-bank money rate for one month had risen to 15 per cent.  There is no room for doubt about public policy or the challenge facing the Government in that context.  The Minister tried to square a circle and address that matter today but he left many questions unanswered.</P>
    <P>My party welcomes the stated bottom line in regard to borrowing in this budget. It could be tighter, but I will deal with that later.  Much more could have been done to control expenditure and avoid penalising further the public with higher taxation.  If the targets can hold, the markets will welcome them.  The Minister referred to a sum of £150 million from asset disposals.  In these days of political correctness and with his new colleagues in Government, he cannot call a spade a spade or a privatisation by the name we know it.  He did not specify from where this £150 million in assets would come.  It may come from elements of his third banking sector idea or from selling part of the State equity in Greencore or Irish Life.  This is not spelt out but if that is the case, I welcome it.  It is a pragmatic view in the formation of public policy.  In future budgets I hope the Government will have the ability to use the assets at its disposal and to translate them into alternatives that can be more productive.</P>
    <P>I have reservations about the 1 per cent levy.  I note that its full worth in one year would be £130 million as opposed to £78 million in this tax year.  With the potential of making £130 million next year the Minister and his colleagues will find it impossible not to maintain the levy.  That is part of this budget's arithmetic.  Unfortunately, it looks as if the 1 per cent levy will be with us for much longer than the <Col N="1564" /> remainder of this year, which is disgraceful.</P>
    <P>I have not had the benefit of seeing the budget tables today.  I take the point made by my colleague, Deputy Allen, that it would be useful if Members of the House were trusted earlier with data that can be seen on public screens around the country.</P>

      <P>There appears to be some changes in the pre-budget capital tables. I did not have a chance to examine them, but there also appears to be significant changes in the arithmetic.  I welcome the bottom line stated here, but it is the kind of bottom line that may be a chimera or real.  We will have to wait and see how it works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to compare it with one or two other points.  The Programme for a Partnership Government gave a commitment to maintain firm control of public finances so that there will be a steady reduction in the national debt to GDP ratio.  This is an overriding principle of both the Programme for Government and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> stated that the national debt to GNP ratio should move towards 100 per cent by 1993, which happened, although it has been deflected by devaluation.  This was partly to achieve a broad balance in the current budget.  The Minister accepted in this House last year that the current budget deficit should not drift beyond 1 per cent of GNP.  He also accepted that the Exchequer borrowing requirement should not be more than 1.5 per cent of GNP, but he has gone soft on that this year, apart from the large pieces of arithmetic to which I alluded earlier.  I regard <Col N="1565" /> that as a regressive move.  I do not see it in the overall economic interest and pump-priming a small open economy through public expenditure is not a valid way to do business.  The Minister is going backwards and reneging on commitments he gave to this House on other occasions.</P>
    <P>This budget was driven by one simple, obvious and direct engine.  We have more taxes, considerable borrowing and disposal of State assets to pay for spending the Government has not controlled. There are two key areas in the Government's spending Estimates.  In the pre-budget Estimates the Government provided for 30,000 more Irish people to draw the dole in 1993.  That is the bottom line in regard to employment of this new partnership Government who claimed its first priority was to attack the unemployment crisis.  The families of the Labour Party have been stuffed left, right and centre into positions of advisers, treasurers and party apparatchiks in the first bout of labour induced employment creation in this House.  My heart goes out to the Minister and Taoiseach sitting on the Fianna Fáil benches whose own indiscretions in the same area would warrant thundering editorials and lathers of indignation from the Irish media but whose Labour colleagues can slip their relatives and their apparatchiks into high paid State jobs with consummate ease without a word from the commentators who rightly persecute yourselves.</P>
    <P>Public sector pay constitutes a large element of the arithmetic of this budget. I was amused by the Minister's sense of humour when he said he wanted to maintain what he called downward pressure on public expenditure.  He did this by letting public expenditure increase by more than twice the projected annual rate of inflation.  Thank God the Minister does not have an appetite yet for increasing public expenditure if this downward pressure has the effect of increasing it by twice the projected rate of annual inflation.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that this year he will set aside over £4 billion for public sector pay and pensions.  The increase in public pay in 1993 over 1992 will be 7.4 <Col N="1566" /> per cent; the increase in public sector pay in 1992 over 1991 was 10.7 per cent.  The Minister continued in his understated way and assured us it was a matter of concern to his Government.  It was a matter of such concern that he said: &ldquo;I am not making any provision in the budget for more improvements in public service pay conditions&rdquo;.  I looked at him when he read that line and wondered how he could keep a straight face when public sector pay increases this year will be more than double the rate of inflation. Depending on the out turn inflation figure by last years, public sector pay could be ten times the rate of inflation. Yet the Minister came here today and said with a straight face he was not making any provision for further improvements in pay.</P>
    <P>The Minister waved the stick of possible increases in PRSI also &mdash; the case of the wolf at the door before the next round of <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> comes up &mdash; by telling the public service they may have to pay more.  Over the past five years, the State, paid £120 million in redundancy payments to help reduce the numbers in the public service. Yet, by one means or another the numbers in the public service have remained as high.</P>
    <P>I have met the Minister's advisers present today on more than one occasion while negotiating programmes for other Governments which proved to be less temporary than some had hoped.  I have a high respect for the quality and capacity of the Irish public service which has been reinforced by such meetings.  I have respect also for nurses, gardaí, teachers, local authority employees and others but we have got to make choices in this society about how much public pay can be confiscated by way of future choice.</P>
    <P>My preference and that of my party as we look down the road this year of renegotiating public sector pay and pay in general with a possible renewal of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is to ask whether this Government on today's evidence has the appetite and the capacity to bring in radical public service reform.  Such reform could bring <Col N="1567" /> in a well paid but leaner public service and in that way meet both the efficiency needs of the economy and the just income needs of those in the public service.  As things currently stand, without such reform, I fear we are on the threshold of the public sector pay process becoming such a millstone around our necks in terms of choice that it would block out almost entirely all of the other areas of choice which validly should be open to any Government in respect of confronting the unemployment crisis.  This is an issue which must be faced up to in the coming year.</P>
    <P>In regard to the overall state of the public finances, what will happen if we do not reach the target for privatisation or the disposal of assets, its politically correct amended title?  What will happen if the current spending Estimates are breached in the course of the year?  What will happen if some very large amount has to be set aside for Aer Lingus?  The Minister's speech does not indicate how he will pay for such a measure.  Will we let the borrowing drift?  Will we tax more or will we cut spending?  How will we pay for it?  Are we in for a prolonged period of drift in which targets will not be met and such targets may be replaced by drift?</P>
    <P>Examples of the hidden costs in regard to the public sector pay dimension were mentioned earlier.  We have seen the hidden cost in the building of Tallaght hospital in what would be the second blunder by the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin. He arrived in office and cancelled the Taoiseach' promised starting date on the building of Tallaght hospital and this morning he told us that he was increasing by 33 per cent the basic nightly charge for hospital beds for both public and private patients but with the key impact hitting the private patients.  There are 1.3 million people subscribing to the VHI in Ireland and many of them, like others, must put their names on various hospitals lists. Being a member of the VHI does not guarantee skipping every waiting list.  I wonder why the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, should spring this kind <Col N="1568" /> of ideological trap on the eve of the budget.  There is a notion that people who wish to provide for themselves by joining the VHI can be forced to pay more.</P>
    <P>This budget reflects similar narrow mindedness.  Week in, week out, for the next several weeks, one Minister after another will come into this House to explore similar proposals.  They will do that because the Minister for Finance in his Estimates said &ldquo;pay is costing me so much, welfare payments for extra unemployment are costing me so much, I have cut the rest of the Estimates to the bone&rdquo;. The first piece of bone exposed was that in relation to health matters by the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, yesterday.  In this budget we will feel the surreptitious cost of double tax and the hidden agenda cost on a weekly basis.  It will creep up on us as we find charges increasing, new charges being introduced and the hidden agenda exposing itself because the Government failed to grasp the nettle of the underlying spending problem that has driven it to its present position.</P>
    <P>In relation to capital spending, we are about to travel again down a long road which experience has shown will produce a limited return.  I do not know any blanket injunction that states it is wrong if we spend on capital development no more than on current spending.  It is all too easy to jump to the other extreme of that argument and agree that something called capital spending rather than current spending is right simply because if it is called investment it must be productive. We have a long experience in this economy of highly unproductive public capital programmes.  It was one of the bitter harvests of the late 1970s and early 1980s where we had phenomenal rates of public capital investment which produced phenomenal rates of public indebtedness, the national debt mortgage. We are still paying off the bill for that.  This year the debt repayment stands at almost £2,500 million.</P>
    <P>In respect of capital and EC Structural Fund spending, I hope the Minister's advisers will introduce some kind of capital <Col N="1569" /> project appraisal for calculating the rates of return from such spending and there should be choice in regard to alternative investments.  If there is no capital project appraisal, such spending will become politically driven and we will end up with productive investment that will not maintain sustainable growth or sustainable jobs.  If this Government spends a further £500 million &mdash; whether it is Irish taxpayers' money or EC taxpayers' money &mdash; it should provide a rational means for assessment of such spending.</P>
    <P>I agree that our transport facilities should be improved.  I am a frequent user of the railway network and I know the social and economic pros and cons about maintaining it.  When we invest in railways we create jobs in the workshops of Germany, Britain, France or Japan.  That may preserve the jobs and the quality of transport service here but when considering alternatives, what return is derived from our investments?  Someone must do the sums.  In the future, we may not get the chance to incur this level of expenditure as easily as we did in the past.  The Minister told us today that the public capital programme will increase by 22 per cent or £500 million and it will create a maximum of 3,500 jobs directly or indirectly.  The figure of £500 million for 3,500 jobs should be examined but this budget does not provide a detailed analysis of costs in this regard.</P>
    <P>Regarding taxation, apart from the explanation in regard to expenditure in the Minister's speech, there was a suggestion that the real reason we have a problem and must introduce levies, more taxes and higher VAT is the completion of the Single Market and devaluation, and if we did not have these problems we might be in a better position.  We have been told that once we accept the Single Market and devalue only once we will be over the hump, and, in that sense if one buys the Minister's logic, the Single Market is justified.</P>
    <P>Much is being made about the removal of VAT at the point of entry. This is a once off adjustment and it is neither a reason nor an excuse for increased taxation.  The Minister told this House on 15 December last that the <Col N="1570" /> inauguration of the Single European Market will involve the elimination of VAT at the point of entry but that the cash flow loss in 1993 from the VAT change should be partially mitigated by alternative measures in the VAT areas.  The bottom line cost is £25 million and that does not warrant the introduction of substantial extra taxation even if it is an element in the completion of the European Single Market.</P>
    <P>Does devaluation offer an excuse?  The Minister reminded us again today that the National Treasury Management Agency will save £100 million, and I believe that because I doubt if he would give that figure if the NTMA could not deliver. There is a notion that the devaluation costs, which after adjusting our foreign reserves and borrowings came to about £800 million, are to blame for increased taxation.  On 11 February I asked a Parliamentary Question about the net budget cost arising from the 10 per cent devaluation.  The Minister replied that as regards the main Exchequer effects of the devaluation, his Department has estimated the net cost at about £13 million in 1993.  Devaluation no more than the VAT increases announced today do not explain why there should be increased taxation.  The change in the rate of DIRT is a costly one &mdash; from the standard rate to 10 per cent.  Its full year cost will be a heavy charge on the Exchequer.  The DIRT adjustment is not a temporary arrangement, it is here to stay, and we must live with it.  Unlike VAT at the point of entry, which is a once-off tax and unlike devaluation, which we hope is a once-off, DIRT is an ongoing tax and we are stuck with it.  The Government's job is to reduce its expenditure, not to introduce a levy which it says is temporary because of the Single Market, DIRT, VAT and devaluation and then keep it in next year because of the underlying problem resulting from the change in the DIRT rate.</P>
    <P>This Government is living in a fool's paradise if it considers that more spending and more taxing equals more jobs. Something significant happened in this House in relation to the Culliton report. <Col N="1571" /> Dealing with tax reform, the Culliton report states that by removing the demoralising effect of the current tax system and removing the waste of non-productive tax avoidance activities, reform will create a far more conducive environment for productive enterprise and for more solidly based investment decisions.  In no other single area does the Government have at its disposal the tools to make as far reaching and effective a reform to support an enterprise economy as in taxation.</P>
    <P>The Government today, by its first move buried the Culliton report, it is a dead letter.  This report is not just about moving chairs between the State agencies, it never was about that.  There is no point in the Minister for Enterprise and Employment moving the chairs and coming in here to reassure us that the Culliton report is alive and well in the hands of this Administration because it is not.</P>
    <P>In an overall context this budget has not done anything in terms of job creation &mdash; and there are 302,000 unemployed. What is the Government's response?  A 1 per cent levy.  What is that levy being charged on?  It will be charged on labour, and people at work, the asset we want to do something about, and it will challenge the unemployment statistics. It will be levied on wages and earnings &mdash; and again the unearned income escapes.  It is interesting to note that if one has money in a special savings account one pays tax at the 10 per cent rate but those who earn their income by working will be hit yet again.  That is the philosophy underlying this levy and that is this Government's approach to tax.</P>
    <P>It is a disgrace that the tax hits at people earning less than the average industrial wage.  How can the Government have any credibility and tell us it cares about creating employment incentives if it brings in a smash and grab tax such as this new 1 per cent levy which will dip into the pockets of people who do not even bring home the average industrial wage?  This new lenten levy will not only outlast Lent this year but, <Col N="1572" /> because of the amount of money it can yield in a full year, is most likely to stay on our books for quite a while.</P>
    <P>Look at history.  We introduced a temporary youth levy in 1982 and we are still paying it.  Deputy Dukes and his colleagues in 1983 introduced a special income 1 per cent levy which lasted until the 1988 budget.  Having tried to uncomplicate the tax system for five years, at the first opportunity the new Administration decides to complicate it again.</P>
    <P>Today we have five different taxes on labour.  The ordinary worker pays PAYE tax, PRSI, a health contribution, an employment and training levy and from today, compliments of the new partnership Government, a new lenten levy of 1 per cent, even if one earns less than the average industrial wage.  The Minister told us today that there was no choice but to seek revenue from the income tax area, just as he plaintively told us about how he could do very little about talking to the Bundesbank while his French colleague, Monsieur Sapin, could talk in Washington with Mr. Schlesinger of the Bundesbank and point out a few things. Of course there is a choice.  The Government could choose to cut spending but they have chosen high spending and taxation as the road they wish to follow.  In saying there was no choice, and in the suggestions in the media that this levy is temporary, there is a touch of the St. Thomas Aquinas formula.  The Minister for Finance wants to be made holy, but not yet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that.  The Government increased the PRSI ceiling and did nothing radical.  It is disgraceful that a partnership Government which said it wanted to take people out of the poverty traps just skirted around the problem as if it did not exist.  This budget is an abject failure of nerve, political will and focus on the part of this Administration. On top of that, there was minor fiddling with the family income supplement.</P>
      <P>The exemption limits are a fiddler's elbow style of economics.  Due to the exemption limits, about 13,000 people were removed from the tax net from budget day, but if they work for a few months they will be sucked back into the system.  If I added the thousands who are supposed to have benefited from exemption limits since I started to read Irish budgets, none of us would be paying taxes.  This system of introducing an annual exemption limit is a fiasco and someone should advise the Minister to change it.  When one gets one's first job and exceeds the exemption limit one goes on what is called marginal relief paying the 48 per cent rate of income tax and 7.5 per cent rate of PRSI.  One also pays the new 1 per cent levy depending on one's wage.  People are trapped by a system that demands, creates and lives off dependency.  What do the politicians do?  They fiddle with the exemption limits and do nothing at all.  It is a fiddler's budget with regard to the lower paid; it is a disgrace.</P>
      <P>I will draw my remarks to a conclusion with a few brief comments on value-added tax and one or two general perspectives on employment.  On value-added tax every enterprise in the current straitened circumstances is faced with a loss of employment.  This is an attack on jobs and could have been avoided if we had made the choices on spending but this Government ignored them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the modest exclusions that have been mentioned by the Minister for Finance in some labour intensive areas. I welcome them only because they avoid creating an unemployment disaster.  As distinct from creating jobs, the Minister <Col N="1574" /> promised that in areas like hairdressing, car repairs, confectionery etc., he would not rob us of jobs.  That is useful, but it is standing still.  It is not an initiative. That is simply not being vindictive.  For that the Minister is looking for some kind of reassurance from this House that we will support it.  Clearly, it is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>On capital taxes &mdash;&ldquo;Red Richie&rdquo; must be alive and well somewhere.  I do not know where the former Minister for Finance, Richie Ryan is.  Perhaps he is still in Luxembourg.  There are echoes of &ldquo;Red Richie's&rdquo; days here today.  The Government could not resist the 2 per cent probate tax.  God bless those with little enterprises that are not located in residences. The Government will screw them for 2 per cent only because they are out there and they have not been caught yet. This is a begrudger's budget.  The budget is off the wall in terms of its incentives and its implications for small and medium sized enterprises.  I hope its provisions will not be seriously considered for inclusion in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that young farmers have been denied a write-off of the capital acquisitions tax.  The Government tinkered with it for the sake of respectability but that is all that was done.  I wonder who thought up the residential property tax.  It smacks of begrudgery. If one wants to sell a principal private residence one must get a certificate.  If one does not get the certificate from a parent, one must get it from the Revenue Commissioners in order to sell the house and get on with business.  This smacks of the begrudgers' agenda.  It is petty and in terms of its revenue implications, too petty to be bothered with politically.</P>
    <P>Today the one month bank rate rose to 15 per cent.  The Minister told us his sums are predicated on interest rates coming down; we all share his desire. However, if they do not, his sums will be inaccurate in this area too.  The Minister should continue his present policy rather than borrowing additional money.</P>
    <P>The first priority was to maintain a favourable overall climate in terms of our public finances.  To some extent that has <Col N="1575" /> been done in today's budget.  Tax reform is not a luxury, it is of vital necessity in the light of our unemployment crisis, not least in the way it interacts with welfare payments at the lower end of the scale. This Government ran away from that today.  There is no hint of radicalism in this budget.  It is a budget without imagination and is a gross failure in terms of creating employment and helping the lower paid.  There is an onus on this Government to cut costs for Irish enterprise if we are to have the enterprise culture to which it says it is committed. Perhaps Ministers will make statements on this throughout the year.  It is not even mentioned as a priority in this budget.</P>
    <P>Our marginal and average tax rates remain penally high.  This is the first occasion that a Minister for Finance has reversed a trend which was for the good of the economy and society.  It is a disgrace that so little should have been done by way of radical reform for those who earn below the average industrial wage. It is a disgrace that people on low pay are being left on the margin as a result of the fiddling with limits that I mentioned earlier.  There is a need to focus on economic growth and job creation in the enterprise and trade sector.  That is where we can develop sustainable jobs.  Greater development of small and medium sized enterprise is required.  There must be training in real workplaces rather than training schemes.  These aspects are there for the appraisal of anyone in Government or in Opposition.</P>
    <P>In its first budget, this Government has adopted a human set aside policy.  We all know about the anger of the farmers concerning tillage set aside.  The Government's talk of radicalism, attacking poverty traps, changing the standard band of taxation, which is a joke in the light of its action today, does not amount to a row of beans.  It puts to one side 300,000 or more people and tells them they are part of a human set aside policy.  The Government will offer them welfare payments and hope they will not get too upset at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>This budget lacks vision, focus and <Col N="1576" /> does not set out targets for so many issues, including fiscal policy.  The signals on public sector pay set out in this budget are so weak that the Minister, without a smile on his face, assured us that he would not allow for additional pay increases this year.  The Government, like a rabbit caught in the headlights of an oncoming car, is frightened of having to take a tough line in the forthcoming negotiations on pay, but it must adopt a strong approach if it is not to return to this House with its hands tied behind its back.  This Government has devalued itself.  We waited in hope for vision, for a radical agenda by a Government that has shown an enormous appetite for change.  Instead of the roar of a lion, we got the squeak of a mouse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget is based on the assumption of an additional 26,000 people being added to the number on the live register.  They are the Minister's figures and they represent the first major failure of this budget.  If the public had a priority it was that this budget would have addressed the problem of unemployment. A budget that admits there will be 26,000 extra people on the dole queue is a failure by any yardstick.</P>
      <P>This budget sums up the haunting memories of what happened in the early eighties.  Do we remember the early eighties? It was a period of high unemployment, high taxes and high interest rates.  We are back in that spiral again now but it is worse than anything we could have imagined.  Levies were a great feature of the early eighties as well.  They have now returned in a guise to help the unemployed.  In fact, they are no more than another smash and grab raid on the pockets of the PAYE and compliant tax paying citizens.  The Minister hopes to get a further £76 million by pretending this is not income tax, that it is merely a levy, and, as it is to help the unemployed, it would not be treasonable to oppose it. We are supposed to welcome the fact that our pockets are being rifled because it is to help the unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Minister announced as a solution, or part solution, to the scale <Col N="1577" /> of unemployment the setting up of the county enterprise boards.  This idea emerged &mdash; not in this fashion &mdash; from the all-party Oireachtas Committee on Unemployment last summer.  That committee identified that one of the greatest barriers to job creation in small enterprises in this economy was the absence of seed capital, the difficulty of getting access to equity capital and that such a fund ought to be established.  The Government said it would create such a fund, allocate £50 million to it and that it would be matched by £100 million, in a way that was never specified, from the financial institutions.  Of course, nothing happened.  The idea was lost in the internal row between the Taoiseach's Department and the then Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Taoiseach, of course, won the battle and removed responsibility for small enterprise from the control of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  He transferred it to his own Department and gave responsibility for its administration to one of his favourite Junior Ministers, Deputy Noel Treacy, who managed, during the lifetime of that Government, to set up one county enterprise board in Galway.  It never got any money, it never did anything and the Minister tells us today that he is making £25 million &mdash; not £50 million &mdash; available to the county enterprise boards.  He hopes to get matching finance from the financial institutions for £100 million without indicating how that will be done.  This is supposed to be a great step forward.  One could not contemplate a more wasteful structure for the creation of jobs than a county enterprise board system.  It has nothing in common with any unit to do with planning, such as the concept of regional planning, which would be of benefit to us.  This is based on the GAA unit of the county and is set up so that anybody who has the ear of a Government ID &mdash; better still the ear of a Minister &mdash; will get a grant for making widgets or concrete blocks in his back garden.  The fact that somebody down the road or in the next county is already making them will not be relevant.</P>
    <P>The people who thought this idea up <Col N="1578" /> are not into fancy economic concepts like displacement.  The philosophy is, if the lads get a few bob out of it, what is the harm, it keeps them happy and we are pretending to bring power to the people. It is the most wasteful concept that could have been suggested.  It is an excuse to give politicians a jar of lollipops to distribute to their supporters at local level. It is wasteful.  When the IDA had responsibility for small enterprise they knew it would be wasteful.  It was delighted to get rid of small enterprises as it considered them unsuccessful.  It has to contend with the concept of displacement and is glad to have this removed from its responsibilities in the sense envisaged here.</P>
    <P>Many people will have been expecting great things today from the social welfare aspect of the budget.  It is very sad that so many people have to live on social welfare of one kind or another.  It is an important budget for them because their expectation was that it would repeal the damage to the most vulnerable people in the community.  I am glad that Deputy McCreevy is in the House but I have bad news for the public who believe that his infamous Circular 14/92 and the rest of his cuts &mdash; dubbed by his constituency colleague Deputy Emmet Stagg, now Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, as the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo;&mdash; would be rolled back.  Deputy McCreevy has shown who is the top dog Minister in Kildare.  There is no doubt about that. He managed to pass the ball to the wing when the new Cabinet was set up.  He now has a ministry to which he is far more suited than social welfare.  He did not have a great deal of familiarity with the unfortunate people in a great many other constituencies, as well as mine, who, for example, are being disconnected by the ESB, as my colleague Deputy De Rossa highlighted in this House last week, because the community welfare officers do not have the authority or finance to assist them.  Those at the very bottom, the most vulnerable groups in the social welfare net, looked to this budget to see the Labour Party implement its commitment to roll back the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo;<Col N="1579" /> cuts.  We hope the Minister for Social Welfare in his contribution will acknowledge the attempts of Deputy De Rossa and others in this House to highlight the injustice to people who are barely able to put food on the table and who suffered the ignominy of having budget meters installed in their houses which will require the purchase of tokens at £5 per time.  When the token runs out, the electricity is cut off a few hours later.  If they happen to have a pan on the cooker and a heater switched on they are left without food or heat.  That is the reality for people caught in the poverty trap.  At a minimum people expected more from this budget. In addition people generally expected that there would be progress in meeting the targets set in the mid-eighties by the Commission on Social Welfare in terms of the priority rates for short term recipients. The Minister apologised for not being able to do anything about it.  He raised social welfare by what he estimates will be the rate of inflation, with effect from July which means that people are now worse off.</P>
    <P>The minimum the Commission on Social Welfare set in 1986 means that disability and unemployment benefit should now be £65.78.  Is anybody seriously saying in this House that a basic rate of £65.78 is exorbitant or excessive for a single person?  The Minister has recommended a rate of £55, or £60 with effect from July.  This is still more than £15 short of the recommended minimum rate.  It is a heartbreaking disappointment for people on social welfare that the Minister has not managed to make even some progress towards achieving the objectives of the Commission on Social Welfare, which reported in 1986.  In regard to income tax, of all the three card tricks that Ministers for Finance ever managed to perform on the basis of &ldquo;now you see it now you dont&rdquo;, this is the worst.  In the course of his budget speech he confessed he was sorry that on this occasion he had to look for a net contribution to revenue from income tax.  At least that is honest, it states the situation as it is because pretending that there is some kind of <Col N="1580" /> minimal marginal relief to taxpayers because of a couple of pounds on the tax bands is blatantly not the case.  After you take the special 1 per cent levy into account taxpayers are worse off.</P>
    <P>The Minister has attempted to present the budget as being in the interests of the low paid.  However, when you do the calculations, that is manifestly not the case.  The claim that he will take 13,500 taxpayers out of the tax net is not true either.  Apart from the fiscal drag, as soon as the 3 per cent increase under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is put in place &mdash; remember we are talking about people at work &mdash; most taxpayers will be back in the tax net.  This is a Houdini type attempt by the Minister to give the impression that he has done something for the low paid.</P>
    <P>This is a sackcloth and ashes budget. The Minister was wearing the ashes and he wants to put the unemployed into sack cloth.  To come in here with his ashes like some latter day North side Gandhi presenting an image of caring and compassion for the unemployed should be dubunked for the myth it is.</P>
    <P>There is a number of benchmarks against which this budget must be measured.  The main bench mark is the impact it would make on the scale of unemployment.  Nobody believes that a budget will eliminate unemployent but it should impact on the scale of the problem. In addition the backdrop to this budget was the promise by the two parties now comprising the Government during the general election.  Most hard-pressed mortgage holders will remember the very specific and definite commitment by the Minister for Finance on the question of introducing full mortgage interest relief if interest rates had not gone down by the time of the budget and that that full mortgage interest relief would be made retrospective to 6 October 1992.  That is another broken promise.  The Minister estimated that such relief would cost about £40 million in a full year.  He has provided for a complex system difficult to administer, that will give relief of about £17 million.  It is very simple to <Col N="1581" /> measure the distance between the promise and what has been done in practice.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the social welfare recipients and their expectations, also the result of promises made during the general election.  The Labour Party made clear their position.  I do not know if it is expected in this House that one should attempt to measure the promises against the practice?  Do politicians' promises mean anything any more?  After all, the Government is only five or six weeks old. People voted for this elusive phenomenon called &ldquo;change&rdquo; that swept the Labour Party into office and that had Deputy Lenihan and Deputy Bertie Ahern telling us that Fianna Fáil and Labour were really soul brothers and that, as the Tánaiste put it in his phrase, the face of Irish politics would never be the same again.  Perhaps it was appropriate that those words were uttered in the Concert Hall; perhaps they should be put to music, but to people who believe the face of Irish politics has changed forever, I have to say that I see the same old faces looking at me, the same old policies in this budget, which are no different from when Fianna Fáil were in office with the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>I am sure a number of people have filed away the promises from the Labour Party concerning the injection of equity into Aer Lingus.  In the Programme for a Partnership Government it is stated that they will &ldquo;ensure the commercial future of our national airline as part of our overall air transport policy&rdquo;.  I have read the Minister's paragraph on this a few times, but I do not understand what he means. The workers in Aer Lingus would be well advised to get their act together based on what has been said tonight.  I do not know if the Minister proposes to raid the remaining shares of Greencore and Irish Life.  That would seem to be what is at stake.  Perhaps the Minister can tell us what the provision is.  I think it is £135 million from selling off assets.  I seem to remember a promise from the junior partner that there would be no privatisation but this, presumably, refers to the remaining shares in Greencore and Irish Life.  Are they going directly into <Col N="1582" /> Aer Lingus?  There is no commitment to that effect.  There seems to be a willingness that they should be disposed of, notwithstanding the strategic influence that a company like Greencore might have in the industrial development of this country, and notwithstanding the role that a major financial company like Irish Life might have.  It seems that it would have been prudent for the Government and the Minister to remain in a position to influence and direct investment by two of the major companies in this economy. However, in order to make up the budget arithmetic and help the Minister do his three card trick, we have to sell off these shares, and there does not seem to be any objection from the Labour Party about that.</P>
    <P>It is fair to remind the House of the promises that were made during the general election because, if people did not expect that there would be major and rapid change, they did expect a better outlook for their children and for the unemployed.  The did expect an improvement on the decrepit clapped out performance of the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats Government and the cynicism, dejection and despair that it imposed in the manner of its unravelling. People expected that at least this new partnership Government would put some of our people back to work, would put some of our homeless into houses and would put some of the tax that is being wrongly levied on the PAYE sector back in their pockets and stimulate job creation as a result.  That has not happened.</P>
    <P>Many people are watching this debate this evening and a great many more are in the House listening to it, and they will note that even before the Minister for Finance got on his feet today, the Minister for Health Deputy Howlin, created public uproar by the introduction of swingeing increases in hospital charges. It is fair to say that these swingeing increases were unexpected.  I do not think the public expected them.  This is the same public that taught former Deputy Haughey a lesson about hospital charges and the decline of the health services in <Col N="1583" /> 1989 when he, Mr. Haughey, rushed back from Japan and mistaking his stature as equal to that of the emperor he had left behind, decided we would have a general election.  Now, so quickly, six weeks after coming into office, the new Minister for Health decides that we should have swingeing increases in hospital charges. The public will recall how vigorously Deputy Howlin opposed these health charges when he was a very effective health spokesman for his party.  On 28 April 1987 Deputy Howlin introduced a motion to this House to annul the hospital charges introduced by the then Fianna Fáil Government, and during the course of his introduction he said.</P>
    <P>I would classify these charges as immoral and no amount of exemptions or exceptions will make them moral. They are a crude and vicious instrument whose only effect will be to undermine the standard of health care...</P>
    <P>It is all too easy to envisage situations where necessary treatments will be foregone because of the fear of these charges, where children will simply not get the X-rays, where old people will try to nurse themselves at home rather than face the humiliation of going to a hospital with an empty purse.  I have already met people who are in terror of the prospect of facing an illness and simply not having the means to cover the charge proposed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>His motion was seconded by my constituency colleague, now Minister, Deputy Mervyn Taylor, who got straight to the heart of the matter and, on the same day, 28 April 1987, he said:</P>
    <P>One has to call a spade a spade in this kind of situation.  The truth of the matter is that the imposition of these charges by the Fianna Fáil Government is a disgrace and an outrage.  There is no other way in which it can be described.  It constitutes a vicious assault on the standards of working <Col N="1584" /> people who cannot afford to meet charges of that nature.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin, now the Minister for Health, in summing up informed the House of what his philosophy would be towards the health services.  He said that the charges amounted to:</P>
    <P>...an outright and vicious attack on fundamental principle.  That principle has underpinned the health services for a generation.  It has provided a basic bottom line guarantee to those who are ill or infirm, to the parents of small children, to the aged and to those who sought the assistance and support of the State in times of great distress.  It is the principle that health care should be free at the point of delivery for those in need.  That principle which informed Fianna Fáil philosophy as well as the philosophies of other parties in this House will die if these regulations are allowed to take effect.</P>
    <P>He challenged the other parties in the House that night when he said that the Labour Party felt that the issues were clear cut and straightforward and that the Members on all sides of the House would have to decide when it came to voting where exactly they stood on these issues and whether they wished to have these charges imposed.</P>
    <P>In this budget there is a total abandonment of the commitment of the Government to the principle of tax reform.  Even the minimalist approach of recent Governments in terms of tax reductions &mdash; admittedly tax reductions that disproportionately assisted the higher paid &mdash; seems to have been abandoned as well.  The Minister promised in the Programme for a Partnership Government to make progress towards equity in the tax code which involves shifting some of the burden off the shoulders of the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>There were specific promises to remove the low paid from the tax net altogether, to broaden the standard tax band, to maintain basic tax reliefs, to improve collection and enforcement and to ensure equity as between the PAYE <Col N="1585" /> sectors, the self-employed and those with substantial investment income.  It certainly has not improved equity as between the PAYE sector and the rest.</P>
    <P>I want to debunk the Minister's propaganda that substantial progress on tax reform has been made in recent years because nothing could be further from the truth.  Tax levels are now effectively higher than a decade ago when public anger at the injustices of the tax system brought thousands of our citizens on to the streets of our cities and towns throughout the country.  What the past decade has proved is that juggling around with the tax bands or the rates does not constitute tax reform.  Rates and bands have been juggled about with the speed of a three card trick operator and the result has been roughly the same.  Few Governments have promised more and delivered less than the last Administration.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats, who apparently only want to listen to their own star performer, sought in particular to give the impression that they were the champions of tax reform, but their record in office is dismal.  The figures show that the burden on the PAYE sector increased substantially during the period of the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrat Government.  In 1989, when Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats came into power with lavish promises of tax reform, the average PAYE worker paid £3,127 a year.  By 1991 this figure had jumped by £438 to £4,565, representing an increase of 14 per cent.  This was about twice the rate at which earnings increased over the same period.</P>
    <P>However, it is only when comparisons are made between the PAYE sector and other groups that the level of the injustice becomes apparent.  In the 1989/91 period, the average tax paid by the self-employed, which includes many high earning professionals, increased by just £44 or 1.6 per cent.  Farmers did even better from the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrat tax policy.  Their average tax payment declined by £231 from £786 to £537, a fall of 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>Neither has there been sufficient progress <Col N="1586" /> in dealing with the scandal of unpaid taxes and tax evasion.  The recent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out that just over £2.5 billion in tax payments remain unpaid at the end of May and that the Revenue Commissioners expect to collect £418 million of that amount.  I do not propose to discommode the Secretary of the Department of Finance or the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners by suggesting that I believe that that £2 billion is out there.  However, I do believe that a great deal of it is out there and I do acknowledge that there have been improvements recently in enforcement and collection, but there is still uncollected tax out there.  We do not need to look any further than the proceedings at Dublin Castle to be convinced of that and more progress needs to be made in that area.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners or the Secretary of the Department would say, through the Minister, about the urgings on him by some Fianna Fáil backbenchers that there is a lot of hot money out there that would, if an amnesty were introduced, be induced back into this jurisdiction and used for more productive purposes here.  I do not see any reference in the Minister's script to it.  We had a number of press releases from south Tipperary and elsewhere saying that it was all fixed up with the Minister for Finance and that it would be in the budget.  I see no sign of it so far.</P>

      <P>The imposition of the employment levy in this budget effectively wipes out the benefit of the minimal tax reductions.  The average industrial earner is worse off and the table attached to the Principal Features of the Budget shows how somebody earning £10,000 is worse off after this budget than before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extension of the standard band, which the Minister boasted about as an achievement, amounts to about 2.67 per cent which is less than the rate of inflation <Col N="1587" /> as predicted by the Minister himself. Some workers may be moved out of the upper band for a short time but when they get the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> increases they will be back in the higher band.  The same applies to the Minister's claim that 13,500 taxpayers will be removed from the tax net because of the increase of 2.8 per cent in the general exemption limits.  It would amount to between £7,000 and £7,200 for a couple and between £3,500 and £3,600 for a single person.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the Minister's reiteration that the fundamentals of this economy are sound and to the compliments he paid himself and his assistants on the management of the economy.  I cannot understand how it can be said of any economy where there are 300,000 people unemployed that the fundamentals are sound.  I cannot understand how it can be said of any economy where the price of money is anything from 18 per cent upward that the fundamentals are sound. I cannot understand how we can pretend to even increase the number of people at work when the life blood of the economy is being sucked out, sucked abroad, sucked into savings accounts or sucked into unproductive investment and property because of the historically high interest rates.  We are deluding ourselves in continuing to refer to the inordinately successful output figures and export trade figures and the constant balance of payments surplus.  These are significantly inflated by the multinationals which is the most productive sector of the economy through the mechanism of transfer pricing which enables them to falsely and artificially boost the profits in this jurisdiction in order to get a tax benefit in their country of origin.  This is such a phenomenon that President Clinton has undertaken to introduce a Bill in the House of Congress to see if this phenomenon can be tackled and that, of course, will be a negative factor as far as this economy is concerned.  It is equally negative for us to continue to delude ourselves that our extraordinary figures show the real economy.  I do not think that is the <Col N="1588" /> case and I would like to refer the House to the last report published by the NESC in December 1992.  That report serves to show the relationship between our supposed growth figures and our job creations.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to bore the House by reading out any of the tables in that report but I will distribute them for the benefit of the recorders.  The NESC authors acknowledge that there can be little doubt but that the productivity data for Irish manufacturing industry are artificially inflated by transfer pricing practices carried out by some multinational corporations.  They go on to examine the apparent phenomenon whereby Irish productivity levels in each of the sectors examined are dramatically above those of other EC countries.  It is true that our productivity rates in the multinational sector are good.  By and large the latest means of technology is harnessed to the means of production, generally speaking. To suggest, as is suggested by the figures, that our productivity rates are three times better on average than the rates in the other EC countries is a manifest nonsense. We should stop deluding ourselves and this House should make provision to discuss the report of the NESC rather than hiding it away and being afraid to refer to it.  The House should draw the conclusions that ought to be drawn from that report.</P>
    <P>The authors of that document stated that comparative data on sectoral productivity rates suggest strongly that transfer pricing is taking place in the Irish manufacturing sector.  This is not some left-wing economist group associated with Democratic Left but rather the NESC, all upstanding gentlement having the <i>crème de la crème</i> of the corporatism and consensus that has managed to give us 300,000 unemployed.  It is a conservative respectable body.  This phenomenon, they say, does not seem to be a significant issue in other western economies.  It appears to be particularly pronounced in three sectors of Irish manufacturing industry &mdash; pharmaceuticals, office and data processing and the &ldquo;other food&rdquo; category.  These <Col N="1589" /> three sectors accounted for 33.2 per cent of total manufacturing net output in 1989 and were responsible for 39.6 per cent of the total growth in manufacturing net output between 1980 and 1989.  Some of the apparent rise in productivity in Irish manufacturing is thus illusory, to use their word, in that it owes more to the accounting practices of multinational corporations than to any fundamental changes in the relationship between output growth and employment growth in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The figures for the indigenous sector, which does not have resort to the transfer pricing mechanism, are probably a great deal more reliable.  Since a great deal of that indigenous sector trades into the United Kingdom, the conclusion that one has to draw is that the job content of that element of trading into the United Kingdom is disproportionally important to this economy.  I am making this point with relevance to the currency crisis which the Minister skated over.  It has become fashionable to say that we have only 32 per cent or 33 per cent of our export links with the United Kingdom, that we have been diversifying and have a fantastic record over the last ten to 15 years exporting to other countries in the EC &mdash; a plague on the houses of those in the indigenous sector who did not get out their Portuguese ready-reckoner, learn the language and go out to sell to the Portuguese and the Germans and so on. Arising from this NESC report it is natural to expect that we will continue to have a major share of our trade with our largest neighbour, which has almost 60 million people.  We have the same language, we have similar accounting practices and it is normal that it will continue. Since the figures are more reliable it is probable that there are more jobs at risk in the indigenous sector.  We have to take that on board following sterling's departure from the ERM.</P>
    <P>I have expressed the view in this House that the devaluation débacle was due to a combination of factors that involved the Government of the day going on sabbatical leave at a critical time, an <Col N="1590" /> inability on the side of officials to get off the tracks of Euro machismo and our fascination with a link with the hardcore group of currencies.  Now there is an attempt to pull down the shutters on that debate which is so vital for our economic future and which was avoided by the Minister tonight.  The debate needs to be rejoined.  Sounding off against the unfeeling Bundesbank will not get us anywhere. It is a dialogue of the deaf.</P>
    <P>The traditional silence of the Central Bank is no longer acceptable.  Very harsh things have been written recently about the conduct of affairs in the Central Bank and as yet we have had no statement from them defending their position.  I have no doubt, as I said during the debate on the currency crisis, that the public servants in the Central Bank, in the National Treasury Management Agency and in the Department of Finance functioned honourably and with great commitment according to their own lights, but it is no longer good enough to pretend that this is too arcane a pastime to have the rest of us involved in it and not to allow a debate.  It is nonsense &mdash; and the Department of Finance must know this &mdash; to suggest that we are going to do anything about improving our employment levels while we maintain interest rates at their current historically high levels.  How can our most vulnerable traded sector cope with the volatility of current exchange rate policy with the United Kingdom? Aids to exporters, for example, those provided through the market development fund, cannot become a permanent feature of industrial policy.</P>
    <P>How can the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, come in here and talk about growing the indigenous sector and implementing Culliton against a backdrop of historically high interest rates?  That is not possible and the Minister ought to know it.  I see two radical solutions to that problem. Perhaps there are others; I am doing no more that seeking to open the debate.</P>
    <P>The first solutions has been articulated by Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats. Admittedly the language tends to obfuscate what they want us to hear. <Col N="1591" /> When Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats say we have to get the costs of business under control they mean we must freeze public pay, bring down the cost of public utilities such as telephones, energy supplies and so on and dramatically slash public spending.  Certainly that is one solution.</P>

      <P>It ought to bring the response from the markets that they claim it will but of course it will never happen with this black melange of a Government consisting of Fianna Fáil and Labour.  There is no point in pushing that solution because it will not happen.</P>
      <P>The second radical solution &mdash; pending the putting together again of the ERM with Britain included &mdash; is that we may be forced to consider floating the Irish pound.  For as long as we remain in the ERM and the UK remains outside, our currency is a sitting duck for speculators. Whether sterling falls or rises speculators are on a no lose bet.  Irish business will suffer from the inevitable see-saw in exchange rate policy and more Irish jobs will be lost.</P>
      <P>What do we tell the public about the latest news this evening?  People thought that the threat of an increase in mortgages had disappeared, but instead the monthly rate has been increased to over 15 per cent, it has gone over the level that triggers off the increase in retail rates the building societies must charge.  What do we propose to do in that situation? We have to deal with this question and debate it openly and honestly.  I am not saying I have a monopoly on wisdom, or indeed any wisdom at all, on this issue, but I am saying the agencies concerned, the Department and the Minister for Finance must bring the debate to this House and we must continue to have that debate until we find a resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our European partners expect us to protect our short term interests.  No other conclusion can be drawn from the stance of our partners during the recent currency <Col N="1592" /> crisis.  They clearly see us as being part of the sterling zone.  Wishing ourselves into a special relationship with the Deutsche Mark is futile, and the Germans have made that clear.  They do not regard us as being in the Deutsche Mark zone.  Therefore why do we continue to make such painful sacrifices to remain members of a Deutsche Mark club whose members do not regard us as qualifying for membership?</P>
    <P>Being in or out on the EMS is not the same thing as being in or out of the European Union, and people should stop denigrating those who have a different view and who are committed to the process of European integration.  Those who say the ERM is essential to the concept of greater European integration are misleading and unfairly presenting the argument. They are not the same thing. Neither is it fair to suggest that because a particular exchange rate policy is linked with another economy we automatically import the growth rates of that economy. I do not believe that is the case.  Neither do I believe it is the case that we would lose our entitlement to Cohesion Funds if we were not in the ERM for a temporary period while people went back to the drawing board and tried to come up with an exchange rate policy which works and which, if possible, includes the United Kingdom.  I do not believe we would lose our Cohesion Funds if this happened, and there is no basis for saying so.  Greece was never in the EMS and it has not lost any of its entitlement to Cohesion Funds.</P>
    <P>I think the Department of Finance probably believes we would lose the disciplines imposed on us by the system if we were to operate outside it for a while, that we would go back to the profligate days of the late 1970s and the early 1980s in terms of public spending etc.  I cannot believe, after all we have learned and the price we have paid for the debt burden we have carried, that that would be the case.  It is now time for some imaginative innovative thinking on this area of exchange rate policy.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the confidence the Minister has placed in the revival of a revamped business expansion scheme.  I <Col N="1593" /> am bound to say it is a triumph of hope over experience.  In 1990 the Comptroller and Auditor General published a report that included an audit carried out by his office on the operations of the business expansion scheme as it applied at that time.  Some of the findings of that audit were a serious indictment of the effectiveness of the BES.  The Comptroller and Auditor General concluded, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Large amounts of tax may have been foregone with little net gain in terms of job creation or maintenance.</P>
    <P>He went on to cite the notorious case, with which we are all familiar, at Shannon where a total investment of £23 million in March-April 1989 in one new company produced, from information he got from the Revenue Commissioners' files, seven jobs.  He estimated that at the top rate of income tax &mdash; the rate that would apply to BES investors &mdash; that cost the Exchequer £13 million.  If it cost £13 million for seven jobs, then each job cost approximately £2 million.  I am concerned about the effectiveness of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I agree with the concept of the business expansion scheme.  If the scheme can be operated in a way that encourages investment in what is regarded as risk enterprise, then it should be encouraged.  I have no objections to the ceilings being lifted, etc., but I think the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance would have to agree that they were not successful in working out ways of doing that in a previous existence.  I would refer the Revenue Commissioners to a study on this scheme carried out by Dr. James Stuart in Trinity College in which he reached conclusions to those reached by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  His paper shows that while the BES scheme is hailed as a major benefit to small business it has spawned several major tax avoidance schemes.  If I had time, I would like to have put some of his proposals on the record of the House, but perhaps we can return to it at another time.</P>
    <P>Unlike the Minister, I do not think the business expansion scheme is going to <Col N="1594" /> provide a flood of new investment for enterprise in this country.  People whose job it is to find loopholes in the scheme to convert it into a tax shelter are likely to do that again.  Therefore, it is incumbent on those who police the scheme to ensure that we do not have the disgraceful examples of abuse we had on the last occasion.</P>
    <P>This budget has Fianna Fáil written all over it.  There is nothing in it that substantially differentiates it from budgets that have been introduced by the previous Coalition of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.  There is no evidence in the budget of any new thinking, a new beginning or willingness to tackle the underlying poverty for those on social welfare and low pay, no serious assault on mass unemployment and little to reduce privilege and inequality in the taxation and PRSI systems.  When the Programme for Government was published in January we said then that it was dominated by Fianna Fáil economic thinking and that the only evidence of Labour Party influence was in the social area.  The same can be said of the budget. Despite the plethora of advisers, assistants, accomplices, aides, sons, daughters, sisters, uncles and aunts, there is no evidence of any formative influence by the Labour Party in this budget.  It seems, not for the first time, that Fianna Fáil has said to the Labour Party, &ldquo;you must wait&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>All the old strokes and tricks which were so strongly criticised by the Labour Party when it was on this side of the House have been used in this budget; for example, VAT increases which will come into effect on 1 March and social welfare increases which will not come into effect until July.  This means that those on social welfare will have to pay more for clothing, footwear and various other goods for almost five months before they get the meagre extra few bob provided for in the budget.  The principle of increasing social welfare generally in line with inflation would only be acceptable if existing social welfare rates gave people a reasonable minimum income.  This is clearly not the case.  In any event, the Minister has taken <Col N="1595" /> an optimistic view of the likely level of inflation.  Many believe the rate of inflation will be higher than 3 per cent, especially with the impact of devaluation. In addition, the increases are likely to be wiped out by the VAT hike, increased local authority rents and other increases that have already been introduced.</P>
    <P>Having regard to all the critical headings one has to address, this budget is a failure.  This is especially regrettable having regard to the level of expectation about this new partnership Government that promised so much.  The Government has delivered a budget in the same old style of taking a few bob here and giving a few bob there so that the net condition of those caught in the poverty trap is no better.  The disgraceful &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; social welfare cuts have not been repealed.  The budget provides for 26,000 extra people on the live register; that is what it promises on the unemployment front.  Generally speaking the budget is a failure and it augurs very badly for the beginning of the life of this new Government.</P>

    <P>The purpose of this resolution is to give effect to a budget day increase of 10p, including VAT, on a packet of 20 cigarettes with <i>pro rata</i> increases on cigars and roll-your-own tobacco and to set a single rate for piped tobaccos.  Consumption of cigarettes fell by 26 per cent between 1980 and 1988.  The fall was due to a combination of factors including public concern about the health risks posed by cigarette smoking and the relatively high level of taxation.  In recent years cigarette consumption has been on the increase.  Between 1989 and 1991 consumption grew by 12 per cent, helped no doubt by the absence of a duty increase in the 1990 budget and the lowering of the standard rate of VAT during this period.  However, the 16p tax increase imposed in last year's budget seems to have had an impact with the indications being that consumption fell in 1992 by about 4.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>On health as well as budgetary grounds there is a strong case for continuing this policy.  It is estimated that the effect of this increase, together with trade price increases in late 1992, will be to reduce demand further for cigarettes by something over 1 per cent in 1993.  However the increase is not being applied to piped tobacco since the amalgamation of existing piped tobacco rates, based on a weighted average of existing rates, has resulted in a substantial increase in the traditional pipe smoker' hard-pressed <Col N="1598" /> tobacco.  To have applied the duty increase proposed on a <i>pro rata</i> basis to piped tobaccos would have seen this product, which is generally favoured by older men, particularly harshly hit. Excise duty and receipts from tobacco products amounted to £415 million in 1992.</P>

    <P>Financial Resolution No. 2 provides for an increase of 32p, including VAT, on a gallon of ordinary strength cider and perry with a <i>pro rata</i> increase for cider in the middle alcoholic strength range from midnight tonight.  It also changes the unit of charge from litre to hectolitre to comply with EC law.  The purpose of the resolution is to give effect to an increase of 32p, including VAT, on a gallon, which is the equivalent of 4p per pint of ordinary strength cider and perry, with a <i>pro rata</i> increase for cider and perry in the middle alcoholic strength range.  To comply with the EC requirements the unit of charge on cider and perry is also changed from the gallon to the hectolitre. These changes will take effect from midnight and are estimated to result in an additional Exchequer yield of £1.2 million in 1993 and £1.6 million in a full year. The increase will have a negligible effect on the CPI.</P>

    <P>This resolution provides for the introduction of a new low duty rate for wine and made wine to apply to products <Col N="1601" /> which have an alcoholic strength of between 1.2 per cent and 5.5 per cent by volume.  It also changes the unit of charge from litre to hectolitre to comply with EC law.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this resolution is to introduce with effect from midnight a new low rate of excise duty for low alcohol wine and made wine products such as coolers and spritzers.  The rate will apply to products which have an alcoholic strength between 1.2 per cent and 5.5 per cent.  The effect of the Single Market changes on 1 January impacted adversely on coolers, spritzers and the like.  Previously these drinks were charged only on the proportion of wine contained in them.  However since 1 January they became liable to charge on the total liquid quantity at the full wine rate without regard to their lower alcoholic content. This has the effect of more than trebling the charge on these products.  As this would effectively kill the market for such products, a new reduced duty rate is being introduced which will allow low alcohol wine and made wine products to compete on roughly equal terms with products of similar alcoholic strengths. This broadly restores these products to their pre-January position.</P>

    <P>(4)  THAT the duty of excise on gaseous hydrocarbons in liquid form imposed by section 41 (1) of the Finance Act, 1976 (No. 16 of 1976), shall be charged, levied and paid, as on and from the 1st day of March, 1993, at the rate of £56.75 per 1,000 litres in lieu of the rate specified in section 74 (1) of the Finance Act, 1991 (No. 13 of 1991).</P>

    <P>This resolution provides for an excise duty increase of 1p on a gallon of industrial fuel oil used by industry, an excise duty reduction of 2.5p on a gallon of industrial fuel oil used for the generation of electricity for sale and converts the unit of charge from the hectolitre to a rate expressed in terms of a thousand litres, with effect from midnight tonight. It also provides for an excise duty reduction of 5.5p a gallon on auto LPG and converts the unit of charge from the gallon to a rate expressed in terms of a thousand litres.  This will take effect from 1 March.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this resolution is to align the rate of excise duty on industrial fuel oil, other than fuel oil used in the manufacture of alumina, with the minimum rates set for the product in the <Col N="1604" /> relevant EC directive.  This involves increasing the present rate by 1p per gallon in the case of fuel oil used by industry and reducing the rate by 2.5 per gallon on such oil used by the ESB to generate electricity, reducing the excise duty on auto LPG by 5.5p a gallon and converting the unit of charge from the hectolitre in the case of fuel oil and the gallon in the case of the auto LPG to a rate expressed in terms of a thousand litres.  Changes to the rates in fuel oil will take effect from midnight tonight.  The reduction in the auto LPG rate will take effect on and from 1 March.  It is estimated that the change in the fuel oil rates will cost £2 million in 1993.  The reduction in the auto LPG excise rate will have no net revenue effect as it will be offset by the increase in the VAT rate in the product which comes into effect on 1 March.  The CPI effect on these changes is expected to be negligible.</P>
    <P>Three separate rates of excise duty apply currently to fuel oil.  Fuel oil used in the manufacture of alumina has a nil rate, fuel oil used by the ESB to generate electricity is liable at the rate of £1.53 per hectolitre or 7p a gallon and fuel oil used for any other purpose is liable at the rate of 76p per hectolitre or 3.4p a gallon.  The EC directive on excise duty rates on oil has fixed a minimum rate which must be applied from 1 January 1993 to heavy fuel oil throughout the Community at the equivalent of 13 ECU per thousand litres. This is equivalent to just over 4.4p per gallon.  Under the relevant EC directive we can maintain the nil rate on fuel oil used in the manufacture of alumina.</P>
    <P>The position regarding fuel oil in the Aughinish plant will not, therefore, change.  An increase of 1p on heavy fuel oil used by industry other than Aughinish is the minimum necessary to comply with EC law and will also apply to recycled waste oil which is used as fuel oil.  It is not anticipated that this change will give rise to any significant adverse impact on industry since all members states will have to respect this minimum.</P>

      <P>This resolution provides for a new form of limited annual licence for amusement machines.  The new licence will be valid for every day in the period from 1 March to 31 August but only for weekends and public holidays in the period from 1 September to the last day of February.  This resolution also changes the period of validity on the existing high season licence which currently runs from 15 June to 15 September.  In future it will cover the period from 1 June to 1 August.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this resolution is to introduce a new form of limited annual <Col N="1606" /> licence to dovetail more closely with established patterns of trading by traditional amusement and funfair centres, particularly in seaside resorts.  In addition, the resolution adjusts the period of validity of the high season licence to include the June public holiday. Changes should have no impact on Exchequer yield and no CPI effect.  The present licence structure for amusement machines is as introduced in the Finance Act, 1992 &mdash; annual licence until 30 June, £100 and high season licence for three months until 15 September, £30.  Two changes now proposed are intended to meet the requests of the industry.  The yield from the duty in 1992 was approximately £900,000.</P>

    <P>(2)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>This resolution provides for an increase in the levy charged on premiums in respect of certain classes of non-life insurance.  The levy is at present 1 per cent of premiums received and it is proposed to increase this to 2 per cent.  The increase will apply to premiums received on and from 25 February 1993.  The yield is expected to be £9 million in 1993 and £11 million in a full year.  This measure will not mean a cost increase for policyholders relative to the position in 1992 as the special 1 per cent levy in respect of the insurance compensation fund terminated on 31 December.</P>
    <P>This resolution is essentially a technical amendment to section 203 of the Finance Act, 1992, which provides for a stamp duty of £2 on certain ATM cash cards. The duty is charged in respect of the accounting period of the bank or building society as the case may be, and is payable <Col N="1608" /> within one month of the end of that period.  This arrangement was set up to facilitate banks and building societies in the administration of the tax following discussions with them.  As enacted section 203 did not provide for a situation where as a result of a change in the accounting period of a bank or building society the duty could be avoided in a particular year.  This has now occurred with one of the major banks.  The effect of this resolution is to ensure that the cash card levy will be payable by customers of all banks and all building societies in 1993.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Resolution No. 1 provides that the price of 20 cigarettes be increased by 10p, and the yields are quite significant.  Has the Taoiseach any figure to suggest what effect this increase will have on the number of people smoking?  Is there an expectation of a reduction in the numbers smoking and what will be the effect of such a reduction?  Will the Taoiseach indicate whether it will have an effect on employment in the industry and what advice is the Department getting in this regard?  Will it be a question of keeping down the expected increase in the number of smokers or will there be an actual decline in the sales of cigarettes? Will there be a knock-on effect on the manufacturing side, with a possible loss of jobs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach clarify the point made by the Minister in his budget speech today in relation to the effect on cross-Border trade?  He indicated that a new scheme would be introduced so that country of origin stamping would be put on tobacco products.  Will the Taoiseach explain what is meant by that because I do not understand fully how the system will operate in practice?  If he has the figure in his brief, will he give the price differential after this imposition, in respect of 20 cigarettes of any standard brand, between here and Northern Ireland?  If there is an expectation of distortion in cross-Border trade, what precisely has the Minister in mind in this respect? <Col N="1609" /> In respect of Resolution No. 2 relating to cider and perry the Taoiseach indicated an increase of 4p on a pint of cider. Will he explain what was the policy thinking behind the decision to increase the excise on cider and perry but not on any other beer or long alcoholic drink?  The adjustments on hydrocarbons are of a technical nature.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We on this side of the House put down amendments to the Finance Bill to bring about what the Minister is doing under this Financial Resolution so we cannot very well oppose it tonight.  The imposition of a 1 per cent levy on insurance policies which was introduced after the Insurance Corporation of Ireland collapse has, as I understand it, lapsed.  The Minister and the Government have decided, after penalising policyholders for years, they will not benefit now that the levy has lapsed but they will impose a 1 per cent excise levy which will go to the Exchequer.  Rather than the money going into the insurance fund it will in future go to the Exchequer and there will be no gain for the policyholder.  I presume the non-life insurance policies the Taoiseach has in mind will include motor insurance, which is what we are talking about &mdash; non-life insurance is a euphemism for motor insurance.</P>

      <P>With regard to Financial Resolution No. 1, has the Government given any consideration to the question of ear-marking any or all of the increase in excise on tobacco products for health education in respect of cancer?  I know there are a number of active lobbies who would have sought some such indication from Government.</P>
      <P>In respect of the resolution relating to cider and perry, it is interesting that the increase is confined to cider and perry and is not extended to beer.  I would like to hear the policy logic that lies behind that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Resolution No. 4 &mdash; hydrocarbons &mdash; if I understand the point made by the <Col N="1611" /> Taoiseach, we are reducing the excise on heavy oil used by the ESB in the generation of electricity and slightly increasing the excise on industrial fuel oil to bring these prices into line with the European norm.  Is it expected that the reduction in price for the ESB will induce the ESB to use more oil as a means of generation, which probably would be unfortunate as it seems to be a more expensive fuel source than coal?  Is it expected that there will be a possible knock-on effect there?  I welcome the continuation of the Alumina zero rating which is critically important.  If excise duty was imposed on the Alumina plant at Aughinish it would devastate its capacity to sustain production at that point.</P>
    <P>On amusement machine licence duty, I welcome the Government's proposal. It is very much in line with that sought by the industry, as I know from representations I have received from people in Youghal, Limerick and elsewhere. This proposal is to be widely welcomed.</P>
    <P>On Financial Resolution No. 6 will the Taoiseach list which policies other than motor policies are affected by the decisions not to give the consumer the benefit of the doubt yet again?  This is another exercise in dipping into one's pocket.  Do such policies include those taken out by policyholders in conjunction with their mortgages?</P>

There is a great difference between amusement machines, that is the traditional funfair machines that are located in various resorts around the country, and gaming or poker machines which are machines of a different nature.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek clarification on two points, and I am being consistent in raising these points.  Each one of us has constituency worries about increased taxation.  The argument we have been making for years is that the cigarette industry gave much employment but fortunately in recent years it has diversified into alternative areas.  If one looks at the complications in the health area caused by excessive smoking and also the number of deaths which the Minister recently announced resulting from smoking related diseases, it is appropriate that we should get additional revenue from this source while giving an incentive to people to give up the habit of smoking. Those of us who are fortunate to have given up smoking are always accused of preaching to those who find it difficult to do so.  Perhaps today, Ash Wednesday, is a good day to start talking about this matter.  I hope there will be benefits in terms of revenue as well as health.  I am sure my constituency colleague, Deputy Michael Bell, has a different view of this matter because of the employment created by this industry in his constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to cider and perry &mdash; and I am being consistent on this matter also &mdash; my constituency is the only one in in Ireland that is involved in this industry. Last year Bulmers Showerings in Clonmel, a major employer in my constituency, were concerned that they would find it difficult to compete in Europe where there is a very strong wine lobby.  Cider and perry have an unfortunate reputation, probably unfairly so. As other alcoholic drinks are exempt, perhaps there is a European reason for this increase.  Even though it is only 4p per pint, it will take £1.6 million out of the industry, an industry which during crisis, particularly devaluation and the sterling crisis, finds it difficult to maintain employment.  I had hoped the Minister <Col N="1613" /> for Finance would take measures to assist the industry.  However, this imposition will have a significant bearing on it.</P>
    <P>I should like the Taoiseach's assurance that this company will be retained, engaged in its present task with other major employers and maintaining the standards they have achieved.  I would like him to bear that in mind even if it is a requirement of the European Community that this taxation should be imposed on these drinks.  I am concerned about this as many people in my constituency are involved in the industry. Whether in Government or Opposition it is appropriate to express our reservations. I hope the Taoiseach can give us some such reassurance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few issues in relation to these resolutions on which I want to focus and get some responses from the Taoiseach.  As I understand it, the £11 million levy on liability insurance applies to motor, employers' and public liability insurance.  Is not one of our problems about job creation here occasioned by high costs, including the high costs of insurance?  There was an ideal opportunity to reduce the costs in that the Compensation Fund no longer needed this topping up.  If this Government was genuinely committed to job creation surely that is the one area it would not attack?  Will the Taoiseach accept that this is a real attack on jobs, that all his rhetoric and that of his colleagues about their interest in enterprise and job creation is for the birds because it is in relation to decisions on the budget that one puts one's words into effect?  Will the Taoiseach accept that an £11 million extra imposition, a lot of it on jobs, is outrageous within the context of there being over one-third of a million people unemployed?  Does he accept that all motor insurance has a huge impact on jobs from the point of view of company vehicles, travellers and people going to work?  The Government's imposition of tax to employers' liability insurance is a direct tax on jobs.  Of course, to a degree, the same applies in relation to public <Col N="1614" /> liability.  Again, in many instances it is a cost to an employer, yet this Government which pretends to have an interest in job creation has no hesitation in adopting what might be described as a &ldquo;smash and grab&rdquo; approach.  It saw the £11 million and grabbed it irrespective of its impact on jobs.</P>
      <P>I heard much talk about the interest of the Taoiseach and members of his party in the problems of insurance for young people.  I need not bother reiterating what we heard from the Labour Party over recent years or remind the House of the crocodile tears it shed concerning motor insurance for young drivers.  In three quarters of an hour will the Labour Party march into the lobby and vote for a resolution that will involve its Government imposing an extra tax on young drivers?  The Labour Party in particular should be fully aware of what it is doing if it votes for this resolution.  Will the Taoiseach accept that it constitutes an attack on jobs and insurance of all kinds, but particularly, on young drivers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the day that is in it this could be called the &ldquo;sack cloth and ashes&rdquo; budget after what we heard.</P>
      <P>There are three points I want to make, the first, is on the increased tax on tobacco products.  In view of the overwhelming evidence that cigarette smoking is damaging to health, that consistently, budget after budget, we have increased taxes on cigarettes, will the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance agree that the money collected from the sale of those products should be put automatically into the health area as additional money &mdash; I see the Minister for Health nodding his head &mdash; so that he would not be forced to increase hospital charges for our hard-pressed, sick people?  Would it not be much better if the Minister for Finance took all the ten pennies he will collect from every packet of 20 cigarettes henceforth and gave it to the Minister for Health so that he would not have to impose these penal extra charges on the sick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before we finish I should like the Minister for Finance to give me some idea of <Col N="1615" /> how much money he expects to garner from the extra ten pennies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is £20 million.  We could invest double that, £40 million, into eliminating the hospital waiting lists if we could get our hands on those £20 million yielded from cigarette taxation, extra money that could be spent on alleviating hardship and sorrow.  The Minister announced that £20 million would be required to eliminate the waiting lists of people who needed new hips, or cataract removal operations.  In the next sentence he announced he would give free colour television licences.  I could not help thinking that one would first have had to have one's cataract removed before one could even see the colour television.  I should prefer that money to go directly to alleviating the health problems caused by smoking.</P>
      <P>I reiterate what Deputy Jim O'Keeffe said about the increased insurance costs for young motorists.  The Minister for Finance is not old.  Does he realise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am afraid women's hair-dressing is much more expensive.  Will the Minister agree that, in increasing the insurance cost for young drivers, he is forcing more and more young drivers to drive without insurance.  More and more young people are driving without insurance because the insurance cover costs are double, three times the cost of cars?  The value of the motor cars sometimes is only one-third of the price <Col N="1616" /> of the insurance cover costs being sought by insurance companies.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's proposal about gaming or amusement machines.  I am glad Deputy McManus corrected the Minister's Budget Statement because, of course, it deals with amusement machines.  Representing a seaside constituency I know this forms much of the business of the towns of Skerries, Rush, Lusk, Youghal and Ardmore, County Waterford, which I know very well.  In his Budget Statement the Minister said there were other things he would examine in the context of the Finance Bill &mdash; a number of technical issues.  Is one of those technical issues that represented by the Seaside Amusement and Funfair Association who wanted the duty removed from the push-penny machines? How long is it since the Minister played one of those push-penny machines? Probably a bit too long&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They are amusement machines, no more or less, just like those on which one tries to grab a furry dog or something else.  Will the Minister inform the House whether he will abolish duty on the push-penny machines?  I am sure it would not be very difficult to do. I am also sure that the amusement and funfair people would be delighted to show the Minister how to play on these machines.  I am afraid, at the rate the budget is imposing taxation, that is all people will be able to push around &mdash; pennies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to increased duty on cider in respect of which I recognise the important economic factor represented by some of my colleagues, I am sure the main reason was financial, although there may be others.  Bearing in mind perhaps the unfair reputation of cider drinking it does now present a considerable <Col N="1617" /> problem in some urban and rural areas.  In a future Resolution perhaps the Minister might consider changing its presentation and/or packing to dissuade the types of abuses now prevailing.</P>
      <P>The other point I wanted to make is in relation to the insurance industry.  I cannot believe the Government could have been so petty as to take another swipe at the hard-pressed motorist.  Our car insurance costs are higher than almost anywhere else in the world.  It is extraordinary, at a time when 302,000 people are unemployed that the Government should decide when some little relief was coming the way of insurance premium holders to eliminate it.  It is a cynical reaction on the part of a Government which is supposed to be espoused to enterprise.  After all, Fianna Fáil in Government is supposed to be the party of enterprise, the party or the entrepreneur, the party of energy, a get-up-and-go party that would resolve our unemployment problems.  Therefore, I cannot understand what the Minister's present proposal will do for unemployment or how it will encourage young people to insure their cars, they will continue to pay high premiums whereas they should be getting a reduction.  I cannot understand how they can reconcile that policy with young Fianna Fáil policy enthusiasts who were strongly in favour of a reduction in motor insurance and called repeatedly for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget presented them with an opportunity to do something positive about that but they failed to do so.  What about the other partners in Government? The party of idealists spoke on behalf of our young people, our hard-pressed mortgage holders, and motor insurers, people affected by increased public liability insurance cover over the years which is now almost the highest in the world.  It is now almost impossible to obtain public liability insurance cover.  In the midst of all this the Labour Party &mdash; I am sure they will say something about it &mdash; will probably vote against it although we have had no indication that they intend to do so.  What will they do when the opportunity <Col N="1618" /> arises in just over 30 minutes?  I hope in view of their sterling performance in that area &mdash; with which we all agreed &mdash; they will strongly uphold the views they upheld previously so honourably from these benches, and vote against the Resolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget has been trumpeted by the Minister for Finance as pro-employment.  There is a proposal before us to increase, effectively by one per cent, the cost of employers' liability insurance.  Everybody who knows anything about employing people &mdash; and apparently that does not include the people who made decisions in relation to this budget &mdash; knows that in addition to employers' PRSI, every employer here faces a levy on his or her wages bill of about 10 per cent to cover employers' liability insurance.  This is a crippling charge imposed by our legal, rather than our tax system, on employment. Everybody who knows anything about industry, employment and the service industry knows that every possible step has to be taken to curtail and or contain these hidden costs on employers.</P>
      <P>This budget has been produced by two parties who said they accepted the analysis of the Culliton report, that the tax wedge was too high and that they would do something about it in this budget. There is an increase in the tax wedge on employment today, in that henceforth it will be more expensive to employ somebody because of the other tax changes the Minister has introduced.  It will be more expensive to offer somebody a job, and less worthwhile to work.  People earning under the average industrial wage will pay more in tax and levies than they have done heretofore.  Then the Government imposed a secret levy on the activity of employment itself and an extra 1 per cent on employers' liability insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What kind of pro-employment tactic is that?  Is it logical?  Where are the proposals about which we heard in the programme for Government for reducing insurance premia for drivers?  What is the relevance of all the rhetoric from the <Col N="1619" /> Labour Party about bringing down the cost of insurance for the community at large?  Do people think there is such a thing as a painless levy on the insurance business?  Does the Labour Party, in particular, think that because insurance is big business one can fleece them for 1 per cent and that nobody will notice the difference?  All householders must insure their house and will have to pay more because of the imposition of this levy. Every employer will pay more, quarterly or whenever, through his insurance broker, to keep people at work.  Every person who drives a car will pay more to his insurers.  This measure is being put in place as part of a budget that claims to be pro-employment.  Not a single scrap of this budget is pro-employment.  Every single major feature of this budget is aimed at making it less profitable to work and less profitable to offer work to other people.</P>
    <P>This Government was elected on a promise to do something about unemployment. I think of all the high blown rhetoric in the National Concert Hall about a new beginning and what has happened here today, which is that this is a budget against employment, jobs, and enterprise.  At every hands' turn the Government increased the pressure on unemployment.  It has turned the screws on every possible front against those who are trying to make jobs and work for others in our economy.  Employers who felt that perhaps this Government would see the logic in the Culliton report, who perhaps believed the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, when he said that he was in favour of implementing the Culliton report; who heard the Minister for Finance speak in its favour, have seen a budget put before this House today which widens the tax wedge, drives more nails into the coffin of employment and which &mdash; by sleight of hand &mdash; adds 1 per cent extra to the cost of employers' liability insurance.</P>
    <P>Where is the impetus to give jobs to people who need them?  When he began his Budget Statement this afternoon the Minister said he was concerned about <Col N="1620" /> jobs.  But this measure is destroying jobs. The Minister does not seem to understand how employers' liability insurance saps people's will to offer jobs to others; he does not understand that this is, in effect, an additional 1 per cent levy on the payroll levies every employer faces. He should admit that this is an anti-employment measure and withdraw it. We will oppose it and every single aspect of this budget that undermines the enterprise economy, the pro-employment economy about which Culliton spoke.  No amount of posturing in public, getting soft rides from some section of the media about a pro-jobs budget &mdash; which I saw on the front of one paper this evening to the effect that this was Bertie's pro-jobs budget &mdash; or about being in favour of employment stands up to scrutiny.  On every single front there has been a deepening of the trenches against employment.  The decision to employ has been made more anti-employment, the decision to look for a job has been made that much more hopeless for those curently unemployed.  Will the Minister withdraw this proposal now and admit that it is flawed?  Will he also admit that the Government does not seem to have realised the damage which will be caused by the imposition on employers' liability insurance?  Unless and until the Government shows some commitment to lessening the burden on the activity of employment there will not be an improvement in our economic situation.  I echo what Deputy Cox said this evening. When it comes to a decision on reforming the taxation system to make it less anti-employment we must look at its effects on jobs.  Deputy Cox said that this is not a pro-jobs budget and that it undermines the willingness of people to employ others.  When it comes to tax reform, in particular, there will never be a better time to bring about pro-jobs tax reform than when we are in a budgetary crisis. There will not be a recovery if we keep tightening the screw on employment.  Just because we are in difficult circumstances does not mean we should postpone tax reform; because things are hard at <Col N="1621" /> present does not mean one should penalise employers and employees.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reaction in the face of the difficult budgetary situation which he and the Labour Party have largely created is to make the creation of employment and working less worthwhile. Until we decide that when the economy is going badly, there should be more emphasis on tax reform and pro-employment change, all these measures are doomed to failure.  This budget will worsen the situation, not improve it.  If there is any understanding on the other side of the House of the Culliton report, this measure should be withdrawn immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the comments that this budget is anti-jobs.  One of the most important industries in my constituency, Showerings of Clonmel, has been singled out for attack.  Certainly, I will be glad to vote against the increased duty on cider as proposed in it. Why has the Minister chosen this route, considering that an increase on cider in last year's budget yielded very little to the Exchequer?  We must remember also that cider is one of the traditional beverages. It plays a vital role in the economy of the south east, in particular in Clonmel. At present Showerings employ 400 people in Clonmel, as well as generating employment in apple production.  This increase in duty is detrimental to the future of the cider industry.  While I welcome a responsible attitude to alcohol, there should be fairness and the Minister's decision to single out cider shows a certain weakeness in that he was not prepared to tackle other major drinks companies.  This will affect the competitiveness of the cider industry and naturally will result in a reduction of its market share.  This will cause unemployment in a town which was devastated 18 months ago by the loss of 350 jobs in Digital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a case for special treatment of the cider industry, indeed the European Community made that decision when it adopted Directive 92/83 putting it in a category distinct from wine and beer.  It <Col N="1622" /> has a very high labour content, and will face grave competition from imports if it cannot retain its price competitiveness.  I am sure the people of Clonmel and in south Tipperary will have been very happy to hear my colleague, Deputy Ferris, speaking in support of the cider industry.  However the difference is that I will be voting against the budget and that is what really matters.  Deputy Ferris has the opportunity to put his words into action.  Furthermore, two of the three Deputies in the constituency form part of the Government and it is regrettable that they could not have taken a stand at the first opportunity they had to protect the cider industry in Clonmel, 400 jobs and the economy of our constituency.</P>
    <P>I will be delighted to vote against this budget.  The Minister's decision is unfair, weak and passive and will not reap any rewards for the Exchequer in contrast to the loss that may result in a town like Clonmel.</P>

      <P>I join my colleagues on this side of the House in expressing my disappointment in relation to many of these proposals.

      <P>What does this budget contain?  My colleague, Deputy Browne representing <i>Carlow/Kilkenny</i> always has an apt phrase to describe things and he said it was a budget of 30 years ago.  It is disappointing and lacks innovation.  With regard to the proposals before us, will the Minister tell us why he did not take a leaf out of President Bill Clinton's book, who in attempting to make a fresh start looked at new sources of taxation and levied an energy tax as an alternative to taxing work?  That option was recommended by the ESRI.  There has been a minor alteration in the area of hydrocarbons to bring us into line with our <Col N="1623" /> European partners.  Fine Gael has identified an energy tax &mdash; and we have been supported by the ESRI in this &mdash; as a major source of income with beneficial conservation effects which would allow us to make enormous improvements in easing the burden of taxation on work.</P>
      <P>Did the Minister and his colleagues not consider this?  Would this not be the kind of innovation which would allow us to invest heavily in our economy and in jobs and avoid the mish-mash of negative policies in relation to employment creation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the amusement machine licence duty, which is long overdue. I know Members referred to Tramore, County Waterford, and this certainly will be a help to them.  That is the only positive point in this budget.</P>
      <P>I was given my first job in Showerings of Clonmel and I speak from first-hand knowledge of that industry.  The job potential of this industry seems to have been forgotten.  As well as jobs in the plant, natural apples are produced in orchards which also creates employment in the area.  It is an indigenous industry which produces a natural product and has potential for growth.  We have heard much about Culliton and many other things, but when the first opportunity to do something positive arises, the Minister picks an obvious natural industry which has potential for greater growth and employment and dismisses it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the south east, in particular in Clonmel &mdash; as a follow on from Digital about which we are all so concerned and which is in difficulty in another part of the country &mdash; the Minister will take away jobs, investment and potential growth.  This is also an area in which the Minister's colleague in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is searching for alternative usages of land.  What is the Minister doing?  One of the obvious areas &mdash; the planting of trees that can produce a natural product &mdash; will be levied with extra taxes and duties.  What will happen?  There will be no further investment.  The Minister's colleague is searching for ideas for better usage <Col N="1624" /> of land, given the restrictions under Common Agricultural Policy, and yet he decided to penalise the planting of trees. Therefore we lose out on the extra usage of the land, the employment that could be created, the potential for growth in the area and the revenue potential of exporting the apples.  That is all dismissed, obviously without any consideration from the Department's point of view, because the Minister did not know what he was talking about.  He probably saw it simply as a manufacturing plant and did not examine the added value of that industry in Clonmel.</P>
    <P>Many Members said that the Minister spoke in the context of the Culliton report.  The 1 per cent increase in insurance levies imposed by the Minister is devastating for industries in which there is high employment potential.  I know, and the Minister knows, of industries which have gone to the wall or have failed to get off the ground because of the high cost of public liability insurance. This is detrimental to the creation and sustainment of jobs.  Employers are now faced with a further cost handicap from this Government in addition to everincreasing expenses.  Where will it end?</P>
    <P>No opportunity has been used by the Government or Minister in the budget to foster enterprise, given the options which are being taken here this evening.  It is clear the Minister wants to substitute machines for people at work.  He wants to marginalise and disregard all the people who are barely holding on to jobs as well as the 300,000 people we are trying to get back to the jobs market.  He is sending a clear message to the unemployed that their services are no longer required.  The light has been turned out and the Minister has given the kiss of death to the Culliton report.  The title &ldquo;Department of Enterprise and Employment&rdquo; is meaningless jargon.  It does not have empathy with the word &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are starting to debate the Resolutions and the Labour Party Ministers have left the House.  They were not able to stomach what was said earlier and left collectively when most of the budget speeches were being delivered on this <Col N="1625" /> side of the House.  My colleague, Deputy Howlin, the Minister for Health, who was so eloquent for the last number of years on these benches, has not said anything this evening but has decided to slip out the door.</P>
    <P>What are we doing for young people? What future will we offer them when they try to get jobs in industry?  We impose a motor insurance levy.  We are sick and tired of talking in this House about doing something about the direct cost of insurance.  Opportunities exist in the sales service industry but young people are unable to take up jobs because they cannot get insurance to drive a car for a company.  We all know that but the Minister has imposed a further cost increase in that area.  It makes no sense.</P>
    <P>The Minister is creating a dependent society, encouraging people to stay on the margins and out of the workplace. The diminishing numbers in employment are being levied and taxed out of existence and their jobs are in danger.  If the Minister proceeds down the road that this budget has set out for the Labour-Fianna Fáil Government over the next three or four years, 400,000 people will be unemployed. What will the Minister say at that stage when he knows the reality now? There have been constant increases in duties and levies.  The budget is a total failure in its attempt to address the serious jobs crisis.  The Minister has abdicated his responsibility, that of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and the work of the people directly involved in job creation.  The budget offers nothing to the people.</P>

      <P>As in ten other member states excise on cigarettes will be paid by means of the purchase of tax stamps.  It is a system used extensively throughout the Community.  We have been discussing the system with the industry and with Revenue and it will take some time as I have indicated today, to finalise those discussions.  However, the system works, and it forces compliance.  I am sure everyone <Col N="1627" /> in the House will support it on that basis.</P>

      <P>Maybe everyone in the world is wrong except Deputy McDowell. On the question of the comparison with taxes on cigarettes in Northern Ireland, the post-budget difference is 28p.  There are still two budgets to come this year in the United Kingdom and while nobody can speculate precisely what will happen in those, I think the difference might narrow.  The difference of 28p is made up of excise duty and VAT.  That is quite a margin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the health arguments, the potential employment implications of major price hikes must be taken into account.  Employment in the industry fell from 1,700 in March 1988 to 1,300 in March 1992.  There has been a decline recently of about 100. The increase of 4.3 per cent is ahead of inflation and it follows significant increases in recent budgets.  Account must be taken of trade distortion and I would have increased it more were it not for that factor.</P>
      <P>Earmarking tax for health promotion is not our policy.  Taxes are not earmarked for spending purposes.  Successive Governments have made moneys available in the Health Estimates but have not earmarked taxes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will show that we are not crucifying it.  It has a remarkable tax advantage over other products which is why the cider market is growing to such an extent.  West Coast Cooler has a strength of 4 per cent and the duty per litre is 68p.  Reno Cooler has a strength of 5 per cent and the duty is 68p.  Beer, which has a strength of 4 per cent has a duty of 66p and beer premium lager, which has a 4.5 per cent strength has a duty of 73p.  Cider and perry have a strength of 6 per cent and the duty is only 31p.  There is a huge incentive for this industry in terms of relative taxation.  A further increase would have been justified. Cider and perry are the lowest products with a strength of 6 per cent on sale in the State.  Notwithstanding the increase, which is equivalent to 4p per pint, cider and perry in this band are still extraordinarily favourably taxed in comparison with all the other coolers and spritzers.  There is no need to go through it; I have given enough figures which demolish all the arguments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only answer the questions raised.  Deputy O'Keeffe raised the differential in favour of Northern Ireland.  The duty on a six-pack of beer is 85p, wine 77p and spirits 33p.  Duty raised on beer is substantially higher than in Northern Ireland.  Consequently, with open frontiers further tax increases on beer would give rise to trade diversion as the drinks industry has argued.  A few years ago the Government had to reverse <Col N="1629" /> their policy as a result of this.  This industry is a very large employer, both directly and indirectly.</P>

      <P>Dear Ceann Comhairle,</P>
      <P>On the advice of my medical consultant I have decided to retire from politics.</P>
      <P>My medical condition is such that I could not continue to provide my constituents with the fulltime dedicated service to which I believe they are entitled.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I have no option but to resign my Dáil seat, effective as of today.</P>
      <P>I would like to thank you for your unfailing courtesy to me over the years.</P>

      <P>I am sure there will be great regret that Deputy O'Connell has had to retire from politics for medical reasons.  I wish to thank him for the service he has given in this House and to his constituents for nearly 30 years. He had a distinguished career in medicine and in medical journalism.  He was most active on behalf of his constituents, and he made an important contribution to this House as a backbencher and as Ceann Comhairle.  He also served briefly in the European Parliament and the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year he achieved his lifelong ambition to become Minister for Health. Over the past 12 months, and especially in today's budget, many of his initiatives have borne fruit under the partnership Government comprising the two parties, <Col N="1633" /> Fianna Fáil and Labour, with which he has been associated.</P>
    <P>It is well known that he worked from early morning to late at night to achieve his objective of providing a better, more caring and cost-effective health service for all the people.  He will be much missed.  I wish him, on behalf of his colleagues in this House, a full recovery of his health so that he may enjoy with his family a long and happy retirement from politics.</P>

      <P>I join with the Taoiseach in paying a well deserved tribute to Dr. John O'Connell on the announcement of his retirement from Dáil Éireann.  As the House is aware, he is one of the longest serving Members, having been first elected in 1965.  He has served with great distinction in public life in Ireland.  As a member of the European Parliament he was elected with one of the largest votes ever obtained by any person standing for the Parliament in an Irish constituency.  On two occasions he was elected as Ceann Comhairle and showed himself to be a man of innovation in that office.</P>
      <P>It would be fair to say that the greatest achievement in Dr. O'Connell's political career, and in his own estimation, was his appointment as Minister for Health. To say that he sought that job and enjoyed it immensely would be an understatement. Everybody who came into contact with him at the time he became and acted as Minister for Health was conscious of the enormous enthusiasm he had for the job and for the cause of improving the health of the Irish people. It is a great misfortune for him and for this House that it is ill-health that has caused him to bring his active political career in the House to what must be seen by all as a premature end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I have never shared Dr. O'Connell's political convictions it would be fair to say that I speak not only on my own behalf but on behalf of all members of the Fine Gael party in saying that we all admired his tremendous enthusiasm for his work and for whatever cause he choose to serve.  I know that the Ceann <Col N="1634" /> Comhairle, one who has had a long friendship with Dr. O'Connell, and has many experiences in common with him, will take the trouble to convey the sincere good wishes of all Members to Dr. O'Connell.  We wish him every success and a speedy return to full health, and to active participation in the public life of this country in whatever way he deems appropriate.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I wish to add my words of tribute to Dr. O'Connell.  The news of his retirement has come as a shock to all Members.  It is a tribute to Dr. O'Connell that he made the decision of his own volition in a time of ill-health to resign from the House rather than be unavailable to his constituents in Dublin South-Central.</P>
      <P>I have known Dr. O'Connell for many years.  He shared offices in this building with my father in the 1960s.  He always struck me as a man of absolute courtesy and a hard working representative on behalf on his constituents.</P>
      <P>We had our political differences.  Dr. O'Connell left the Labour Party, but notwithstanding that there was never any ill-feeling.  He always treated one with respect and there was always courtesy in one's dealings with him, whether he was in the Chair or a member of the Fianna Fáil party over the years.</P>
      <P>It is a sign of Dr. O'Connell's character that he choose to resign rather than carry on as he could have done through his ill-health. I hope he has a speedy recovery to full health.</P>

      <P>Like the other party leaders, I am surprised and saddened to hear that Dr. O'Connell is not in good health and that his ill-health has forced him to take the unfortunate step of resigning from the House.  I have known him for many years as we have been Members of the House for almost the same period and I had the pleasure of serving in Government with him last year for nine or ten months.  I found him a very helpful and courteous colleague in <Col N="1635" /> the Government and I found him helpful and courteous when he occupied the post of Ceann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>He has had a long, active and distinguished career in this House and won the admiration and affection of many Members.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Spring said, it is a mark of Dr. O'Connell that, in spite of the fact he was supporting a Government that has a majority of about 40, and could afford to take it easy and remain a Member of the House he choose not to stay.  He should have our admiration and respect for the decision he made.  I hope he will speedily return to full health and will have a long, happy and enjoyable retirement.</P>

      <P>As with most Members, the announcement comes as a big surprise to me.  I was not aware that Dr. O'Connell was seriously ill and I regret he has had to resign as a result.  I first met Deputy O'Connell many years ago before either of us was a TD when we and a number of others sought housing for families living in tents on Mountjoy Square.  It was a <i>cause célébre</i> at the time.  The then Minister for Local Government, Mr. Kevin Boland, declared these were all anti-Christs who should under no circumstances be allowed onto our airwaves or television screens.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell was a man of great energy and conviction and he appeared always to have a mind of his own and to do as he thought fit.  I appreciate that caused many problems for the parties he joined.  Nevertheless that is what makes politics interesting.  I wish him well and I hope he enjoys his retirement.</P>

      <P>As the person who had the unique distinction of serving as his Minister of State for his 11 month tenure of office I very much regret that through ill-health Dr. O'Connell is unable to continue as a Member of this House.  The Taoiseach has mentioned that on at least one occasion I felt it necessary to caution Dr. O'Connell on his workrate and the <Col N="1636" /> number of hours he spent each day working in his Department from early in the morning until late at night.  I told him my opinion that it might have a detrimental effect on his health.  I am sorry to see that ill health has caused him to leave this House.</P>
      <P>In the short time I worked with him he devised a great number of excellent initiatives to improve the Department of Health and the delivery of the health services here.  He was passionately committed to this cause throughout his public life and before.  Therefore, I take this opportunity to say how sorry I am to see my good friend and colleague, Dr. O'Connell, retire from this House.</P>

He had a unique energy in terms of the effort he put in on behalf of his constituents.  I am sorry he is now retiring on the grounds of ill-health.  I hope that his health is fully restored to him at an early date.  I have known Dr. O'Connell for most of 20 years in the Labour Party and, subsequently, as a constituency colleague.

I am very shocked as everyone else is, particularly because he and I, as everyone knows, have been good friends as well as colleagues in the constituency. The best I could wish anyone in this House would be that the colleagues they share their constituency with would be on as good terms as Doctor John and I have been and will be for many years.  I know the staff in Leinster House will also miss him greatly.  We hope he will come in to see us and stay in touch.  Knowing Dr. O'Connell, please God if he makes <Col N="1637" /> a full recovery he will be working just as hard at something else because that is his nature.</P>
      <P>I know the constituents of Dublin South-Central are going to miss him greatly.  We were both elected in the same year, 1965.  He has many stories to tell about his most colourful career.  I am very shocked and terribly unhappy that the people of Dublin South-Central are losing a great representative who has always been such a genuinely caring person.  All Members should try to be three-quarters of what Deputy O'Connell has always been, a sincere and dedicated public representative, an inspiration to everybody who has known and worked with him.</P>

      <P>I had the honour to share a constituency with Dr. O'Connell for many years.  I learned a great deal about politics and surviving in politics from him.  When the constituencies were revised in 1980 our constituency was divided in two, resulting in part of his constituency being merged with that of the late Frank Cluskey, then the Leader of the Labour Party.  It was a famous footnote in history that Mr. Cluskey, in his inimitable way, said to Dr. O'Connell &ldquo;go west, young man, go west&rdquo; because Mr. Cluskey wanted to run in Dublin South-Central.  But he did not go west, he contested as an Independent.  He was elected and changed history in that Mr. Cluskey, unfortunately, lost his seat and the leadership of the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>The fact that Dr. O'Connell survived as an Independent is a testimony to his extraordinary dedication to his constituents, as Deputy Briscoe said.  He shared the constituency with my brother, the Lord Mayor, who, unfortunately, is not here tonight.  I am sure he will join in expressing great sadness at this announcement and wish Dr. O'Connell a speedy recovery and success in the future.</P>

    <P>(2)  THAT the provisions of section 16 (as amended by the Finance Act, 1984 (No. 9 of 1984) of the Finance Act, 1983 (No. 15 of 1983), shall apply and have effect for the contribution year 1993-94, as they applied and had effect for the contribution year 1984-85, as if&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the following paragraph were substituted for paragraph <i>(b)</i> (inserted by the Finance Act, 1984) of subsection (2):</P>
    <P>(b)  the Youth Employment Levy Regulations, 1982 (S.I. No. 84 of 1982), the Youth Employment Levy (Amendment) Regulations, 1983 (S.I.

    <P>&lsquo;(a)  where in a contribution year a payment is made to or for the benefit of the employed contributor in respect of reckonable earnings of that employed contributor, levy shall be payable by the employed contributor at the rate of one per cent.  of the amount of the reckonable earnings to which such payment relates:</P>

    <P>(3)  IT is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>This resolution anticipates legislation which will be contained in the Finance Bill to impose for the year 1993 to 1994 a temporary levy of 1 per cent on all income, on a similar basis to the existing health, employment and training levies. Effect will be given to the levy by way of re-activating and modifying the legislation relating to the income levy which was enforced in the period 1983 to 1986. Accordingly, the income levy as modified will be payable at a rate of 1 per cent by all individuals over 16 years of age but with a specific income exemption in order to protect the lower paid.  In the case of the self-employed exemption will apply where income for the year is not greater than £9,000.  In the case of employees the levy will not be payable in any week where income is not greater than £173.</P>
    <P>In addition all medical card holders, including those whose income is more than £9,000 per annum, will be exempt from the levy.  All social welfare payments will also be exempt from the new levy and such payments will not be taken into account in determining whether an individual qualifies for an income exemption from the levy.</P>
    <P>Unlike existing levies, and the income levy which applied in the early 1980s, employers will not be liable to pay the <Col N="1640" /> new levy in respect of their employees who are medical card holders.  The levy will be imposed on all income as estimated on the income tax under the Income Tax Acts, subject to allowable deductions in respect of approved superannuation contributions and, in the case of self-employed individuals, capital allowances.  The income levy will be collected, like the employment and training levy, the health contribution levy and PRSI, by the Revenue Commissioner under the combined PAYE-PRSI collection system, and from the self-employed and farmers under the self-assessment system.  It will be paid directly by the Revenue Commissioners to the Exchequer.  It is expected that the yield from the levy will be £78 million in 1993. It is a contribution from those at work to help support those who are not at work. This type of levy was introduced in 1983 and was brought in at much lower exemption limits.  It started at approximately £3,000 at that time.  We have been careful to ensure that those at the bottom of the income scale are exempt in so far as is possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this proposal. It is a crude way to raise revenue.  It clearly indicates that the Government found a gap in its budgetary calculations about two weeks ago.  It could not get agreement on any proposals and decided that this was the simplest and quickest way to raise the money.  By raising it in this way the Government is ensuring that all eligible income is levied.  My understanding is that all eligible income, from the first pound earned, will be levied. This means that the allowances which this House decided people should be entitled to, for example, mortgage and personal allowances for a spouse, will not be considered in the calculation of the amount of the levy which must be paid.  It is unfair not to consider these allowances against the levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Taoiseach had to raise £78 million by a levy on income, why did he not do so from within the income tax code by altering either rates or the allowances under the income tax code?  Why did he <Col N="1641" /> resort to this crude system?  I anticipate that the Taoiseach will use the argument that a similar levy was introduced in 1983. I do not accept that argument.  At that time, another coalition Government involving the Labour Party was in office. On that occasion the Labour Party could not agree to other necessary measures. Finally, a levy of this kind was agreed to. The fact that this budget contains such a levy proves that the biggest mistake the Government made was failing to reach and publish a proper agreement on budgetary parameters by the respective parties before the Government was formed.  This failure will mean that there will be more last minute tax dodges to fill the gap which cannot be filled because the parties involved in the Government are unable to agree to bridge the existing gap in the public finances.</P>
    <P>This is an unfair tax.  It does not make any allowance for mortgage interest payments or dependency costs and is levied on all income.  Furthermore, it is a tax on jobs.  Unemployment has increased to over 300,000 since the formation of the Government.  Why, then, should the Government impose a tax on work in the first budget introduced since the barrier of 300,000 unemployed was broken?  This is a tax on those who create work, such as employers, who must get the money from their cash flow, and it is a tax on those who take jobs because they are penalised.  It is interesting to hear the Taoiseach announce that only people at work will pay this levy.  Income which is not derived from work will be exempt. The exemptions which the Taoiseach has announced will increase the level of poverty.</P>
    <P>With regard to medical cards, a situation could develop where a person would, perhaps, be £300 or £400 better off as a result of being £1 or £2 below the relevant income limit, thereby qualifying for a medical card.  Extra marginal taxation will now be imposed on people once they are ineligible for a medical card.  The number of levies they will have to pay as a result of losing the medical card and the other allowances will mean that the rate of taxation on the extra £1 earned, <Col N="1642" /> which puts people over the medical card limit, will be in the region of at least 500 per cent.  Society should encourage people to do overtime, to work harder, to improve themselves and seek promotion in their business.  This would increase their income above the medical card limit.  However, people will now have an incentive not to work harder.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this levy is a symptom of the onset of paralysis in this or any Government with regard to policy making.  Within a month of its formation the Government is unable to make decisions about the budget.  It has to resort to cheap and unjust stratagems.  I am not proud of the fact that I was a member of a Government which also introduced these levies.  When this coalition Government was formed without a proper budgetary agreement I predicted that such a levy would be introduced.  It is unjust, unfair and is an indication of the complete political paralysis which has already afflicted this Government.  I predict that this Government will introduce more levies in future budgets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>This aspect of the budget reflects the attitude of these two parties in Government.  This income levy will make it difficult for those marginalised in society to earn a living.  It is the most unjust and indefensible levy introduced by a Government in recent times.  We are not talking about an isolated issue.  The Minister describes it as a levy of only 1 per cent.  However, the tax rate has not been reduced in the PAYE sector.  PRSI, health levies and youth employment levies have increased and now we have another income levy. the Minister says that this is a once-off charge.  That is patently untrue.  The income this year will be approximately £78 million and £130 million in a full year, thus indicating the strategy that will be adopted by this Government in maintaining and keeping this levy in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand how the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, representating their parties in Government, can justify this levy while at the same time talking about job creation.  This is not consistent with <Col N="1643" /> what has happened here this evening.  It is a shock to workers struggling to survive as a result of increases in mortgage interest rates.  The Minister must be aware of the trauma experienced by workers.  What reward have these people received from this Government for whom they voted?  They have been betrayed. Their present income level will not be maintained and further tax increases will be levied on them.</P>
    <P>Members are aware of the number of people who see the medical card as a type of Holy Grail and the difficulties in dealing with this issue.  We are reinforcing the dependency mentality which exists and which we have tried to reverse. With one stroke of the pen the Minister has undone the good work carried out over the last few years.  The significance of the 1 per cent levy is greater than its financial impact, because it will change people's thinking and attitudes.</P>
    <P>People, if they wish to exist in this society, would be better off working outside the system rather than accepting a low income job because the State will provide them with benefits and a medical card.  This would be all right if millions of people were employed.  However, 217,000 taxpayers are exempt from paying tax, approximately 300,000 are unemployed and a large section of the farming community are dependent on EC subsidies.  This reduces the number in employment to approximately 500,000 who have to pay the taxes and levies which this Government is trying to impose in a distorted way.  The net result will be to increase the number of unemployed and decrease the numbers employed.</P>
    <P>This is a foretaste of the attitude of the parties in Government.  They will look for easy solutions to budgetary difficulties. Within six weeks of taking office, we can see how this Government will act during the next 12 months.  No financial or psychological incentives are being offered to encourage people to find work and become less dependent on the State.</P>
    <P>Four or five years ago the only country comparable to eastern Europe, in terms <Col N="1644" /> of State dependency was this country. Eastern Europe has changed in recent years.  Where is this country going?  It is going down a road paved with failure in terms of employment and State dependency.</P>
    <P>How can the Labour Party suggest that this is an enterprising and radical budget geared towards job creation?  It is insulting to people seeking employment or those struggling to maintain an adequate standard of living.  These people are encouraged to depend on the State. Many people leave jobs because their salaries are not sufficient to encourage them to stay at work and be productive.</P>
    <P>The act of betrayal perpetrated in this House is the beginning of the end of a policy which was in place for the past few years and which was beneficial.  This policy has been abandoned.  No plan or programme has been outlined in this budget.  No incentives have been offered to people seeking employment or in employment.  People will pay more tax and will not be adequately compensated for the work they have done.  Both the financial and psychological impact of this budget will cause considerable damage.</P>

      <P>It is cowardly because it is not described as a tax and it fails to draw any distinction between rich and poor or differentiate between people's ability to pay tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government is peppered with references to equity and equality.  It is an extraordinary concept of equity which taxes rich and poor alike.  This tax is a tax on the poor.  I am not convinced by the argument advanced by the Minister for Finance that there is an income exemption in order to protect the lower paid. He defined this income exemption by describing the Government's concept of the lower paid.  If one earns under £173 per week, one is considered by this Government to be in the lower income <Col N="1645" /> bracket.  If one earns over £173 per week one is considered to be in the higher income bracket and subject to the same tax regime as somebody on £100,000 per year.  The sum of £173 per week is the basic income of a low grade local authority worker and it is the income earned by workers marching outside the gates of this House.</P>
    <P>They are those who, if they live in local authority housing, are subject to the highest rates of rent.  They do not qualify for a medical card or for any benefits available from the State.  They are also becoming resentful at paying increasing amounts of taxation, qualifying for no benefits and having little pay in their pockets.  They are increasingly questioning whether it is worth their while, apart from their commitment and wish to be doing a productive day's work, to go out to work in the first instance.  This 1 per cent tax will be the final straw for many low-paid workers who are charged higher rent on their houses, and lose their medical card benefit.  In many cases, they do not qualify for student grants or any other benefits.  The Government classifies them in the same category as the higher paid.  This tax is regressive and it should be rejected by this House.</P>

Its dishonesty strikes me more than anything else.  It is dishonest in two parts; first, it is an increase in taxation and the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach should have been honest enough to call it this instead of trading it off as a levy.  Second, we know &mdash; perhaps the Taoiseach will be good enough to admit this to this House &mdash; that it is not temporary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a specific question I wish to <Col N="1646" /> ask.  Will occupational pensioners be required to pay this extra levy?  They are already irate at paying health levies, and youth employment levies and so on.  They have given a lifetime of service and are now having these levies imposed on their pensions.  I hope the Taoiseach will clarify tonight that these will not apply to pensioners who are subject to the other levies.</P>

At a time when jobs are at a premium and people are looking for inspiration from this Government, they are disastrously let down.

I would like to repeat what they said when they brought in this exemption levy in 1983 at an earnings level of £3,000.  Ours is at £9,000 and excludes 509,700 of the 1.1 million workforce. A further 300,000 are also exempt.</P>

    <P>(3)  THAT the rate of flat-rate addition to prices of agricultural produce or agricultural services supplied by unregistered farmers be decreased from 2.7 per cent. to 2.5 per cent., and that, accordingly, section 12A (inserted by the Value-Added Tax (Amendment) Act, 1978 (No. 34 of 1978) of the Principal Act be amended by the substitution in subsection (1) of &ldquo;2.5 per cent.&rdquo; for &ldquo;2.7 per cent.&rdquo; (inserted by the Act of 1992).</P>
    <P>(4)  THAT this Resolution shall have effect as on and from the 1st day of March, 1993.</P>
    <P>(5)  IT is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>This Resolution provides for an increase to 12.5 per cent in the rate on 10 per cent rated categories such as building, newspapers and holiday accommodation, an increase in the rate on the supply of poured concrete and concrete blocks from 10 per cent to 21 per cent; an increase to 21 per cent in the rate on 16 per cent rated categories such as telecommunications and adult clothing; a decrease to 12.5 per cent on certain 16 per cent rated activities such as garage repairs, hairdressing and dry cleaning; a decrease in the rate of flour, confectionery and bakery products, as well as non-chocolate biscuits, from 21 per cent to 12.5 per cent and an adjustment from 2.7 to 2.5 per cent in the level of flat-rate farmers' refund, together with a similar change in the VAT rate on livestock.  These changes will have effect on and from 1 March 1983.</P>
    <P>The Resolution provides for an increase from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent, with effect from 1 March 1993 on building and building services, newspapers, <Col N="1659" /> hotel and holiday accommodation, tour guide services, short term hire of cars, boats, caravans, mobile homes and tents and trailer tents.  This increase, while consistent with and partially dictated by the Single Market agreements on VAT rates and structures, will make a positive and necessary contribution to the overall budgetary arithmetic.</P>
    <P>The Resolution provides for an increase from 10 per cent to 21 per cent, with effect from 1 March 1993, on poured concrete and concrete blocks.  This measure will be of assistance to building enterprises who meet their tax obligations and who face unfair competition from black economy activity within the building sector.  The projected yield is £0.4 million in 1993 and £0.7 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The Resolution provides for an increase from 16 per cent to 21 per cent with effect from 1 March 1993 on telecommunications, adult clothing and footwear, including materials for their manufacture, auto LPG, spectacles and contact lenses, farm accountancy and farm management services, services of auctioneers, solicitors, estate agents and other agents directly related to the sale of agricultural land.</P>
    <P>This measure is necessary to comply with EC Single Market requirements. Under the terms of the EC VAT agreements, member states can have only one rate at a level equal to or higher than 15 per cent.  As our standard rate is being maintained at 21 per cent on this occasion, it is necessary to abolish the transitional 16 per cent rate.</P>
    <P>The proposed increase applies to about 8 per cent of all VAT-able goods and services.  The projected yield from this increase is £40 million in 1993 and £65 million in a full year.  This increase will result in an estimated rise of 0.29 percentage points in the CPI.</P>
    <P>The Resolution provides for a decrease from 16 per cent to 12.5 per cent, with <Col N="1660" /> effect from 1 March, 1993, on general repair and maintenance services, e.g. car repairs etc., personal services such as hairdressing, dry cleaning, driving lessons etc., jockeys' services, photographic services, works of art, literary manuscripts and most antiques.</P>
    <P>This reduction is being made for most of the categories outlined, which are highly labour-intensive, with the aim of helping to consolidate and promote employment.  It is fully consistent with the provisions of the EC VAT arrangements for the Single Market, which allow us retain reduced rating for a transitional period, prior to eventual standard rating, on activities which had been subject to a low rate on 1 January 1991.</P>
    <P>The projected cost to the Exchequer is £6.5 million in 1993 and £11 million in a full year.  This decrease will result in an estimated fall of 0.088 percentage points in the CPI.</P>
    <P>The Resolution provides for a decrease from 21 per cent to 12.5 per cent, with effect from 1 March, 1993, on flour confectionery and bakery products, as well as non-chocolate biscuits.  This initiative is aimed at safeguarding employment within the domestic biscuit-making and flour confectionery industries.  It is also compatible with EC agreements which permit the option of reduced rating for food.  It is also aimed at preserving jobs and ensuring less cross-Border trading.</P>
    <P>The projected cost to the Exchequer is £7 million in 1993 and £11.5 million in a full year.  This decrease will result in an estimated fall of 0.06 percentage points in the CPI.</P>
    <P>The Resolution provides that, on and from 1 March, 1993, the flat-rate compensation to unregistered farmers, which operates as an addition to the selling price of their agricultural produce and agricultural services, will be adjusted from 2.7 per cent to 2.5 per cent.  A similar change will apply in the case of the VAT rate on livestock.</P>
    <P>The adjustment in the flat-rate will result in a reduced cost to the Exchequer <Col N="1661" /> which is estimated at £4 million in 1993 and £6 million in a full year.  The flat-rate addition compensated farmers for the VAT incurred by them on their farm inputs.</P>
    <P>Farmers will receive in 1993 an estimtated £72 million in compensation for VAT incurred on farm inputs.  In addition, about £16 million will be paid to farmers through direct refunds of VAT incurred on the construction of farm buildings and on land drainage and reclamation.</P>
    <P>Farmers sell most of their produce to VAT-registered traders, such as creameries and livestock marts, who can reclaim in their VAT returns the flat-rate compensation which they pay to unregistered farmers &mdash; there is no pass through to the final consumer.</P>
    <P>Farmers are not obliged to use the flat-rate scheme.  A farmer can register for VAT, and can then reclaim VAT paid on all taxable inputs.  Approximately 2,200 farmers were registered for VAT at the end of 1992 compared with 2,100 at the end of 1991.</P>
    <P>The resolution provides for a change from 2.7 per cent to 2.5 per cent in the rate on livestock, including horses, sold by VAT-registered farmers or cattle dealers.  This adjustment is linked to the equivalent change in the flat-rate refund paid to unregistered farmers.  The rate is traditionally maintained at the same level as the flat-rate refund for ease of buying and selling operations within marts.  For instance, cattle dealing would be unnecessarily complicated if one VAT rate applied in the case of sales by registered farmers, while a different level of flat-rate refund applied when sales are made by unregistered farmers.  The new rate will apply to all supplies, intra-Community acquisitions and importations of livestock on and from 1 March, 1993. The new rate on livestock will have a negligible effect on revenue yield.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the increase in the rate of value added <Col N="1662" /> tax on building services.  Although the Government has made certain provisions to compensate for that by means of increased housing grants for new house building, no such compensating arrangements are made in respect of reconstruction of existing houses.  That is a very anti-social decision.</P>
      <P>Many families have an option to build on to an existing house wherein the extended family can, so to speak, stay together; for example, a young married couple can share a house or a complex of apartments with a parent or parent-in-law or they can build a new house.  One of the major problems in our society has arisen as a result of the separation of the component parts of the extended family. This decision to favour new house building over reconstruction and extension of existing houses confirms an undesirable social trend which I do not support. There are many families who do not have the option to extend the house but where possible should be encouraged and not discouraged by tax policy.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned about the increase of the VAT rate on hotel, guesthouse and caravan park accommodation.  We have an opportunity to develop the tourism industry.  However, the two complaints most frequently voiced in surveys of complaints made by tourists to Ireland were: first, that this country and its accommodation are too expensive, and second, that the standards of cleanliness in our streets are not good enough.  This VAT rate increase will aggravate that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of car hire is a cause of dissatisfaction amongst tourists and that cost will be further increased as a result of the budget.  It is important to recognise the impact of car hire cost on tourism.  Car hire spreads the tourist spend around. People who hire a car have access to small guesthouses in relatively remote areas.  If we continue to increase the cost of car hire we will encourage coach tourism as the predominant form of tourism. However, coach tourism necessarily <Col N="1663" /> tends to be concentrated in large centres and is not distributed throughout the country.  The northern half of the country benefits little from coach tourism whereas it can benefit, as well as any other part of the country, from car hire as people are free to visit any locality.  It is unwise, from the point of view of either taxation or tourism policy, to increase the cost of car hire.</P>
    <P>The general trend of increasing the level of tax on services is unwise when employment should be our priority.  It is fair to say that while it is possible to automate many manufacturing processes, it is not possible to automate many of the services, particularly human services.  There is more employment created per pound spent or per pound collected in VAT in the services industry that there is in the goods.  A tax policy which increases VAT on services is inherently anti-employment and that is the trend in the Government's tax policy. That is unwise and does not deserve the support of the House.</P>

      <P>The changes in value added tax and customs and excise taxes being effected in this budget will increase taxation by £81 million.  Who will pay the £81 million?  It will be the ordinary people in society, those who buy adult clothing, newspapers and other goods.  Ordinary people with ordinary expenditure patterns will pay the increased taxes.  Regardless of the rhetoric we have heard about individual exemptions in relation to VAT increases, the fact remains that this is a night of infamy for the two Government parties. It is a night of infamy for the Labour Party in particular because people earning £9,000 per annum will pay 1 per cent extra of their earnings by way of an income levy.  Listening to RTE today, I heard a taxation expert calculate that a married couple, with a £41,000 income between them and a full mortgage will be better off as a result of today's budgetary <Col N="1664" /> measures.  The Labour Party should reflect on that and on what it is doing to people with an income below the average industrial wage who will be only a few pence better off before indirect tax changes are taken into account.</P>
      <P>It is a night of infamy for the Labour Party because it has put a tax on labour. It is a night of infamy for the Labour Party because this increase in indirect taxation is yet another way to assault the people who voted for its members.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7 and 8, subsection (2), to delete paragraphs (a), (b) and (c).</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to delete subsections 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c) of Resolution 9.  A number of points needs to be made on the question of VAT.  I refer specifically to the fact that increases in the VAT rates apply from tomorrow.  These will affect everybody in exactly the same way regardless of income, whether one is earning £100,000 or £5,000 a year.  A person who buys a dress or suit will pay 21 per cent VAT, whether their income is £5,000 or £100,000 a year.</P>
      <P>The Labour element in this Government should have insisted that if the necessity was to claw in that money, the social welfare benefits &mdash; which they are claiming they were responsible for including in this budget would be payable at the same time as the indirect tax increases which are now being levied. However, the much vaunted child benefit increases will not come into effect until September.  The other social welfare increases will not come into effect until the last week in July.  One presumes that whatever benefits there may be in relation to tax will not come into effect until April.  Yet, the VAT rates will be increased from tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has indicated that there are rates which will be reduced, but the net effect will be an increase of £71.9 million in relation to this budget's arithmetic.  That is the information in the &ldquo;Principle Features of the Budget.&rdquo;  In <Col N="1669" /> addition, there is an expected increase of approximately £170 million in the VAT take during the coming year.  It is nonsence for anyone to believe that in some way the least well off in our society are being catered for by this budget.  It is nonsense for Deputy Broughan to claim that the Labour Party's promises on health and education are being met by this budget.</P>
    <P>The school books and uniforms that parents will have to buy, clothing, gas bills, ESB bills and other goods will increase as a result of the VAT increases. This budget cannot be seen as indicating that the cuts implemented in the supplementary allowance scheme have been reversed.  They have not.  I made the point here on two occasions and was voted out of this House by Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party a week ago when I protested at these cuts against the weakest sections of society.  I protested at the fact that these cuts were introduced in a circular from the Minister for Social Welfare &mdash; Circular 14/92 and the so-called clarification Circular 18/92 &mdash; which are denied to Deputies of this House.</P>
    <P>When I asked the Department of Social Welfare if I could have a copy of the circulars I was told that they were only available to community welfare officers.  It is extraordinary that a Minister can issue instructions which have the effect of devastating the income of my constituents and that I am not allowed to see the circulars which the Minister issued to the community welfare officers employed by the Eastern Health Board. I obtained copies of those circulars, but not through official channels and that is not a suitable way for this House or the Government to do business.  It is improper that a Deputy of this House should have to covertly collect unmarked envelopes to find out what, precisely, Minister are instructing civil servants to do with regard to the allocation of public funds.  It is not acceptable and there should be the strongest protest from all <Col N="1670" /> Members.  It affects all sides of the House that this covert activity is carried on by Government Ministers.</P>
    <P>The most important aspect of these cuts was referred to by Deputy Rabbitte in his contribution earlier today.  People in working class areas of this and other cities are living in fear of having their heat and light turned off by the ESB.  All the Government's claims that promises are being met will not solve those people's problems.  This budget, if implemented in full, will not solve the problems.  Constituents of mine have received ESB bills which they cannot pay and as they got a single payment from the community welfare officer since last July of, say, £20 or £40, they cannot get any further assistance.  That has not been addressed in the budget, and if the Labour Party has any conscience it should put whatever pressure it can on the Minister for Social Welfare, to reverse these cuts.</P>
    <P>My main objection is that these VAT increases come at a time when those on fixed incomes, whether they are low paid or on social welfare, will have to pay them months before any additional benefits are paid to them as a result of this budget.</P>
    <P>I wish to make one final point in relation to VAT, concerning a refund to unregistered farmers.  This issue, is a hardy annual which I raised on many occasions since I came into this House. Unregistered farmers may claim, as of right, VAT refunds varying in amounts from year to year depending on what the Minister for Finance decides in the budget.  This year the amount they can claim is reduced from 2.7 per cent to 2.5 per cent and it is claimed that this change will yield £4 million to the Government. Will the Taoiseach indicate how much the unregistered farmers claim as a result of this 2.7 per cent or the reduced rate of 2.5 per cent?  What is the basis of that claim and how do they get this money?</P>

On one occasion it was announced in the Dáil that this refund system involves about £70 million. Is this a book-keeping exercise?  Is £70 million being claimed illegally?  If it is a book-keeping exercise, how can the Government claim that it will gain £4 million as a result of a reduction from 2.7 per cent to 2.5 per cent?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>One good thing this Government has done regarding VAT is to reduced to two the number of rates &mdash; 12.5 per cent and 21 per cent.  A reduction in the number of rates is welcome.  The negative aspect is that this is being done at the expense of extracting £72 million more from taxpayers this year.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party have a perverse notion of what constitutes tax reform.  The same could be said about their income tax proposals.  It is like a torturer telling his victim not to worry too much as he will not pull out all the fingernails but will pull out a few toe nails instead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one examines this Resolution and all the changes in VAT rates, one can almost hear the sound of holy grails being smashed one by one.  The VAT rate on hotel <Col N="1672" /> and holiday accommodation is increased from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent.  When I heard that today I thought of my friends in the Labour Party and, in particular, of the late Deputy Frank Cluskey who fought long and hard to make sure that there would not be a VAT rate of more than 10 per cent on hotel and holiday accommodation and tourism services for the reasons Deputy Bruton mentioned earlier.  The Labour Party has turned its back on that.</P>
    <P>The VAT on newspapers is to increase. I remember a campaign here and the hysteria on the Fianna Fáil benches when they thought that VAT on newspapers would not be further reduced.  Most of all I remember the Fianna Fáil ballyhoo when it was proposed to put VAT on construction.  Now VAT on building services is going up from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent and even though Fianna Fáil used to say that the way to get the country moving again was to reduce VAT on construction.  There was a lot of sympathy for that point of view in the Labour Party but that has been abandoned.</P>
    <P>It seems all that matters this year is to get another £72 million so that the Government does not have to make one decision about the real source of the problem, the inability of Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party to agree on anything that will prioritise public expenditure and thereby take some of the weight of Government expenditure off the backs of the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the VAT increases from 16 per cent to 21 per cent.  I will talk about telecommunication services because we are already suffering under that increase.</P>
    <P>VAT on adult clothing and footwear is being increased from 16 per cent to 21 per cent.  I wonder &mdash; he is not in the House now &mdash; what Deputy Kemmy thinks about this increase.  I remember him in 1982 moralising from the backbenches about a very modest proposal in relation to VAT on clothing and footwear. Where is he now?  He has been giving out to the Government for the last <Col N="1673" /> couple of days about other issues, but there is not a word out of him when it increases the VAT rate from 16 per cent to 21 per cent.  In fact, it increased the tax on clothing and footwear by over one-third compared to what it is today.</P>
    <P>I am glad there are some reductions, but our VAT system is still full of the most appalling anomalies of which I will give one example, because I know other Members wish to speak.  I have been investigating horse riding services.  If I want to go for a ride on a Sunday morning and hire a horse from a neighbour's establishment, I will be charged 2.5 per cent VAT, from today, if I go out on my own.  However, if I am restricted to riding the horse within the confines of her establishment &mdash; she has a substantial piece of land &mdash; I will pay 12.5 per cent VAT.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This example shows the nonsense of our VAT system, the Finance Act 1992, and the changes which it made in value added tax in relation to various sporting and recreational activities. However, as an administrative measure the Minister and Revenue Commissioners say they will apply a 12.5 per cent rate.  I do not believe we should do these things as an administrative measure.  I would like the Minister or the Taoiseach to put this properly into a Finance Act which will clarify the situation and apply one rate of value added tax to all these items.  The Government made a mess of a basically good idea, that is, to reform our VAT rates, but it has been hoist with its own petard because it was Fianna Fáil in March 1982 who decided that the <i>deus ex machina,</i> the rabbit out of the hat, which would solve their budget problem that year, was VAT at the point of entry.  The Minister for Finance today whinged that he cannot do without the revenue.  In order to solve a problem which they created themselves &mdash; and that was supposed to be the boom and bloom year, but they have seen damn all boom and bloom in the meantime &mdash; VAT at the point of entry was imposed; because they did that in 1982 the Irish taxpayers will pay £72 million more in VAT this year as the Government has not got a way out.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 105 together.</P>
      <P>The Department has played a key role in the funding and organisation of research efforts to date into the collapse of sea trout stocks.  The results of the 1992 research programme have been evaluated by a working group set up under the aegis of the Department and chaired by the Department's chief scientific adviser.  The group, which comprises a range of scientists working on the research programme, includes representatives from the Salmon Research Agency, the Central Fisheries Board, universities as well as the Department's Fisheries Research Centre.</P>
      <P>The report of the working group was published earlier this week.  It concludes that further research needs to be undertaken in 1993 into the causes of the problem and also recommends a number of conservation and management measures which should be taken or enhanced to halt the decline in sea trout numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1416" /> As I announced on publication of the report, the working group's recommendations are to be implemented under an expanded research, conservation and management programme which is currently being put in place by the Department.</P>
    <P>The 1993 programme is being undertaken in consultation with all relevant interests including the fisheries boards, fishery owners and fish farmers.  It builds on measures taken in previous years.</P>
    <P>Research will be continued with additional emphasis on stock sampling data and sea lice biology and distribution. The working group will remain in place to evaluate and report on research projects undertaken this year; Conservation by-laws to protect existing sea trout stocks will be renewed, and possibly extended for 1993; Rehabilitation of sea trout stocks will be developed under a national stock enhancement programme being formulated under the Department's direction; Management strategies for fish farms will be further enhanced and formalised, with particular emphasis on the development of agreed guidelines, by management strategies and fish husbandry practices aimed at minimising lice loads and disease incidence on fish farms.  I have also established a representative advisory group to examine and recommend on following strategies including site location.  The Department's sea lice monitoring programme for 1993 gets under way this week.  The frequency and co-ordination of all lice monitoring activities will be further reviewed.</P>
    <P>In recent meetings with representatives of the fishery owners and fish farmers I have stressed the importance of a consensus approach to resolving the complex problem of sea trout declines.  I am confident that the initiatives now being taken will have the full support and co-operation of all concerned.</P>

      <P>The Department of the Marine is currently implementing a fishery harbour development programme covering the period 1989 to 1993.  This programme, which was drawn up following consultation with all maritime local authorities, including Wexford County Council, made provision for development of Duncannon Pier, County Wexford.  To this end, a site investigation costing £20,000 was carried out by the Department of the Marine during 1992. The results of this investigation will be used in the design of any development at the pier.</P>
      <P>Due to slower than anticipated progress in implementing the current development programme, 1989-93, and severe financial constraints, it will not be possible to carry out any development works at Duncannon Pier during 1993.</P>

      <P>The report of the Department's investigation into the incident on board the fishing vessel <i>Stelimar</i> was completed in 1991.  It pre-dated by some time, therefore, the policy decision that reports <Col N="1418" /> into marine accidents would be published in future.</P>
      <P>When this change in policy was announced in February 1992, it was made clear that the decision could not be applied retrospectively because of legal considerations arising from the circumstances under which earlier investigations would have been conducted.</P>
      <P>I regret, therefore, that it is not possible to make available the report into the incident in question.</P>
      <P>Safety standards on fishing vessels are reviewed on an ongoing basis by a specialist fishing vessel safety working group which comprises representatives of the fishing industry and administrative and technical staff of the Department. Guidelines relating to the safety of fishing vessels are issued by way of marine notice to the industry.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, enables the making of regulations governing the safety of fishing vessels and their crews.  I recently signed the Merchant Shipping (Musters) (Fishing Vessels) Regulations, 1993, which require the holding of regular musters or drills in preparation for emergencies, the regular inspection and maintenance of live saving and fire fighting equipment and the recording of particulars of such in vessels' logbooks.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1419" /> The objectives for the Irish fishing fleet are established under the terms of the Multi-Annual Guidance Programme, or MAGP, which covers the period 1992-96 and which was agreed last year in Brussels after lengthy negotiations.  The agreement reached represents an extremely successful outcome for the Irish negotiators and has effectively reversed a previous Commission proposal which was to reduce our fishing fleet to around 35,000 GRT.  The objective for the Irish fleet at the end of this MAGP period, in 1996, is now 51,195 GRT, with some scope for increasing to 54,195 GRT.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of this programme, we have already moved to develop the fleet in line with available quotas.  The whitefish sector, which is the area offering greatest potential, is being enlarged substantially by the new entry of some 14 all-weather vessels, targeting offshore stocks of prime whitefish.  Another six such vessels are expected to enter the fleet this year.  We now need to move to consolidate our achievements and in this regard the renewal and modernisation of our fleet is of crucial importance.  To this end, grants will continue to be made available under BIM's marine credit plan for work of this nature at the appropriate levels required to trigger Community funding under the FEOP aid schemes and within the constraints presented by the current economic climate.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should point out that all fleet policy instruments are currently being reviewed in the light of the recent agreement on the MAGP.</P>

      <P>My statutory powers in relation to fin-fish farming derive from the Fisheries Acts and the Foreshore Act, 1933.</P>
      <P>The policy objective with regard to the licensing of fin-fish operations is to ensure that development takes place in an orderly and well regulated manner, with full regard for other interests and in harmony with the environment while maximising the industry's contribution to the economy, in terms of jobs and revenue.</P>
      <P>In line with this policy objective, the Department has devoted considerable technical and administrative resources to bringing all fin-fish operations under an effective licensing and monitoring regime.  All licence applications are subject to a rigorous process of evaluation and public consultation including, in the case of significant projects, compliance with the requirements of the EC Directive on Environmental Impact Assessment.</P>
      <P>The siting of fish farms as well as structural, environmental and fish husbandry aspects of any such proposed operations, is dealt with under this licensing and regulatory framework.  I have no immediate plans therefore to introduce any new regulations governing the location of fish cages.</P>

      <P>There is a Community-wide ban on the use of drift nets in excess of 2.5 kilometres either within Community waters or by Community vessels in international waters.</P>
      <P>A similar Community ban also applies to all fishing for salmon by any means outside 12 miles from baselines.  In addition there exists a range of national measures designed to regulate drift net fishing for salmon within 12 miles and ensure that sufficient numbers of salmon escape back to their rivers of origin to spawn and guarantee the continuity of the species.  This is also intended to ensure that anglers and other categories of netsmen can be afforded an opportunity of securing an equitable share of the overall salmon catch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These measures include restrictions on <Col N="1422" /> the numbers of licences to use drift nets, no fishing for two days at weekends, annual close seasons, restrictions on the size of boat and maximum length and depth of nets that may be used and a ban on the use of monofilament material in drift nets.</P>

      <P>The proposed works were included in the Department of the Marine's Fishery Harbour Development Programme 1989-93.  In order to progress this project a site investigation was undertaken at Crosshaven Pier during 1992.  This investigation was completed last autumn at a cost of £22,000.  The results of the investigation will be used in the detailed design and cost of the proposed extension.</P>
      <P>Due to the limited availability of financial resources and other priorities for available resources, it will not be possible to carry out the proposed development at Crosshaven during 1993.</P>
      <P>However, the Department of the Marine is drawing up a new development programme covering the 1994 to 1997 period, for which all maritime local authorities have been invited to make proposals for harbour developments in the fisheries interest and for which they are prepared to make funds available.  Cork County Council has proposed the improvement of Crosshaven Pier among their list of proposed development projects. Pending finalisation of the 1994-97 development programme and clarification of its funding, I am not in a position, at this point, to indicate when development works can be undertaken at Crosshaven.  However, I am hopeful that some funds can be found for this project and I would expect to be in a position to clarify matters before the end of this year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1424" /> I am conscious of the need to maintain a balance in the staffing of the boards and in this regard I am pursuing with the Department of Finance the possibility of filling certain priority posts, including the posts of deputy managers, as agreed with the Central Fisheries Board.  That said I must point out that due to the difficult budgetary situation the scope for providing additional staff to public bodies is limited.</P>
    <P>Regarding the seven temporary posts the Deputy refers to, which I take it are temporary fishery officer posts in the Eastern Regional Fisheries Board, I wish to advise the Deputy that in finalising the allocation among fishery boards of the funds available for 1993 consideration will be given to the Eastern Regional Fisheries Board's requirements for the recruitment of temporary protection staff.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Labour Court recommendations mentioned by the Deputy, I wish to advise him that the implementation of the recommendations in the Labour Court reports are not compatible with undertakings given by successive Ministers for Finance to Dáil Éireann and to the Central Bank in relation to posts in the public service vacated under the schemes of voluntary early retirements.  Implementation of these reports will also have adverse repercussions in regard to staffing in other parts of the public service. However, I understand that the Central Fisheries Board is considering the Labour Court recommendations to see whether the aspirations of the staff involved could be met in a manner which does not contravene these undertakings.</P>
    <P>Regarding the pay claim on behalf of the administrative staff in the regional boards, this matter is ongoing between management and unions in the fisheries boards and I have no function in the matter at this stage.</P>

      <P>The findings of the Widgery Tribunal, which was appointed by the British Government to inquire into the events of Bloody Sunday, have been widely viewed as unsatisfactory eversince their publication in April 1972 and have been a source of distress to the families of those who died.  It was for that reason, in reply to a parliamentary question on 10 February 1993, that I welcomed the recent explicit recognition by the British Prime Minister that the victims of Bloody Sunday should be regarded as innocent of any allegation that they were shot while handling firearms or explosives.  However, I recognise the concerns of the relatives of the victims <Col N="1433" /> that not all the allegations of the Widgery report have been dealt with.  I would, therefore, welcome any further steps which could be taken by the British Government to meet the legitimate concerns of the families in this regard.

      <P>The question is a purely hypothetical one to which no real answer can be given.  It is impossible to quantify what the level of foreign currency borrowing would have been between 1 September 1992 and 31 January 1993 if the Irish pound had been devalued earlier than it was.  The impact of such a devaluation on foreign currency borrowing would have depended crucially on the subsequent reaction of <Col N="1438" /> interest rates and exchange rates.  No one knows what would have happened to interest rates and exchange rates had we decided to devalue earlier than we did. Therefore there is no basis for any quantified reply.</P>

      <P>Relief for interest on a &ldquo;qualifying loan&rdquo; within the meaning of section 21, Finance Act, 1982, commonly known as mortgage interest relief, is restricted to the lesser of 80 per cent of the interest paid, or £1,600 for a single person, £3,200 for a married couple and £2,320 for a widowed person.  These restrictions also apply to interest relief on qualifying loans taken out on farm residences.</P>
      <P>It is presumed that, in the second part of the question, the Deputy is referring to a situation involving part business and part personal use of the farm residence. Where interest is paid in respect of a farm residence, the portion of the interest which is wholly and exclusively laid out for the purposes of the trade is allowed as a deduction in full in computing the profits of the trade.  However, the portion of the interest which is in respect of personal use of the farm residence is restricted in the manner described in the previous paragraph.</P>
      <P>Proposals for any change in mortgage relief are a matter for the budget.</P>

      <P>The Community Regeneration and Improvement Special Programme (CRISP) is a scheme under the disadvantaged areas initiative operated by the International Fund for Ireland, which is administered by an independent board. The scheme is designed to help bring about community-led economic development in the most disadvantaged areas in Northern Ireland.  It draws matching funding from the British Exchequer.  The Minister has no function in relation to the scheme.</P>
      <P>The Department of Finance has overall responsibility, together with the Department of Finance and personnel in Belfast, for the management of the joint Ireland/Northern Ireland INTERREG (Border areas) programme which is supported by the EC Structural Funds.  The matching funding for the EC aid comes from a mix of Exchequer, other public sector and private sector services.  Where the matching funding for particular measures under the programme comes from the Exchequer it is provided for in the Votes of the Departments responsible for the relevant measures.  This is in line with the normal practice for Structural Fund-assisted expenditure and is considered more appropriate than providing for a special fund within the Vote of the Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>The House will be aware that statutory price control generally was abolished in 1986 with the disbanding of the National Prices Commission. Currently there are no statutory price controls in operation.  The emphasis of successive Governments since 1986 has been to refrain from direct interference in business and to avoid employing bureaucratic measures that would impose unnecessary burdens on business or consume scarce public funds.  Accordingly, I do not have official information readily available about prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as regards the concerns mentioned by the Deputy, I understand that, following the practice advocated by the former National Prices Commission, when price control generally was in operation, importers of magazines from the United Kingdom enter into legally binding contracts to buy sterling on a six-monthly basis.  Consequently, when comparing prices, it would not be appropriate to merely convert from the stated sterling charge to Irish currency as at a current date.  In addition, as the product is VAT free in the United Kingdom, due allowance for this and the additional cost of transport from the United Kingdom to Ireland must be taken into account when a comparison between retail charges here and in the United Kingdom is being made.  I understand that United Kingdom newspapers have their Irish sale price determined in the United Kingdom.  The last contracted sterling change took place <Col N="1446" /> in November last.  This resulted in a reduction in cover prices of approximately 8.5 per cent.  The next currency-related cover price adjustment should take place in May.</P>

      <P>Absenteeism, be it due to alcohol related problems or other factors, is a cause of concern because of its detrimental effects in terms of increased costs and reduced productivity and competitiveness.  The control of absenteeism is an essential element in managing an enterprise and is the primary responsibility of the management at each workplace.  Enterprises which have adopted specific counselling and control policies and kept necessary records have been successful in reducing the problem. I would encourage all enterprises to consider undertaking similar strategies.</P>
      <P>There have been a number of studies and reports on absenteeism and these are outlined in the following table.  The Irish Business and Employers Confederation is currently undertaking a major survey involving 1,200 of its member companies in an attempt to quantify the level of absenteeism generally.  I believe that this survey should provide very useful and comprehensive information covering manufacturing industry, business and the services sector.  An interim report was published in November 1992.  I understand that it is intended to publish the final report later this year.</P>

      <P>The company to which the Deputy refers is a Gibraltar registered company which, by order of the Gibraltar Supreme Court, has been in liquidation since 1984.  Although the company does not ever seem to have been registered as carrying on business in this jurisdiction, there was an Irish dimension as it seems to have been, by all accounts, under the control of an Irish national.  In addition, many of those who invested in it appear to have been from Northern Ireland in particular.  The company has its genesis here going back to the seventies in the form of an industrial and provident society.  This society ceased operations around 1978 when new legislation in that sphere was imminent and transferred certain assets and liabilities to the Gibraltar-based company. Public advertisments placed at the time by the Registrar of Friendly Societies did not elicit any substantiated claims from depositors that moneys were owed by the society.</P>
      <P>Various representations about the company, including allegations of criminal offences within this jurisdiction and requests for the appointment of a High Court inspector have been made both to me and to my predecessors.  While I have certain powers under the Companies Acts relating to the appointment of inspectors to conduct investigations into the affairs of companies, I have no reason to demur from the view of a predecessor of mine than no useful purpose would be served by invoking these powers in this case.</P>
      <P>Allegations made have been subject to full investigation by the Garda in 1984-85 and 1988 as well as review on a number of other occasions.  I understand that a file in the case was referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions but the director signified that there should be no prosecution. I am also informed that the Garda authorities have indicated that if any new evidence is adduced in the case it will be thoroughly investigated and, if appropriate, again referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>

      <P>For some years now, the grants made on the advice of DÍON, the London-based advisory committee on the welfare of emigrants in Britain, have been confined to British based organisations with one long-standing exception &mdash; Emigrant Advice, Dublin. In 1992, as an exceptional measure, a grant was made to a second Irish based agency.</P>
      <P>However, both Emigrant Advice, Dublin, and the other agency were advised last year that the then Minister had accepted the recommendation of the DÍON Committee that the moneys available were more pressingly needed by the voluntary agencies in Britain and he did not propose providing further grant aid for voluntary agencies operating in Ireland.</P>
      <P>DÍON will shortly be inviting applications from suitable British based bodies and will subsequently advise me on how best to allocate this year's grant of £500,000 which is at the same level as last year.</P>

The level of payments under these schemes is kept under review. However, with a given budget, any increases in these allowances would have to be at the expense of the numbers participating in these schemes.</P>

      <Quest>whether Ireland has supported the Commission's proposal for the creation of a new Objective 6 under the Structural Funds which would be targeted at coastal regions with a high dependence on the fishing industry; the reason this proposal was not acceptable to the Council of Ministers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, Community structural aid to the sea fish sector is currently available through Regulations 4028/86 and 4042/89.  These regulations are not currently part of the Structural Funds framework, but will be incorporated into that framework with effect from 1 January 1994.</P>
      <P>In this context, the main purpose of the Commission's initiative in proposing a new Objective 6 was to integrate all current fisheries structural measures into the Structural Funds and, within that framework, to adopt accompanying socio-economic measures with a regional impact to assist areas dependent on fishing. The creation of an Objective 6 is just one possible way of achieving this aim. Another possible way of reaching the same goal would be to create a new heading within Objective 5b.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the creation of an Objective 6 has been discussed on a number of occasions at Community level, most notably at the Edinburgh Council, <Col N="1458" /> which concluded, <i>inter alia</i>, that &ldquo;appropriate attention should be given to the needs of areas dependent on fishing within the relevant objectives&rdquo;.  The matter is still under discussion, and no final decision has yet been taken on it at Community level.</P>
    <P>In this context, the Irish view has consistently been to support any initiative which will result in the Community having at its disposal structural instruments and resources which will enable it best to meet the challenges currently confronting the fisheries sector, in particular in areas which are heavily dependent on fishing.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136 and 137 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Research and development and marketing programmes are essential for the ongoing development of most industries including the food industry.  As regards <Col N="1468" /> research and development, my Department already provides some funding to Teagasc for food research.  The Culliton report has indicated that the level of funding of research and development in Ireland is small by comparison with other countries with which we must compete. It is, of course, my aim to move towards a situation where the overall funding level by the EC, the State and the processing industry should be such as to ensure both that our research institutions are able to carry out their necessary tasks effectively and that Irish firms are encouraged to develop their R &amp; D programmes.  I intend to pursue this aim to the greatest possible extent consistent with limitations on national financial resources.</P>
    <P>In the case of marketing, my Department already supports the activity of CBF through a grant-in-aid, and that organisation also receives income from levies and from EC funds.  I would encourage CBF to develop its market development and promotion services and I understand that it is proposed to do so.  BIM and ABT are not under the aegis of my Department.  The Culliton report indicated a need to co-ordinate and integrate State-aided agency support for overseas food marketing.</P>
    <P>The Expert Group on the Food Industry, established under one of the Culliton recommendations and due to report within the next month or two, has both the question of research and development and that of the organisational structure of food promotion agencies within its remit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Hydro and wind power are the renewable energy sources which offer the greatest potential for electricity production in Ireland. Hydro-electric technology can be regarded as being fully commercialised while the technical feasibility of harnessing wind power has now being firmly established.  Hydro power now accounts for 5 per cent of total electricity production or approximately 746 Gigawatt hours per annum and there has been a <Col N="1470" /> significant increase in recent years in the contribution from private hydro producers.</P>
      <P>In the case of wind power, the Deputy will be aware that construction of Ireland's first wind farm at Bellacorick, County Mayo, with an installed capacity of 6.45 megawatts was completed in October 1992 and the technical and financial performance of this installation will determine to some extent further developments in this area.  I will continue to encourage the greater utilisation of both these resources in the context of our overall energy requirement.</P>
      <P>With regard to different forms of electricity production relative to their cost, my objective is to ensure that Irish electricity prices are as low as possible after taking account of the need for a diversified supply of fuel.  The ESB continues to monitor the relative costs of electricity from various fuels and this forms a major part of its decisions in relation to the type of fuel to be used whenever new generating capacity must be constructed. Details of the relative cost of the ESB's existing fuels are clearly shown in the ESB's comprehensive annual report.</P>

      <P>My attention has been drawn to recent statements regarding drug abuse in the Dublin area.  In this regard, my Department recently held a series of meetings with the Garda and the drug treatment services to assess the current position.  The matter was also examined on 10 February 1993 by the National Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse, which is chaired by my colleague, Deputy Willie O'Dea, Minister of State.  Following the meeting, the chairman and the committee have undertaken to identify gaps in legislation which need to be remedied to strengthen the powers of the Garda and the Customs Service.</P>
      <P>My Department, in conjunction with other State agencies and voluntary bodies, has in place a wide range of drug treatment and preventative strategies which are the subject of regular review. These are being implemented under the Government's strategy to prevent drug misuse.  Recently strategies to combat drug abuse have taken on another dimension due to the large number of persons who have become infected with HIV/AIDS as a result of sharing needles which have been contaminated with the HIV virus.  Consequently many of the services cater for both HIV/AIDS infected individuals as well as drug abusers.</P>

      <P>I am currently examining the scope for deployment of additional teaching resources to children with special educational needs.  The question of remedial teaching posts will form a key element in this consideration.  In this connection the Programme for a Partnership Government provides for the recruitment of 500 remedial teachers by September 1996.</P>

      <P>An analysis of the operation of the existing school book scheme showed that:</P>
      <P>(a)  there were wide variations in the levels of support claimed by apparently similar schools and in the levels of support received by pupils;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1476" /> (b)  inadequate criteria formed an unreliable basis for identifying needy pupils.</P>
    <P>My Department was concerned at the lack of uniformity in the interpretation by schools as to what constituted a needy child and consequently proposed revised arrangements which involved using the established criteria of the Department of Social Welfare Clothing and Footwear Scheme for identifying the most needy children.</P>
    <P>These arrangements, which would help to ensure that available funds are directed towards those pupils who are most in need of assistance and that funds are distributed equitably between schools and within schools, are the subject of ongoing discussions with the interested parties.</P>
