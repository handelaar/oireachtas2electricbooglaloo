      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 2, 3, 4, 1, 7 and 8.  It is further proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that; (1) Nos. 2, 3 and 4 shall be decided without debate.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to No. 3 on page 129 of the Order Paper.  The effect of this is that each day the Technical Group would have the fifth of the five Priority Questions.  The order specified suggests that Fine Gael have the first two questions, the Progressive Democrats the third, Fine Gael have the fourth and Technical Group the fifth.  This is a departure from normal Standing Orders of the House.  Standing Orders provide for the situation that has obtained up to today; this is a sectional order to change that, the effect of which will be to exclude my group from effective participation in Priority Question Time.</P>
      <P>Through no fault of yours, Sir, up to now on only one occasion this year we have dealt with more than Priority Questions. Having regard to the nature of Priority Questions there will be important matters which will not be reached.  I appeal to the other Opposition parties not to push this order through.  It is not the intention of the Independent Deputies, the Green Party or Democratic Left to obstruct unreasonably spokespersons for Fine Gael on important issues or to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that but what is proposed is a negation of democracy.  We are about to start the debate on Dáil reform tomorrow and to cut out Deputies democratically elected to this House is unworthy of Fine Gael or the Progressive Democrats.  I ask them to think again on it.</P>

      <P>In this connection, we have applied for an extra five minutes for <Col N="283" /> Priority Questions to try to overcome the difficulty that has been created.  It has taken a great deal of negotiation and discussion to agree to the motion in its present form.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to item No. 3, on behalf of the Independent members of the Technical Group, I appeal to the Taoiseach and every fairminded member of this House not to push this item through today but allow it to be referred back for further discussion. The effect of what is recommended by the two larger Opposition parties in item No. 3 would be to deny the Independents and the smaller parties a fair chance of any meaningful participation in the most basic procedures of this House at Question Time.  If this were to happen&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wish to dissuade the Deputy from embarking on a speech; a brief comment should suffice at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>It has profound long term implications over the next few years for this group.  It would simply mean that the existing procedures and rules of the House are to be changed deliberately and unashamedly to exclude minorities from participating in the Dáil.  I appeal, in particular to the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Bruton, to agree to defer this matter so that a fairer system can be agreed.  If minorities in this House are treated in such an anti-democratic manner what chance is there for minorities outside the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael considered this matter in some detail.  Were our party to demand strict proportionality, it would mean that either the Progressive Democrats or the Technical Group would not be in a position to have any question placed or answered on a particular day. As we accept the rights of minority groups we agreed that each such group should have the right to put down a Priority Question and have it answered. It is a matter for regulation and you, Sir, <Col N="284" /> as Ceann Comhairle to see in so far as is possible that the Priority Question Time slot is dealt with in full, thereby ensuring that both the Progressive Democrats and the Technical Group not alone have the right to have their question placed but also have the right to have it answered.  I repeat again that were the Fine Gael Party, as the major Opposition party, to demand its full proportionate due in this matter, then either one of the two groups would not have a Priority Question answered at all on particular days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that considerable thought was given to this matter over the past number of days, I pose the question now whether any useful purpose would be served by referring it back again to the Whips.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to stop any group having the opportunity to ask questions but it is a matter for the Fine Gael Party and the Progressive Democrats. The Government has no objection to it being left for another day, if the Dáil so wishes, to allow an opportunity to try to resolve the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party consists of 45 Deputies.  If we were to get our full share of Priority Questions &mdash; there are only five Priority Questions allocated &mdash; every day we would have four out of the five questions.  In order to facilitate other parties in the House, we agreed to reduce the number we are taking from four to three.  I belive that is reasonable.  It is important to recognise that every Deputy in this House is equal and each Deputy in the Fine Gael Party is equal to each Deputy in Democratic Left.  By allowing Democratic Left have one question out of five we are giving them more than their share.  It is not unreasonable on our part.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>In the spirit of generosity exhibited by the Taoiseach in this matter in wishing to extend to everyone in the House a reasonable opportunity of asking questions, I ask the Taoiseach whether the Government would be prepared <Col N="285" /> to provide five minutes extra for Priority Questions each day and, in that way, facilitate all the parties engaged in this discussion?</P>

      <P>The Chair has allowed a lot of latitude.  Can we accept that Deputy Rabbitte is winding up his remarks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point made by Deputy Bruton about Fine Gael not getting their entitlement in strict proportion, the alternative arrangement of four and one on alternate days would give Fine Gael a marginally better arrangement over a period of 20 days.  However, the fact remains that the concession the Fine Gael Party has made is to the advantage of the Progressive Democrats and to the disadvantage of the Technical Group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I know you are not too good at figures, lads, but that is the way it is.  That situation effectively excludes the Technical Group.  It is not long ago since the Progressive Democrats had fewer than seven Members in this House and I regret that they are agreeing to push this through.  I do not think it is worth taking up the time of the House in contesting a vote on which we know the outcome.  The Priority Question today is from Deputy Gregory.  We will use every parliamentary tactic available to us during Priority Question Time to make sure that the fifth question is raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to move an amendment to the order concerning the Committee and Final Stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting it in two parts in order to facilitate your amendment.  I am putting first that Second Stage be taken and I will propose later that the Committee and Final Stages be taken.  I will call for your amendment at that stage.  Is that satisfactory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose on behalf of the Fine Gael Party that Committee Stage of this Bill be deferred for a week in order to allow the Government time to publish legislation which would subject all public authorities to the requirement to apply for planning permission by which all other citizens must abide.</P>
      <P>I believe there is a fundamental principle here of equality before the law.  I do not believe that the State, particularly where it is engaging in what may be semi-commercial activity, should not be subject to planning permission requirement in the same way as others.  I also believe that citizens who wish to object to any State developments should have the same rights to object under the planning law that they have in regard to private sector sponsored developments.  Under EC law competition should be fair between State and private sector developers and, therefore, the same planning laws should apply to State developers as private developers. For that reason, Sir, I propose two amendments to the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>In regard to Second Stage, I propose that instead of that Stage concluding at 1.30 p.m. today it should conclude at 6 p.m. I propose, in regard to Committee and Remaining Stages, that they be taken not earlier than Tuesday, 23 February to allow time for the Government to publish legislation to subject works by public authorities to the requirements to obtain planning permission in the same way as applies to all other citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a fundamental matter, both of the liberties of citizens and of the liberties of this House and I hope the Government will accept this constructive proposal.  We do not object to the Office of Public <Col N="287" /> Works and other State authorities being given this power but we believe they should be subject to planning permission the same as everyone else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Bruton's proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Brief comments only at this point; we must not at this stage anticipate debate on the Bill proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not entering into a discussion on the merits or demerits of the Bill.  My experience is that rushed legislation is bad legislation.  I appreciate that this is an emergency to some degree but, at the same time.  Deputy Bruton's proposal is reasonable.  It allows time for pause and reflection and time to consider appropriate amendments to the Bill. From that point of view, it is a reasonable approach to what the Government will, no doubt, present as being an emergency case.</P>
      <P>The proposal to rush Second Stage through by 1.30 p.m. will allow at most two and a half hours for debate.  Of that, two hours will be pre-empted by the four principal spokespersons and a quarter of an hour for the winding up of the debate by the Government.  That will allow 15 minutes at most to other Members of this House to express their views on this issue. Quite frankly, that is not good enough and Deputy Bruton's proposal to allow until 6 p.m. today is surely a reasonable compromise and would allow other Members to participate for even five or ten minutes in the debate.  I strongly urge the Government to accept the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disturbed at the way it is proposed to rush this Bill through.  The Bill is an extensive one. The public may feel that it only relates to difficulties that have arisen at Mullaghmore and at two other interpretative centres but that is not the case.  Enormous powers are given not just to the Office of Public Works but to each individual member of the Government also.  If there <Col N="288" /> is a division on the Order of Business &mdash; as I imagine there will be if there is not agreement on it &mdash; significantly less than two and half hours will be available for Second Stage debate and that is patently inadequate.  It means that five speeches in total will be made.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of considerable importance. There are considerable legal problems that arise and need time to be sorted out.  At the very minimum, what Deputy Bruton has now suggested should be agreed and it would only be reasonable for the Government to agree to that.  To do otherwise is quite unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too wish to comment on the extraordinary haste with which this legislation is being brought before the House.  Like many Members of the House, my view and that of my party would be altered somewhat if there were a requirement on the part of State authorities to apply for planning permission. The <i>Programme for a Partnership in Government</i> promised the introduction of legislation which most of us understood to mean that State authorities would be required to apply for planning permission.  However, we have had a series of incidents &mdash; voting down an amendment on the Roads Bill last Thursday, the introduction of this legislation and a statement yesterday on the Order of Business by the Taoiseach &mdash; which seem to suggest that the Government is contemplating something less than a requirement to apply for planning permission on the part of State authorities.</P>
      <P>What Deputy Bruton is seeking is justifed and I invite the Taoiseach to state whether it is the Government's intention to introduce legislation to require State authorities to apply for planning permission and to respond positively to the suggestion that we leave Committee Stage for another week to allow the Government to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I made the position plain yesterday but, apparently, there are some misconceptions about the Bill and its contents.  The Bill is to regularise the position of the Office of Public Works; it is an emergency measure.  It is doing no more than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The questions raised by Deputies O'Malley, Gilmore and Connor are about the planning aspects of the High Court decision.  I made it clear yesterday that there were two differing High Court decisions in relation to the planning problem.  They were appealed by the Government, as a matter of urgency, <Col N="290" /> to the Supreme Court for adjudication but, in the meantime, we were looking at the whole planning process to implement the commitments in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>.  That is the important part of it.  This is a regulation Bill.  The other part surely needs plenty of time for consideration to make sure we get it right.  The House can be assured that the commitments in the programme for Government will be implemented.  I read about and listened to Deputy Cox's hysterics in relation to building nuclear power stations.  Somebody in his own party knows more about nuclear power stations than we do; consequently, they should not make inflammatory statements or try to create fear in people's minds about the Bill.  This is an emergency Bill to regulate the position of the Office of Public Works, to allow the projects to continue, and keep people in employment &mdash; no more, no less.  We will return to the other area in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that Committee Stage should be postponed for a week.  We know from the recent decision in the High Court on the Mullaghmore case the huge costs that can occur if one is not satisfied in advance that particular legislation or powers being exercised are <Col N="297" /> consistent with the Constitution.  We need at least one week to examine whether this Bill is constitutional.  I propose a delay of one week within which the Government would also produce legislation &mdash; which they have promised in any event &mdash; to subject the works carried out by the Office of Public Works and other State authorities to planning permission.  I believe that is an entirely reasonable approach.  I appeal in particular to the Labour Party who have in the past shown considerable concern for the liberties of Members of this House to demonstrate that concern continues, that they will not allow this House to be taken for granted in regard to a matter of this kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hoped we would not have a rehash of the speeches made earlier.  The question revolves around whether this Bill is to be taken today.  I do not wish to have repetition.  I am calling Deputy O'Malley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach, when he intervened earlier, spoke of me and other Deputies referring to the problems of planning permission that arise under this Bill.  I made no reference to planning in what I said earlier; I could not because there is nothing about planning in the Bill.  Planning is a totally separate matter. I understand the Government has decided to pursue that by way of appeal. This Bill does not deal with planning nor did I suggest it did.  However, it would not be the first time that my words have been misrepresented by the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Second Stage of this Bill is to be guillotined in just over two hours from now, it is totally inappropriate that Committee Stage be taken today also.  There are many difficult technical matters and the whole question of the relationship between this Bill and planning law will have to be worked out.  There is no possible way that could be done between now and 6.45 p.m. tonight.  It is totally impossible. One of the amendments my party will consider putting down on Committee Stage is to the effect that any works undertaken by a Minister or by the Commissioners <Col N="298" /> of Public Works would be subject to planning permission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The request to the Government is reasonable.  I cannot see any reason time should not be given for a considered amendment that would deal with the planning aspect.  It makes no sense if we have two conflicting judgments from two different High Court judges for this House to ask the Judiciary to make the decision.</P>

      <P>I wish to clarify a point in this area.  The willingness of the Government to recognise the need for transparency in planning has been expressed in the Programme for a Partnership Government and will be proceeded with.  It is quite reasonable for the Government to try to regularise at the earliest possible moment the serious situation which exists in relation to Government contracts, builders who are carrying them out and workers whose jobs are at <Col N="300" /> risk.  It is ungracious to try to misrepresent what I said and the Progressive Democrats' claim is, as usual, trying to misrepresent the facts.  Deputy Cox said that under the Bill we could build nuclear stations anywhere we liked.  If Deputy O'Malley would take Deputy Cox aside and have a little chat with him it would be helpful.</P>

The legislation we will consider later today has the effect, as I understand it, of explicitly exempting the State from the planning legislation because of the definition of development used in section 2 (5).  Why has the Government not introduced the promised legislation to subject the State to the requirements of the planning Acts in parallel with this legislation? This is promised legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the State Authorities (Development and Management) Bill, 1993 is to restore to the Commissioners of Public Works the power to carry out building functions and ancillary activities subject to the sanction of the Minister for Finance and also to ensure that other State authorities have these powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I am sure Members are aware at this stage, Mr. Justice Costello ruled in the High Court last Friday that the Commissioners for Public Works, apart from specific statutory powers, did not have general legislative authority to build, maintain or manage public buildings nor provide public amenities or supply services to the public.  He also held that State authorities were not exempt from the application of section 24 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  The High Court action did not deal in a detailed way with the <Col N="314" /> environmental issues but focused on narrow legal arguments which affected all State projects.  Although the environmental issue was addressed it was dismissed by Mr. Justice Costello.</P>
    <P>On the second issue, the Government has decided to appeal this matter to the Supreme Court as there are now two conflicting High Court judgments on the matter.  Until we have a Supreme Court decision which clarifies the position the proposals contained in the Programme for a Partnership Government regarding the introduction of further planning controls for State authorities cannot be further progressed.</P>
    <P>I reiterate, therefore, that this Bill deals solely with the question of the powers to build and manage State property and provide services and not with planning issues.  Some statements made since the announcement of this legislation represent a total misconception of the High Court judgement and the Bill. The distinction between the two elements of the judgement is evidenced by the different means being adopted to deal with the High Court decision, that is legislation and appeal.  I can understand Deputies across the floor confusing the issue but I cannot understand outside bodies who should know better making statements that are obviously inaccurate and misleading.</P>
    <P>The legislation must be dealt with speedily in view of the implications of the High Court judgement.  As a result of Mr. Justice Costello's decision the Attorney General has advised that all works in hand by the Commissioners not covered by specific statute should immediately cease.  Contractors have been advised of the position.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 50 major projects involved in all and, in many cases, protective notice to the workforce will follow unless the law is amended.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress at this stage that the High Court decision on the powers of the Commissioners came as a complete surprise to the State's legal advisers and the Commissioners.  The fact is that the Office of Public Works has been building, maintaining and managing many public <Col N="315" /> building since the middle of the last century with the approval of Parliament and on the instructions of different Governments and Ministers for Finance.  Such work includes the erection of Garda stations, Government offices and the restoration of heritage properties such as Dublin Castle and the Custom House.</P>
    <P>While the Attorney General has advised that there are good grounds for appealing the ruling in relation to the powers of the Commissioners, the implications of waiting for the Supreme Court decision in this specific area, particularly in relation to job losses, make it more prudent to change the law.</P>
    <P>This Bill, apart from providing the general powers to build, maintain and manage properties also validate building projects predating this legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 1 provides for the usual definitions. Section 2 (1) provides State authorities with the powers to carry out or procure development, maintenance and to supply goods and services.  Section 2 (2) allows State authorities to carry out all actions necessary for the carrying out of the powers set out in section 2 (1). Section 2 (3) provides for the consent of the Minister for Finance to the exercise of powers under section 2 (1) and (2). This ensures accountability to the Dáil for all powers exercised under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (4) provides that the new powers are not in substitution for the existing powers of State authorities. Section 2 (5) defines development. Section 3 requires the sanction of the Minister for Finance for expenses arising from the implementation of the Bill. Section 4 gives short title and collective citation.</P>
    <P>Some people have queried why work continued on the Burren project pending the full High Court hearing.  Indeed, there have been allegations that officials in the Office of Public Works deliberately pushed forward the project despite the High Court action.  It is important, therefore, that I set the record straight in this regard.  The High Court action in the Burren commenced when the first contract was in progress.  The Commissioners <Col N="316" /> were ready to place the second contract and so informed the court but refrained from proceeding pending the judge's ruling on whether works should go ahead.  Mr. Justice O'Hanlon in that case ruled decisively that works should not be stopped.</P>
    <P>He criticised the applicants for the delay in taking the action and he praised the irreproachable handling of the project by the Office of Public Works.  Given the intensity of criticism of Office of Public Works officials recently perhaps I should like to quote from Mr. Justice O'Hanlon's judgement in this regard:</P>
    <P>Having regard to the course of events as related in the affidavit ... and the documentation which has been placed before the court, it appears to me that the Commissioners have been meticulous in the manner in which they have carried forward the project to date, in giving information to the local authority and to the public at large as to the nature of the planned development; in inviting comments and giving consideration to representations made; in commissioning the environmental impact report, and generally in going well beyond what they conceived as their duties and obligations at law in these respects.</P>
    <P>Conversely, I am of the opinion that the Applicants must be criticised for delaying until matters were so far advanced and so many commitments had been entered into, before taking steps to assert whatever rights they believe they had at law to restrain the Respondents from proceeding further with the project.  Because I believe that the balance of convenience lies in favour of allowing the work to proceed rather than in favour of halting it pending the hearing of the action, and because I believe the Respondents have conducted their affairs in an irreproachable manner to date and that the Applicants have delayed unduly in seeking the relief now claimed, I have to refuse the present application for an interlocutory injunction.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works's legal advice <Col N="317" /> at that stage was that they had the power to build and the High Court had already ruled in the Luggala case that they had followed the correct planning procedure. There was, therefore, no reason not to proceed with the Burren project.  The Commissioners were also working to strict deadlines to draw down EC funds. These required that the project be finished by December 1993.  In these circumstances they sought and received ministerial approval to proceed.</P>
    <P>There have also been allegations that the contractor proceeded with undue haste at the Burren.  Again, the facts need to be set out. Tenders for that project were very competitive.  The contractor submitted that if he was to avoid losses he would have to complete the project within a strict time frame.  Any overtime worked is a matter for the contractor.</P>
    <P>As Members are aware, the Government had decided to suspend work on the Boyne, Wicklow and Burren projects pending the Supreme Court appeal in relation to the planning issue.</P>
    <P>It would be useful for me to outline the background to the Parks Service which is the area where the need for this Bill has come about.</P>
    <P>One of the more challenging tasks facing the Office of Public Works is the provision of public access to our parks, gardens and monuments while at the same time protecting these national assets for future generations.  This is done in a number of ways; by the recruitment of rangers and guides to provide tours, walks and talks for visitors; the construction of information boards, panels, nature and historical trails and the provision of visitor centres containing displays, exhibits and audio-visual programmes.</P>
    <P>On-site visitor centres are essential elements in the management of public access to the heritage landscape.  This is recognised worldwide.  The provision of visitor centres at Ireland's major heritage sites is all the more important given Government policy which aims to significantly increase the number of visitors to this country.</P>

      <P>The value of visitor centres in national parks is that such centres, while managing public access, also provide the opportunity to develop an interpretative programme to encourage public appreciation of the park and all it contains and thus secure its preservation and the protection of the environment generally.  While it is important to state that interpretation is not the sole function of a visitor centre it does form an important part of the use of the centre.  The role of interpretation in fostering an appreciation of the nation's heritage is crucial. Although provocative and inspirational, interpretation is not merely entertainment. It helps parks and other protected areas to contribute to peoples' understanding of nature and culture. Interpretation is an integral component of the Office of Public Works's management policies for national parks, monuments and nature reserves.</P>

      <P>The provision of national parks by the Office of Public Works is in keeping with international practice.  In the US, visitor centres are a feature of national parks.  They are often situated in or at the periphery of a park.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Germany the premier national park is served by an on-site visitor centre where great emphasis is placed on exhibits and displays conveying an appreciation of the natural processes in the park as well as broader conservation issues. At present, the visitor centre at Holland's first national park is being extended.  This <Col N="319" /> centre is five kilometres from the nearest village.</P>
    <P>In Ireland the Office of Public Works manages 33 centres which attracted more than 1.5 million visitors in 1992.  Some visitor facilities are provided within existing buildings.  Other centres are purpose-built such as the award winning buildings at Glenveagh in County Donegal and Glendalough in County Wicklow.  The Office of Public Works, as a matter of policy, also publishes management plans for the properties it cares for.  The Killarney National Park management plan I have already mentioned identifies the need for seven locations in the park where visitor buildings, facilities and services should be provided.</P>
    <P>In 1988 the Federation of Nature and National Parks of Europe, which represents countries from both west and east Europe, adopted a resolution on visitor centres at its 17th general assembly.  The following extract from the assembly emphasises the importance of visitor centres:</P>
    <P>The present critical situation of natural environment requires a new attitude to nature.  A broad approach to environmental education is, therefore, vital to achieve a change in attitude. National and nature parks, with a network of well-equipped visitor centres appropriate to their needs, make a valuable contribution to this objective.</P>
    <P>In all the analysis of the visitor centres controversy very few commentators have focused on the primary purpose of these projects which is conservation oriented. Only recently Dick Warner, writing in a national newspaper, conveyed the nub of the issue, when he stated:</P>
    <P>The challenge of national park management all over the world is to balance conservation interest with the legitimate aspirations of visitors wanting to enjoy nature.  This universal problem is at the heart of the Mullaghmore protest and the problems the Office of Public Works are grappling with.</P>
    <P>Even though there has been controversy <Col N="320" /> over a few projects, most of the 15 visitor centre projects have progressed without dispute and, indeed, were warmly welcomed.</P>
    <P>In the projects at the Burren, the Boyne and Wicklow the plans have met the scrutiny and approval of the relevant planning authorities in each area.</P>
    <P>Despite such independent assessment, the sensitive design of each project, the fact that they were located on man-modified sites &mdash; a quarry and reclaimed field in the Burren, a commercial conifer plantation in Wicklow &mdash; and the conservation record of the Office of Public Works, they still aroused opposition which led to the recent High Court challenge.</P>
    <P>In 1974 expert advice was commissioned to select a representative area in the Burren for protection as a national park.  The Mullaghmore area was picked and a target area of 6,000 acres or 5 per cent of the entire Burren was chosen. Since then the Office of Public Works has acquired more than 3,000 acres of land with the co-operation and consent of the local farmers.</P>
    <P>As early as 1982 the Office of Public Works considered potential sites for a visitor centre even though there was no money available at that time to build a centre.  In 1989 the advent of EC Structural Funds enabled plans to proceed. The project was submitted for EC funding and was approved.  A number of locations were examined and a disused quarry and a reclaimed field one and a half miles from the top of Mullaghmore was chosen.  Clare County Council had no objections to the proposed site.  Design work commenced in 1990.  In 1991 some groups expressed reservations at the location.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works met An Taisce, local groups and other interested parties.  In the light of the fears expressed an environmental impact statement was commissioned from an international firm of consultants.</P>
    <P>The environmental impact statement was completed in 1992 and circulated to the public for comment.  A total of 520 submissions were received, 349 in favour <Col N="321" /> of the project.  The Office of public Works then submitted a detailed environmental impact assessment with the Environmental Impact Statement and public response to Clare County Council for independent assessment again.  Both the council's technical officers and elected representatives endorsed the Environmental Impact Assessment and approved the project.  The EC then confirmed that the Office of Public Works had complied with all EC Directives.  The Phase 1 contract for the project was placed with Government approval. Opponents then sought an injunction to stop the works but were refused by the High Court, and I quoted the judgement earlier.  The Phase 2 works commenced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important Bill.</P>
      <P>One of the saddest features of the entire controversy which led to this Bill coming before the House was the fact that in the course of the protracted public debate, the Commissioners of Public Works were portrayed as being anti-conservationist. That is sad for the simple reason that long before green became popular in Europe the Commissioners of Public Works, founded in 1831, were green.  They are a conservationist society and exist as such.  If people want evidence of this it is to be found in the many marvellous, wonderful national parks throughout this country.  If one wishes to examine the national monuments or anything which they set their hand on, be it Dublin Castle or any other public building, one will find that the Commissioners of Public Works are, in the final analysis, the most responsible conservationist society here and the last century-and-a-half establishes that if proof were needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, everybody is interested in preserving the environment and this is something which is dear to everybody's heart but perhaps, dearer to those who live with nature than it would be to those who live in concrete jungles.  In this context, the environment, while important, is nothing without man.  There are two kinds of environmental blackguardism; the first relates to the destruction of mountainside, rivers, lakes and so on; and the second is where human beings are not given the opportunity by the utilisation of their indigenous resources to reside in their own place.  The challenge which faced the Office of Public Works, and the challenge which this Bill presents, is to marry the two.  People have <Col N="326" /> a right to live where they were born, to obtain employment in areas where it is extremely difficult to do so and to use their own indigenous resources in order to achieve that aim.  It is the most extreme form of elitism for a group of elitist people to state that they know better than those who live in the area which is the subject of concern.  The elitism is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important in this context that we realise that the culture of this country needs to be interpreted and presented to the world in a cohesive, coherent and visual way.  This can best be done by building the interpretative centres concerned in order that people may appreciate what they have come to see.  They enhance and inspire.  To deny people that right would be a grave error.</P>
    <P>There has been a frenzied attempt to prevent the building of the centres concerned and, in particular, the one at Mullaghmore. I spent a brief period as Minister of State at Finance, responsible for the Office of Public Works and I can say without fear or favour that the Commissioners of Public Works under no circumstances would do anything which would destroy the environment. However, they would do everything possible to preserve it and, in this case, to try to marry the needs of the locality and the requirements of the environment.  In fact, since 1831 that has been the record of the Office of Public Works.  I sincerely hope that it will be accepted with the best of goodwill that such an authority does not require a watchdog because one is asking the watchdog to watch itself which does not make sense.  It reminds me of the old Roman saying&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This Bill impinges to a great extent on the culture and heritage of this country.  It would not be before the House today if court action were not initiated in relation to the building of interpretative centres.  I understand that the Minister in charge of heritage affairs here is the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Michael D. Higgins?  Where is the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht since, quite obviously he is the Minister responsible for so much of what is implied in this Bill?  It is quite disgraceful that he is not on the Government benches today.  It is doubly disgraceful that there are so few members of the Labour Party here today. It is disgraceful that we had to call a quorum in the middle of the Minister's speech and that there was little interest shown by the Government benches, particularly the Labour portion of this Government who have so much to say about these measures.  That is different, of course, to what has been said by the other component of Government, i.e. the Fianna Fáil Party in the media.  Those Members are not present to at least listen to the Minister's presentation and that of the main Opposition party and others who wish to speak.  One hopes they would have some presentation to make themselves. Even if it differs from the Government's line on these matters, let us hear it.  Let us have that minimal amount of courage from the minor partners in this Government.</P>
      <P>If this Bill is passed today the Government will have a range of sweeping powers to construct and alter buildings without any reference to the planning laws of this State.  In short, the Government would not be subjected to the same planning laws of the land that apply to every other citizen.  On the other hand, if no such Bill is enacted, and if the judgement of Mr. Justice Costello is to be followed and obeyed, then the Government will have no power to build even a simple wall.  Also, serious question marks would hang over all public buildings carried out by the State since 1922 and even earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael accept that the power of the <Col N="328" /> Government to construct anything must be put on a statutory basis and in this sense, a Bill along these lines is necessary. The right thing for the Dáil to do is to clear up the present anomaly where the State cannot even build if it has planning permission but it is wrong for the Dáil to pass legislation that does not ensure that in future the State must be subject to the same planning laws as everybody else here.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael seek to amend every section that confers upon the Government the right to construct, repair or alter any public building or structure adding that these powers will only be conferred after the State has gone through the normal planning process.  That is what we are seeking.  We agree that the Government has the right to build and maintain public buildings buy lands in sesitive and archaeological areas and construct interpretative centres but we insist that all these activities be subject to the planning laws. That is very little to ask.</P>
    <P>The Government insist on ordinary citizens obeying the planning laws, the requirements of which have become more strict with every amendment to the Act made since 1963 and we have had quite a number of amendments in the intervening years.</P>
    <P>The circumstances surrounding the bringing of this legislation to this House today are indeed murky and messy.  We had the members of the Government, as it were, talking out of two sides of their mouths.  The Mullaghmore interpretative centre led to the court action which, in turn, led to the introduction of this Bill. We heard the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht say he had decided that he would put a &ldquo;warden's hut&rdquo; on top of what had been constructed at Mullaghmore which would cost the State £1.6 million.  We are not criticising what was done but the fact that it was done without reference to the proper planning process. He also stated that he would move the interpretative centre to Leminagh Castle and yet the owner of that castle was able to tell the nation on one of our main news broadcasts that he had never been consulted about a move to Leminagh <Col N="329" /> Castle.  What type of Government is that? What kind of consultation is that between the partners in Government or the people?  Does the House not agree that is an absolute disgrace?</P>
    <P>We heard the Chairman of the Labour Party yesterday trying to blame the Office of Public Works.  It is not they who are to blame but the Government.  The Government should have checked the legal basis for their actions.  From the 1830 Act it seems that the basis for all actions, i.e. building and construction comes from a letter from the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland addressed to the old Barracks Commissioners in which he tells them that the powers of the old Barracks Commissioners have been conferred now on the Office of Public Works without the legislation being specific in those areas.  It is the responsibility of the Government and it was up to them to ensure that these matters were properly checked out and had a proper legal basis before proceeding with any construction, particularly one that was controversial like that at Mullaghmore or Luggala.</P>
    <P>Legal proceedings were instituted about them.  It was not that the Government did not have enough warning about these matters.  They had more than adequate warning.  They should have proceeded with the utmost care given the fact that these matters had been referred to one of the highest courts in the land. It is gratuitous for the Chairman of the Labour Party &mdash; a man for whom I have much respect &mdash; and for the Minister to try to blame others for what happened in the High Court on Monday.  It was inevitable that that would happen.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works works under a certain element of secrecy and I have one major criticism of that body.  In 1989 the Government commissioned a major report on the way the Office of Public Works proceeds with its works. Price Waterhouse was commissioned to carry out the report.  That company received about £90,000 to prepare this report which was presented less than one year later to the Government.  To this day, the Government never told us what is in this report.  There are many rumours <Col N="330" /> that sweeping changes in the way the Office of Public Works proceeds with its works were recommended.  Why was that report never published or debated in this House?  This House voted almost £100,000 to pay for it yet Members never saw it, nor did any citizen, to my knowledge and it certainly was never discussed in this House.  Some of the criticism that is often levelled against the Office of Public Works is that there is secrecy surrounding it and the Government protects it by not publishing this report.</P>
    <P>I agree with much of what Deputy O'Donoghue said in relation to the Commissioners of Public Works.  I agree they do very good work and do it sensitively. There is no doubt that Dublin Castle is a good example, as is the work carried out on Government Buildings. The recent improvements to the facade of this House, while not overly extensive, nevertheless are a good example of the fine work of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that we need interpretative centres.  If one goes to what is probably the most famous archaeological site in Ireland, in Tara, in my Leader's constituency &mdash; I might dispute that the one at Cruachan beside me is more sophisticated &mdash; what one sees there is primitive to the ordinary visitor.  The site is most significant from a historical and an archaelogical point of view but to the ordinary visitor it is a primitive presentation. In other words it needs interpretation and there is nothing wrong with having an interpretative centre at places of such huge significance to interpret and explain them to visitors.  However, we should proceed with those works only after going through the usual planning process so that citizens who have an objection can go to the oral hearings, lodge their objections with the local authorities and go to An Bord Pleanála.  That is all we ask.</P>
    <P>I do not know exactly what is meant by the paragraph on page 48 in the programme for Government.  I will read it for the Minister who might let us know exactly what is meant by it.  It implies a certain amount that I would agree with.</P>

Two months will be allowed for public observations and/or objections to be lodged, and for design changes to be sought by the planning authority in accordance with the Development Plan for the area, for communication to the agency concerned.</P>
      <P>Most of that sounds all right but we would like the Minister to explain the qualifications.  If that meant anything, why in the sections of this Bill that deal with conferring power not just henceforth but retrospectively upon various Government Departments, to build, alter and construct, was that paragraph not reflected?  We would have very little objection if the Government told us it was conferring powers to alter, change, build, construct and so on as long as it was subject to the normal planning procedures of this land.  The Government should lead by example.  We cannot expect citizens to obey the planning laws if the Government, for some reason, feels it can exempt itself from these laws.  We will return to these issues on Committee Stage.  I will table amendments to try to insist that these measures be made amenable to the planning laws.  I hope that, in the spirit of the paragraph I quoted from the joint programme for Government, the Minister will accept my amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Government was announced it was stated that future policy in regard to heritage matters here would be the responsibility of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht. Why is that Minister not participating in <Col N="332" /> this debate in view of the fact that the purpose of this legislation is to deal with future policy in regard to the building of interpretative centres?  Deputy Higgins, Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, has shown a marked lack of moral courage by his failure to come into the House to participate in this debate.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State made a number of statements in his contribution and clearly defended the Mullaghmore project. I asked him if he was speaking for the Government and he said he was.  It would appear, therefore, that he was speaking for Deputy Higgins who is a member of the Government.  I asked the Taoiseach yesterday would collective responsibility apply in regard to this legislation and he said it would.  In view of the fact that Deputy Higgins spoke so frequently against the Mullaghmore project, I cannot understand why he has not come into the House to indicate his position on this matter, either in support of the Government or in opposition to the line being taken by the Government. For him to absent himself from this House, and hope that he can hide, displays a lack of moral courage which does him no credit whatever.  I hope he will now enter the debate and indicate his views on what the Minister of State said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with the Minister of State when he said: &ldquo;until we have a Supreme Court decision which clarifies the position the proposals contained in the programme for Government regarding the introduction of further planning controls for State authorities cannot be further progressed&rdquo;.  That is what is wrong with this country and with this House.  This House has consistently abdicated its responsibility for the making of legislation to the courts.  We have read the Minister's excuse for failure to introduce planning controls on the State is that the matter is before the courts.  The courts are being forced to do work that this Government and this House are supposed to do.  We have a Government bloated with advisers at public expense, with a larger majority than any Government in the history of the State and yet it is hiding behind the Supreme Court <Col N="333" /> and failing to fulfil its responsibilities to introduce legislation to apply normal planning controls, in accordance with the promise it made, to developments initiated by the State.</P>
    <P>My interpretation of this legislation is that it exempts the State from planning control because it says, &ldquo;A State authority shall have power to carry out development&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Development&rdquo; is defined as the carrying out of any works in or under land or the making of any material change in the use of any structures or other land.  That definition of development is taken from the planning Acts.  The State is conferring on itself the power to do everything that everyone else must have permission to do under the planning Acts.  That is wrong.  It would be a very simple matter to amend this Bill and add, &ldquo;subject to the planning Acts&rdquo; after each of the relevant sections.  Then we would be in a position to have this matter dealt with regularly.  Why has the Minister of State omitted those four key words?  The answer is obvious; he believes that the State can do what it likes.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister, who comes from a party which prides itself on being &ldquo;The Republican Party&rdquo;, that the origin of this exemption of the State from the requirement to seek permission under the planning Acts, is in the principle of British common law, that &ldquo;the King can do no wrong&rdquo;.  It is that royalist principle that this Republican party is using to exempt the State from the requirement to seek permision that every other citizen must seek.  One of the concerns the Office of Public Works has is that it would have to pay fees to the county-councils when applying for planning permission.  In other words, officialdom is prepared to impose draconian fees on private individuals who want to erect an extension to their house but do not want to pay fees to the county council when it seeks permission for a major development.  That point was made to me by an official of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>Rushing legislation through this House is highly dangerous.  This legislation may <Col N="334" /> well be unconstitutional and we are not getting an adequate opportunity to tease out its constitutional aspects.  It has not been possible in the few hours since this Bill was published for Members to consult legal advice but such advice as we have, suggests that this Bill is unconstitutional and that it should be referred to the Supreme Court before it is signed into law by the President.  The implications of this decision should be considered very carefully.  As Deputy Connor pointed out, the source of the power of the Office of Public Works is a letter from the Lord Lieutenant and that letter is the basis upon which the Office of Public Works up to now has been operating.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House &mdash; there are a number of teachers here &mdash; that the payment of teachers' salaries by the State is based on a similar letter namely the Stanley letter.  This State has been paying teachers' salaries and maintaining education for years on the basis of a similar letter to that which was found by Mr. Justice Costello to be invalid in so far as it did not give sufficient power to the State to carry out public works.  The Minister should investigate all activities by the State which are being carried out on the basis of letters from Lord Lieutenants because it would appear that these letters are not sufficient to give the State the necessary authority.</P>
    <P>It would be very serious if it were found that the State did not have power to pay teachers' salaries as would be the case if the line of argument of Mr. Justice Costello in the case of the Office of Public Works were to be followed in a case where the authority of the Department of Education were challenged.  This should not be left to the courts to discover for us.  It is the responsibility of this House and the courts to ensure that proper law is made in this land.  I hope that matter will be dealt with before a court finds it invalid also.</P>
    <P>I was very struck by the speech by Deputy O'Donoghue.  He spoke very eloquently and truly about the good record of the Office of Public Works in regard to environmental matters.  If that is so, <Col N="335" /> what has it to fear from applying for planning permission?  If, as I believe, its record is as good as Deputy O'Donoghue says it is, why is the Government unwilling to allow it to apply for planning permission? Why is the Labour Party willing to go along with exempting it from the requirement to apply for planning permission? The argument is being put forward that there are strict deadlines for the application of EC funds.  We have known that for years.  We have been a member of the EC since 1972.  We could have made adequate provisions to deal with that in advance without having to act in what has now transpired to be an illegal way.</P>
    <P>It is important also to draw the attention of the House to Article 15.5 of the Constitution which states: &ldquo;The Oireachtas shall not declare Acts to be infringements of the law which were not so at the date of their commission&rdquo;.  In other words, the Oireachtas cannot introduce retroactive legislation creating retroactive offences.  It is a reasonable argument to say that the Oireachtas may have some trouble in having retroactive validation of acts committed by itself in similar circumstances on the basis of <i>pari passu</i> of the two rules.  I hope that matter will be dealt with.  It is important that we do not introduce further legislation that proves not to be valid.</P>
    <P>The fundamental principle is two-fold. First, do we have a collectively responsible Government in this matter?  Where is the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht who is allegedly responsible for future policy in this area?  Why is he hiding away from this House?  The second important point is, does the law of this land apply equally to all citizens?  Why should State authorities, establishing, perhaps, commercial activities in direct competition with private providers of the same services &mdash; many of the restaurants and shops in these interpretative centres will be in direct competition with those in the private sector &mdash; not have to apply for planning permission while those in the private sector have to do so?  Is that fair?  It is not and it is something that <Col N="336" /> should be rectified immediately.  There is no excuse for not rectifying it in this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is entirely possible for this legislation to be amended to encompass an amendment to the planning Acts and ensure that the State is liable to the same rules as other citizens.  It is profoundly unfair that this House should be asked to pass this legislation in one day.  I draw the Minister of State's attention to the founding principles of the Constitution where there are provisions, for example, for the abridgement of the time for taking legislation.  There is provision in the Constitution that the Seanad should take no more than 90 days to consider legislation. Clearly, the framers of the Constitution had in mind that 90 days was long enough but it seems we now have a principle established in this House where a Government with a majority of 37 can ensure that the House does not even have 90 hours to consider legislation.</P>

      <P>The Government opinion is that the opinions of other people do not matter in this House.  I do not think that is a very democratic approach.  The Government would benefit from having a serious and searching analysis of this legislation in Committee in this House.  The Government is doing itself no favour whatever by its unwillingness to allow at least one week for the implications of this legislation to be teased out.  There would be no problem in allowing one week for that purpose. Tommorrow the Dáil will spend two days discussing Dáil reform on the basis that we are supposed to have an open Government that wants to take everybody into its confidence.  We are to have a declaration of everybody's interests and so on under this proposal.  The Government has great confidence for the next two days in this House in theory but when it comes to the practical matter of allowing us to do our job which is to debate and analyse legislative proposals from the Government, it is not open Government but Government of the jackboot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="337" /> This is an appalling approach to its responsibilities by the Government.  It is appalling in particular from a Government which has a big majority to use that majority to deny proper legislative analysis of its proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to share my time with my party Leader, Deputy O'Malley and also with Deputy Keogh.  The procedure which we are following today is appalling.  I agree with so much of what has been said by other speakers in that regard that I do not need to repeat it but I wish to underline it as a serious concern.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Government states that the Government is committed to openness and transparency but its approach to this legislation is the antithesis of everything one would expect if that is one of the value systems driving the Government.</P>
      <P>It is a bit unfair of the Minister to be critical of outside bodies who might have been expected to know more in their comments on this Bill.  When I went to the Bills Office in this House last night to see if I could get some copies of the Bill to show individuals and outside bodies, I discovered it was not available and would not be available to Members in the usual manner until this morning.  It is a bit highhanded to be critical of outside bodies who have to operate on the basis of second-hand information when the Bill was so rushed that it was not available to us.  There is need for procedures to be looked at, independently of this Bill, if the Government ever seeks to rush through something described as emergency legislation again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the point the Minister made about seeking to separate development from planning but I do not necessarily accept it is what we should be aiming for or is something the House should accept from the Government.  The Dáil is being asked to vote effectively in a vacuum.  We do not know what the planning law is in relation to the developments we are debating today.  We do not know the planning law, no more than the Government can know it because of the conflicting judgements of the High Court. <Col N="338" /> How can the Government today ask for a blank cheque approach to development, construction, building and, perhaps wider issues when we are working completely in a planning vacuum?  It is wrong in principle to seek to confer wide-ranging powers on the Executive in a context where there is no evident constraint and in a complete vacuum in legal terms with regard to what precisely that Executive is required to do in respect of its developmental policy for buildings or other projects.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats and I accept that no-one wants to see jobs at risk but if jobs are put at risk because of problems in law, I do not think it is a good principle of law-making to rush into making bad law and potentially creating similar problems.  The Minister's speech referred to the Bill dealing with ordinary construction work associated with Government Departments.  He talked of Government offices, Garda stations, the restoration of heritage projects like the Customs House and so on.  I take the point the Minister made.  That may be the intention but we are making law and the definitions are set out in the Bill. From what I can see they are much wider in terms of their potential implication than simply the question of Garda stations or Government offices.  I hope someone on the Government side might take a note of what I am saying because I hope on Committee Stage to receive answers to the questions I pose.</P>
    <P>In respect of the powers proposed section 2 states:</P>
    <P>(1) A State authority shall have, and be deemed to always to have had, power&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) to carry out, or procure the carrying out of, development.</P>
    <P>What is &ldquo;development&rdquo;?  The Minister's statement seems to indicate Garda stations and so on and I accept that, but what development is defined in section 5? That section states that &ldquo;development&rdquo; means the carrying out of any works on, in or under land or the making of any material change in the use of any structures. <Col N="339" /> Does &ldquo;any works&rdquo; refer to the benign Garda station at the corner and to the development of heritage projects like Dublin Castle only or does it refer to the potential to demolish, without due regard to any alternative law, buildings that are in the hands of the State?  Could it, for example, include the development of State land for waste treatment, landfill dumps or toxic dumps?  Could it relate to mining because it refers to any work which is under land?  It is not clear that the intention stated in the Minister's speech as being quite narrow and limited is, in fact, what is proposed.  We are making law; we are not talking about intention.  I am worried that the definition in that section as to what constitutes development is potentially so wide as to render meaningless the narrower ground, which I believe is the Minister's intention. My party propose to table amendments to limit the extent of definition of development in that regard.</P>
    <P>Section 2 also states that the State shall have authority to maintain, manage, repair, improve, alter, enlarge, reduce in size, remove or otherwise deal with buildings or structures or other works or property.  That is a very wide definition as to what the State, the Minister and the Department have in mind in this regard.  Even if we are trying today, consentually and in law, to distinguish between the right to develop and the appropriate planning to which that development should be subjected &mdash; I agree with Deputy Bruton that the State should not be exempt from the due process of planning &mdash; the scale of the development is worrying from the nature of the definitions given.  We will have to look at that.</P>
    <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to what may well be a very serious flaw in the Bill.  I note with interest that the Minister has assured the House that the Government has suspended development on the controversial interpretative centres, not just the one at Mullaghmore, pending the outcome of the various matters before the courts.  Nevertheless, I <Col N="340" /> would draw the Minister's attention to case law in the mid-eighties in relation to Pine Valley and the matter of development and the Minister for the Environment. The Minister, or his advisers, will recall that a Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill was introduced in 1982 and a saving clause or a special proviso was included in section 6 (2).  I suggest the Minister check whether a saving clause is needed in this legislation.</P>
    <P>My party believes that on the balance of probabilities the Oireachtas cannot confer validity on what the Office of Public Works has done to date nor in any other case which is pending before the courts hinging on the particular point of law that has been in dispute.  I know the Minister says these are suspended but the Minister is today, retrospectively in law, validating the development even if subject to suspension.  In law he may be wrong in that and if he does not put in a saving clause as per the precedent of the 1982 legislation and the Pine Valley case he may find that the law will be rejected as potentially unsound and, possibly, unconstitutional.  The Dáil is not in a position to specifically reverse a judicial decision in cases such as the Mullaghmore case with some general classification of the type proposed.</P>
    <P>I accept that there is an emergency but I do not know that the emergency obliges us to have the Bill passed today.  I have tried to explore this matter in a way relevant to what is before us and not to colour the matter.  I would be more than happy to trade a few blows with the Minister on Mullaghmore and the other centres. In the matter of law-making, we have an insufficient amount of time to debate Bills and I appeal to the Minister, particularly in his role as Government Chief Whip, to consider the points I raised.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats intend to table a number of amendments.  If this is emergency legislation it should be limited in time.  It is something the House generally would regard as unsatisfactory were it not tied to express planning conditions. If it is the will of the Government <Col N="341" /> not to accept the amendments suggested by Deputy Bruton linking development and planning expressly in this legislation, then there is an onus on the Government to time-limit what it is proposing.  My preference is that we make the linkage between development and planning but I insist that this must be limited if it is emergency in terms of its scope and its time.  I stress again that we need to limit the scope of the meaning of various phrases such as &ldquo;any other works&rdquo; or &ldquo;the nature of the definition of developments.&rdquo; If all that is in mind is the local school, the Custom House or the Garda station, I do not think that is what this legislation empowers us to do.  In relation to section 4, which deals with expenses incurred, at some stage the Minister might tell the House precisely what expense is likely to be incurred on this matter.</P>
    <P>Would the word &ldquo;development&rdquo; cover, for example, the demolition of the Upper Merrion Street Georgian houses which are now owned by the Office of Public Works?  Would we be giving the Office of Public Works a right, in development terms, to do what it wishes with such property?</P>
    <P>It is wrong in principle to leave to the Executive power which should be subject to due planning process.  For that reason the Bill is fundamentally wrong but I accept there is an emergency.  It is wrong in practice to introduce legislation when we do not know when we are given the development definition on the one hand, the extent of its planning application on the other.  There is a fundamental problem with that.  It would be wrong in principle not to set a time limit for what is generally perceived to be emergency legislation which would be wrong in law were it to expressly exclude the precedent of the Pine Valley case.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given a strong outline of the case that can be made for heritage centres.  I remind him that I could find no reputable international body that did not object at the level of the European Commission to the decision to fund Mullaghmore, notwithstanding the general <Col N="342" /> hypothesis that the Minister advanced today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The first sentence of the Minister of State's speech contains a serious factual legal inaccuracy and it is indicative of his and the Government's approach to this matter that it should do so.  He stated that the purpose of the Bill is to restore to the Commissioners of Public Works the power to carry out various functions, subject to the Minister for Finance.  It is not to restore them. &ldquo;Restore&rdquo; suggests that they had them and lost them as a result of a court case. What the court decided is that they never had them.  How can one restore to somebody something that person never had? It is indicative of the thinking that occurs in Departments, and elsewhere, that they make the fundamental error and give themselves away in the very first sentence of what they write for the Minister of State.  He, of course, did not spot the error.</P>
      <P>Mr. Justice Costello in his judgement gave a long list of what the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland are empowered by statute to do but it does not include the activity they undertook on interpretative centres.  They are entitled to do scores of different things and the way to approach this would have been to add additional powers rather than give not just the Commissioners of Public Works but every member of the Government, unlimited power to do anything that he or she wants.  They may be subject to other constraints at some future date but they have an unfettered power to do anything they like.  That is simply too wide.  It is wrong to try to force the Second Stage of this Bill through this House within 90 minutes.  Dozens of Members wish to speak on this matter. What is the urgency about it?</P>
      <P>In the course of his introductory remarks the Minister of State said: &ldquo;As Deputies are aware the Government has decided to suspend work on the Boyne, Wicklow and Burren projects pending the Supreme Court appeal in relation to the planning issue&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At best that will take many months. <Col N="343" /> Nobody objects to the Office of Public Works building schools or Garda stations or to its power to do that.  The only litigation is in relation to these three projects. The Government, having lost the case, has no option but to suspend work so where is the urgency?  Why can this not be done and a proper Bill drawn up over a period of some months?</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with Deputy Cox's point.  It is set out in the <i>Pine Valley Developments v. the Minister for the Environment</i> case reported in the Irish Reports of 1987 in the judgment both of Mr. Justice Henchy and Mr. Justice Lardner.  Mr. Justice Henchy said, at page 43:</P>
    <P>Section 6 of that Act [The Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1982] had the effect of giving retrospective validity to planning permissions such as this granted on appeal prior to the 15th March, 1977, save where such retrospective validation would conflict with a constitutional right of any person.  That exclusion has been attacked by counsel for Pine Valley as being unfairly discriminatory as far as they are concerned, but in my view, while a discrimination has resulted, the primary and overriding purpose of the section was to avoid an unconstitutional invasion of the judicial domain by attempting to give validity to any planning permission which the Courts may have held to be lacking in validity.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Lardner said much the same thing.  He recites the <i>Buckley and Others (Sinn Féin v. Attorney General and Another)</i> case in 1950, Irish Reports, where again the Government, through the Dáil, sought to come in and predetermine or change a case which was being decided upon by the courts.  That was held to be unconstitutional.  But the Minister of State, the Government and the Office of Public Works are attempting to do that here because they do not have the saving clause that was in the 1982 Act.  I wonder why?  Therefore, the words in section <Col N="344" /> 2(1), &ldquo;and be deemed always to have had,&rdquo; which also appear in section 2(2), should be deleted.  If they are not deleted the matter is unconstitutional as far as any of these three cases are concerned. The Minister of State, and the Office of Public Works simply will not get away with it.  The law on the matter is perfectly clear.</P>
    <P>Section 2(2) states:</P>
    <P>..all such incidental, supplemental, ancillary and consequential powers as, in the opinion of the authority, are necessary or expedient.</P>
    <P>The definition of development is taken directly from the 1963 Act and it covers the carrying on of any works in relation to land or buildings.  Under this Bill a Minister will be given power to demolish any building here.  I hope, under other legislation, it may be possible to stop him if somebody can get in in time.  It is outrageous to give Ministers powers that are as wide as that.  There are many other matters I would like to deal with but in the appalling situation in which we find ourselves I cannot do that and I want to share my time with Deputy Keogh.</P>

      <P>I regret the time available to us is so limited that we cannot examine in detail, even at this stage, the various points in the Bill.  The technical points have been covered by my party colleagues. The point I want to make is in relation to the whole issue of democracy and accountability.  What we have in this Bill underscores the lack of accountability which is in total defiance of the Government's wish to restore confidence in the democratic process by encouraging openness and participation at all levels, by improving public accountability, transparency and trust and by ensuring the highest standards in public life.  What we see here files in the face of that.  Anybody who is building as much as a bungalow has to apply for planning permission and yet we have the prospect of public bodies having no accountability whatsoever&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I ask you not to prejudge the matter and give me the 20 seconds.  The first, in order of these decisions of this House this morning, was that each of these parties should have half an hour to address this House.  It states, each of our contributions should not exceed 30 minutes and it goes on to state that the Minister or Minister of State should have 15 minutes at the end.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the point the Deputy is making but he has embarked on a little speech.

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose sharing about two or three minutes with Deputy Sargent. If any one of the 1,000 or so local people who attended the public meeting in Corofin last Monday night were to apply for planning permission to build a modest bungalow on the site of the proposed interpretative centre at Mullaghmore in all probability they would be refused by Clare County Council.  How is it then that the Government propose to introduce legislation which would give the Office of Public Works the unfettered right to construct and develop a large visitor centre and three car parks on a site where a local person would be refused permission for a small house?</P>
      <P>This Bill was brought about by the Mullaghmore decision in the High Court but it is about far more than Mullaghmore, Luggala or the Boyne Valley. This Bill is about the Government pushing through legislation which will give Government Ministers and State authorities unprecedented and unqualified powers to do what they like.</P>
      <P>The Bill is not about what should be done, but about who decides what should be done.  It raises fundamental questions about our understanding of democracy, the so-called principle of subsidiarity and the Government's commitment to its much lauded programme for Government. Indeed, the Bill makes a mockery of the fine words in the Programme for Government about broadening democracy. It humiliates the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and it is a fundamental mistake.  I have great respect for the Office of Public Works, its staff and the work it has done down the years.  If we were simply talking about regularising the position arising from the High Court decision, most of us would understand the need for this Bill.  The Bill gives unprecedented power to State authorities to do what they like in the matter of building and construction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Green <Col N="348" /> Party, I must say the Government has taken leave of its senses in regard to this Bill.  It is not correct to say that the people opposing the Mullaghmore interpretative centre want the project abandoned; they simply want it relocated.  That must be made clear because it appears those on the Government benches do not understand that, even though people protested outside the gates of this House several days in an effort to make that point.  It is also incorrect to expect people to live anywhere.  That would be a recipe for absolute chaos and if that is what the Government believe, I would like to hear more about its policy in that regard.</P>
      <P>The Bill strikes at the very heart of democracy and contradicts the Programme for Government.  That programme states that all bodies should adhere to normal planning procedures and that is contrary to what is in the Bill. Members of the Labour Party cannot hide in regard to this issue, very few of them have been present for the debate this morning.  At least the Minister, Deputy Higgins, should be present.</P>
      <P>This Bill is anti the Programme for Government and anti Government ethics.  Much more urgent legislation has not come before this House, such as the ground water directive which would be relevant to the Luggala site.  There is a need for new legislation to protect existing buildings such as Garda stations, and I am sure nobody would disagree with that.  However, there should be a rethink on the decision to appeal to the Supreme Court in this case.  If the seven people who took the case lose, they will be paying for the rest of their lives.  They made an extremely courageous decision without any hope of personal gain.</P>
      <P>The EC is willing to renegotiate, as Deputy Cox said.  The EC is willing to provide funding to make up the money spent initially and to consider relocation as it never endorsed the sites involved.  I will be tabling amendments as the Bill should not be enacted in its present form.</P>

      <P>I want to make two points. The Boyne Valley is not in the ownership of any pressure group.  The biggest centre in the Boyne Valley is the town of Drogheda which has a population of 24,000 and 60,000 in its hinterland.  Those people would have the biggest claim to that centre if it was justified on the basis of numerical strength.  Pressure groups have requested me to have the proposed centre moved from the Newgrange area on the north side of the river; Newgrange is mid-way between Slane and Drogheda. When the Office of Public Works examined all the submissions it decided to choose a site on the south side of the river near the village of Donore on the periphery of Drogheda.  Another pressure group requested that it be located in the Slane area.  At one stage I was tempted to set up a pressure group requesting that the site be chosen in <Col N="350" /> Drogheda because that is the most densely populated and most historical area in the Boyne Valley.</P>
      <P>Meath County Council, which is in Deputy John Bruton's constituency, was consulted and the Fine Gael members of the council voted unanimously in favour.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies who spoke and, in the course of their remarks, paid tribute to the Office of Public Works for the fine job it has done in the past.  I am delighted that Deputies acknowledge the professionalism and dedication to conservation of the officials of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not deal with specific points which can be raised on Committee Stage.  In relation to the Programme for Government, there is a qualification on page 48. Is any Deputy seriously suggesting that if the Department of Defence wished to erect an Army barracks or the Department of Justice wished to erect a Garda station along the Border that they should be subjected to ordinary planning requirements?  That would be ridiculous as members of the UVF, and other such organisations, would be able to examine the plans of those buildings.  That is what <Col N="351" /> the words &ldquo;in general&rdquo; mean.  I assure the House that this is a real commitment and will be pursued.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cox asked about the timetable in relation to the Bill.  The Bill will stand but we might be able to facilitate him with a timetable in regard to the planning side of the legislation.</P>
    <P>As I said, I want to divorce the two areas about which we are talking.  It is the Government's intention to allow Government agencies, including the Office of Public Works, build and maintain those centres.  This is not an attempt by the Government to get round the commitment given in the programme for Government about making planning laws more transparent.  If the Office of Public Works had gone through the normal planning process in regard to those interpretative centres, they would be up and running by now.  At most it would have taken six months to complete the process.  The issue would have been sent to An Bord Pleanála and a decision made.  Two years of consultations and disputes have taken place thus far.</P>
    <Col N="352" />
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not all the more reason to make them subject to the law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, it would have been easier to do it that way.</P>
      <P>The urgency of this legislation as far as the Government is concerned is that jobs are at risk and that is clear from the telephone calls we are getting in the Office of Public Works.  Contractors are seriously concerned and are talking about putting people on protective notice because of the unclear legal position. That is why this legislation was brought forward.  I reiterate the fundamental and basic premise, that the Government must have the means to provide, maintain and manage buildings for use by the public and the public service and to provide services in accordance with Government policy.  Therefore, the Government must have an agency with the powers proposed in this Bill and for that reason I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>The Office is similar to many that have been established in recent years, for example the Office for Women's Affairs that was set up when Deputy Bruton was in Government, the Office of Science and Technology and the Office of the Minister of State with special responsibility for food.

The role and functions of the Office will encompass briefing and advising the Tánaiste generally on all Government policy matters; representing the Government on the new National Economic and Social Forum and thereby ensuring direct liaison through the Tánaiste between the forum and the Government; joint responsibility, together with the Minister of State and Chief Whip attached to my Department, for the implementation of the provisions under the heading &ldquo;Broadening our Democracy&rdquo; which are contained in our <i>Programme for a Partnership Government, 1993-97;</i> representing the Tánaiste on a committee of programme managers to monitor the implementation of the programme for Government; representing the Tánaiste on the Central Review Committee under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> any successor to that committee under any further such programme and representing the Tánaiste on the Interdepartmental Committee on the Co-ordination of EC Affairs.  That committee will continue to be chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with special responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt.  He is also Minister of State at my Department.  Staff are currently being recruited for the Office for which provision will be made in a separate Vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the reply which I gave to a similar question on Wednesday, 7 October 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since that date, significant progress has been made in discussions with the Commission <Col N="359" /> of the European Communities and other interests regarding the development of a series of Shannon related projects in energy, the environment, and clean technology.  These projects include an ongoing feasibility study financed by the Commission of the European Communities regarding a possible role for the Shannon Estuary in the context of the Euro-Quebec Hydro-Hydrogen pilot project.</P>
    <P>Progress has been made to develop scientific and technical co-operation between Ireland and Russia with grant assistance from the Commission of the European Communities and with the involvement, <i>inter alia,</i> of the University of Limerick.</P>
    <P>The special economic development officer in my Department will be making a promotional visit to Canada towards the end of April 1993, accompanied by other relevant experts.  Discussions have already taken place with Polish shipping interests which may lead to a pilot project for the provisioning of Polish ships being established at one of the ports of the Shannon Estuary.</P>
    <P>International marketing is still continuing in relation to other countries outside of the European Community which could find a commercial advantage in using Ireland and Shannon as an economically-strategic trading bridgehead into the European Community.</P>
    <P>Inputs by the relevant Departments of State and other relevant interests for the next round of the EC Structural Funds and for the Cohesion Fund, on an integrated economic development basis, are currently being co-ordinated by the Shannon Estuary staff project team within the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Taoiseach has the information I seek.  Will he indicate what specific proposals have come forward in regard to the IDA land on the Tarbert/Ballylongford landbank?  Is he prepared to give a guarantee today that the necessary funds will be provided from the Cohesion Fund for the provision of <Col N="360" /> a proper road network, a proper water supply and public lighting for that landbank? The Taoiseach will be aware that this is the centre of the Shannon Estuary. Therefore, I would like him to be more specific in his response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question in regard to proposals coming before the IDA should have been addressed to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment. In regard to the advances made since my reply to a question on 7 October, we are proceeding on the basis of trying to establish Shannon as a centre for clean technology and scientific research and development with significant support from DG12 and the science and research and development section of the EC Commission. They have financed a study on the development of new clean technology and have become part of that pilot project between Quebec and Hamburg.  We want to put Ireland into that type of project development.  Projects submitted to the IDA or seeking Cohesion Fund aid are separate matters.  The Deputy can be assured that support will be forthcoming for whatever the Shannon Estuary area requires for development when we have the projects in place.</P>

Will the Taoiseach be more specific and tell us what agency is monitoring progress on the Shannon Estuary at present?  Who is responsible?</P>

Will he clarify if the transhipment idea is still feasible because he used the words &ldquo;trading bridgehead&rdquo; today?  Will he clarify what he means by a trading bridgehead?  The Taoiseach also used the words &ldquo;clean technology&rdquo; in relation to the estuary.  Will he explain how proposals in the past for steel, smelter and oil refinery projects and so on come under clean technology?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mention oil refinery projects for the Shannon estuary.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 17, 20, 39 and 47 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strength of the Garda Síochána in the Dublin metropolitan area was increased by 64 during the period from January to December last year bringing the strength of the force in the DMA to 3,988.  The total strength of the force in the country now stands at 10,984.  While I take the point about the ratio of crime to population in the Dublin area I have to say that the population of a particular area is but one of a number of considerations which the Garda authorities take into account when deploying members of the force.  Other factors would include the area of policing to be covered, the particular type of crime that is prevalent, and so on.  The weighting that should be given to the various factors <Col N="365" /> that arise is, I understand, a matter to which the Garda authorities are paying particular attention at present.  While I do not believe it is an adequate or even a proper approach to crime merely to throw additional gardaí at the problem &mdash; apart from the resource implications, the problem is far too complex for that type of simple quick-fix solution &mdash; I do believe that an increased visible Garda presence on our streets would act as a deterrent to would-be criminals and give a welcome reassurance to the public.  In this regard I am conferring with the Garda Commissioner about a number of measures which could be taken to increase the number of existing gardaí available for outdoor operational duty.</P>
    <P>The measures being contemplated include accelerating the rate of intake of recruits from the current recruitment campaign and, in particular, increasing further the number of civilian staff employed in the Garda Síochána, which is low by international comparisons.  The number of civilian clerical staff in the Garda Síochána has almost doubled since 1989 and now stands in excess of 700. This civilianisation process has released gardaí from administrative duties to perform the police tasks for which they were recruited and trained.  The Garda authorities are carrying out a review at present to identify further areas in the force which may be suitable for civilianisation.</P>
    <P>I am, of course, concerned at the level of crime in the Dublin metropolitan area and in particular at the recent disturbing manifestations of the problem in the city centre which included three very serious incidents, two of which resulted in tragic deaths and the third in innocent passers-by sustaining serious injuries in the course of an armed robbery.  I take this opportunity to express my sincere sympathy to the families and relatives of those involved and to assure them that the full rigours of the law will be applied to the perpetrators of these acts.</P>
    <P>With regard to the incidence of crime in Dublin city centre, it must be remembered that up to 750,000 people pass through the O'Connell Street-Grafton <Col N="366" /> Street artery every day and with those numbers incidents are inevitably bound to occur even if one were to saturate the streets night and day with gardaí.  The plain truth of the matter is that the specific incidents I have just referred to, did not arise from an inadequate Garda presence &mdash; in fact patrolling gardaí were on the scene immediately and were in a position to make arrests.</P>
    <P>Since taking up office last month, I have conferred with the Garda Commissioner and the Assistant Commissioner with specific responsibility for the Dublin metropolitan area regarding both the situation on O'Connell Street as well as the crime situation generally in the Dublin metropolitan area.  It was agreed that law enforcement in the Dublin metropolitan area would include the following measures and strategies:</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities will intensify their use of closely co-ordinated foot and mobile patrols and checkpoints, deployment of plainclothes surveillance units will be increased and there will be greater targeting of Garda resources to meet specific anti-crime needs in particular areas.</P>
    <P>The ratio of police to population in the Dublin metropolitan area will be maintained at 1 to 260 which compares favourably with the national average of 1 to 320.</P>
    <P>Continued emphasis will be placed on ensuring that there is adequate manpower deployment in the five Garda stations in the proximity of O'Connell Street, including the O'Connell Street station.  In this respect 50 of the 64 gardaí, who were attested as full members of the force before Christmas, were assigned to Dublin stations and have since taken up duty there.  In addition, in the period 2 November 1992 to 22 January 1993 23 civilians took up posts in the Dublin area releasing gardaí in those posts for operational duties attached to the stations in question.  Of the gardaí newly assigned or redeployed to operational duties as a consequence of the above, 51 were employed in city centre <Col N="367" /> stations north and south of the Liffey, with particular emphasis on those stations which police O'Connell Street and its environs.  A further 40 members who were attested to the force last week were assigned to Dublin stations on 12 February 1993.</P>
    <P>The O'Connell Street area is being patrolled on a 24-hour basis by both uniformed and plain clothes gardaí and particular attention is being paid to the area during the late night and early morning period.</P>
    <P>Many of the problems in the Dublin city centre area are created by large numbers of young people congregating particularly at weekends, and often inebriated. I do not wish O'Connell Street to be turned into a no-go area for young people &mdash; to make the whole area dead at night like certain other European cities &mdash; but it will be necessary to look closely at the complex issues which give rise to the crime problem in the city centre, the resolution of which will require a response not just from the law enforcement agencies but from city centre interests as a whole.</P>
    <P>For my part, I have assured the Commissioner that whatever resources he requires to combat crime in Dublin city centre and in the Dublin metropolitan area will be made available.  I also intend to ensure that Garda powers in relation to public order will be strengthened. Work on legislation to enhance Garda powers to deal with street offences is already at an advanced stage of preparation in my Department.  This legislation will provide for the creation of offences relating to: (a) persons being found drunk or under the influence of drugs in such circumstances that they are a danger to themselves or others; (b) the use of threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour in a public place and (c) disorderly conduct in circumstances such as to cause annoyance to other persons in the neighbourhood.</P>
    <P>These new offences will carry the power of arrest and liability to substantial fines and-or imprisonment.  It is also <Col N="368" /> intended that if those causing disturbance are in possession of intoxicating liquor, the gardaí will have the power to confiscate it on the spot.</P>
    <P>The new legislation will augment other existing Garda powers to deal with street offences, including the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990, which enables the gardaí to take steps to deal with the carrying of knives and other dangerous weapons and the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, which gives gardaí powers to deal with underage drinking.</P>
    <P>I am also examining the proposals in the interdepartmental group on urban crime which will assist in the formation of a broadly based response to the problem of crime in modern urban societies. I will shortly be putting the report to Government for approval to implement its recommendations.  While the group made specific recommendations in relation to the Ronanstown area, many of these may be adapted and applied to other urban areas.  However, I believe that there is a need to distinguish between crime problems in the suburbs where people live &mdash; which require a broad societal response &mdash; and the problems of city centre thuggery and intimidation which require instrumental response not only from the gardaí but also the relevant interests and institutions concerned.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased to say that there are indications that the policies adopted to deal with the problem of crime in Dublin are proving effective in that the latest provisional indications for recorded crime in the Dublin metropolitan area show a decrease of the order of 2 per cent in comparison with the corresponding period last year.  While I acknowledge that the decrease is small it is nonetheless welcome.</P>
    <P>The policing arrangements for the Dublin metropolitan area are being kept under constant review by the Garda authorities and I can assure the House that I will do all that I can to ensure the safety and security of all those who live, work or visit our capital city.</P>

      <P>I gave a comprehensive reply but I realise that Deputy Shatter did not listen.  I answered all those supplementary questions in my reply.  I did not announce an extra 50 gardaí when I was in Ronanstown.  If the Deputy read the reports correctly <Col N="370" /> he would realise that I indicated at that meeting before Christmas that 50 gardaí had been allocated to the city centre stations.  I said in my reply today that 40 extra gardaí had been appointed on 12 February to city centre stations, north and south of the Liffey.  I do not accept that O'Connell Street is unsafe for citizens to walk in.  There is a strong Garda presence both in uniform and plain clothes in O'Connell Street.  I have faith in the measures that have been taken by the Assistant Commissioner in charge of the Dublin metropolitan area and the Garda Commissioner, in conjunction with the Department of Justice, to give that strong Garda presence in O'Connell Street and people will realise they are safe to walk in the centre of the capital city.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will no doubt be aware the Council of Europe Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism was opened for signature in 1977 and was ratified, without reservation, by Ireland in 1987.</P>
      <P>The Convention set out to list certain types of offences which, of their nature, were regarded as offences which should not, for the purposes of extradition, be regarded as political offences or offences connected with political offences.  In the view of the Committee of Minister of the Council of Europe expressed in 1991 and repeated earlier this year the main value of the Convention lies in principle not in the enumeration of the kind of offences but rather in the political message which is conveyed by the Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the views of the Committee of <Col N="371" /> Ministers in so far as this expression of principle is concerned and, while the wording of the Convention might be amended to include reference to nonautomatic weapons or to make more explicit references to possession of weapons or explosives, I also agree with the Committee of Ministers that, at present, there is no realistic prospect of securing agreement to amend the Convention in this regard.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response in that she does not appear to see the need to amend our extradition laws.  Does she believe that it is acceptable as a political offence that those in possesion of firearms and explosives are free from extradition from this country in accordance with the Supreme Court decision of November 1991?  Is the Minister aware that her predecessor gave a commitment to this House on 15 October that the Government was preparing, as a matter of urgency, legislation to close off the loophole?  Is work on that legislation continuing and when will it be published? Why was no reference made to this proposed legislation in the programme for Government?  Will the Minister contrast the speed with which the Government introduced legislation following a court decision five days ago with the fact that 14 months later we are still waiting for legislation to close off a disgraceful loophole? No Member could accept that anybody in possession of firearms and explosives possesess them for anything other than terrorist activities.</P>

That legislation is in the course of preparation and I do not believe the Deputy would want me to say in advance what it may or may not contain.  I will bring proposals to Government. <Col N="372" /> While that legislation is not specifically mentioned in the programme for Government, the Deputy will be aware that it was mentioned in the communique following the first Anglo-Irish Conference meeting which the Tánaiste and I had in London.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 73 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there is no evidence to suggest any significant increase in the supply of heroin to this country.  Preliminary Garda figures indicate an increase in the quantity of heroin seized in 1992 by comparison with that seized in 1991.  The 1991 figure was however particularly low being the second lowest level of heroin seized in the ten year period 1983-92.  The preliminary 1992 figure in fact equates with the 1990 figure and is 20 per cent less than the average heroin seizure figure for the decade concerned.  In fact the Garda authorities have indicated to me that factors such as the very low percentage of pure heroin contained in the quantities seized and the increasing usage of heroin substitutes such as MST and methadone, would normally suggest a limited supply of heroin on the streets.  The Garda authorities <Col N="373" /> are keenly aware that there are some heroin dealing activities associated with certain areas of Dublin and very special attention is being given to these areas.  Specific measures have been taken by the gardaí to counteract such activity and these measures have resulted in a considerable number of detections of drug related offences some of which the House will be aware of because of the media attention they have recently received.</P>
    <P>I must stress that I do not believe that there is ever any room for complacency is so far as drug abuse generally or heroin abuse in particular is concerned.  The evils associated with drug abuse are indeed reinforced in an era where AIDS has become an inescapable reality in society.  I condemn in the strongest possible way those who profit from the sale of drugs, those who resort to crime to feed their addiction and, of course, those who have threatened innocent members of society with the deadly needles which are part of the culture and practice of their habit.  For that reason I have given my full support to the Garda authorities in the measures which they are taking to deal with the drug problem.  The Garda authorities treat drug enforcement as a priority.  They monitor the drug situation in the country very carefully and constantly review and adapt their strategies for dealing with it.  These strategies include close liaison with customs authorities at home and abroad and continuous international co-operation with police forces abroad so as to curb the supply of illicit drugs to this country.</P>
    <P>All members of the Garda Síochána deal with law enforcement aspects of drug misuse within their operational area and there are now gardaí specifically trained in this area in every Garda division. In addition specific Garda drug squads operate in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway, special drug units operate in particular areas of Dublin and similar specialist units are set up on a temporary basis in other areas as required.</P>
    <P>A national drugs unit which was established in 1990 and which is based in Garda <Col N="374" /> headquarters co-ordinates the Garda anti-drug efforts here and also acts as a liaison body with international drug enforcement agencies.</P>
    <P>The allocation of manpower and other resources to specialist units such as drug enforcement is, of course, a matter for the Garda authorities and they have assured me that specialist drug units have been and will continue to be given the resources necessary to deal effectively with the problem.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities will continue to monitor the situation and I am confident that they will take all the drug enforcement measures necessary to deal effectively with the problem.</P>
    <P>However, I would point out that drug law enforcement is only one aspect of the drug problem.  Every member of society has a role to play as important as the Garda response.</P>
    <P>Drug abuse causes major problems in society and the role of parents, teachers and other agencies caring for young people is as important as the Garda response.  The need for a national strategy to tackle the drug problem on every front has been recognised by the Government and the Minister for Health launched, in 1991, the Government strategy to prevent drug misuse.  This strategy sets realistic and achievable objectives for reduction both in the supply of and the demand for drugs.</P>
    <P>The Deputy can be assured that the Government is determined that the problem of drug abuse here will be tackled and that the gardaí have all the resources they need to continue their resolute and effective handling of this problem.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 11, 44 and 71 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="378" /> I am of course concerned about the level of crime as reported in the Commissioner's Report on Crime for 1991 and particularly juvenile crime.  Since I took office as Minister for Justice I have met with the Garda Commissioner and his senior officers on several occasions to discuss various aspects of the crime problem, including juvenile crime, and I intend to have ongoing consultations with the Commissioner on the ways and means of addressing the problem of crime in all its aspects.</P>
    <P>A major review of the Garda juvenile liaison officer scheme was undertaken between 1987 and 1990 and, as a result, a number of changes in the scheme were implemented.  A Garda national juvenile office was established in July 1991 and its responsibilities include the overall operation and monitoring of the Garda juvenile diversion programme (JLO scheme) throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The benefits of a caution under the programme were extended to juveniles up to the age of 18 years, an increase of one year.  Two levels of cautions were introduced, depending on the circumstances of the crime and of the juvenile and family.  The area of supervision following caution, which is a vital element of the programme, was examined and now contains two levels of supervision, regular or intensive, depending on the likehood of the juveniles re-offending.</P>
    <P>A system of supervision which meets the needs of each juvenile and the rostering of juvenile liaison officers for night and weekend work to ensure better contact with parents and those involved in the scheme are now in place.</P>
    <P>Administration and operational procedures were streamlined and every juvenile, under 18 years of age, made amenable for any crime or offence throughout the country is referred to the national juvenile office.</P>
    <P>For the 12 months ending 31 December 1992, a total of 11,450 referrals were made.  Of those finalised to date, in excess of 61 per cent have been dealt with under the provisions of the programme.  There are currently 80 full-time operational <Col N="379" /> Garda juvenile liaison officers.  The programme is subject to constant review in order to improve the service provided. The programme has shown a consistent success rate of 89 per cent since its inception in 1963 to date.</P>
    <P>In relation to Kildare, the Carlow/ Kildare Division is serviced by two juvenile liaison officers, one in Carlow Town dealing with the Carlow area and one at Newbridge dealing with the County Kildare area.  During 1992, the number of referrals dealt with by these juvenile liaison officers was 161 in Carlow and 210 in Newbridge.</P>
    <P>Specifically in relation to juvenile crime a number of measures have already been taken by the Garda authorities to build closer links between gardaí and young people.  These include the following:</P>
    <P>Emphasis is being placed during training on gardaí involving themselves in social and sporting organisations at community level.</P>
    <P>A system of community policing has been introduced where community gardaí have a special role in working with young people.  There are now community gardaí serving in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway.</P>
    <P>The Garda schools project has been established to help young people to develop positive attitudes towards the gardaí and their local environment. The young people involved also discuss the grave risks to them of alcohol and drug abuse.  I understand from the Garda authorities that they have made plans to extend the project to all schools throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The gardaí are involved in a number of community-based projects aimed at helping young people to steer clear of crime.  These include the GRAFT project in Ronanstown, the KEY project in Killinarden, the WHAD project in Cherry Orchard and the Outreach programme in Limerick.  My Department provides funding towards the cost of these projects.</P>
    <P>Also in my Department a considerable <Col N="380" /> amount of work has gone into the preparation of a new juvenile justice Bill.  This Bill, which will repeal the 1908 Children Act, will be substantial legislation covering all areas of the juvenile justice system.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to the 1991 crime report, while there was an overall increase over 1990, the level of juvenile crime actually fell.  I might add that the preliminary indications for 1992 are that the overall level of crime in the country is stabilising.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the juvenile liaison service is grossly overworked, understaffed and underdeveloped? Will she also accept, in relation to Question 71, that two liaison officers to cover an area with the population of Kildare and Carlow is unrealistic in terms of dealing with the possible expansion in the crime rate?  Will the Minister accept that while the reported juvenile crime rate might have diminished the actual rate is far higher?  Many crimes are not reported because of public frustration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accept that the juvenile liaison officers scheme is understaffed.  It is probably under pressure, like every avenue of resources within the Garda Síochána and other areas of Government responsibility. Juvenile liaison officers have a big workload with which to deal and they do so effectively and efficiently as possible. They have done tremendous work with communities throughout the country. Most of us are familiar with the projects in operation in Dublin, particularly in South-west Dublin.  Juvenile liaison officers need the support of not just the Department of Justice and the Garda generally.  They receive the backing in the various stations and divisional headquarters and that is important.  They need the support of teachers and, in particular, parents.  That is something I would like to address in the juvenile justice Bill. There is a strong onus of responsibility on parents in this regard and it is something all of us need to address.  By getting <Col N="381" /> involved in schools, in community activities and sporting organisations the gardaí, particularly the younger gardaí coming out of the training school in Templemore, get to know young people and may steer them away from crime.  That is something we would all like to encourage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that there has been an increase in the number of juvenile liaison officers.  However, will she accept that as more than half of those convicted are under 21 years, and that it costs approximately £600 per week to keep a young person in detention, 80 full-time juvenile liaison officers out of a total Garda force of more than 10,000 is inadequate. That number does not take into consideration the nature of their work and their exhausting schedule of attending football matches and other community events which the Minister outlined in her contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We should not refer to the 80 juvenile liaison officers as if in some way they are a specialised force.  Each of those officers is backed up by the other members of the Garda Síochána who also work in the community. While juvenile liaison officers will have a particular responsibility, they will always have the support of their colleagues in the force and from the station within which they operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that the juvenile liaison officer service is under pressure but not understaffed.  Will the Minister explain what that means as I understand from members of the force that they are grossly understaffed?  Will the Minister agree that 80 such officers is totally inadequate for the country given that almost 40 per cent of all crime is committed by juveniles?  Will the Minister agree that redeploying resources to this area would be money well spent as it costs £65,000 to keep one person in Trinity House, for example, for one year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The 80 juvenile <Col N="382" /> officers must be doing a significant amount of work given that juvenile crime has decreased according to the latest available crime figures.  All of us would like to see more than 80 officers recruited and I will raise that with the Garda Commissioner. I have raised with him the way in which existing resources are allocated and the need for community, parental and teacher support.  They need the support of the voluntary groups in the areas in which they operate.  Any member of the Garda Síochána can only do so much. Gardaí in intelligence gathering have to depend on the support and co-operation of the public.  I know Deputy Harney supports that very strongly.  It is a matter I can raise with the Garda Commissioner.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>the number of gardaí at present attached to Shankill Garda Station, Shankill, County Dublin; and the way in which this compares with each of the years 1988 to 1992; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda Commissioner has informed me that 47 members of the Garda Síochána are currently attached to Shankill Garda station. The corresponding figures since 1988 are as follows: 1988, 32; 1989, 34; 1990, 43; 1991, 43; 1992, 46.</P>
      <P>This is an increase over the period of 47 per cent in Garda manpower.  In addition, two clerical staff were assigned to Shankill in 1992 thereby releasing two gardaí for outdoor operational duties. The requirements at Shankill will contiunue to be monitored by the Garda Commissioner in the light of available resources and competing demands on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that information.  Is the Minister aware that the population of Shankill has increased considerably since 1988 and that the present strength of 47 gardaí is just not capable of dealing with the crime problem in the general area?  Is the Minister <Col N="383" /> aware that at times when complaints are made to the Garda station nobody is on duty or available to serve the public? Occasionally, assistance has to be got from Bray Garda station because of the unavailability of gardaí in Shankill.</P>

      <P>An increase of 47 per cent since 1988 is a significant increase even taking into account the fact that the population in the Shankill Garda district had increased substantially.  I was not aware that when complaints were made by people to Shankill Garda station there was nobody available to take them.</P>

      <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to her reply to Queston No. 5 where she informed us that there was a ratio of one garda per 260 persons in Dublin.  Is she aware that the population of the catchment area of the Shankill Garda station is now about 25,000 which means that notwithstanding the increase in Garda numbers the Garda strength per head of population is about half the national average and almost half the Dublin average?</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>if, in view of the serious upsurge in crime and the shortage of Garda manpower throughout the country, she will renew the option of allowing members of the force to serve until they are 60 years of age; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the Deputy's assertion that there is a serious upsurge in crime.  It is, however, fair to say that the use of violence in the furtherance of criminal acts is on a much higher level than was the case in, say, the pre-1970 period.  The reasons for this are many and varied but time would not permit me to go into them here.  The numbers of gardaí has been rising steadily in response to this particular crime trend. In 1970 we had 6,551 gardaí.  Today we have 10,984 and hundreds of civilian staff have been recruited to free up gardaí from indoor work to fulfil outdoor operational duty requirements.  There are now 1,647 civilian staff working for the Garda of whom almost 700 are full-time clerical staff and 181 are traffic wardens. This figure has risen significantly over the past three years.</P>
      <P>The compulsory retirement age for gardaí, sergeants and inspectors, at present set at 57 years, is the subject of discussion under the Garda conciliation and arbitration scheme and a meeting to discuss this particular issue is imminent. The House will appreciate that I would not wish to prejudice the discussions with the Garda representative bodies by commenting here further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members will of course be aware that the retirement age for the grades in question was increased temporarily from 57 to 60 between 1989 and 31 December 1992.  Members attaining 57 years during that period benefited from the concession which was introduced because of the time-lag involved in recruiting additional gardaí from the Garda recruitment campaign which commenced in 1988.  The temporary extension of the retirement age which applied in the period 1989 to <Col N="385" /> the end of 1992 will continue to provide benefits to the force until December 1995.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the Minister is going to meet with the Garda representatives bodies because they were waiting for almost a year to meet with her predecessor without success.  Would the Minister agree that the numbers in the force have actually declined?  For example, in 1985 there were 500 more gardaí than there are now.  Would the Minister also agree that this year about 420 members will leave the force and we will recruit only about 270?  Would she further agree that giving the gardaí the option to serve for a further three years would ensure, first, that we have more experienced members at the disposal of the force and, second, that costs would be halved?  Those gardaí would be receiving pensions - about 1.5 per cent of the pay bill each year goes towards pensions &mdash; and they would have to receive a gratuity. On a short term basis &mdash; I do not recommend it as a long term solution &mdash; and given the difficulties that exist within the force I ask the Minister for a third time to give the gardaí the option to serve for a further three years?  Would the Minister agree, if that option is not forthcoming, that in the next couple of years those who got the extension of three years plus those who would normally retire at the age of 57 will all retire together thus leaving the garda authorities with a serious manpower shortage?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision to extend the retirement age was originally taken in the context of the conditions prevailing at that time.  They included the relatively high retirement rates and the delay in replacement due to the time taken to recruit and train recruits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because the compulsory retirement age is now the subject of discussion under the Garda conciliation and arbitration scheme I do not want to prejudice those discussions and I do not think Deputy Harney would wish me to do so.  I have listened very carefully to what Deputy <Col N="386" /> Harney has said in relation to this matter. However, it is important to point out that we started the recruitment of the second 1,000 Garda trainees last year.  I intend to comply with the commitment in the Programme for Government to accelerate the recruitment level and I will bring proposals in that regard to Government shortly.  That will go some way towards the reductions Deputy Harney talked about in relation to the compulsory retirement age this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister clarify a matter for me?  The Minister said the recruitment of the second 1,000 Garda has started.  As the Minister is aware when statements of that nature are made the media usually think that 1,000 gardaí are being recruited.  Could the Minister confirm that the recruitment currently taking place does not exceed 250 gardaí. Can she also confirm that Deputy Harney is correct in saying that if the retirement age is not extended the numbers in the Garda force by December 1993 will be less than the numbers in the Garda force in December 1992?  Would the Minister agree that unless the retirement age is again temporarily extended rather than this Government, in its first year increasing the numbers in the Garda, there will in fact be a reduction?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in saying that 250 trainee gardaí are in Templemore, that is the number being recruited.  There is a commitment in the Programme for Government &mdash; as I said in answer to Deputy Harney &mdash; that Garda recruitment should be accelerated and I intend to do that.  Deputy Shatter might try but he is not going to get me to pre-judge the outcome of the discussions under the Garda conciliation and arbitration scheme.  It would be worth our while to wait for their decision.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not misleading the House in stating that Garda numbers have increased when, in fact, since 1987 Garda numbers have declined from 11,400 to the present figure which she quoted in her reply?  Would the Minister not agree that commitments to the <Col N="387" /> House to press for extra gardaí ring hollow when her own party made an electoral promise in the eighties to increase Garda strength to 12,000.  Despite six years in office we are still 1,000 short of that number.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the number of incidents involving the throwing of missiles from the bridge where the Navan Road bypass crosses over the Blakestown Road, Dublin 15 and to the fact that injuries have been sustained as a result; the measures, if any, which are being taken to stop these extremely dangerous occurances; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that they are aware of the problems referred to by the Deputy and that these incidents are being fully investigated by the gardaí.  I am of course concerned that such incidents which can result in serious injuries to persons and damage to property should <Col N="390" /> occur and the Garda authorities have assured me that they have taken a number of measures to deal with the situation. These include the closer co-ordination and use of patrols and greater deployment of plainclothes surveillance units.  In addition, particular attention is paid to youths found loitering on bridges over the Blanchardstown bypass.</P>
      <P>A recent important initiative is the introduction of talks in schools by Dublin Bus which are carried out in co-operation with community gardaí and which deal with the dangers associated in throwing missiles at buses.  I understand that so far 2,700 children in schools in the Clondalkin, Ronanstown and Blanchardstown areas have been visited and the Ballyfermot area will be included in the programme within the next few months.  The Garda authorities are satisfied that these measures are proving effective in that there has recently been a significant decrease in the incidence of such acts of vandalism in the area.  I am informed by the Garda autorities that they are, however, keeping the matter under review and will make whatever further appropriate action that may be necessary to deal with the problem.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply, but I still anxiously await a reply to my question which asked what is being done to stop these extremely dangerous occurrences considering that last weekend there were further incidents. People out for a social evening, particularly women, are afraid to go home because of the danger of crossing at the Navan Road bypass.  Does the Minister agree that if areas like this are effectively no go areas where ordinary law abiding citizens cannot go out for a drink in the evening and so on efforts should be made to combat these occurrences immediately?</P>

      <P>I would be concerned, as I am sure the Deputy would, if any area of our country was to become a no-go area.  The Garda authorities have informed me that in addition to the extra patrols, local community <Col N="391" /> gardaí, in association with inspectors from Dublin Bus, are visiting schools in the area to try to make contact with youths, many of whom are involved in incidents of this kind.</P>
      <P>Apart from increasing Garda patrols in the area the best way to tackle the problem is to get to the root of it by talking to those who are causing it.  The way forward is to do this in a systematic way as in Ronanstown and other areas and as it will be applied in the Ballyfermot area in the next couple of months. Also it is a way to get the support of parents and teachers for the gardaí in this area of operation.</P>

      <P>My Department provides an annual grant-in-aid to the Irish Association for Victim Support, a voluntary body which provides practical and emotional support to victims of crime.</P>
      <P>The grant-in-aid to the association was increased in each of the years 1991, 1992 and 1993, to a point where the funding to be provided in 1993 will be more than double the amount provided in 1990.</P>
      <P>The possibility of further increasing the funding for the association is kept under constant review in the Department of Justice.  However, Deputies will be aware of the many competing demands that there are for the limited financial resources available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to inform the House <Col N="392" /> that my Department is working closely with the IAVS and that assistance other than the grant-in-aid has been provided. In this regard, I would refer the Deputy to the written reply to Deputy Callely yesterday which outlined the progress made in providing a range of support services for victims of crime over and above a grant-in-aid.</P>

Does the Minister agree that this was an insult, given the increase in crime in recent years and the invaluable work done by the association?  Has the attention of the Minister of State been drawn to the very excellent paper delivered by Anne Meade, Secretary of the Irish Association for Victim Support &mdash; which the Minister has kindly sent us &mdash; at the recent conference arranged by the former Minister in Dublin Castle.  As a commitment to the many people who have been victims of crime in our society can the Minister assure us that there will be a substantial increase, both in the financial and staff resources made available to the association &mdash; I am thinking of advisory services, rental of premises, the holding of conferences and such matters as the association require help with.</P>

With regard to Deputy Harney's question about the doubling of recources, the figure for 1987, 1988, 1989 and 1990 remained static at £8,000 but was increased to £12,000 in 1991 and to $15,000 in 1992.

      <P>As I said in my reply to Deputy Callely yesterday, there is a wide range of services available to the association over and above grant-in-aid&mdash; it is not only a question of grant-in-aid.  I would point out that the association has drawn up a charter for victims of crime and has been making representations to the Department of Justice since its foundation in 1986.  The representations and suggestions made to us have been reflected in much of the legislation the Department produced since the association was set up in 1986.

Would the Minister of State agree that the Government should put in place a charter for the victims of crime and that it should not be left to a voluntary group in the context of the work they are doing? The charter for the victims of crime that has been prepared by the Irish Association for the Victim Support is the type of charter that should be sponsored by Government and put in place.

There is no voluntary organisation under the aegis of any Department that we would not like to fund to a greater degree than it is being funded at present.  Of course we would like to give more resources to every voluntary organisation that is doing such tremendous work.  We are in constant contact with the association and it is in contact with us.

Would he agree that the conditions attaching to grants from his Department are so strict that it would not be possible for the association to seek more and that the Department needs to widen the conditions under which grants are paid?

      <P>The registrar is also required under the Solicitors Acts to maintain a record of every order of the High Court striking the name of a solicitor off the roll or suspending a solicitor from practice, and also to publish a notice in <i>&ldquo;Iris Oifigiúil&rdquo;</i> of any order of the High Court striking a solicitor off the roll or suspending a solicitor from practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister of State explain to the House the difficulty he encountered in getting his Department to obtain the information requested?  Is he aware of the two extremely well publicised cases of solicitors struck off for fraudulently embezzling clients' funds and misappropriating clients' funds?  Can the Minister confirm that he is aware that there are substantial legal difficulties in processing criminal prosecutions against such solicitors?  Can the Minister indicate whether it is intended in the context of introducing a Solicitors (Amendment) Bill to provide for draconian new criminal penalties that can be brought against solicitors who misappropriate clients' funds in the type of cases that recently received so much publicity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder how Deputy Shatter found it so difficult to get the information he was so anxious to receive from the Registrar of the Incoporated Law Society.  If he reads page five of today's <i>Irish Independent</i> he will see that the President of the Incorporated Law Society in a speech yesterday referred to the figures.  For the record the figures are as follows: 1989, 2; 1990, 1; 1991, 5; 1992, 3.  We do not have figures for 1993 yet because the year has not yet expired. In regard to the second part of Deputy Shatter's question, I am aware of the legal difficulties involved.  Basically the Government has two options.  We have had representations from the Incorporated Law Society with detailed proposals for penalising solicitors who engage in fraudulent activities in embezzling clients' funds and so on.  We could accept those but it would mean including a new Part to the solicitors Bill which will be coming shortly before a special committee.  Alternatively, we can deal with the matter as part of general legislation on fraud.  I do not know whether it would be more appropriate to adopt the latter course but we are examining the situation.  I am aware of those difficulties and they will be dealt with by means of one of the two options I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I would encourage the <Col N="396" /> Minister to deal with them in the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill as that legislation is before the House.  Is the Minister of State aware that not only is there widespread concern among the general public but also in the legal profession and the solicitors' profession?  There are difficulties in this area because the solicitors' profession is funding a compensation scheme, at great personal cost, which, if claims continue at current levels, cannot be met.  There is a clear need to put in place legislation that allows for proper criminal prosecutions to be brought in the type of cases that have occurred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I can confirm that the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill will be reintroduced in the House shortly.  In relation to the latter part of Deputy Shatter's question, yes, I am aware of the concern. In fact the President of the Incorporated Law Society recognised it yesterday in his speech.  I assure Deputy Shatter, in case there is any doubt, that the necessary legislation will be put in place.  It will either appear in the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill or it will be part of the new legislation we are about to introduce to update the law on fraud.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State satisfied with the manner in which the Incorporated Law Society deals with complaints from the public?  Would he agree that there is a need for an independent legal ombudsman?  Would the Minister of State agree that the Incorporated Society is so firmly entrenched in its &ldquo;cover-up&rdquo; in relation to misbehaviour in other matters, that it is now issuing letters of intimidation to Deputies who are attempting to bring to light these misbehaviours?  I have evidence of that.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, before section 1, to insert the following new section.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;1.&mdash;Nothing in this Act shall be construed as exempting any State authority from any obligations to obtain planning permission for any development which, if the development were carried out by a person other than the State, would require planning permission under the provision of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 to 1992.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am acutely aware that the purpose of the Bill is not to provide for new planning laws but I am equally conscious of the fact that it arises out of a planning issue, namely, the Mullaghmore development and the litigation that arose out of it. It is of the utmost importance that the principle of the State being subject to ordinary planning permission requirements, and not being considered to be above the law in relation to planning permission matters, should be upheld and respected and not in any way trenched upon by the provisions of any Bill. In this Bill we are giving express power, not merely to the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland but also to any member of the Government who has the consent of the Minister for Finance to carry out any development on State lands.  It is worth reminding ourselves of the extensive nature of the empowerment we are giving these people if the Bill goes through unamended and also the extent of the disempowerment which that constitutes for this House.  The High Court has held that Ministers of State who are <Col N="460" /> corporation sole, and the Commissioners for Public Works in Ireland, who are in the words employed by Mr. Justice Costello on his High Court decision &ldquo;a statutory corporation&rdquo;, are strictly limited as to the manner in which they can carry out certain actions including developments.  There is no general power of development conferred on individual members of the Government as a matter of Irish law.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Dempsey, is attempting to introduce into Irish law a general power of development for members of the Government or the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland acting with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>We should examine the nature of the possible developments that could be carried out under the authority the Minister is seeking for members of the Government. Developments under the provisions of this Bill, if it becomes law, and the planning Act 1963 encompass virtually everything that can be done on land.  Any works carried on or under land fall into the category of development. That includes erecting new buildings, demolishing old buildings and putting in place a completely different usage for any land.  It is a development under the planning Acts to change, say, a retail premises into a restaurant, to change a race course into a football stadium, to intensify the use of any land so as to interfere with other people's rights or to knock down a listed building.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind that &ldquo;development&rdquo; includes the activity of demolishing a listed building &mdash; that is a development under our planning laws &mdash; it follows that we are giving any Minister the right to demolish any building under his control and we are giving the Commissioners of Public Works the right to demolish any building which they have.  What safeguards are there that they would not exercise those powers in a way which would be a material infringement of the public's right to have our architectural heritage respected?  The only safeguard that exists at present, subject to Mr. Justice <Col N="461" /> Costello's decision being reversed which is what the Government hopes to do, is that there must be some form of consultation under section 84 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 between a State authority proposing to demolish a building and the local planning authority.</P>
    <P>If the State were minded to go through with the demolition of a building there would be nothing the local authority could do, apart from insisting on some form of consultation.  Unless and until there is a subjection of the State to planning laws we are in the position of having to live with the English constitutional theory that the State is above the law.  In the planning code this is incorporated in the notion that all the State has to do is consult with planning authorities.  The scope of the power to carry out developments without strict observance of the planning laws is not one which should be given in such general terms to Ministers.</P>
    <P>Doubtless, this Government considers itself enlightened but one has only to go back to the decision of a previous member of the Deputy's party, former Minister Kevin Boland, who, when he was Minister for Local Government without being unfair to him, personally sanctioned the destruction by the ESB of a swath of Georgian Dublin.  He personally advanced the cause of filling in the Grand Canal and converting it into a multi-lane highway and sewer right across south inner city Dublin.  In my constituency he sanctioned the development of Mount Pleasant Square as a motor garage and a car repair location.</P>
    <P>It is not, therefore, to be taken for granted that Ministers can be trusted to take decisions which are in the national interest or in the interest of conservation. We are not in the position of being able to trust every Minister of the Government not to destroy parts of our architectural heritage.  More important still, we are not in a position to assume that Ministers, in the course of carrying out developments, will find themselves in any sense obliged to respect the rules of planning which other ordinary mortals have to, as a matter of law, comply with. <Col N="462" /> The purpose of this amendment is to restate the law as we understand it to be as of this day and as stated by Mr. Justice Costello in the High Court, that the State is obliged to obtain planning permission to carry out any development, that section 84 of the Planning Act, which provides at present for consultation, does not act as a substitute for the obligation to obtain planning permission.  It must be stitched into the record that, as far as this House is concerned, the State is obliged to obtain planning permission and that nothing in the provisions of the Bill now before us can be relied on by any Minister to suggest that he is, in some sense, exempt from planning controls.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister indicated this morning that he intends, at some stage during the debate, to release to us a rough programme of legislative deadlines by which he proposes to put in place the commitments of the Government, under its plan, to make the State more amenable to planning laws.</P>
    <P>In relation to that, I wish to say, first, the present proposals in the Programme for Government are vague.  Second, there is no guarantee that they will be delivered on.  Third, the Minister's statements of his intentions have to be taken in the context of a report we read in today's papers that some official Government spokesman, as was described in <i>The Irish Times</i>, indicated that the Government intends to go further than its programme commitments in this area.  Why we have to read about that in the papers and not hear about it during the Second Stage debate in this House I do not know, but that is the way we are treated in this House now.</P>
    <P>Even if it is the intention of the Government to put in place a process of consultation we must bear in mind that consultation and regulation are different things.  We have had in relation to Mullaghmore, Luggala and other places, clear indications that, in the last analysis, a Government which is intent on having its way will not necessarily be stopped by any group whether environmentalists, conservationists, like minded people or, <Col N="463" /> necessarily, in the future, by any local authority.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the opponents of this amendment is to restate beyond any doubt that any change in the law in relation to empowering Ministers made in this Bill, will be subject to the proviso that no obligation under planning law, to obtain planning permission, is affected by it. I join with other Deputies who expressed very grave disquiet and sentiments of disgust at the manner in which this Bill has been guillotined through this House today.  There is no need for such a guillotine.  It is wrong in principle that we should all be under time pressure this afternoon, and that a Bill of this importance with such far reaching implications should be pushed through without any adequate opportunity for Opposition spokespersons to look at it, to tease out all its implications or to persuade the Government side that some features of it deserve closer scrutiny, reconsideration and change.</P>
    <P>It augurs extremely badly, as the first set piece of this Government, in terms of its commitment to making the Dáil into a working legislature.  It makes a farce of what is going to happen tomorrow in this House, that is, the proposed discussion in relation to Dáil reform.  If Dáil reform encompasses what happened in this House this morning I despair at democracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments concern the wish of the Members who have tabled them that the developments proposed in this Bill should be subject to a requirement to apply for planning permission. There are two reasons for that. The first is the obvious one, that it complies with the requirement of good planning practice.  The second is that it has the effect of locating the effective decision about the development at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the problems which have arisen over the proposed interpretative centres is the extent to which local people are frustrated that developments are being imposed on them.  Indeed, it is probably <Col N="464" /> fair to say that much of the frustration expressed by those who support the development at Mullaghmore was about the lack of involvement of local people in decisions that intimately affect their own area.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a recipe for big brother Government.  It is a recipe for State bodies deciding what is good for the environment and what is good for local communities.  Those decisions are not necessarily based on any kind of rational approach to the development of an area. As we know, in the case of the interpretative centres, what is driving the decision to provide interpretative centres is not any concern about the localities, the environment or the amenities involved. What is driving the provision of interpretative centres is the availability of money from the European Community and the desire of the relevant Government agencies to use that money and to advance projects for that money.  In much the same way, the availability of federal grants in the United States is driving the provision of toxic dumps and toxic waste incinerators in the reservations provided for native Americans.  If a grant is provided for something there is a tendency for that grant to be spent and for some project to be devised to meet it.</P>
    <P>Reference was made here this morning to the comments by Deputy Cox, that the Bill could give rise to a Government Minister wishing to develop a nuclear power station.  I share the view that the possibility in the present climate is probably unlikely.  But it allows for Government Minister to go ahead with developments which have traditionally been regarded as very controversial.  It would, for example, permit a Minister for the Environment to develop a toxic dump or to provide toxic waste incinerator in an area, without any requirement to subject his proposal to the planning process.  It would enable the Minister for Defence to build military installations in parts of the country without any requirement to consult the local people.  It would enable the Minister for Communications to provide radio masts, perhaps in the Minister of State's own <Col N="465" /> constituency, a matter, I understand, on which he had some strong views.</P>
    <P>Most of the legislation going through this House these days is enabling legislation which gives Ministers very wide powers in regard to development.  The difficulty, and what has given rise to a great deal of controversy about the proposed interpretative centres, is the extent to which the public, members of local communities are effectively disenfranchised. It ends up, as has happened in Mullaghmore, with a debate taking place between, on the one hand, a State agency whose accountability to the public and to this House is remote, to say the least, and, on the other hand, people who are opposed to the development.  The local community is sandwiched between two competing points of view and does not have a serious input into the whole issue.  By requiring the State authority to submit its plans for planning permission in the normal way decision making would be brought back to the local area.  Proposals would be subject to the development plan of the local authority, which is adopted by the members of the local authority, and the development would be open to scrutiny in the normal way.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of planning. It is a principle that now seems to be accepted generally by Members of this House.  I am a member of a party which sees the state as having a much more active role in the economic life of this country than at present.  Unlike the implications in Deputy Bruton's contribution today, I do not see anything ideologically wrong with the State competing with the private sector.  But I believe that any such competition should be on equal terms.  If any organ of the State wishes to proceed with a development it should have to subject itself to the same type of scrutiny as any other kind of development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I would recommend to Deputy McCormack, if he finds it difficult to listen to my contribution, to take himself on one of his walk-abouts to meet his constituents.  Most of us when we read the Programme for Government understood it to mean that it was the Government's intention to introduce legislation to require State authorities to submit developments for planning permission. In the light of the practice in this House over the past week, for example, on the Roads Bill, where the Government voted down an amendment requiring the new National Roads Authority to apply for planning permission and the Taoiseach seemed to be suggesting that what was intended was considerably less than a requirement on State bodies to apply for planning permission, I have serious doubts that this Government intends to introduce legislation to require State authorities to submit their proposals for <Col N="467" /> planning permission.  The Minister of State should clarify exactly what the Government intend to legislate for in this area.</P>
      <P>My amendment was framed to take account of some of the concerns the Minister of State seemed to have during the course of the Second Stage debate.  He referred, for example, to what he considered to be an absurdity, that if one wanted to build an Army barracks or a Garda station close to the Border, for security reasons, it would not make sense to have to submit that for planning permission. Presumably that was what was anticipated when the term &ldquo;in general&rdquo; was inserted in the Programme for Government.  My amendment takes the same term &ldquo;general&rdquo; and states that no State authority shall be exempt from a general obligation to seek and obtain planning permission in respect of construction and development.  This is very much in harmony with the Government's own stated general objective in the Programme for Government.  It should be possible for the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>
      <P>In the second part of my amendment I have stated again that that requirement would not apply to any construction or development which was completed prior to 14 February 1993, which is the date of the Costello judgment.  All these suggestions, for example, that a new planning application would have to be submitted for every Garda barracks and every building that has ever been built by the Office of Public Works, would not arise under this formula.  The new situation would start from that date.</P>
      <P>As has been mentioned by a number of Deputies earlier in the debate, very few of the developments which are going ahead on behalf of the Office of Public Works engender the kind of controversy that the interpretative centres have engendered. I have high regard for the work and professional competence and the staff of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of options open to the Office of Public Works or to any State authority in this type of situation where <Col N="468" /> work is proceeding.  It could do what any private developer could do in those circumstances, apply for retention or apply for permission in this interregnum situation.  The only developments which there is a requirement to put a halt to, are the proposed interpretative centres, because of the controversy they have aroused.  State authorities in general should have to apply for planning permission for any development they undertake and in the cases that have given rise to this legislation in the first place there should be a specific requirement to undergo that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go over the ground that has been covered by the previous speakers.  What they have said is in line with what I said in opening the opposition to this Bill this morning.  The major principle involved here is that the Government has not been made amenable to the remit of the planning legislation. There is every good reason the Government should always be amenable to planning laws.  In the programme for Government there is a clear, although perhaps not too specific, promise made that all Government Departments and State agencies, including the Office of Public Works, will be required by law to comply in general with the information procedures in the planning laws.  That is a general statement, but even if that vague statement were reflected in this legislation it would go a long way towards satisfying our demands.  Fair play demands of the State that it should be amenable to these laws in the same way as every citizen.  The planning laws have developed since the first enactment in 1963 to the stage where any citizen erecting a clothes line can be required to have planning permission.  The State opts out under section 84, which was criticised in the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition of the word &ldquo;development&rdquo; in planning legislation should be known.  Section 3(1) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, states &ldquo;development in this Act means, save where the context otherwise requires, the carrying out of any works <Col N="469" /> on, in, or under land or the making of any material change in the use of any structures or other land&rdquo;.  That is a very wide definition.  It can impinge on the rights of many people and give the State this right to trespass and to do under the law what is found for the ordinary citizen to be unthinkable.  In the United Kingdom, under their planning legislation, when a development of a kind that can have a major impact on an area is proposed a local inquiry is set up, commissioners are appointed and members of the public who have an interest or who live in an area directly affected can go and argue their point.  They can have themselves professionally represented at these inquiries.  That is a development of enlightened law.  I cannot understand why the Government here cannot entertain a similar step forward.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to be reasonable on this issue.  Maybe by saying this I am anticipating a refusal, which I should not anticipate.  This is the major problem all members on this side of the House have with this legislation.  We are viewing it through the prism of this problem in the programme for Government.  Some of us on this side of the House wish the Government well, although we are in Opposition.  Do not begin by making a joke of your promises.  There is much public cynicism about politicians and about what we do in this House.  Is it any wonder that is so when people read what has been promised?  Vague as it is, it is quite high sounding.  Then they find this arbitrary legislation with all its draconian intent and the hard face of the Minister to reasoned arguments from this side of the House that this simple amendment be made.</P>

    <P>I am delighted to see the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht join us at this point.  Perhaps that is a message that this is Government legislation as distinct from Fianna Fáil legislation.  Would that he had the opportunity to deliver <Col N="470" /> a Second Stage speech this morning, because it would have made it easier for us on this side of the House to understand exactly where he stands in relation to the legislation before us.  He is nonetheless very welcome.  I cannot help thinking that he and many members of the Government must not agree with the speed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Many of my colleagues and other speakers have voiced their view about the unseemly haste of this legislation. While I can understand the concern within the Office of Public Works to regularise the development programme they have in hand, given the outcome of the Costello judgment in the High Court case last week, this legislation goes far further than that.  My main concern is that the Taoiseach on the Order of Business this morning, categorically stated that this legislation only dealt with the Office of Public Works, regularising the projects on hand by that office and not with anything else.  That is on the record. The Taoiseach, in response to questions from this side of the House, stated it only dealt with Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 1 of the Bill it is stated: &ldquo;&lsquo;State authority&rsquo; means any authority being &mdash; (a) a Minister of the Government, <Col N="471" /> or (b) the Commissioners&rdquo;.  The Ministers of the Government are a very wide ranging body with very wide ranging powers dealing with many aspects of potential development in our country.  I support the three amendments.  If the Minister could pick one of the three that have been proposed by different Members on this side of the House we would be happy.  We would not nitpick as regards the suitability of the wording. The intent of each of the three amendments is exactly the same.</P>
    <P>I concur with what was said about the Commissioners of Public Works, particularly the National Parks and Monuments section.  I have had occasion to deal with them over the years.  One of the best kept secrets has been the wonderful work over the decades that has been done by that body.  I regret the unneccessary conflict that has arisen in relation to the location of the interpretative centres at Mullaghmore, Luggala and the Boyne Valley.  If we had planning procedures in place these difficulties would never have arisen.  That is what these amendments purport to do.  If it was just the Office of Public Works we were talking about here today, it would be one matter; but extending the powers of this emergency legislation to all State Departments and Ministers is a major cause of concern.</P>
    <P>In Wexford, a beautiful old seafaring port, coming in over Wexford Bridge and as you head towards Rosslare, we have a beautiful waterfront, wooden works and a quay front that is intrinsically unique to Wexford.  The parallel modes of transport, maritime, rail, road and pedestrian, are not in any other area.  Wexford Corporation proposes to destroy the wooden works and to extend the quay front with a modern device, which will be beautifully finished by modern standards.  However, it will destroy the unique character of our old seafaring port.  Because there are no planning procedures in place, and because third parties, the public generally or councillors cannot be heard in relation to this issue, this procedure is likely to go ahead on the grounds that an interceptor sewer which is urgently needed must be <Col N="472" /> installed as part of the main drainage. Expediency, taking a cheaper option, will allow Wexford Corporation to destroy the wooden works in Wexford and extend the quay front.</P>
    <P>I urge anybody who has an interest in our built heritage and our industrial architecture to descend on the powers that be.  I urge both Ministers present to take an interest in this.  For years I have been writing to the National Heritage Council and I have tried to interest the Maritime Institute of Ireland, as we are a seafaring port.  I failed in relation to Wexford County Council and Corporation. I am the only councillor in Wexford to even see the destruction.  If Wexford means anything to the people of the area and the tourists who visit there, it is because of our beautiful seafront and wooden works.</P>
    <P>If planning were in place this matter could be dealt with democratically, third parties could have a voice and appeal to An Bord Pleanála and there would be a binding document on everyone involved.  I am sure we could all give examples of how we have been frustrated in our own counties because of the lack of planning procedures in relation to the State.</P>
    <P>But when it comes to our built heritage and our natural heritage, there is a need for particular sensitivity.  If we cannot oblige the Departments of State, including the Office of Public Works, to appreciate the democratic input of third parties and the growing concerns of the public in relation to our environment &mdash; and to cater for that through the planning process &mdash; then we are failing as Members of this House.</P>
    <P>I appeal for a commitment from the Minister of State at the Office of Public Works and from the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to ensure that there is no more desecration of our natural and built heritage.  I know it is not intentional.  Those who draw up these plans are well motivated but they are not taking on board the concerns of the public, natives and visitors.  If the built heritage is destroyed the damage cannot be reversed.  If the wooden works in Wexford <Col N="473" /> go, they cannot be replaced.  The same applies to the houses in Upper Merrion Street.  Planning permission must be required in relation to the proposals for that street.  There is a litany of other issues of which the same may be said.</P>
    <P>Nuclear power stations were mentioned as an example of what might be done if planning permission was not required.  In fact, planning permission is required for such developments.  In the late seventies when an application was received from the ESB to erect a nuclear power station in Carne that was the first indication of a Government proposal in regard to nuclear power.  Because of our lack of competence as a county council, it was hard to assess whether Ireland needed to go nuclear at that point. However, as members of the local authority. It did come through the planning process and there were major objections. Many people cut their environmental teeth on the Carne issue.  There were many outings to Carnsore Point and many protests of one kind or another. Many people, particularly younger people, got their first taste of involvement in environmental issues in Carnsore Point on the nuclear issue.  There is a procedure for planning applications by the ESB.</P>
    <P>Many issues could be introduced in the debate underlining and giving examples of our concern at lack of procedures throughout State authorities.  In this legislation sanction is given to the continuation of lack of planning.  To my knowledge, the construction of nuclear power stations is incorrectly introduced here, as an example.  I know that as a result of being a member of Wexford County Council when that application was received.</P>
    <P>In supporting the three amendments, I ask the Minister to say why there has been such unseemly haste.  In his speech, as Deputy O'Malley pointed out, the Minister stated that the Government had decided to suspend work on the Boyne, Wicklow and Burren projects pending the Supreme Court appeal.  I do not think that will take place today or tomorrow. It will probably be fast-tracked through <Col N="474" /> the list for the Supreme Court, given that it is a Government issue, but it will take a little time.  Why then, the haste with this legislation if the major projects in question are not going ahead, regardless of this legislation, until after the Supreme Court decision?  Could we have an indication from the Minister as to what other projects are tied up as a result of the Costello judgement?</P>
    <P>Could the Minister also indicate why the Taoiseach misled the House on the Order of Business?  Perhaps the one sheet of paper failed to reach the Taoiseach.  I know he is a one sheet of paper man.  He specifically said the legislation before us today dealt only with the difficulties that have arisen with the Office of Public Works as a result of the High Court judgment of last week.  Why the unseemly haste, when the three major projects concerned are being postponed anyway until after the Supreme Court judgment?  Could we have a commitment from the Minister regarding the introduction of planning requirements for all State bodies.</P>

      <P>As a member of Dublin City Council planning committee I have had cause, in the past, to criticise the Office of Public Works.  I have also had cause to congratulate it on its excellent work, particularly in relation to the Customs House and Government Buildings.  These are the jewels in the crown.  Unfortunately, the Office of Public Works has been guilty of bad estate management of many of the listed buildings in this city.  The city council has written to the Office of Public Works requiring it to enter into negotiations with us and to be accountable for lack of good management of the estates in its stewardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An example was given earlier of the houses in Upper Merrion Street, which during the stewardship of the Office of Public Works, fell into a disgraceful state <Col N="475" /> of neglect.  Such was the neglect that when the new developers bought the property they applied for permission for a development which would just retain the facade.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the wideranging powers this Bill proposes to give to the Office of Public Works because it does not include checks and balances to limit those powers.  At the moment there is a loose consultation process by the Office of Public Works with the local planning authorities, but that can mean it just tells the authorities what it proposes to do.  It has no teeth.  It does not include any regulation.  Consultation and regulation are quite different.  I am particularly concerned at the provision that the Office of Public Works can &ldquo;maintain, manage, repair, improve, enlarge, reduce in size&rdquo; and so on.  The Office of Public Works is being given huge powers in this Bill to deal with many of our listed buildings in Dublin and around the country.  I am very concerned that there is no control or duty on the Office of Public Works to comply with the planning regulations.</P>
    <P>For example, if the Office of Public Works were to decide that the cheapest course to maintain a listed building was to put in aluminium windows, who could tell them that is not on, that it is in our cultural interest to look after the facades and indeed the interiors of listed buildings? There is no system of checks and balances and that is why the Office of Public Works must be subject to the planning process as other developers are.</P>
    <P>In many cases there are very excellent architects working for the Office of Public Works and they have been responsible, in the main, for much of the good work that has been done by the Office of Public Works.  It is, however, a very bureaucratic institution and if things are left to administrators without an outside check, they may take the cheapest and most expedient route and not have due regard for our cultural heritage.</P>
    <P>Our built heritage is a finite resource and the Office of Public Works, which has responsibility for much of the built heritage <Col N="476" /> all around the country, should be subjected to the planning controls we expect all other developments to be subject to.  That is why I support this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. B. Fitzgerald Mr. B. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill does not go far enough to protect the Office of Public Works because it is time all public bodies, including local authorities, and the Office of Public Works in particular, should be protected from small elitist groups who set themselves up, appointed by nobody other than themselves, to oppose most projects which are coming on stream.  I can speak with some authority in relation to the one project which has been mentioned here, the Boyne Valley Achaeological Park.  This has been opposed by the Boyne Valley Trust, a very small group of people, many of whom are not even from the area.  I take exception to the fact that it is implied that I as a public representative and a member of a local authority, was not consulted sufficiently in relation to this particular project.  I would hope the Minister during the course of the evening will be in a position to announce that the interpretative centre in the Boyne Valley should be allowed go ahead.  There is no justifiable argument to prevent it.  The argument being put forward is an economic argument and that, I understand, is contrary to planning laws.  It cannot be taken into consideration when a project is being considered for planning permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedure adopted to consult with the various bodies, and particularly the local authority, concerning this project was as follows.  The project was initiated by the county council tourism sub-committee back in 1986.  It was adopted by the full council in the following month when the council requested the Office of Public Works to acquire land with a view to developing an archaeological park in the Newgrange area.  There was much demand by tourists to visit the area and the facilities and infrastructure were inadequate.  It was central to the county council's tourism strategy, but we did not have sufficient finance to do it.  That is <Col N="477" /> why we requested the Office of Public Works to acquire the land for us.</P>
    <P>The Royal Irish Academy set up a group consisting of the Office of Public Works, the local authority and Professor George Eogan from the archaeological department in UCD to examine the pros and cons of setting up such a park in the area, as it is a sensitive area.  The Minister of the day on 10 November 1987 approved the project in principle.  In December of the same year the county council welcomed the announcement and approved in principle its going ahead.  On 11 December 1989 a special meeting of Meath County Council was held in the presence of the Office of Public Works, Bord Fáilte and George Eogan, the Professor of Archaeology in UCD, who outlined to the council the proposals intended for the Boyne Valley Park.  On 5 July 1990 the Office of Public Works made a submission to the county council under section 84 of the 1963 Planning Act for a visitor centre, car park, pedestrian bridge and access minibus route.  A further submission was made on 13 September 1990.  The county council, on 26 September 1990, approved in principle and advised it had no objections to the submission as outlined but would require further information as the project began to unfold.  On 5 November 1990 the council was informed of the detailed proposals of the Office of Public Works for the area, which indicated that the council would be making a compulsory purchase order to acquire the necessary land.  The public was being made well aware at all times of what was being done because our meetings were open to the press and it was highly publicised.  On 29 November the Office of Public Works made further&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will not be much longer.  The point I was trying to make was that within the existing planning laws under section 84 of the 1963 Planning Act, the Office of Public Works has complied in full in relation to this project. They have gone beyond what they were required to do by producing an environmental impact statement which invited people to make submissions.  The individuals who are objecting today, and who sought an adjournment the other day in the High Court, are people who have already made submissions to this environmental impact statement.  The Office of Public Works and local authorities act for the common good and always have.  They do not act for small elitist groups or the landed gentry.</P>

      <P>There has been much disquiet for some time about the lack of accountability of the Office of Public Works.  Unlike the case described by the last speaker, in Wicklow the council did not agree to welcome the proposal on an interpretative centre but we got one anyway.  The consultation process related to the county manager.  Although we did say our piece, it was not listened to.  If it was listened to, it was not heeded.  I am concerned at the fact that the reputation of the Office of Public Works has been damaged.  As somebody concerned about conservation, I think much damage has been done to the reputation of a very fine body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The underdevelopment of the status of the Office of Public Works in relation to the public has been highlighted for some <Col N="479" /> time.  I would have thought that sufficient consideration had been given to the whole question of how to make the Office of Public Works accountable.  That could have been incorporated into this Bill. I find it hard to believe that sufficient thought and time has not been available to do so.</P>
    <P>There is a certain onus on the Minister to explain why the State, the Office of Public Works and other such bodies, should be exempt from planning permission. The logical expectation of the average person is that nobody should be exempt unless there is really good sound reason.  I have not heard any reasons at all in regard to what gives the State special status.  Is there some kind of Ministerial infallibility that we, on this side of the House, are not privy to?  Is there some kind of special knowledge on that side of the House, once one gets into Cabinet, that we do not have?  I would like to know what happens if, for example, a Minister develops delusions of grandeur, or happens to have a certain amount of ignorance, or happens to make a mistake, or happens, God forbid, to go mad while he is on the job?</P>
    <P>The Costello judgment, clearly, is that no State body is exempt from the planning process.  In particular, in relation to the Office of Public Works, it makes the point:</P>
    <P>I must conclude that this early 19th century administrative machine is being asked to perform functions it was never designed to perform &mdash; to meet 20th century demands it needs to be supplied with new parts, as was done in the case of the Blasket Islands; perhaps, even, it requires to be replaced altogether.</P>
    <P>Rather than supplying new parts what is now being given to State bodies is a type of 12th century licence, that I thought had long since died, a <i>droit de seigneur</i>, when it comes to the relationship between State bodies and the countryside.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the Irish countryside because I happen to represent <Col N="480" /> a county that has the best countryside and the best landscape and I want to keep it that way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Next to nowhere. Within our county we now have the foundations of an interpretative centre that was badly thought out and badly located.  The Office of Public Works is probably not to blame, but greed, and a desire to get the European money in fast, is responsible for the lack of thought and the bad location.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons why the Luggala site has not hit the headlines as often as Mullaghmore is that there has not been any organised group whatsoever in favour of the centre.  Indeed, you would walk a long way in the hills of County Wicklow before you would find somebody who is wholeheartedly in favour of the Luggala location of the centre.</P>
      <P>A very important question affects us in County Wicklow, over and beyond the siting of the interpretative centre, and that relates to the national park, which has now been established and which will be subject to future legislation.  The principle is now established and it is a principle I welcome; it is an important development and it is one, I hope, which will succeed.  There is no chance of it succeeding unless it is built on trust, co-operation and on mutual respect with the people who live in the uplands of County Wicklow.  I am talking about people who would not know an elitist group if one presented it to them.  I am talking about people who have worked the land for generations, who belong to the landscape in a way that anybody from outside will never do, who hope to see the children they have reared there stay in County Wicklow.  Many of them have not been able to see that hope realised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have many rural communities in Wicklow which are rapidly being drained of all life that should belong, by right, to rural communities as it does to urban or suburban communities.  We are losing post offices, Garda stations and health services.  Things are running down. <Col N="481" /> Young people who are the lifeblood of our community are moving out.  Those people want to see a development in Wicklow that will encourage tourism.  We all welcome tourists into County Wicklow and we accept as natives&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I will finish the point. If one is going to develop a very large project of conservation, like a national park, one must do it by trusting the people.  The first step is to enable the planning process to be part of the deal.  I do not believe that these amendments on their own will resolve the difficulties or will open up the State bodies to the full accountability, but they will be a start.  It is a statement of trust which has to be built up again.  I wonder if the Minister is aware of the damage that has been caused, the mistrust and the feeling of being marginalised that people have when they see the decisions that have been made.</P>
      <P>I have one last point to make.  Locally, in my constituency, the people came up with a proposal in relation to interpretative centres, plugged into local communities with great possibilities for job creation, but tied into local resources in a way that was environmentally friendly. That was never listened to.  Nobody has ever heard the case that should have been presented because nobody came to listen. I remember at one of the first meetings held in relation to the interpretative centre, a spokesman from the Office of Public Works stood up, clearly dismayed at the strength of feeling he was getting from the crowd.  He asked in a very bewildered fashion what has democracy got to do with this?  I will submit, to the Minister that democracy has everything to do with this.  That is the challenge and the opportunity we should take today by agreeing to this amendment to the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to get this opportunity to speak to this amendment. I was disappointed I did not have an opportunity to speak at the earlier Stage this morning because of the guillotine that was brought in by the Government. I want to begin by responding to the remarks made by Deputy Brian Fitzgerald. I am sorry he has left the House. I did not interrupt him because I understand he was making his maiden speech. I find it quite appalling that any Deputy in this House, and particularly a Deputy of the Labour Party, would talk about small groups and minorities and elitists and landowners and talk in that way about those whose concern, vision and courage has helped to fight campaigns for our environment for many years.  I find it a disgrace and it is an insult to those people.  It is an insult not only to those people who have fought this cause but, indeed, an insult to the rest of us who are concerned about the environment.  In the past it was the case that it was the better informed, the better educated, who were interested in and were aware of environmental issues.  I am pleased to say that all recent surveys indicate that more and more young people of all backgrounds are concerned with, interested in and knowledgeable about our environment. I welcome that very much.  It is only through education and information that we will make the right decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In attacking the decision to locate these interpretative centres at Luggala and Mullaghmore, which I have visited on many occasions, I have always distinguished between the officials at the Office of Public Works and the professional and very good advice they give on most occasions, and the political decisions that were made.  I always <Col N="483" /> believe, naturally, that it is the Ministers and the politicians who must take the rap when wrong decisions are made.  I also said at the weekend, in a number of comments I made, that we should not be criticising the officials when they get it wrong, it is a matter of ministerial and political responsibility.</P>
    <P>Having said that, an article that appeared in yesterday's <i>Irish Press</i> by the public relations officer for the Office of Public Works, Chris Flynn, is an absolute disgrace.  One part of it said:</P>
    <P>What is left unsaid is that it's also very fashionable to have an environmental &ldquo;cause&rdquo; in your c.v., if you are in the public eye.  The details of the case are not really important.</P>
    <P>I presume Mr. Flynn's article was cleared by the Minister because it might surprise the Minister to know my attention was drawn to Mr. Flynn's article by an official of the Office of Public Works who was disgusted when he read it.  In making those disgraceful comments about those who have had the courage, vision and toughness and who put their own very small private resources in great jeopardy to take this case, Mr. Flynn is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>One of the people who took the case is none other than Professor Eimear Colleran, former chairperson of An Taisce, member of the Council of State, a leading expert in this country on environmental issues, well respected not just in Ireland, but internationally.  It is a disgrace that a public relations officer could write such things.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Taoiseach referred this morning to new procedures which will be put in place in relation to planning for State bodies.  We were told, in the speech of the Minister of State, that nothing will be done in this matter until the Supreme Court adjudicates. Presumably, if the Supreme Court decides that planning permission is not necessary we will not see very much change.  If the Supreme Court decides it is, the Government will have no option. Despite the comments made about it I was under no illusion when I saw the <Col N="484" /> Programme for Government.  When it was published I said one of the disappointing features about the programme was that it was very poor on environmental matters.  This is what the Programme for Government said about the Government's new proposal on planning for State Departments:</P>
    <P>Departments and State agencies will be directed to comply, to the maximum possible extent consistent with the needs of the service they must provide, with the requirements of good planning and to take due account of the legitimate interest and wishes of the population living in the vicinity of the proposed development.</P>
    <P>All they will be required to do, to the maximum possible extent is to comply with good planning.  That does not mean they will have to get planning permission. In fact, all they will have to do, as the earlier paragraph tells us, is to fulfil the information obligations in the planning Acts which is to lodge details of their proposal and allow people two months to make observations.  There will be no requirement for planning permission and there will be no right for third parties to make an appeal to An Bord Pleanála. It is very dishonest of the Taoiseach to pretend that there will be a requirement to have planning permission for State developments in the future as a result of the commitments in the Programme for Government.  Will the Minister of State comment on that?</P>
    <P>I presume the reason the State uses to justify not having planning permission is an arrogant presumption that the State knows best, the State has all the best expertise in the country and if the State sets out to build or construct something the State is doing the right thing and building it in accordance with the highest possible environmental standards.  That presumption is an arrogant one.  All expertise does not reside in the State, as many Ministers know.  They are bringing in outside experts to advise them.  If all the expertise was there they would not need to bring in outsiders.  The Labour Party is bringing in programme managers <Col N="485" /> and so on to help them.  I think most State officials also recognise that they do not have all the answers.  It is an arrogant presumption and it is about time we got rid of it.</P>
    <P>In relation to many of the comments about the requirement to get planning permission, if these developments are so good, why are the State authorities, and the Office of Public Works afraid to go through the planning procedures?  If these buildings are being constructed in the right areas according to the highest standards then why not go for planning permission?  What is the problem?  The Office of Public Works and, particularly, those who have had ministerial responsibility since this whole saga began, have a double agenda.  They want interpretative centres provided and when they were opposed, they did not try to see the Opposition as allies.  They did not try to reach a compromise, like most reasonable people.  Most politicians set out to reach compromise.  Very often, our job is about making compromises.  Unless we want to be totally in control, on our own, we must consider the views of others. Rather than adopt that approach, the attitudes was taken that they were in charge and would use the might and main of this State to beat the Opposition down all the way.  Even when the Opposition was beaten and court cases won that is not good enough.  They now want to change the law and we have this emergency legislation.</P>
    <P>I reject that attitude.  It is an arrogant one and contrary to the spirit of the Programme for Government which talks about broadening democracy, restoring confidence to the democratic process, encouraging greater openness and participation from all groups at all levels and improving public accountability transparency and trust.  That is all nonsense if, when one beats the State in the second highest court of the land, the State will retrospectively seek to change the laws, so people cannot have fair play.</P>
    <P>I am delighted we have a sufficient number of courageous and brave people to take on the State.  It is good for our democracy, it is good for this State, it is <Col N="486" /> good for Government.  It is good for this House also that we must confront these issues in a manner in which we have not confronted them before.  We never had an opportunity in this House to have any proper debate about these interpretative centres.</P>
    <P>In relation to the planning issue, the Luggala centre, for example, cost maybe seven times more to build on the side of a mountain than it would to build it down in the town.  In inclement and bad weather conditions it will be inaccessible. The town nearby, Roundwood, is in need of a new sewage treatment plant because the existing plant does not work satisfactorily and runs the risk of contaminating the Dublin water supply. Instead of putting the centre in the town and installing one sewage treatment plant to cope with the problems of Roundwood and the interpretative centre, we went up the mountains, spent seven times more, £0.5 million, on a sewage treatment facility, and the town and the Dublin water supply are at risk.  Even from an economic point of view this does not make sense.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important, in the context of this debate, to go back to the beginning and realise that even if only a minority raised the issue many silent people feel very strongly about what has been going on.  Deputy Fox's election to this House for the Wicklow constituency can testify to the fact that there is deep concern about the manner in which these matters have been handled.  It is not good enough for the State, or any Minister of the State, to decide to beat people down, to use all the legislative weapons at their disposal in order to win at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>These are good facilities which could be a focus for great unity, consensus and assistance in any community.  Those in charge, politically and officially should have set out to bring people together.  In the main they were dealing with reasonable people.  I know that because I know many of the people involved and I object very strongly to the offensive use of the terms &ldquo;landowners&rdquo; and &ldquo;elitist&rdquo;.  Many of these people come from families who <Col N="487" /> did a lot for this State.  I do not want to personalise this debate by mentioning their names.  Many fine people who may, in some circumstances, be regarded as different are nonetheless Irish people who give to this country and are entitled to be heard.  I strongly object to people chastising them because they take a different point of view from ours.  How can we ever hope to unite people in other parts of Ireland if we adopt that attitude here?</P>
    <P>If I remember the figure correctly, it is accepted by the Office of Public Works that we can only restore and maintain at most about 2 per cent of our stately homes because of a lack of resources. It seems strange that we are constantly preoccupied with building modern structures when there are so many fine old buildings around this country which can be restored.</P>
    <P>This legislation is a huge embarrassment to the Labour Party and I do not wish to add to that embarrassment.  I have huge personal regard for the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht but the Government, at a very early stage, placed him in an impossible position. It made his job very difficult indeed. I hope that he will be able to continue the fight to find a satisfactory resolution to many of these difficulties.  I cannot believe that people like the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, who has had a fantastic personal record in relation to the environment can be happy about what we are doing here today.</P>
    <P>For many months many Deputies, including myself, said as my party also said in our election manifesto, that the State will have to put itself on the same basis as everybody else when it comes to the planning process.  The State has to be the leader on the environment.  The State has to be the good environmentalist and must give example.  It has to go through the process.  When it does not do that, it brings the whole process into disrepute. I cannot see why the Minister, if he is committed to the State applying for planning permission, cannot accept the amendments.  From my party's point of <Col N="488" /> view, if any one of the amendments of the planning issue is acceptable to the Minister, we will support it.  Perhaps Deputy Gilmore's amendment, which is somewhat restrictive in that it presumably rules out matters relating to security and defence, which is not unreasonable, is acceptable to the Minister. If it is, it will be acceptable to my party.  I beg the Minister to accept this amendment.  I think he is going to destroy much of the work very successfully done by him and the last Government and indeed what will be done by this Government in the whole area of the environment. The director general and the directors of the Environmental Protection Agency are about to be appointed by the Government.  We will make difficult the work of that independent agency and many of the environmental concerns it pursues if we now decide that we are going to exempt for all time all State Departments and all Ministers of the Government from the necessary rigours of having to go through the planning process.  If developments are good, if they are being built to high standards, if they are following the best expertise, what is the Minister afraid of? He cannot suggest that our planning process is so difficult that he would not be able to come through.  If a commitment were given to go through that process now, it would go a long way towards taking much of the tension, bitterness and unnecessary fracas out of this whole debate.</P>
    <P>We are a small country and these interpretative centres are going into very small rural locations.  In years to come, whether these centres are built or not, people will have to live with each other. The memory of this whole saga will probably live on from family to family for quite some time.  I regret that very much, but we all know what campaigns such as this do.  We and those who are proposing these centres have a responsibility to try to end, once and for all, the kind of difficulty, tension and bitterness that exist.  We can do so by making a commitment that, from now on, all of these developments will be subject to the planning process and that the Government <Col N="489" /> will adhere to the spirit of what they tell us was intended by the programme for Government, although that is very weak. If that is done it will go a long way towards removing many of the difficulties that many of us have with this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendments before the House.  I would like to re-echo the sentiments expressed by Deputy Harney with regard to the necessity for tolerance in this debate.  It is regrettable that Members of the House have made targets of individuals or groups, whether or not they agree with them, who have courageously, with their own scarce resources, challenged the strong arm of the State and brought us to the current position.  The lack of tolerance and the lack of debate to date has been appalling. It is regrettable that it has invaded the Chamber.</P>
      <P>It is ironic that in the publication of the Book of Estimates today the Office of Public Works has its budget for purchase of sites and buildings reduced by 52 per cent.  What the Minister is intending to give to State authorities, and indeed to the Office of Public Works, with regard to power and authority he is certainly taking away with regard to finance.  All of us would prefer the situation where the Office of Public Works would be adequately financed but would also be subject to proper scrutiny and to the rigours of the planning law.  This Bill is about power and authority.  It has the taste of big brother and the strong arm of the State about it.  It is not tidying up legislation to deal with projects in the past or projects currently being undertaken. It is also about power and authority for the future.  This House is being asked to sign a blank cheque and to throw away its duty with regard to scrutiny of developments that are undreamt or unheard of at present.  It would be irresponsible of us to grant a <i>carte blanche</i> of that nature to any State authority, Ministers or officers in the Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some ways the Bill does not go far enough.  I regret that local authority developments are not subject to the planning <Col N="490" /> procedures as all individuals and State bodies should be.  We have many examples throughout the country of developments by State authorities, such as local Government bodies, county councils and corporations, which are in poor taste.  Not least of these is Wood Quay, which was controversial many years ago.  We also have throughout the country local authority housing estates which are a testimony to bad planning. It is absolutely imperative that the rights of local authorities as development agencies should also be called into question in debating this Bill.</P>
    <P>I did not get an opportunity to make a speech on Second Stage this morning.  I do not intend to make one now but I support the amendments tabled and appeal to the Minister to respond in a reasonable fashion to what are very reasonable amendments.</P>

      <P>I am glad, with all this demand for democracy, that the Government side of the House will be allowed a word.  Some of the long speeches certainly came from my left hand side.  The Government has decided to suspend work at the Boyne, in Wicklow and in Clare at the Burren.  This legislation is needed to allow work on 50 or more different projects to proceed so that given the employment content, the people involved may continue to do the work. Therefore, the high flown rhetoric we have heard about the Government using its heavy hand is nonsense.  The Bill was introduced to ensure that what we demanded throughout the general election should be allowed: that people should be given employment and that those in employment be allowed to continue. As a result of this Bill, a number of people who are in employment will not be added to the dole queue.  We have heard a lot of nonsense on this.  There is a great demand for the planning Acts here today.  I agree with Deputy McManus that County Wicklow is the most beautiful county in Ireland, but that is all I agree with her on.  It the most beautiful county perhaps because the Labour Party has always been represented there since the foundation of the State and we have maintained it very well.</P>

      <P>We will maintain that vigilance over the country because we have that interest.  I am glad to say my predecessor, who spent 44 years in this House, and I for my 24 years have endeavoured with vigour to maintain that county in its pristine state.  I have never moved a section 4 exemption in Wicklow County Council to have a house built where it should not be built.  I hope all of us from Wicklow can say that.  I am not one who has signed section 4 exemptions and I will not do so.  I do not require medals, but I do not want anybody lecturing me.  Perhaps people who are making a lot of fuss should look up the record at where section 4 exemptions <Col N="492" /> have been put down in Wicklow County Council and who has signed them.</P>
      <P>Let us now deal with the Planning Acts.  We in Wicklow had to hold a planning meeting of the council once a month, at some expense to the council, because of the number of planning applications that have come into the council.  Planning is an executive function of the manager; it is not a function of the county council. Therefore, when we talk about the Planning Acts we are not extending democracy because planning is an executive function of the manager, not a function of the county council.  When we talk about Planning Acts we are not talking about extending democracy to the members of the council.  We are asking that decisions be handed over to the executive of the council and its planning sections.  We have the opportunity in Wicklow to look at all the decisions being made and all those being refused.  Therefore, we are not very upset by this demand for an extension of the Planning Act because we have had the problem on occasion of having to refuse applications in order to protect the environment.</P>

I am delighted with their work in Glendalough where there is an award winning centre. If such a proposals was made now the same groups would say &ldquo;Glendalough is going to be ruined.  Glendalough will never be the same and we will attract too many people there.&rdquo;  The Eco-tourism idea that certain people look at special buildings, as is the case in Greece, Rome and elsewhere, where a certain few are allowed to see the magnificent buildings while everbody else is kept out, is, unfortunately, happening in Wicklow.  Deputy Harney expressed concern about Wicklow and the sewerage system there but I wish she had answered me when I looked for money for sewerage facilities for the area.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>What is very clear from the debate so far is that very complex issues need to be addressed.  A very detailed debate is necessary to discuss solutions to those complex issues and in many ways the approach of the Government to these problems is completely <Col N="495" /> wrong.  We need to look at different options as to how these complex issues should best be addressed.  There should be full and reasoned debate and there should be time for pause and reflection. Arising out of that process with the co-operation of the Opposition there is a possibility of finding a reasonable solution. That is not going to happen from what has occurred in this House today. Today is a bad day for democracy.  What we have is a presentation from a Government which is clearly ridden by internal dissension on what should be done and which has engaged in juggernaut politics to ramrod through a solution to cover that dissension.  That is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>I came into this House at 9.15 a.m. and looked for a copy of the Bill which we were expected to put through this House today but I could not get one.  I have been in this House for nearly 16 years and I cannot accept that it is democratic politics to expect us, the elected representatives, to deal with a Bill in this fashion.  One does not have time to consider the Bill properly and certainly sufficient time is not being given to address the issues properly.</P>
      <P>We are dealing today not only with Mullaghmore but with much wider problems. On the one hand, our approach suggests that a State Department, particularly the Office of Public Works, is the essence of all goodness in relation to planning and conservation and on the other hand there are accusations that it is the essence of everything that is wrong with that.  While we have great praise for those who are in what is loosely termed the green lobby and are prepared to battle in a David and Goliath fashion against the State, either through the planning process or the court, to achieve victory, that is only codswallop for somebody who is interested in the development of this country.  I represent the ordinary citizen who is the ham in the sandwich in all this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work of the Office of Public Works has received universal praise.  The main complaint is that it is so slow in getting a job done.  Certainly the craftsmanship it <Col N="496" /> employs and the taste and sensitivity we have come to expect from it is there and generally it is doing a fine job, but whether its political masters have adopted the right course in relation to what is clearly a very sensitive issue is another question.  I do not believe they have.  The Office of Public Works has been placed in the middle of a dispute in Mullaghmore and other centres throughout the country, which they would be as well to avoid until their political masters have cleared the road for them.</P>
    <P>There is need for some form of process or tribunal which would enable interested parties to present a reasoned view to serious development issues of this kind. One point which Deputy Kavanagh touched on without going into detail is the view of the local people who are interested in jobs.  This brings us back to the age old problem of the time before the Planning Acts, before the town and country development Acts of 1932 and the question of the resolution of the conflict between those who favour development for jobs and those who want to conserve the environment.  There has to be some way of resolving that conflict and we have not come up with the proper procedures to do so.  This Bill before us today will not do so.  The amendments which are going to be rejected would not totally achieve that aim but they would form part of the process.  Developments of this kind and indeed industrial developments should be subjected to a process where all parties could make a reasonable case and which ultimately would lead to a resolution.</P>
    <P>Part of the unemployment problem, which is exemplified by the recent Sandoz development in Cork, is that there is no end to the development process.  I do not prejudge whether certain developments should go ahead.  What I am saying is that our present processes are inadequate for those who want to engage in industrial or touristic development.  This issue is not addressed in the Bill or in the amendments. I support the amendment which proposes that State Departments, and &mdash; as my colleague, Deputy Ó Cúiv said &mdash; local authorities be subject to the planning <Col N="497" /> process.  That is not the ultimate answer.  The Government should take on board the broader issue.  The Minister might even consider preparing some form of Green Paper or White Paper on this whole issue.  Indeed, there could be an investigation as to the extent our horrendous unemployment figures are related to the fact that the proper process is not in place.</P>
    <P>I do not support the building of outrageous developments in the middle of tourist beauty spots, thereby destroying the environment.  As a result of the green lobby in recent years people in these areas have become environmentally sensitive in their approach, and this is to the advantage of environmentalists.  The State, particularly the Government, has been too slow to react to these developments. We are now floundering around trying to find solutions with processes that are utterly inadequate.</P>
    <P>Let us take comfort from the fact that at least we have been given the opportunity to say a few words on this issue. Let us appreciate the work to date of the Office of Public Works and the green lobby.  Let us understand that there are complex problems to which we do not have solutions.  In particular let us understand that the Bill before the House and the amendments do not in any way resolve those problems.  There should be a commitment from the Government that those problems will be addressed so that in time to come we will not be faced with similar difficulties to those we are faced with now.  Those who are prepared to engage in industrial, touristic or State development should operate by the rules and procedures to be followed.  Unless that is done there will be a huge waste of public funds.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day the lack of proper process will be paid for by the European or Irish taxpayer, or a combination of both.  Ultimately, when the media light is directed elsewhere, the people who will lose are those in areas such as Mullaghmore. These had hoped to find some future for themselves and their children but are now in the middle of a national controversy with, as they call it, a hole <Col N="498" /> in the ground.  We must find a resolution to that problem soon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>It is absurd to say that I, on behalf of the Green Party, or any other Member of the Opposition simply talks in defence of elitist groups.  It is also absurd to say that this Bill is an attack on elitist groups.  The only elitist group involved here is the Cabinet and members of the Office of Public Works who choose to operate without reference to local democracy.  That is the only elitist group which is at issue here and is being defended in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I support the three amendments to section 1.  I will not refer to my amendment as it is not relevant to the debate at the moment.  In relation to planning, as opposed to what the Taoiseach has said, this Bill deals with a much wider issue than simply the Office of Public Works. It must be borne in mind that people all around the country who have nothing to do with interpretative centres or Office of Public Works activities are looking very closely at this Bill.  I refer in particular to people in my constituency, particularly the St. Margaret's area, who live in close proximity to Dublin Airport. A similar ruling applies in this regard in that the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications can decide to extend the runway with no statutory regard for the welfare of people living nearby.  In the case of airports in other European countries &mdash; for example, Schipol Airport &mdash; the Minister for Transport there is obliged to buy and demolish houses, relocate people, provide adequate insulation and ultimately face up to responsibilities.</P>
      <P>In the private sector the management at Farranfore Airport is looking very closely at this matter.  They have to apply to extend the runway and comply with very stringent restrictions imposed by An Board Pleanála with regard to night time flying, sound insulation and many other issues.  We must bear in mind that this Bill has very wide-ranging implications, particularly in the area of planning, which are addressed in the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to point out that the <Col N="499" /> constitutionality of this Bill has to be clarified.  We talk about cherishing the nation's children equally.  I assume we can include adults in that.  We must bear in mind that as certain activities need planning permission and others do not. It appears that under this Bill inequality is being perpetrated.  This is a very important aspect of the Bill which is unrelated to the interpretative centres and particularly Office of Public Works activities.</P>
    <P>The democratic factor has been mentioned here a number of times.  We are not talking about the elite &mdash; for example, the people who took the court action were farmers, teachers and an unemployed person.  How can we talk about the elite in this regard?  We are talking about people who are brave and courageous enough not simply to speak out, to write a speech or to publish a letter in a paper but to mortgage everything they own and face the prospects of being financially milked by the State if costs are awarded against them.  They are people deserving of admiration simply for the stand they are taking.  Whatever we may say about the cause or whether these people are right or wrong, the fact that they have strong convictions about this matter means they are very special people.  I must point out that for a long time citizens have been forced into the High Court to defend basic rights which are being railroaded or overturned by the State.  I have in mind the Carrowmore passage-grave case in 1989 where there was a similar occurrence.</P>
    <P>The scandal of the law forcing people to incur such expense needs to be addressed but it has not been in this Bill.  A basic principle in the Green Party is that decisions should be taken at the lowest effective level.  If that principle is to be upheld &mdash; I believe it is reasonable because it involves the democratic principle in the most comprehensive way &mdash; we need to look at how this Bill can incorporate basic planning procedures.</P>
    <P>We are talking about enacting enabling legislation.  The Bill is referring to an elite but not the elite referred to by those on <Col N="500" /> the Government benches.  They need to look into their own hearts to see what it means.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for many of our laws to take EC Directives into account. That has not been the case and is reflected in the present predicament.  There are EC Directives on ground water waiting to be transposed into Irish law which would have major implications for the development of Luggala.  These would allow for closer scrutiny of the conditions even without planning permission being sought.  Because of the Government's desire to act on this question it is showing disregard for other, equally urgent questions.</P>
    <P>The three amendments should be considered. The Government should accommodate some aspect of the planning procedure because it gives people a consultative role.  Even though it may be an executive function at local authority level, it allows for consultation which at present is not allowed in relation to the proposed interpretative centres.  It must be made clear that it is not a question of saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to interpretative centres as some people think but rather that the location must be appropriate.  If that can be understood then we will make progress with some members on the Government benches.  I support the amendments in regard to the planning aspects of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>This rushed Bill and indeed, this debate will not solve the serious problem of our planning laws. The Office of Public Works should require planning permission for whatever works it wishes to carry out.  When replying perhaps the Minister would clarify whether an Irish citizen has the same rights as a non-Irish citizen to object to planning matters?  Does the construction of a golf course require planning permission? Does a a farmer require planning permission to drain his land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before us arose out of the High Court ruling on the Office of Public Works site at Mullaghmore.  All aspects of planning must be brought before this House, not in a confined but in an open-ended <Col N="501" /> debate, where Members of this House, from their experience as public representatives, would be able to put their views regarding planning matters on the record of the House.</P>
    <P>I visited the Mullaghmore site on Sunday last.  I did not meet any other public representatives there and I do not know how many of the contributors to the debate have visited that site.  As a lay person I consider it an ideal site for an interpretative centre.  It was not the site I had seen several times on my television screen where the interpretative centre appeared to be on Mullaghmore mountain. When I visited the area I discovered that the site was not on Mullaghmore mountain, but on a partly disused quarry well separated from Mullaghmore mountain by rough grassy land and certainly not on the Burren which was the public perception.  There must be consultation about such matters but I would be very sceptical if planning permissions and rights of objection were bogged down in the current appeals board system.  The system is too slow and cumbersome and is frustrating for people who wish to proceed with genuine developments.  It often results in people not being willing to go through this process.</P>
    <P>During my visit to Mullaghmore I observed that feelings are running very high.  It reminded me of the famous rod licence dispute in my own constituency about two years ago.  This cannot be good for any community.  I met only people who are in favour of proceeding with the interpretative centre, presumably because they outnumber the objectors by about nine to one.  When this type of crux arises in a local community the bad will generated damages the community concerned. In this regard there should be a set procedure in planning law.  This rushed Bill may solve the immediate problem but it will not solve the overall problem throughout the country where communities have to deal with similar problems.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sargent referred to the courage of people who go through the courts to object to what they perceive as undesirable developments.  I have great <Col N="502" /> sympathy for those people but I am a little sceptical of people who set themselves up in trust to carry out an objection. I have no objection to a person who feels strongly enough and stands up on their own to object but the setting up of trusts for the purpose of objecting to this kind of development should be examined. This matter cannot be discussed in this debate but it must be examined in the overall aspect of planning.</P>
    <P>Perhaps all this tension and debate in a community like Mullaghmore could be avoided if the Office of Public Works was required to go through the same planning process as everybody else.  In the long run I suspect this would solve some of the problems that have arisen in this case. I have given my views on what I have observed when I visited the area and I have yet to be convinced of the validity of the objections to this site.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned that the effect of the amendments tabled on section 1 will determine and weaken the provisions of this Bill and render them ineffective, leaving the Office of Public Works in an even weaker position than heretofore.  It is understandable that people take their present view because, having listened to a large number of speakers, I am amazed &mdash; perhaps I should not be &mdash; that so many misunderstand the position in the community near Mullaghmore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh's contribution illustrated his view of the situation in Wicklow and I very much agree with him in presenting my view as that of a member of the community near Mullaghmore. Deputies are misled if they think that a huge number of the community in north Clare or in the Clare area generally are in a pitched battle with the Office of Public Works; the vast majority of people strongly support the Office of Public Works proposals.  There is also a perception that Clare County Council at executive and elected level has in some way been left out of the process &mdash; that is also untrue.  Section 84 is 100 times tougher than the ordinary planning procedure in that the Office of Public Works <Col N="503" /> in a sense is being told: &ldquo;you have been sent to climb Mount Everest, you have almost made it to the top but we have changed the rules in the meantime. Nobody got killed or injured in the process but still we would like you to start all over again&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am encouraged by Deputy McCormack's contribution because he has the advantage of living near the area.  He comes from a similar rural background and understands the social and community implications of the controversy that rages.  It is incumbent on all of us to ensure, in so far as possible, that it does not get out of hand.  I was pleased with the meeting last Monday night, those who favour the centre generally have at all times been well behaved and I intend to use my influence to ensure that that continues to be the case.  However, the Bill seeks to enable the Office of Public Works to maintain and manage public buildings and properties and is of particular importance and interest in my area.  I should explain briefly that the State intends buying 6,000 acres there and has already bought 3,000 acres.  It is merely making provision for public access to the park; to facilitate this it proposes to build a visitors' centre.  It has followed all the rules and regulations applied heretofore to the letter of the law.  It is important that the Office of Public Works is empowered to carry out these functions and to acquire the further lands as planned.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the effect of the amendments tabled would be to set back the Office of Public Works, not just in this project, but in all its other work and to render them virtually useless.  From my local knowledge I can say that there are excellent relations between the Office of Public Works and the local land owners.  I appreciate the enormous contribution local landowners made to the conservation of the Burren and the welcome they traditionally extended to all comers.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, one of the inevitable effects of the environmental extremism, implicit in statements by members of An <Col N="504" /> Taisce and by some of the objectors, is that ordinary people who would be environmentally friendly and highly responsible are being alienated and that is not in anybody's interest.  Many ordinary people have adopted an attitude to extreme environmentalism which is unhelpful.  For instance, landowners feel their hospitality to visitors has been abused and they resent the gratuitous insulting comments of some of the people mentioned by Deputy O'Donoghue earlier today.  In showing their support for the centre they are considering excluding all comers from their properties pending the completion of the centre.  Leminagh Castle which was one of the possible alternative locatons is no longer acceptable to the general public.  Several farmers who have sold the existing 3,000 acres of the national park are taking legal advice with a view to recovering ownership of their lands.</P>
    <P>In any event the current controversy is undermining the Burren national park and today's legislation is an attempt to put the Office of Public Works back on the rails legally.  What is happening is causing severe damage to the cause of conservation in the Burren.  All members have an obligation to ensure that their contributions do not worsen the position. I call on people to stop talking down to the ordinary residents of the Burren and to listen to their views.</P>
    <P>As I said I can identify closely with Deputy Kavanagh's views which I heard previously on radio in relation to the Luggala centre.  I did not hear Deputy Fitzgerald's contribution but I suspect from what somebody else said about him that I would also agree with its thrust.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, but I oppose the amendments to the section on the grounds that they would undermine the effects of the Bill, especially in the short term, and totally diminish the role of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnnyFox" hpid="Mr. J. Fox Mr. J. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>I can hardly be described as elitist.  I am not a member of the green lobby.  I am a farmer's son from the Luggala area of Wicklow where an interpretative centre is being built.  My family have <Col N="505" /> been in the area for five or six generations, my father and grandfather both having worked as road workers with Wicklow County Council.  That would put the lie to an idea that I am speaking on behalf of any elitest group.  Deputy Kavanagh mentioned, and on occasions I take it he was pointing the finger at me, that people have been involved in moving the odd section.  I did it to try to maintain a roof over the heads of many of the local people when the Wicklow County Council planners would not grant planning permission for one house in the area where the Luggala centre is to be located. It is absurd to talk of proper planning in connection with the Burren and Luggala visitor centres.  I appreciate Deputy Kavanagh's view and others which do not necessarily coincide with mine.  However, I take exception to the emotive language and terminology used by some previous speakers in the House to lay blame at the door of those who have a bona fide right to object.  They should be afforded the right to do so without being subjected to such rhetoric.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the Government parties will include in their next general election manifesto but it cannot possibly have anything to do with the environment. In this two and a half hours debate on an emergency Bill about three out of 101 Government Deputies spoke. Anybody with that track record who tries to sell to the general public the idea that they are really interested in the environment will not be believed.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the 100 years old law under which the Office of Public Works has operated in the provision of ordinary buildings such as Garda barracks, Army barracks and Government buildings, which have been well constructed and well maintained, is being replaced by an equally outdated, outmoded and draconian law which gives no right to the general public to make observations or object if the need arises. We are supposed to have a law for all but in this case it is clearly a law for some, and that is something neither I nor any fair minded Deputy could support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="506" /> The outcome of today's vote is obvious.  When the bells ring Deputies will come in and vote without having listened to the debate.  A similar intransigent attitude was adopted by the Office of Public Works in relation to the visitor centres at the Burren and particularly Luggala.  The county development plan submitted to Wicklow County Council and the people of Wicklow had to be advertised, voted on by the local authority and sent back for further scrutiny before being finalised.  Everything had to be done according to the letter of the law.  Yet, with one stroke of a pen, we contravene the Planning Act and the county development plan just because there is £2.5 million or £3 million in a pot in Europe that has to be spent.  That is the only argument for the visitor centres at the Burren and Luggala &mdash; the money has to be spent.  It is a sad day for democracy when we cannot adhere to the county development plans which have been teased out by professionals and put together so meticulously.  There is no professional opinion on planning or sanitation which supports the site at Luggala.</P>
    <P>There is concern about the sewerage system for the new centre at Luggala which it is envisaged will have 16,000 visitors per year.  The centre is located in the catchment area of the Roundwood reservoir which provides Dublin's water supplies.  If one bungalow was to be erected in that area Dublin Corporation would object.  Yet, the Office of Public Works have not produced any suitable solution; they have merely said they will address the problem when it arises.  The problem of the location of this centre so close to the Roundwood reservoir has not been addressed professionally.  The Trinity Study Group, commissioned by Wicklow County Council at a cost of £10,000 to the taxpayer, was firmly in favour of relocating the centre, but its view was ignored.</P>
    <P>This will be a dim, dark day for democracy if we steamroll a Bill such as this into law.  I appeal to the Government to reconsider the Bill having regard for everybody's rights and to our beautiful environment.  Our children will not thank <Col N="507" /> us for destroying the environment.  As a previous speaker said, we have one chance to preserve in perpetuity our natural environment, but if this Bill is passed that opportunity will be lost.</P>

      <P>In reply to some of the points raised I will make a few general comments.  The first relates to a word that has been used frequently in the House on this matter, that is &ldquo;elite&rdquo;.  As one who is almost a member of the Cabinet it is nice to be told I am a member of the elite.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the first time I was told I was a member of an elite group. To go back to what I said on Second Stage, this Bill is not about planning but rather about the issue raised by the High Court decision that the Office of Public Works and, by implication, all other State bodies, do not have a right to build and maintain buildings and so on.  It is that matter rather then the planning issue that is addressed in the Bill.  I have no doubt that if I came into this House with a Bill that attempted to address that aspect of the judge's decision I would be rounded on by various Members and told I was trying to circumvent Supreme Court decisions, that this was not the way to proceed and that these issues should be tackled by the planning laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with great interest to the debate on planning and the ideas put forward by Members from all sides.  Six or seven good ideas on planning were put forward on how the State might be more amenable to planning laws.  I think it was Deputy Connor who suggested that public inquiries be initiated rather than going through the ordinary planning process. <Col N="508" /> Other ideas were mentioned that deserve consideration.  These would involve fundamental changes which will be considered in the context of the Government's commitments in the Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>I note that Deputies opposite, whether deliberately or otherwise, continually quoted the Costello judgment and the planning element of that decision.  There is another judgment, the Lynch judgment, which is directly contrary to the Costello judgment.  I sincerely say to Deputies opposite that the Government, in asking the Supreme Court to adjudicate on two conflicting High Court decisions on the same matter, has adopted a reasonable position.  In the light of the judgment made, legislation will be framed in relation to planning.  I know there are arguments against this decision but it is reasonable to wait and see what the Supreme Court decides.  In light of that decision and the commitment in the Programme for Government, we will bring forward legislation.  I said on Second Stage in reply to Deputy Cox that I would try to get a commitment on a timeframe for planning legislation and I repeat&mdash;it is not easy to be specific about this &mdash; that as soon as possible after the Supreme Court decision is made legislation will be brought forward by the Minister for the Environment.  In my role as Government Chief Whip I give a categoric commitment to the House that when the Bill is passed it will receive priority.  The other Whips can then pursue the matter with me.  As soon as the Bill is published and a reasonable length of time is given for consultation with the other Whips, I will bring it to the Floor of this House.  There will be no undue delay in that regard and I will stand over that commitment.</P>
    <P>There may be some slight repetition in this but I want to try to address most of the points made.  I have addressed the point made by many Deputies in relation to planning and why we need to go this route.  As I said on Second Stage &mdash; I am not going to labour the point and this is not an attempt to beat anybody over the head on this matter &mdash; there are jobs at <Col N="509" /> risk at present in relation to the question of whether the Office of Public Works or State bodies have the right or the power to build.  I deem that to be an emergency. If people opposite argue otherwise we will just have to agree to disagree on that subject.</P>
    <P>Deputies McDowell and Gilmore made the point that this Bill gives unfettered approval to any Minister to build all over the place, whether it is in relation to nuclear stations or toxic dumps, but that is not so.  Admittedly there is control, although maybe not as strong as we would wish by the Minister for Finance. Anybody who has sat around the Cabinet table with the Minister for Finance &mdash; I am not just talking about the present Minister &mdash; will know it is most difficult to get approval from that Minister for any project involving expenditure.</P>

      <P>Deputy McDowell gave examples of Ministers who were totally unfettered by controls.  He had to go back to the sixties and seventies to get examples of &ldquo;destruction&rdquo; caused by Ministers.  I am not going to argue the points made in relation to some of those decisions, but I would point out to the Deputy, and I am sure he will accept this, that there is a much more enlightened attitude at present than was the case at that time.  I am not casting reflection on former Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dáil reform was mentioned as was the matter of putting this Bill through in one day.  This is a principle I do not favour and is one that I, as Chief Whip, will ensure will not be followed, but I regard this Bill as an emergency.  It deals with a very serious matter and that is why it had to be taken today.  When talking about Dáil reform, maybe the Opposition could look into their own hearts and find the good grace not to turn the Order of Business <Col N="510" /> every morning into a mini-Question Time on many matters that are totally out of order.  If there is a little give and take on both sides some improvement could be made by way of Dáil reform.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Doyle also asked in relation to projects that are ongoing, the type of projects that might be affected if this Bill <Col N="515" /> was not put through the House.  We are talking about a total of about 50 projects. All of the Office of Public Works projects, all State projects, would be affected if the Bill did not go through.  As an example of that there are a couple of social welfare exchanges, one in the Navan Road, one in Tallaght.

      <P>I have dealt with Deputy O'Donnell's inquiry about section 84 procedures.  In case people have the view that the Office of Public Works untramelled can run roughshod over local county development plans and so on, that is not the case.  Under the section 84 procedure all standards that the local authority have regarding fire regulation, waste disposal, effluent and lighting have to be complied with and if they are not complied with then you have a situation where there is an appeal to the Minister for the Environment. He has the final determining power at that particular point in time.</P>

    <P>Some Deputies talked about a lack of consultation.  I have personal experience and I am not going to recount.  Deputy Fitzgerald did it earlier on.  I have personal experience of the consultation process which took place in Meath in relation to the Boyne centre.  Deputy Killeen has personal experience of the process that took place in Clare.  I outlined it earlier on in the House in my Second Stage speech.  I do not want anybody to run away with the notion that this was steamrolled through and nobody knew what <Col N="516" /> was happening anywhere.  That is an unfair point to be making and it does not stand up to scrutiny.</P>
    <P>In relation to remarks made by the information officer of the Office of Public Works, I understand that the article was written by Mr. Flynn pre-Christmas, was not used until lately and he was asked to do that and he did that on a personal basis.</P>

      <P>Let me refer to some of the points Deputy Harney made in the <Col N="517" /> course of her remarks.  Deputy Harney said that presumably if the Supreme Court judges in one way we will see very little of the Government's proposals. Her presumption is wrong.  It is notable that Deputy Harney was Minister with responsibility for environmental protection of three years almost and I am not aware of any proposals she made in this area, to Government or anybody else, to try to improve the situation in relation to the&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I did make a submission to the Government during the review of the Programme for Government.  My party sought to have agreement on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not bring any proposals to the House in relation to this matter.  The high moral tone that the Deputy has adopted and the use of the word dishonest with which she so much berated the Taoiseach does not befit the Deputy.  It it is not fitting she should use it in the House in relation to the Taoiseach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps this is a good time to refer to what Deputy Creed said in the course of his remarks.  He mentioned about tolerance and so on.  So maybe this is a good time to say that I wholeheartedly agree with his approach. There is a need for tolerance and I would have to say that so far in the debate, apart <Col N="518" /> from one or two little lapses, there has been quite a level of tolerance on all sides and a very sincere effort to address problems that have arisen as a result of the decisions.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe mentioned about conflict and the need to keep it outside the House in relation to this.  There are very serious issues which have been raised in relation to the both matters, in relation to the right to build and the right to planning.  I reiterate that in relation to the amendments before us they are more proper to a planning and development Bill that will be brought to this House and they are not proper to this Bill before us.  I will not be accepting them.</P>
      <P>If I could just refer to them individually, amendment No. 1 can be dealt with and I dealt with it in the context that it has been referred to and is a matter that is coming before the Supreme Court. It has already been announced that we are referring that matter to the Supreme Court.  I cannot really understand amendment No. 3 because the Bill itself has no links to the Planning Acts and the phrase &ldquo;in Planning Acts&rdquo; does not appear in the Bill.  In relation to amendment No. 10, this Bill does not tamper with or alter in any way the application of the Planning Acts as now interpreted by the courts, or as will be interpreted by the Supreme Court, nor does it purport to amend any other Acts.  On that basis I regret I will not be accepting these amendments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 is in my name and I would have liked to have <Col N="519" /> had a division on it.  I am not prepared to waste the only remaining quarter of an hour on a division.  It is regrettable that we have only got as far as amendment No. 1.  It was inevitable because of the circumstances under which this debate is being held.  The Second Stage debate amounted to little more than an hour and a half this morning.  Any time that a Second Stage debate is curtailed to that extent inevitably the debate on Committee Stage, and particularly on the first amendment, becomes a <i>de facto</i> Second Stage debate and people are inclined to say what they have said if they had been allowed to speak on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>I might add now &mdash; because I was not aware of this or adverted to it when I spoke on Second Stage very briefly &mdash; that there are significant changes in the Bill as published this morning in the green print from the white print that was distributed to some Deputies late last evening.  This is regrettable.  A number of us did a lot of work on this Bill overnight. We were entitled to assume that the Bill as published this morning would be the same as the advance copy we were given last night.  This has proved not to be the case.  I have not had an opportunity to assess the full meaning of the changes that were made but undoubtedly they seem to be of some significance.  It does not augur well for co-operation in this House that something of that kind should happen.  I do not recall it happening before or, if a change had to be made, the Opposition were told that a change was made in the Bill and why.  This was done surreptitiously and it was not drawn to anybody's attention so far as I am aware.  It certainly was not drawn to my attention.  That is a matter of some regret.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a great pity that there are quite a number of amendments of importance and substance remaining on today's Order Paper which obviously are not now going to be reached.  It is deplorable that a Bill that is as wide-ranging as this and will have enormous effects way beyond Mullaghmore or Luggala or anywhere else, should go through in such an extraordinary short time by means of a guillotine <Col N="520" /> by a Government that has a majority of 40 and intends that we on this side of the House and, indeed, the whole country will know that they have a majority of 40.  I know that some members of the Labour Party came in here to support some aspects of this Bill today.  I also know that the great majority of members of the Labour Party are very much opposed to what is going on.  I wish they would make their views known.  I am sure they must disapprove of it just as the rest of us do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>To my knowledge, the only changes that may have occurred &mdash; and I cannot confirm this &mdash; in this Bill in the green form are what are called tidying up changes.  There was no significant change in it.  If the Deputy is insinuating that some member of the House staff or some members of the Attorney General's office or somebody else changed this Bill significantly, it is a disgraceful kind of comment and should not be let stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that the Bill was changed.  It was changed in a number of respects and not only one.  It certainly was not changed by any member of the House staff, nor did I suggest that, nor would they do it.  It was changed obviously by somebody under the direction of the Minister.  The Minister should take responsibility for that.  He need not assume that every time somebody criticises something that is done one is simply criticising officials.  That is not the case. Officials are not responsible for the mess that the Board of Works finds itself in today and for the neccessity for the Government to come in and seek to have this legislation guillotined through the House.  The Minister and his predecessor are responsible for the situation that now exists.  He should not, as some others do, seek to take refuge behind officials.  I am not criticising any officials.  I am criticising the Minister of State and the Government.</P>

Out of courtesy to Members of the Opposition and the Whips a white version of what was proposed was circulated &mdash; a limited circulation. That is the only Bill.  If the Deputy wishes to make an issue of something that was done out of courtesy to him and his party that is fine.  The next time the Deputy will wait for the Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 2, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;1.&mdash;(1)  Nothwithstanding anything contained in this Act or in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 to 1992, no State authority shall be exempt from a general obligation to seek and obtain planning permission in respect of any construction or development which, if undertaken by any other body, company or individual, would require such permission.</P>

      <P>In page 2, subsection (1), line 17, to delete &ldquo;A&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Upon the commencement of this Act, a&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to deal with something of a fiction.  The subsection states that the State authority shall have and be deemed always to have had all such incidental, supplemental and ancillary and consequential powers as, in the opinion of the authority, are necessary or expedient for the purpose of the exercise by it of the powers aforesaid. Mr. Justice Costello, in regard to this legislation which allowed the Office of Public Works the authority or the right to build in the first instance, found that there was not a legislative authority and I agree with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to take up the time of the House with a history lecture but it is interesting to note that the basis of the Office of Public Works being involved in construction seems to go back to the Public Works Act, 1831.  A Bill was proposed in 1830 that would include the public buildings, etc. but because of the famine in 1831 the Public Works Act was rushed through the House of Commons in London.  Basically, it seemed to allocate a sum of £500 to the Public Works Commissioners in Ireland for the relief of distress and afterwards the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland wrote to the old barracks commissioners because it appears that they were to be replaced by these new Public Work Commissioners. He informed them, rather vaguely, that they too could be responsible for the <Col N="524" /> upkeep of military barracks etc., throughout the country.  Hence, by precedent more than by an arrogant assumption of certain authority, the Office of Public Works took on to itself a whole range of authorities which apparently it legally never had.  It is arrogant, that this legislation should fly in the face of what has been found to be illegal and unconstitutional by Mr. Justice Costello.  For that reason I have tabled this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief because we are all anxious to get to amendment No. 8.  In supporting my colleague and in speaking to section 2, could I ask the Minister, in relation to subsection (5), the definition of &ldquo;development&rdquo;, meaning &ldquo;the carrying out of works in or under land or making any material change in the use of any structures or other land&rdquo;. What is the position of work carried out by the State under water?  We have very interesting areas of archaeological sites under water and marine archaeology generally. Also what is the position of harbours and portal development?  Much of it, particularly extensions to same, are now under water as well.  They would come under the responsibility of the Minister for the Marine and the Minister for the Environment.  Are both those areas excluded from this Bill and, if so, why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to amendment No. 7, if the words &ldquo;and be deemed always to have had&rdquo;, are not deleted, then this Bill certainly cannot be used in relation to the three interpretative centres which are the subject of litigation because a decision has been given in the case of one of them and decisions are pending in the case of the other two.  For that reason I explained very briefly this morning, the courts will not countenance any attempt by this House, the Oireachtas or the Government to change the law retrospectively in the case of any issue or matter which is the subject of litigation.  If the Minister of State does not accept either amendment No. 7 or amendment No. 8 &mdash; amendment No. 8 <Col N="525" /> is really to the same effect as amendment No. 7 but is drafted in a different way &mdash; this Bill when enacted cannot be used to support the development at these three places.  We are given to believe that the reason the Bill is being brought in particularly is to support and legalise the existing illegal developments at these three places.  It shows what a farce this whole procedure is and the danger of trying to ram something like this through the House without its being properly debated.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - GATT Negotiations: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Yates on Tuesday, 16 February 1993:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann reaffirms its opposition to the proposed GATT deal as it is currently framed in view of the prospect of reducing gross agricultural output by 5 per cent and as it extends beyond the level of volume and value restrictions on agricultural output agreed by the Council of Agriculture Ministers in June 1992, as part of Common Agricultural Policy reform; and calls on the Government to ensure that Ireland's vital national interest and employment are protected before these proposals are ratified.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann fully supports the efforts of the Government in its defence of Ireland's vital agriculture and food interests in the ongoing GATT negotiations.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>As I said last night, the situation is pretty grim in relation to the GATT negotiations.  In my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan dairying is the most important source of income, not just for the farmers but for the whole area, co-ops and industry included.  Over the last ten years more than 50 per cent of farmers have been forced out of dairying.  That was before Common Agricultural Policy or GATT.  Obviously, if the current GATT agreement is allowed to go through in its present form that exodus will continue and will mean that young farmers will not be able to get into production and the damage to rural life will be major, not only in Cavan-Monaghan but throughout Ireland.</P>
      <P>I mentioned last night that there was no curtailment of production in the USA, Australia or New Zealand. However, we must remember that Eastern Europe produces almost twice as much as EC countries and there is no curtailment there either.  In fact, maybe some of these areas will become part of the EC and that will cause their own problems.  It must be taken into account that in the agreement in 1983 which brought in the milk quotas there was a stipulation that if extra milk quotas were to be given Ireland would get its fair share and would be treated as a priority area.  However, this year under and Irish Commissioner for Agriculture, Ray MacSharry, the Italians benefited by obtaining an increase of 10 per cent on their quota and at the same time Ireland had to take a decrease.  Under the present GATT proposals that decrease could be a further 5 per cent over the next five or six years.  This is something we cannot allow to happen.  This Government must treat the present situation as a very serious one for the small and medium sized milk producers and must oppose the GATT proposals in the strongest possible way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="530" /> In recent days we have been informed that farmers have had an 18.5 per cent increase in their incomes.  Of course, we were wise in asking from what base that increase occurred.  With the increase in sheep numbers which Minister O'Kennedy encouraged, there has been the total failure of this Government to provide adequate safeguards for sheep producers and, more recently, the total failure of this Government to handle the currency crisis has resulted in total loss of faith in the Minister's and Government's ability to deal with the EC, not to mention international GATT agreements.</P>
    <P>In relation to the meat industry, the Irish Commissioner, Ray MacSharry, allowed a rule to be brought in that stops animals over 340 kilos being accepted into intervention.  While we have negotiated some extension to the introduction of this rule it will militate against policy production of cattle, especially from the suckler herd, which we have been trying to encourage.  As a former committee chairman, with others, I encouraged the introduction of continental type cattle. This means simply we will not be able to afford to bring them into proper weights to meet the different marketplaces because, if the market is not there on a given day, intervention will not be available and that is the only safeguard.  With regard to heifer meat, from 1947 until about 1989 we had a special arrangement with our colleagues in the UK.  For instance, from 1973, when we entered the EC, the UK value of a premium paid on both heifers and steer meat going into the UK was mainly financed by the UK budget.  This was in place until our own Commissioner, Ray MacSharry, had it abolished which now means, first, we have no support for heifers and, second, &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>He has left Sligo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we do not have special opportunities in the UK that we had all those years for meat in general. In fact, we are now in open competition with German bull beef and all other meat from outside the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="531" /> It is interesting to look at sheets from 1982, heifers were making 94p per pound in July of that year and the cost of slaughtering for ten heifers was £13.75.  Perhaps that would be a reasonable price this year but the stoppage per beast is a lot higher now than it was in 1982.  While the heifer price may be reasonable at present one does not have to stretch one's imagination too far to realise what will happen with an extra couple of hundred thousand steers being forced onto the market if the GATT proposals are allowed to go through.</P>
    <P>Again, we may not be able to dispose of heifers at all; maybe in the west we will but not in the rest of the country. This is the sort of problem that the Minister, the Tánaiste and every other member of the Government must treat seriously.  We must make sure that the GATT agreement now proposed does not and will not stop Irish farmers, especially young farmers, remaining in business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a few brief points in relation to this fundamentally important motion.  First, for years we have prided ourselves on our instructions to farmers and directions from advisory services to use and to breed the best possible cattle.  Breeding pedigree cattle from better quality bulls has meant production of bigger carcases.  The weight limit of 340 kilogrammes will certainly very much limit access to the intervention market for the kind of cattle that would be produced from all the instructions over the years.  It is a very negative and retrograde step to contemplate this.</P>
      <P>A 38 per cent cut in export volumes means some 200,000 fewer Irish cattle being eligible for export to non-EC markets. This is of particular importance to the west as many of the plainer type cattle are priced upwards because of this market and it will put a complete blockage on the smaller farmer on the poorer land in the west from being able to dispose of the kind of cattle that he raises in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further 5 per cent reduction in the <Col N="532" /> milk quota would certainly considerably reduce the milk pool available to the west by an estimated three million gallons. As dairying has been one of the most profitable aspects of the agricultural business over the last number of years it is important that the quota would be retained and expanded.  As mentioned, the Italians were able to negotiate an increase whereas we have not been able to negotiate any despite the fact that the Treaty of Rome indicated clearly that comparative advantage for individual countries should be exploited and our comparative advantage lies in the production of milk and beef.  It is a failure of the Government and of the Department not to have negotiated an increase in the milk quota here.</P>
    <P>The pigmeat sector had gone through very disparate stages over the last 20 years.  If the GATT negotiations go through as proposed, an extra 500,000 tonnes of pigmeat imports will be allowed into the EC, this will devastate the smaller pig producer and something must be done about that.  These proposals would dramatically hit the agri-business in general and will lead to a further decline in jobs and farm incomes.  It should be borne in mind that rural Ireland is being devastated on a number of fronts.  One has only to drive through the more remote parts to see the number of houses closed as a result of emigration, unemployment and an enforced decline in agricultural incomes.  It is simply not on. Somebody must put a stop to it.  I call upon the Minister and the Government to take the matter to the EC and to ensure that the proposals in this motion by Deputy Yates are implemented for the good of all our farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Mr. <Col N="533" /> Walsh has already given a detailed presentation on the GATT dossier.  I would like to take the opportunity to deal more specifically with the agri-food industry and the impact which the GATT agreement will have in this area.  I would also wish to return to particular points of relevance in the GATT discussions.</P>
      <P>All members are well aware of the significance of the agri-food sector to the Irish economy.  It is, as the Culliton report acknowledges, the most important element of the indigenous sector of Irish industry.  It accounts for almost one-third of the gross output of all manufacturing industry in Ireland, some 30 per cent of the employment of Irish-owned manufacturing firms and over 20 per cent of total manufacturing employment.  These figures, however, do not do full justice to the importance of the agri-food sector because they omit the fact that the inputs to the sector are home-produced to a far greater extent than the inputs to any other sector of the economy, nor do they take account of the contribution which the sector makes to the preservation of rural areas.</P>
      <P>Since joining the European Community there has been a strong emphasis on the production of commodity products such as beef, milk powders and butter with a significant volume of output being put into intervention.  While this has resulted in increased production levels and reasonable returns to our producers, nevertheless it did not encourage the food industry to diversify or to promote a wide range of products on international markets.  In recent years the ever escalating cost of intervention operations and the acceptance that it was no longer possible to continue producing goods which had no real markets have made it essential for the industry to adapt to the demands of the market place and to become more competitive.  It has been accepted by all parties, including the farming organisations, that over-production could not continue and that a more rational system geared to the needs of the market had to be put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was in recognition of this fact that the Government devoted special attention <Col N="534" /> under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to the expansion of the food and drink industry, the importance of which was again underlined in the recent Programme for a Partnership Government. Policy over recent years has been clearly directed towards developing a modern industry to develop the significant job opportunities and exploit the potential of the sector.  Major investment has taken place in the beef, pigmeat and dairy sectors.  Our pigmeat sector now has modernised slaughtering plants capable of competing with international producers. The dairy sector has been undergoing rationalisation in recent years and we now have a number of major agricultural co-operatives which export significant quantities of Irish food products.  Furthermore, these co-ops have expanded their operations by acquisitions in Europe and the United States.  There have also been expansions in the beef sector.</P>
    <P>The various State agencies have also played their role.  In particular, they have been instrumental in emphasising the importance of the market led approach and impressing on companies the need for them to have a clear strategy for developing their markets.  Grant assistance is now being directed towards companies who are committed to providing quality Irish products for export markets. Overall the emphasis is being put on the market place and away from production.</P>
    <P>Much, however, remains to be done. The agriculture and food sector is facing new challenges in the years ahead from the advent of the Single Market, the eventual GATT agreement and the likelihood that greater market access will have to be conceded to the new democracies in East Europe.  There will have to be an even more decisive shift to marketled production.  Ireland has a lot of natural advantages &mdash; in particular I am referring to our largely extensive production methods and a relatively clean and pollution-free environment.  In addition, there is now a mechanism in place to cope with our long-standing seasonality problem which should assist the securing of a greater share of Community markets <Col N="535" /> with a consequent reduction in the dependence on intervention.  The farming and processing industries must take advantage of these resources and build markets for premium high quality products.</P>
    <P>For its part, the Government will continue to work in co-operation with the industry to provide the support and encouragement necessary to meet future challenges.  A programme of investment has brought about the major developments in the food processing industry and the extensive modernisation of facilities already referred to.  More than £44 million in FEOGA processing and marketing aid has been made available to the Irish agri-food industry.  It is anticipated that the new Structural Funds, when they come on stream, will add further to the achievements to date.  Some £20 million has also been contributed by the Exchequer.  All this has brought about substantial upgrading of plants, increased processing and improved quality and hygiene standards.</P>
    <P>The development of a successful marketing strategy will be an essential element in the future strategy of the food industry.  Several State agencies are involved in the promotion of food products but while they do a good job, a more rationalised approach is needed. Accordingly, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry established an expert group on the food industry last year whose task it is to prepare a national food industry development plan for the coming years.  The group consists of retailers, producers, processors and State agencies under the chairmanship of the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  It is expected that the group will submit its recommendations for action to the Minister shortly.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of the outcome of the GATT negotiations, it is clear that the current and future trend of agriculture and economic policies will be to move away from market support towards direct payments to farmers.  More and more the agri-food industry will have to compete <Col N="536" /> on its own merits.  This will, I feel, be benefical to the industry in the long term provided it is done in a gradual and balanced way allowing time for the necessary structural changes to be put in place.</P>
    <P>Turning back now to the GATT negotiations, I must point out that, contrary to what some speakers have indicated, there is as yet no GATT agreement. What is under discussion is an agreement reached by Commission and US negotiators on agriculture which has still to be accepted by the Council, the US Congress and the other parties in the GATT. There are also 14 other topics in the negotiations, some of which are providing as difficult, if not more so, to resolve, for example, services, market access and intellectual property rights.  it has been presumed that once the EC and US resolved their differences on agriculture then agreement would be possible in all the other sectors.  However, this has not been the case and many parties, including the US, have raised difficulties in these sectors which will not be easily resolved.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined here last night the main thrust of the current proposals on agriculture, which will cover the three areas of domestic support, border protection and export competition.  There has been little reference in the contributions here to date to the domestic support aspect, because the EC will not have to do anything additional to meet the proposed 20 per cent reduction in expenditure.  The reason for this is that estimated current expenditure, which takes account of Common Agricultural Policy reform, will be significantly lower than in the base years.  I should add that the choice of base years was put forward by Mr. Dunkel and was not chosen arbitrarily by the EC, as one Deputy seemed to suggest last night.  The Commission estimates that there will be a surplus of some 13,000 mecu which can be used to cushion the impact of measures in other areas.</P>
    <P>The domestic support aspect also covers the now infamous &ldquo;green box&rdquo; of policies which will not be subject to reduction under the GATT agreement. <Col N="537" /> There were several references to premia payments in the debate last night and I would like to take the opportunity to clarify a few matters.  Firstly, the Commission has clarified that the ewe premium would fall into the green box because it will not be subject to quantitative restrictions following Common Agricultural Policy reform.  The Commission has also confirmed that the other headage payments in the disadvantaged areas would be exempt from reduction and the provisions of the Final Act will have to cover this.  This is one of the aspects that we will be seeking to clarify in the on-going discussions at expert level.  It should be recalled when the Council mandate was agreed in November 1990, the Commission gave a firm undertaking that the level of these payments would not be reduced.  Our aim is to ensure that not alone is this commitment respected but that nothing in the agreement would prohibit the level of payments from being increased in the future.  The proposed &ldquo;peace clause&rdquo; gives rise to some concern in this respect and we will be clarifying the position with the Commission during the discussions already referred to.</P>
    <P>Reference was made last night to the possible introduction of national aids by other member states as an alternative means of supporting agriculture and the difficulties which would arise for Ireland under that scenario.  It must be stated that EC rules are absolutely clear on such aids &mdash; any state aid which distorts or threatens to distort competition is not allowed.  National aids which upset the competition position between member states are not permissible.</P>
    <P>Border protection covers the tariffication of border measures such as variable levies and commitments on current and minimum access.  The proposals put forward by the EC in relation to tariffication, together with the suggested safeguard clause, should provide adequate protection for almost all sectors of interest to Ireland.  A risk was identified in respect of skim milk powder and sugar but the Commission is proposing a lower rate of reduction for these products. <Col N="538" /> Deputies have correctly identified the minimum access commitment, and in particular whether aggregation of meat products will be permissible, as the most critical concern in this area.  The Commission has proposed the aggregation approach in its submissions to Geneva and has assured the Council that this has been accepted by the US but our concern is that the Final Act, as currently drafted, does not make this explicit.  Ireland, and other member states, have been emphasising this point to the Commission and we are insisting that the draft Final Act must be amended in order to prevent future challenges in the GATT.  It is absolutely essential that there is no misinterpretation on this point and that all parties accept it.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, some advantages to the minimum access commitment and all other parties, including the US, would have to open up their markets so as to meet the 5 per cent commitment, if it is not already being met.  In response to a question raised last night, EC farmers will be able to export dairy products to the US market within these limits but they will of course be in competition with the other parties in the GATT.</P>
    <P>The proposed restriction on export supports, particularly the volume limitations, is potentially the most damaging commitment in the proposed agreement. The position is exacerbated by what is know as front-loading, that is that exports would have to fall back below base levels &mdash; average of 1986-90 exports &mdash; in the first year of implementation.  This causes very serious problems in the beef sector where current export levels are 200,000 tons higher than in the base period.  There will also be problems in the dairy sector, particularly in relation to cheese exports, and in the whitemeat sector.  The volume restriction commitment raises difficulties for other member states too, even for staunch free traders such as the Netherlands and Denmark, and the Commission is under pressure to modify the commitment. Our aim is to try to reduce the level of the commitment and also to seek an end of period commitment so that the impact of front-loading is moderated.  On <Col N="539" /> a more optimistic note, it should be said that the Common Agricultural Policy reform outcome will lead to a reduced need for refunds in the cereals sector and probably also in the whitemeat sector where refund levels are already low and which will benefit from a substantial reduction in feed costs.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his officials will make every effort to ensure that what is eventually agreed can be contained within the outcome of Common Agricultural Policy reform or, if not, that we get firm commitments that our vital interests will be protected.  It should be pointed out that even when an overall agreement is in place the impact on the individual sectors and on each member state will depend on the rules and regulations which are subsequently put in place to implement the various commitments undertaken. The implementation of the commitments will be an internal Community matter and will ultimately be a matter for the Council of Ministers to decide.  Contrary to what Deputies Yates and Deenihan stated last night, there has been no decision, or even discussion, on how such commitments would be shared out in the EC.  Our view is that the burden must be shared equitably throughout the Community with full account being taken of the contribution which sectors make to the economies of regions.  The House can be assured that when this stage in the process is reached, the Minister will be seeking to ensure that Ireland's unique dependence on agriculture and in particular on exports is fully taken into account.  While it is premature to speculate what from the implementing rules might take, we will certainly be seeking to ensure that the burden of adjustment and cost to be borne by Ireland, such as on the reduction of exports, takes account of our special situation in the agriculture sector and that it will not be based on any member state's contribution to intervention.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan expressed the view last night that the proposed agreement would allow the US and others to produce unlimited quantities of product <Col N="540" /> while the Community will be subject to production quotas and other restrictions. This is a concern shared by the Minister and he has consistently pointed out in the Council that the Community will be required to bear a disproportionate share of the burden of reform.  He has proposed that the agreement should include a commitment that other participants will observe disciplines on world markets.</P>
    <P>I would also like to address the position if there is no GATT agreement.  As the Minister already stated, it cannot be assumed that the <i>status quo</i> could continue unchanged.  There has been an increasing number of challenges to the Common Agricultural Policy in recent years and we run the risk of many elements of that regime being found to be incompatible with the GATT, if new disciplines and rules are not agreed in the current negotiations.  Deputies will recall that the US won two GATT panel procedures against the EC system of payments and subsidies for producers and processors of oilseeds and related proteins. It will also be recalled that the US threatened to impose unilateral punitive duties on many EC agriculture and food exports, including many of direct interest to Ireland such as cream liqueurs, casein and cheese, unless the matter was resolved.</P>
    <P>There was, very rightly, grave concern expressed by all quarters concerning this action.  The party leaders in their joint statement issued on 6 November called for all steps to be taken to avoid implementation of retaliation and counter-retaliation measures so as to avoid a trade war which would be in nobody's long term interests.  We were pleased then, that there was a separate bilateral agreement on oilseeds with the US last November.  The terms of that deal, and not the GATT deal as was incorrectly stated last night, would limit the EC production area of oilseeds to 5.128 million hectares.  We do not, of course, welcome any such curtailment but it has to be borne in mind that the Community lost two GATT panels and a solution had to be found in order to avoid a trade war <Col N="541" /> which could have had very serious implications for our exports.</P>
    <P>An acceptable agreement which prevents future challenges to the Common Agricultural Policy in the GATT would be in our interests and would avoid the threat of a trade war arising again in the future.  The proposed peace clause meets some of our concerns on this aspect and we are seeking clarification from the Commission on the precise scope of the measure.  Having said this, it cannot, of course be a GATT agreement at any price, but must be one which protects our vital interests.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cox made a number of comments last night which deserve a reply. The allegation that the Government and previous Governments had adopted a passive stance in these negotiations could not be further from the truth.  Throughout this long process over the last six and a half years successive Ministers for Agriculture, Foreign Affairs and Industry and Commerce, including the Deputy's own Party Leader, have gone to great lengths to explain and forcefully defend Irish agriculture interests in all the relevant fora.  Furthermore, no opportunity has been lost at the diplomatic level and in suitable bilateral contracts by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to promote Ireland's case.  While it is correct to say that Commission negotiators have undertaken their own negotiating responsibilities in pursuing these talks within GATT and with the US side, the basic fact remains that the Council of Ministers will take the final decision on the Community's acceptance or otherwise of the outcome of these negotiations and a GATT agreement will not be accepted at Community level until that decision is taken by the Council.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also made an interesting connection between the stance of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry as explained to the House last night on the eventual outcome of a GATT deal and the conclusions of the Edinburgh Summit in December.  Regrettably, Deputy Cox quoted selectively from those conclusions in regard to the growth rate of the agriculture budget guidelines <Col N="542" /> in the future and the possibility of its covering further measures which might be necessary to protect our vital interests. The Edinburgh conclusions also commit the Council to increasing the FEOGA guarantee fund if necessary, in order to finance the implementation of Common Agricultural Policy reform.  If the evaluation exercise now underway at EC expert level confirms our view that the GATT outline agreement on agriculture goes beyond Common Agricultural Policy reform parameters, and if that agreement was nevertheless accepted, then the necessary additional resources would have to be provided.</P>
    <P>While contributors to the debate last night detailed, with apparent certainty, the financial implications of a GATT agreement on agriculture for Ireland, it is, I hope, apparent to all by now that an assessment of the effect of a GATT deal on the Irish agri-food sector is no easy matter and the precise implications will not be known even when a final agreement has been negotiated.  Nevertheless, the departmental services are making every effort to quantify, with reasonable precision, what the effects might be.  The evaluation which is currently underway at EC expert level, at the Minister's instigation, will be an invaluable aid in this process.  The group has dicussed the proposed agreement on two occasions, firstly in a very general manner and again this week when it focused its attention on the impact on the cereal and oilseeds sectors. Again, this was only a preliminary discussion and a more detailed assessment will take place over the coming weeks.  It is clear from discussions to date that this is not a simple exercise and many complex and detailed questions have been put to the Commission for reply.  The Agriculture Council will be kept informed of the progress made.  Here at home all interests will be kept informed of developments through the GATT Forum which has remained in place since 1988.</P>
    <P>The impact of the overall GATT agreement on employment levels in Ireland will be a major point for consideration when the Government is taking a final <Col N="543" /> decision on the round.  As already indicated there are 14 other topics under discussion in the round, including such sensitive sectors as textiles, services, and so on.  My colleague, the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy McCreevy, has overall responsibility for the GATT negotiations but a final decision will be the collective responsibility of the cabinet. That decision will have to take account of where Ireland's balance of interests lie in all sectors.  However, in view of the importance of agriculture to our economy the impact on this sector will be the principal consideration in that decision.</P>
    <P>The House will be interested to note that the Minister for Tourism and Trade has decided that an independent assessment should be made of the overall implications for Ireland of a Uruguay Round agreement.  This assessment will take into account all of the areas under negotiation likely to impact on international trade including, of course, agriculture.  It is understood that he will shortly commission a consultancy study that will be undertaken in consultation with the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  The study will examine the impact of the round on Ireland from two perspectives: (1) the indentifiable sectors specific implications, and (2) the overall international trade and macro-economic implications.  The Minister for Tourism and Trade intends to submit the conclusions of the study and his recommendations in relation to them to the Government for consideration as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
    <P>The timing of such an exercise may of course be influenced by the rate of progress in the negotiations.  As the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry indicated last night, the latest reports are that the US will seek an extension of its fast-track negotiating authority for an additional six to nine months.  Consequently, it is expected that an overall agreement covering all sectors will not now be concluded until late this year or early next year.  The agreement, and thus <Col N="544" /> the implications for each sector, may not become clear until much later this year and so the consultancy group may not be able fully to complete its task until then.</P>
    <P>I would like once again to reiterate the concerns of the Minister regarding the proposed EC-US agreement on agriculture. Based on available information and evaluation carried out to date, his view is that the agreement is not compatible with the outcome of Common Agricultural Policy reform and that it would require additional cutback in EC production levels.  If this is indeed shown to be the case, then he will be seeking firm commitments that appropriate measures will be taken to protect our vital interests.</P>
    <P>The Government, including the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Trade and Tourism &mdash; who has overall responsibility for the GATT and these negotiations &mdash; are fully committed to this objective also and all will be working in concert to ensure that it is achieved.  I therefore commend the amended motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amended motion.  The farming sector has faced considerable uncertainty in recent years as the Community reviewed and eventually agreed measures aimed at reforming the Common Agricultural Policy support arrangements.  The sector continues to face some uncertainty in light of implementation of the various measures agreed last May.  It is therefore inevitable that farmers remain concerned that the eventual GATT agreement might require some further adjustment to Common Agricultural Policy support at production levels.  I was therefore very pleased to hear the assurance last night, from the Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh, and tonight from the Minister of State, Deputy Brian O'Shea, that the Government will continue to oppose any outcome to the GATT negotiations which would be damaging to our vital interests in the agriculture and food sectors and in particular that they will oppose any agreement which is not compatible with the reformed Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that the agreement reached <Col N="545" /> by EC and US negotiators could have adverse implications for some of our more important sectors, especially our beef industry.  I hope that in the ongoing negotiations it will be possible to secure the changes to the agreement identified by the Minister.  I am confident that the ongoing analysis being undertaken at expert level in the Community will bring home to all member states that the commitment in the EC-US agreement will require the Community to go beyond the Common Agricultural Policy reform outcome and that appropriate measures will be taken.  The Minister has clearly identified the proposed limitations on export subsidies as a main source of concern. They would impose a disproportionate share of the burden on some Community producers while others may escape relatively unscathed.  The Minister is quite right to seek significant changes in terms of the commitment made and in the rules for implementing such a commitment.  I agree that the Minister should seek to ensure that farmers in other countries make an appropriate contribution towards restoring a greater balance on international markets.</P>
    <P>There are a number of positive elements in the draft EC-US agreement. It is essential that any final agreement should exclude Common Agricultural Policy reform compensation and headage payments from the GATT disciplines. Equally, there should be clear trade rules to avoid challenges in GATT to our domestic support and trade arrangements. Clearly considerable work remains to be undertaken before a final agreement is reached.  I am confident the Minister and his colleagues will continue to outline the vital importance of the agriculture and food sectors to our economy in the ongoing negotiations and that they will be able to secure an outcome that will protect our interests.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the beef industry as being an area of concern.  Let us look at the amount of beef put into intervention in the last number of years.  In the early seventies we exported 40,000 tonnes of beef per year to Germany but in the early nineties that figure dropped to 12,500 <Col N="546" /> tonnes at a time when 85 to 90 per cent of our kill was going into intervention. That is a matter that will have to be carefully examined.</P>

      <P>The proposed GATT deal will have a fundamental impact on Irish agriculture.  Indeed in the opinion of many it poses the most serious threat ever to Irish farmers and the Irish agricultural sector.  As it has potential to cause a loss of almost 20,000 jobs and a total diminution of the family farm enterprise, thereby threatening the survival of our rural communities, our vital national interest must be protected at all costs. The Government has a responsibility to vote against the present deal or else to secure special treatment for the Irish case.  So weak and ineffective have been the attempts by the Government to date to protect the livelihoods of Irish farmers that I ask: does anyone on the Government side of this House really understand the precarious position of the agricultural sector and the threat of new extensions that these proposals hold?  Despite the protective stance taken by the Minister of State, I agree with Deputy Cox that the stance taken by the Government to date has been nothing short of passive.</P>
      <P>The combination of the Common Agricultural Policy reforms and GATT negotiations represent a fundamental change in agricultural policy in Ireland and the European Community.  These two issues are clearly interlinked.  Common Agricultural Policy reform decisions were influenced by the demands of other GATT participants.  More importantly, it is now sadly obvious that perhaps further Common Agricultural Policy cuts will have to be implemented to accommodate the GATT outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole nature of farming is changing, eliminating any scope for decision-making <Col N="547" /> by the individual farmer to undertake a particular enterprise, confined and restricted as he is by quotas. There is also a drastic change in the structure of farm incomes with a significant cut in the value of agricultural output and a major increase in the role of direct payments.  The cheque in the post replaces increased production.  Comparing the structure of national agricultural output and income last year with that envisaged in 1995, when Common Agricultural Policy reform is fully implemented, it is likely that gross agricultural output will fall by a massive 14.5 per cent.  Direct payments, which now contribute 25 per cent of net farm income, will in 1995 contribute 50 per cent of net farm income.  This is the type of future that faces Irish farmers, particularly those in the beef, cereal and sheep sectors who will depend to an alarming extent on direct compensation payments. What is being created is a nation of parttime farmers; family farms will no longer be viable.  The outcome of this will be that the agricultural sector will have no prospect whatsoever of providing industrial or service jobs necessary to contribute to the creation or preservation of employment.  Having a very weak industrial base, we need a strong agricultural industry to stimulate jobs in very fast fading rural communities.</P>
    <P>The current round of GATT negotiations focuses on agriculture.  Sadly, the objective of the US and others, such as Australia and New Zealand, is to progressively dismantle the EC's Common Agricultural Policy by demanding that the EC reduce import barriers to the extent of even ignoring the over-supply problems within the EC itself, that the EC exports less, thereby reducing the volume of EC products to be converted by export refunds, and that the EC reduce internal Common Agricultural Policy support to its own farmers.  These demands, we must all admit, are a lethal attack on European farmers, particularly the Irish farmer who will suffer most.  It should be noted that despite the major cuts already implemented in agricultural <Col N="548" /> prices and supports, the US Government is still not satisfied.  The implications of these demands for Ireland are disastrous.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Yates, last night outlined very clearly the implications for each sector and the alarming consequences for the beef, pigmeat and dairy sectors.  As he pointed out, no sector is spared.  The cereal, poultry, sheepmeat and soya sectors will have a high price to pay.  All these matters make our economic outlook bleaker.  What is most alarming is the failure of the Government to acknowledge fully the extent of the effects of the GATT deal on Irish agriculture. Can any Minister for Agriculture stand over a proposal to force Ireland to cut its volume of exports of beef to non-EC countries by the equivalent of up to 100,000 cattle per annum?  What will happen to the surplus?  As Deputy Yates asked last night, where will all the unwanted stock go?  These are the crucial questions that must be asked.  We all know that the result will be to force down prices in Ireland and ultimately there will be no future whatsoever for the Irish beef industry.</P>
    <P>Dairy producers face a 5 per cent cut in the national milk quota.  This is caused by increased import excess and a cut in export volume.  We are particularly vulnerable to a cut in export refunds because of our high dependency on non-EC markets. The cheese industry will be particularly affected by these cuts, causing a disastrous effect on employment, mostly in rural areas where there will be no hope of a replacement industry.  I am thinking of small industries in my constituency, such as the Mullinahone Co-op where the cheese plant employs 135 people in the Slieveardagh area.  At present unemployment levels in that area are way above the national average.  Any deal or proposal that will affect small local industries such as this will have a disastrous consequence for the entire locality.  This simple local example outlines the real and unwanted consequences of the GATT proposals.</P>
    <P>On a personal level I have an interest in the cereal sector.  GATT demands a 21 per cent reduction in the volume of <Col N="549" /> cereals exported.  The present set aside programme, starting this season, is causing severe stress to tillage farmers who understandably cannot cope with leaving any of their land uncultivated.  It is an attack on their way of life and an assault on their tradition.  It conflicts with their work ethic which is to utilise to the maximum all of their land.  I might add that the set aside programme at present is in a state of confusion.  When will cereal farmers receive compensation payments? Will they have to wait months as is the case with other supports from the EC?  If so, profit margins will be further reduced in a sector where they are already too low.  Not only will these farmers have to cope with a 15 per cent set aside programme this year, but they are also faced with the threat that the figure by which exports will be reduced will increase to 30 per cent.  The Minister must come clean and outline the effects of those proposals on the cereal sector.</P>
    <P>The cereal sector will also have to cope with a major market loss in compound feed demand due to reduced beef, milk and pigmeat production.  This briefly outlines the severe consequences of the GATT deal, but even worse is that any cuts in support and protection negotiated under GATT are irreversible.  This is why Irish farmers and the future of our agriculture must be protected.  We cannot and must not allow the US to dictate our future.  The whole idea behind GATT is to scale down the heavily subsidised agricultural reforms in both the US and Europe and to expand free trade.  The US went into the GATT round adopting a very high moral tone against the EC Common Agricultural Policy.  At one stage President Bush described Common Agricultural Policy as the iron curtain of protectionism.  With its bulging food mountains it is to our loss that the EC found it difficult to shake off those attacks and found itself on the defensive.  The Government must play its role and must do so now.  We must clearly support France, Belgium and those who do not accept the MacSharry view that the GATT deal does not go beyond the Common Agricultural Policy cuts.  Our <Col N="550" /> stand and the stand of the Government must be to ensure no GATT cuts in excess of Common Agricultural Policy reform.</P>
    <P>We cannot just sit and wait to see what will happen.  The future of Irish agriculture depends heavily on the attitude, determination and action of the Government to forcefully resist the present GATT proposals and at a minimum to ensure full compensation.  Ireland must simply take its fair share of cuts.  Under no circumstances must it carry the can for other countries who are creating major surpluses, which are the cause of this crisis.  Failure of the Government to protect Irish agriculture and secure its future will be dearly paid for by massive unemployment, an exodus of farmers from the land and the death of our rural communities.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this very importrant legislation.  I congratulate Deputy Yates for raising this matter.  The present position in relation to the GATTEC talks comes as no surprise to me or to the farmers and rural organisations, from all of whom I have had correspondence. There has been no real commitment in this regard from this Government, the previous Fianna Fáil Government, or the Government previous to that which was in office when I first came into this House.  That truth came home to me after I entered this House in 1987 when an application to have all of Cavan and Monaghan declared severely handicapped was withdrawn by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>That application has not been resubmitted since.  This brought home to me the truth that Fianna Fáil has no contribution to make to farmers. The Coalition Government between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats <Col N="551" /> brought nothing but promises.  I will not fault the Minister, Deputy Walsh, as he is still relatively new to the post but I expect much more from him, as do the people outside this House.  The Minister promised that all headage payments would be paid in the calendar year, but that has not been done.  Perhaps the Minister will tell me the reason for that.  There are many farmers whose bank managers and creditors are knocking on their doors looking for money.  They were told they would be paid by Christmas but through no fault of farmers they could not do so because the Minister did not deliver the cheques.</P>
      <P>Where is the Labour Party tonight, the people who were to change the whole face of politics?  We are discussing the most important industry in this country, yet there is not a Labour Member in the House.  They do not care a straw about it.  I know where they are.  They are probably out looking for more jobs for family members.  Many farmers are losing their jobs; the basis of their income is gone because of the policies pursued by the present and previous Governments.  The EC debates were not properly negotiated. No real effort was made for farmers, many of whom said to me, &ldquo;God be with the days when we had Mark Clinton and Austin Deasy to fight our corner&rdquo;. We expect the Minister to do the same. We have only to look around the country to see the commitment to agriculture. Agriculture is a sour word in this Government's mouth.  They do not want to hear about it.  Afforestation is now the big deal.  On my way to Sligo on Monday for a very important regional meeting I saw one farm after another wholly planted. As these trees grow, other farmers will be pushed out.  Afforestation is the buzz word.  The Minister, titled Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, should have the title Minister for Forestry, Agriculture and Food because forestry is being promoted primarily.  There is no future in afforestation, in planting good arable land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge and appreciate the presence <Col N="552" /> of Deputy Leonard from my own constituency whose commitment to agriculture goes without saying.  I ask him to urge the Minister to renegotiate the GATT deal which will have such a devastating effect on the development of agriculture.  Whether or not the Government like it, we have an agriculturally based economy.  Our very existence depends on a thriving agricultural industry, but this industry is being slowly decimated and farmers are being pushed out.</P>
    <P>I am alarmed by the deficiency payments in the GATT green box.  Do people fully realise what this means and what the consequences of this are?  The objective of the Common Agricultural Policy was that there would be common prices throughout Europe.  We are not yet near catching up with our European counterparts in relation to the prices they achieve, and there is no denying that fact. Figures presented to the Government last Monday in Sligo in relation to the Structural Fund showed that the income of farmers in the north-west is less than half that of the rest of the country.  I am sure the Minister is aware of these figures. The average farm income in 1991 in the north-west, including Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan and Monaghan, not to talk of Mayo and Galway, was £2,400 per annum.  How could any farmer rear a family in this day and age on £2,500, £44 or £45 a week?  The social welfare officer would say those people are well off and are not entitled to assistance.  In the rest of the country the average farm income of £5,400 is nothing to shout about.  I was amazed at this figure.  People in urban areas believe that these farmers, on £108 a week are well off.  They call for them to be taxed and the Government supports them, believing they are not paying their fair share.</P>
    <P>What does the green box mean?  That proposal means that wealthier states such as America &mdash; although figures published last night show they have debts of billions of dollars, so there is no great wealth but apparently borrowing continues &mdash; and the wealthier EC states, such as Germany and France, will be allowed to subsidise their own farmers.  Can we afford <Col N="553" /> to do that?  Of course, we cannot afford to do it.  We are dependent on support prices from the EC.  The consequences of the green box payments are that prices are floated in the marketplace.  If the price is reasonable and will give a profit, that is grand; but if it has to be subsidised directly by member states that is another question.  How can our farmers take less than a profitable price for the goods they produce?  Commonsense must apply. This measure has serious consequences.</P>
    <P>In my region the movement of quotas, such as they are, to the south must be stopped.  The only hope for our farmers is the dairy industry, but this industry is being gradually eroded.  We were told that under the Common Agricultural Policy there would be no movement of quotas.  Farmers in the beef sector also find it difficult to exist.  As regard to the cheque in the post, we must be the good boys of the EC.  Every letter of the law must be abided by and if the farmer makes a mistake, he is denied subsidies and grants for two or three years.  I will give an example in my area where a mistake was made.  I am not blaming the Department officials &mdash; people can make mistakes and I accept that &mdash; but it is wrong for officials to set themselves up as judge and jury of a farmer who makes a mistake and to penalise him in an unacceptable manner.</P>
    <P>In this instance the Department paid out cheques on the double.  The money was very welcome and people thought this must be the EC bonanza that was promised, but a letter followed shortly aferwards stating that there was overpayment and that the cheques should be returned immediately.  Needless to say money coming into any household with a family is used to pay bills and buy extra goods which are necessary.  This money was not spent wilfully or thrown around, but the cheques were demanded back.  I wonder would the officials who made those mistakes lose their salaries for, say, the next two or three years?  Not at all. A mistake made by a farmer is treated differently.  If a farmer makes a mistake the Government believes he is out to do it, but that is a wrong attitude and it must <Col N="554" /> be changed.  We should not be so miserly with farmers who may experience difficulty in compiling herd numbers.  Where a genuine mistake is made people should be level-headed enough to say they understand, and if the herd numbers are all right farmers should get their grants.</P>
    <P>I will give another instance of this Government's attitude to farmers and of driving farmers off the land.  This matter has come to light in the last month and it relates to the whole question of pollution control.  Neither I nor anybody else condones pollution.  If there is pollution control there should be grant-aid to support farmers in tackling the problem.  But what is happening at present?  The fishery boards are using the Air Corps, an arm of the Army that was set up to protect the people, to spy and harass farmers in my constituency.  This is not good enough and it will not be tolerated.  It is unacceptable. How dare these people come in and frighten stock and people in their households?  Farmers go about their business, trying to earn their livelihood above the law.  These people are not breaking the law, they are not criminals.  The Air Corps should be used to chase criminals along the Border and people who commit foul deeds.  How dare anybody categorise the farmers in my constituency in that class?  I will not accept it and I know the Minister would not accept it.  He cannot be aware of everything that is happening but I bring this matter to his attention in the hope that he will have it dealt with.</P>

      <P>Democratic Left intends to abstain on this motion because, while we support reform of the Common Agricultueral Policy, we recognise it is only one step in the right direction. I have heard many Deputies argue the case for the <i>status quo</i> and that is understandable.  The case for the bigger farmer always has been well represented in this Chamber, but I agree that there should be no further concessions from the US in view of the new administration there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the great North-South divide, we should be considering a global view of the GATT deal.  The purpose <Col N="555" /> of GATT is to end protectionist trade barriers and distortions, particularly as they relate to agricultural commodities, a necessary prerequisite for economic recovery in developing parts of the world. The payment of EC export subsidies and the systematic restriction of access to EC markets is deeply unfair to the many Third World countries struggling to develop their farming sectors.  The purpose of trade liberalisation must be to try to bridge the huge gap between North and South.  The Irish debate regarding GATT has focused almost exclusively on its possible effects on Irish agriculture and how it related to the Common Agricultural Policy reform proposals.  We must face up to our global responsibilities even if this means a certain adjustment in farming patterns in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The GATT and some of the proposals regarding the multilateral trade organisation are flawed in many ways, but unless there are some steps taken towards the dismantling of trade barriers there is little chance of sustainable development in a way that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  Even at this late stage there is room to amend the proposals so that the MTO becomes a body able to support environmentally sustainable economic development.  With this in mind we call on the Minister responsible for foreign trade, Deputy McCreevy, to press for this condition to be written into the preamble and articles of the MTO proposal.</P>
    <P>The principal cause of distortions in the world agricultural system relates to the payment of export subsidies in the rich countries of the north.  There is an incentive to produce massive quantities of food which are dumped onto world markets.  The GATT proposal to reduce the volume eligible for subsidisation is a step in the right direction and the EC should support this proposal.  However, more radical measures are needed which would ultimately lead to a ban on export subsidisation, together with the banning of the marketing of agricultural produce on world markets at prices below the cost <Col N="556" /> of production.  This would obviously raise the cost of food imports for developing countries who already face a severe squeeze on their balance of payments, thereby threatening the security of their citizens in terms of food.  In the long term these countries will have to become more self-sufficient in food but in the short and medium term a realistic programme of adjustment support, in some cases for a greater timespan than the ten years underlined by GATT, will be required.</P>
    <P>The EC in particular must be prepared to step up its developmental assistance to allow Third World countries to develop viable national agricultural sectors.  A too speedy move towards trade liberalisation in the South would help only the rich countries.  Of paramount concern must be the provision of food security to the poorer nations.  Therefore, a distinction must be made between subsidies which sustain over-production and distort world markets and subsidies used for rural employment and to promote ecologically sustainable agriculture.  A more prosperous South, with a substantially alleviated debt burden is in all our interests.</P>
    <P>Apart from the inadequacy of some of the proposals of the GATT deal itself, the whole approach of GATT is too narrowly focused.  Whatever follows from GATT must embrace the question of global economic development.  It is not sufficient to deal with international trade policy in isolation from broader economic considerations.  The successor to GATT must have among its founding objectives technological transfer of developing countries and the control of transnational corporations.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael motion seeks to oppose the GATT deal on the basis that it goes beyond what has been already agreed in the Common Agricultural Policy reform proposals.  One suspects, however, that lurking behind this is an antipathy to the practical consequences of having to live with Common Agricultural Policy reform.  It has been obvious for some time that the writing is on the wall for the Common Agricultural Policy.  There has been plenty of time for successive Governments and the main farming <Col N="557" /> organisations to prepare themselves for the inevitability of reform and to seek alternative structures for agriculture and rural development.  At least Common Agricultural Policy reform goes some way towards the undoing of a system which proved to be ruinously wasteful as well as having a pernicious effect on the world agricultural system.</P>
    <P>We have been living with a policy which produces goods for which there is no market, which adds up to £15 per week to consumer food bills, which consumes up to 60 per cent of the entire budget and which allows 80 per cent of all price supports to go to the top 20 per cent income bracket.  This policy does not have a future and is not worth fighting for.  It is clear that Common Agricultural Policy contributed to the uneven development of Irish agriculture and is equally clear that the promised benefits to the whole country never materialised. After two decades of EC membership the agriculture sector's net contribution to the Common Agricultural Policy remains unchanged.  The numbers obtaining a living from farming have declined by 40 per cent and the number at work in the food industry has declined by nearly one-third &mdash; from 46,000 to 33,000.  The Common Agricultural Policy has acted as a transfer of wealth from smaller farmers, consumers and taxpayers to larger, wealthy farmers.  It does this because price support mechanisms benefit farmers who already have a large output.</P>
    <P>The NESC in a document, The Impact of Reform on the Common Agricultural Policy, argued that, from an Irish perspective, Common Agricultural Policy reform is desirable as well as inevitable. Firstly, a viable and sustainable framework for agricultural production is of strategic importance to the performance of the Irish economy.  Secondly, a reformulated Common Agricultural Policy could address more effectively the structural problems of Irish agriculture, including the problem of low and volatile incomes.  Thirdly, a reorientation of policy measures could contribute to the development of the food industry, especially if it reduces the current seasonal <Col N="558" /> pattern of production.  Fourthly, the distribution of resources from the Community's budget is quite uneven, with Irish producers receiving significantly lower levels of support than their more intensive and more economically developed counterparts in other countries.  The document concludes that a reorientation of support measures could strengthen the cohesive impact of Community agricultural expenditure.</P>
    <P>We believe that price support mechanisms should be dismantled over a phased period in the context of international GATT negotiations.  This would create a liberalised agricultural market which relies more on the market to establish prices than on artificial price-fixing mechanisms.  The funds Ireland at present obtains in export subsidies could be redirected to direct income support, structural improvement and a serious programme of integrated rural development. It is important to emphasise that the problems of Irish agriculture are primarily structural and it is the function not only of the EC but of the Irish State to tackle these problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Yates has kindly agreed to allocate me five minutes of his time, which I appreciate.  I wish to deal with some of the issues raised by the last speaker.  Fine Gael is extremely concerned about the GATT proposals as they are currently framed and their implications for the Third World.  I am anxious to alert the Minister opposite and indeed his partner in Government, Deputy McCreevy, the Minister responsible for the final decisions in relation to GATT and the signing of any treaty or introduction of legislation in this regard, to a number of matters which are of great concern.  I call on the Minister to proceed very slowly bearing in mind that in December 1992 Arthur Dunkel produced a draft final Act which embodies the results of the Uruguay Round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of that draft there are very significant proposals, which were touched on by the last speaker, for a new and powerful multilateral trade organisation. These proposals, which could <Col N="559" /> have very far-reaching significance for us as a small nation and for the countries of the developing world have received no attention.  We could serve our own interests, by very carefully watching this development, by seeking to achieve as much as possible in relation to the GATT proposals and particularly by trying to ensure that the proposal for a new international body is reversed.  Such a body would have a marked impact on the right of national Governments to decide upon and employ trade policy measures.  While there is need for new institutional arrangements the proposals as they stand are seriously flawed in that such a body would have great effect on settling disputes over trade and the criteria by which the validity of trade policy measures are judged.</P>
    <P>Most importantly it is proposed that free trade would be an absolute goal of any policy in this regard.  Given our known concern for the Third World, particularly for Africa which is suffering at an unprecedented level, the position in relation to trade undermines the vast aid given by the western world.  We are net beneficiaries from the economies of that region.  That is a horrific reality that any negotiator from a Christian and Catholic society should never turn their back on.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that there is absolutely no commitment to environmental issues in the context of the draft Bill published in December.  I am concerned that the proposed governing body of the multilateral trade organisation would be similar to ministerial conference, that the new dispute settlement procedure that is suggested would be even more inadequate than the previous one which was untransparent, taking place behind closed doors, where nobody could query proposals until the result was delivered and no means of satisfying ourselves on matters. It effectively further diluted the lines of democratic control in nation states.  This is a matter about which we should be greatly concerned.  Together with other Governments we are under increased pressure to promote the environment, <Col N="560" /> to create and maintain employment and improve standards of living as well as seeking free trade, all valid objectives for us and our partners in the Third World.</P>
    <P>These proposals would reduce direct national control over vital economic matters. Unlike the original 1947 GATT proposal this new proposal makes no provision to address the international commodity crisis, control restrictive business practices or protect labour rights. Matters such as protection of the environment and fair trade rules for the Third World are essential in considering the GATT proposals.  I would ask the Minister present and Deputy McCreevy to seek to have this proposal in relation to the multilateral treaty put aside until we have a clear and explicit commitment to protect the environment, to promote sustainable development and to raise the incomes of the poor in the Third World. We should ensure that for countries such as Ireland direct control over decisions would be made by a club of two or three of the richest nations in the world.  It is in our interests as well as those of the Third World, to examine this proposal, to raise questions about it at every level and to ensure that it does not go ahead as currently proposed.</P>

      <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to this well informed debate.  My first criticism is not of the Minister; it is that in all organs of the media today there was not one line about this debate.  On the 6 o'clock news today there was fanfare about 2,000 jobs, and rightly so.  There will be 20,000 jobs at issue if this GATT deal goes through as it is currently proposed.  Yet the matter is regarded as a big yawn by the public and the media.  Because it will not immediately impact on people, they do not understand the gravity of the matter, <Col N="561" /> and I very much regret that.  There is a great responsibility on the Minister and the Government to lead in this regard.  If the Government is seen to be deeply agitated and anxious about the GATT proposals, the country will realise it is a major national issue.  Together with the unemployed budgetary issue and the unemployment crisis, this is a major issue and it must be preceived as such, not just by the Minister but the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.</P>
      <P>I will deal first with the Minister's comments because at the end of the day the steps taken on this issue will be most important.  Disregarding the points made by the Minister last night on analysis of the proposals, the bottom line is his statement, and I quote: &ldquo;I have made it crystal clear to our European partners that I will not accept an outcome which goes beyond Common Agricultural Policy reform parameters unless such an outcome is accompanied by firm commitments that our vital national interests will be protected in the further measures that will be necessary.&rdquo; In his speech tonight the Minister of State said that the Minister and his officials will make every effort to ensure what is eventually agreed can be contained within the outcome of Common Agricultural Policy reform or, if not, that we get firm commitments that our vital national interests be protected. What does that mean?  Does it mean a 4 per cent cut in our national quota, or does it mean 100,000 cattle are to be sacrificed?  We need to take a far more aggressive line on this matter.  Deputy McManus was right in that lurking behind this motion on GATT and Common Agricultural Policy reform is that instead of having parishes with 30 or 40 family farms there will be only two ranchers. We are talking about the annihilation and depopulation of rural Ireland.  I make no apologies for saying that a line has been drawn in terms of Common Agricultural Policy reform &mdash; that is not something to which I would have willingly agreed &mdash; and beyond that line we cannot go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards beef, the level of production in excess of consumption is in the order of one million tonnes per annum. Therefore problems will arise in the event <Col N="562" /> of a reduction in intervention to 350,000 tonnes?  Excess beef will not go to third countries because import refunds will be reduced by 36 per cent between now and 1999.  The Minister of State rightly pointed out that we are heading for a crash in heifer meat prices, for which there is no intervention ceiling for 1994, because there is no market for this meat. The inevitable conclusion is the systematic slaughter of calves at ten days old in return for a premium of £88.  That will result in a loss of jobs in the food processing sectors and the introduction of intervention for cattle weighing 150 kilos, which is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>In the dairy sector, the New Zealand dairy board is jumping up and down with excitement at this proposal because they are selling milk at 40p a gallon and making a profit of 17p a gallon.  If we cut back our national quota by 5 per cent, particularly in relation to cheese exports, where will the compensation come from? It has been acknowledged in this debate that during the Edinburgh Summit a budgetary ceiling was set for the Common Agricultural Policy.  Therefore there is no windfall of money to bail us out.  That brings me to my central disagreement with the Government.  It believes that somehow after all the negotiations are over Ireland will fix it because of our vital national interest, but I do not believe that is possible.  For example, we produce 1 per cent of the EC's pigmeat; but if there is a surplus as a result of increased imports of, say, 400,000 tonnes, we will probably contribute 20 per cent of the surplus.  Countries who contribute to the surplus and who depend on intervention will pay the price.  Why are we so dependent on intervention?  It is not because we export 80 per cent of our agricultureal produce but because intervention is triggered where the price is lowest, and the price for virtually every commodity is lowest in Ireland; thus our dependence on intervention.  Countries who depend on intervention will be devastated, and that is where we stand to lose.  We must insist that any cuts in production are made in proportion to total production levels, not to the excess.  That <Col N="563" /> is a fundamental point that must be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>As we move towards dismantling a Common Agricultural policy with common prices and a common income, there will be a rationalisation of agriculture. That means that Germany, only 2 per cent of whose population is involved in farming &mdash; in Ireland 17 per cent of employment is in the agricultural sector &mdash; will be able, as an industrialised economy, to afford major supports by way of direct income aids to their farmers.  We do not have that option.  The Minister of State said that would not be allowed, but Germany could provide support by way of VAT refunds.  This is a national crisis that must be tackled on the basis of the survival of family farms.  Deputy Boylan rightly said that the average farm income is well below the industrial average wage. <Col N="564" /> There is a saying that the only way young eligible farmers can make a living is to marry what is called a laying hen, preferably somebody in the public sector such as a doctor, nurse or teacher who could sustain them.  With present Government and EC policy there is no way these people will be able to afford to rear their families based on agriculture.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael will be presenting our motion. We will not oppose the Government Amendment because we support a tough line.  Arising from this debate, I want to see a strengthening of the Minister's resolve and an up-take of this matter by the Taoiseach and by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.  A line has been drawn in the sand beyond which we cannot and will not go.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Proposed Loop Head (Clare) Mast.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you, Sir, for giving me time to raise this matter, which has some connections with the Bill we talked about earlier today.  The Commissioners of Irish Lights propose to erect a steel mast 720 feet high about five miles east of Loophead lighthouse.  That work is proposed on foot of an international agreement signed by our Government on 6 August last concerning the establishment and operation of a Loran-C navigation system in north-west Europe and the north Atlantic.  While the Loran-C system has a number of advantages the case for participating in the system is far from compelling.  Fishermen's organisations here and in the UK have serious reservations about the system.  Their belief is that they will eventually move to another navigation system entitled global positioning system &mdash;GPS &mdash; which is satellite based.  They see no reason why they should first incur the cost of changing from their present Decca system to the Loran-C system and subsequently bear the extra cost of moving from the Loran-C system to GPS. Those costs could be substantial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current cost of a Loran-C receiver which would have to be installed if this system was brought into operation is between £2,500 and £3,500.  In addition, it is not possible to transfer information electronically from the Decca system to Loran-C.  The transfer must be carried out manually and it is a very exacting and time consuming procedure.  It is not yet possible to say what the subsequent cost of a change to the global positioning system would be. All the EC fishing zones <Col N="567" /> are situated inside regions covered by the Decca system and that system as a result is used by a very large number of Community fishing vessel owners for radio navigation and scanning the sea bed for fish.  The general view among fishermen is that the Loran-C system is no more precise than the Decca system.  The European Community organisation representing fishermen &mdash; EUROPECHE &mdash; is opposed to the introduction of Loran-C.</P>
    <P>I should add in parenthesis that the Commission of the European Communities has supported the introduction of the Loran-C system but all I can discern from discussing the matter with those involved and from reading the literature is that the Commission's support for this system is very much less than being at the front of their collective minds.</P>
    <P>I find it significant also that the United Kingdom, in spite of having been looking at this system for quite a long time has not yet signed the international agreement. The reason it has not done so is that the authorities there are currently negotiating to get a better deal for the Decca system that is now in operation there. Their belief seems to be that they can get a better deal from continuing with the Decca system than with Loran.  That being the case, it seems questionable whether the Loop Head mast should be constructed at all.</P>
    <P>The question of the health risk from both thermal and athermal radiation from the proposed mast has been raised. I have seen statements on both sides of that issue.  As a layman, I would not dare to venture an opinion and I cannot decide between them; but I am very sceptical about some of the claims of possible dangers. The fact remains however that even the expert retained by the Commissioners of Irish Lights has pointed out that at present no Irish authority has responsibility for the safety of non-ionising radiation.  He suggested that the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, set up by an Act of 1991, could be asked to undertake an assessment. I find it appalling that the matter has <Col N="568" /> proceeded as far as it has without such an assessment having been done.</P>
    <P>In addition, the mast would undoubtedly constitute a major visual intrusion into the area.  It would be visible over a five mile radius by day, set as it would be on the cliff top plateau of Loop Head.  It would be visible over even greater distances at night since it would have to be fitted with flashing strobe lights because it clearly would constitute a danger for air navigation and also for birds.  The mast itself would have to be supported by a complex of guy-wires so that the visual intrusion would be quite substantial. It would be folly to inflict such a major environmental intrusion for the sake of an unwanted system which could soon become redundant.</P>
    <P>Finally, under the law as it stands the Commissioners of Irish Lights do not require planning permission for this project. It would be outrageous to inflict such an environmental intrusion on the area in a situation in which local residents effectively have no statutory right to voice their opinions and have their views taken into account.  I call on the Minister and the Government to halt this project immediately.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy has raised this matter.  A number of Deputies have been in touch with me about it, not least of all Deputy Síle de Valera who has requested me to meet with a group of concerned citizens living in or around the area of this proposed 750 feet mast. I would be glad to meet with the group, as suggested by Deputy de Valera.  I would also be glad to allay the fears of the local community in that, in addition to whatever independent surveys have been done, I will undertake to seriously consider the possibility of another independent assessment in view of what are genuine concerns of a community who would be within the shadow of this mast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Loran-C is a radio navigation system used extensively throughout the world. Ireland, under an international agreement, is to join the chain of Loran-C masts in other north-west European <Col N="569" /> countries in order to provide a safe cost-effective navigation system for our sea-farers. Our joining the chain involves the building of a radio mast which for maximum coverage of our coasts has to be sited in the south-west of the country. The Dáil has been given extensive details of the Loran-C project and I refer Deputies to the Dáil's approval of the project on 8 October 1992.</P>
    <P>The Commissioner of Irish Lights, acting on an agency basis on behalf of the Department, is responsible for the construction, operation and maintenance of the proposed Loran-C mast at Loop Head.  While not required by the European Communities Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations, 1989, to do so, the Commissioners of Irish Lights prepared an environmental impact statement which was made available to the local authority and which was put on public display in a number of locations in County Clare last December.  I understand that under the Local Government Planning and Development Regulations, 1977, planning permission is not required for a navigation aid.  However, I assure Deputy Dukes and those Deputies representing the county of Clare that the Commissioners of Irish Lights will comply with whatever requirements of a planning nature may be considered by the local authority to be necessary in relation to the project or aspects of the project.  This project will not go ahead without consultation, permission or whatever other requirements are necessary under the Planning Acts, despite the fact that there is exemption from such requirements.</P>
    <P>In December 1992 the commissioners held a public meeting at Loop Head and since then they have been engaged in a public consultative process with the local community.  In particular the local community have sought reassurance regarding possible risks to public health, and understandably so.  The Commissioners of Irish Lights have undertaken to address these concerns through the commissioning as necessary of further independent advice on the matter.  One such report has been already commissioned. <Col N="570" /> As has been mentioned by Deputy Dukes, it was undertaken by Professor Walton, a highly respected physicist from Galway University whose integrity and whose report is not being impugned in this discussion.  This report was made available at a further public meeting called by the local community on Friday, 12 February last.  The commissioners furnished the meeting with an account of their investigation so far.  An independent expert addressed the meeting on the question of the safety implications of the proposed Loran-C mast.</P>
    <P>The report indicates that the electric field from the mast will be well within all international reference levels and that it is unlikely that any ill-effects would be experienced by any person in the locality. I have been assured that the commissioners will continue to meet with and inform local interests on the outcome of further investigations into the issues of concern.  I am firmly of the view that the widest possible consultative procedure must apply to ensure that both the beneifts of Loran-C and concerns of the local community are fully explored and the facts clearly established.</P>
    <P>I would like to address this issue in the wider context of my concern for safety at sea generally.  I wish to emphasise that I attach considerable importance to improving safety for those using the seas around our coast, be they fishermen, merchant seamen, passengers on board ferries or the increasing number of pleasure craft sailors.  Safety must be tackled on a wide variety of fronts if we are to reduce further the occurrence of maritime tragedies.  In recent years great improvements have been made to the range of safety services available to our seafarers, including the establishment of the Irish Marine Emergency Service. Such services rely heavily on modern technology.</P>
    <P>I genuinely appreciate the legitimate concerns which can be raised, indeed should be raised, about the use of technology. I am adamant that in the case of this project all these concerns will be addressed, both in the context of their requirements of the planning authority <Col N="571" /> and the legitimate specific concerns raised by the local communities.  I have instructed the Department to arrange with the Commissioners of Irish Lights to furnish the planning authority and the local community with an update on the results of investigations to date into the public health question.  I will also require that any issues raised that have not been fully addressed, or indeed any new issues that come to light, be fully examined.</P>
    <P>I am committed to maximum transparency and openess in this question and to ensuring that the consultative process involved takes due account of the legitimate concerns and interests of the local community.</P>

      <P>This matter is of concern to farmers in some counties, not all.  This problem has risen in counties where the farm development service office and the office of the livestock section of the Department of Agriculture Food and Forestry are located in the same town.</P>
      <P>Under the new regulations, the female staff from the farm development service offices have been transferred to the offices of the Department's livestock section.  The net effect of this is that farmers who are entitled to grants &mdash; the farm development service is the body which estimates the amount of grants available for farmers and due to farmers for certain building and reclamation works carried out &mdash; cannot have their applications processed as there is no staff to process them or the data when the jobs are completed. Consequently, those farmers have been deprived of their grants.  I do not know how long this will continue, but instructions were given on 21 January last that those procedures were to be put into operation, they were implemented on 3 February last.</P>

I wish to point out that the amounts outstanding at present range from approximately £800 to £15,000.  One man who put up a slatted house is owed £12,300, which he cannot get.  When he called to the office he was told by senior staff that they did not know when this money would be paid to him.</P>

Farmers in County Roscommon are owed approximately £100,000 and the only way the problem can be solved is by transferring the staff back to the farm development service offices.  I am sure the Minister will favourably consider that proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Common Agricultural Policy reform measures agreed by the Council of Ministers in December last switched the emphasis in the market support system for the beef sector from intervention purchasing towards direct payments to farmers under livestock and headage premium payments.  These changes have major implications for the work levels in the local offices which operate the headage and livestock schemes, under which £340 <Col N="573" /> million was paid out in 1992 to 289,000 farmers.  Payments should be well in excess of £600 million in 1995 and by 1986 they should be £700 million per annum. By any standards that is a very considerable amount of annual payments to farmers under the livestock schemes. This year, the first year of the Common Agricultural Policy reform, there were considerable demands in the processing of those applications.</P>
      <P>The principal changes in the context of this debate are: an increase in the payments made under the special beef premium and suckler cow premium from £35.15 and £68.54 per head in 1992 to £86.15 and £134.02 respectively, in 1995; payments under the special beef premium to be paid twice in an animal's lifetime, that is, at ten months and 22 months &mdash; previously an animal received the premium only once in its lifetime; a deseasonalisation slaughter premium valued at £52.73 per head will be paid on male bovines slaughtered between 1 January and 30 April &mdash; this is to encourage more even slaughtering patterns throughout the year; an extensification premium of £26.36 per head payable on suckler cows and male bovines on holdings with low stocking rates.  Other measures include the introduction of quotas at national and individual farmer levels; national reserves and leasing and transfer of quotas.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that up to 250,000 applications will be received under the special beef, suckler cow, deseasonalisation, ewe premium and sheep headage schemes between 15 November 1992 and 31 March 1993 whereas the number of applications received in the same period last year amounted to approximately 90,000-100,000.  This was because applications were confined during this period last year to sheep schemes and a small number of applications under the special beef premium and suckler cow schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three main reasons for the substantial increase in the number of applications to be received by the Department during this period.  First, the Department allowed farmers to submit a second application under the special beef <Col N="574" /> premium scheme in November-December 1992 in order to facilitate those who might otherwise not have been able to make full claims last year.  Second, a greater number of farmers than normal delayed their applications for the suckler cow scheme until December in order to give themselves more time to establish their individual quotas.</P>
    <P>Third, the Department accepted applications under the special beef premium scheme during the months of January and February of this year in order to ensure that Irish farmers secured the maximum benefits from this scheme and the related spring slaughter premium scheme.  As I mentioned earlier, the new arrangements for the special beef premium scheme provide for a second instalment of the premium to be paid at 22 months.  The fact that this instalment is payable at an age when some male bovines are close to slaughter requires the Department to be more flexible than in the past in so far as application periods are concerned.  For this reason, the Department intends to have three application periods for this scheme.  The Department will also have to process applications under the spring slaughter scheme.  In view of the very significant and substantial increase in the workload caused by these measures and the financial importance of these schemes to the farming community, a decision was made to assign additional staff to this area on a temporary basis.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Department has the task of establishing individual quotas for the ewe premium and suckler cow premium schemes.  The regulations governing these schemes provide for the quotas to be established on the basis of the number of animals for which farmers were paid premia in a reference year. However, the individual farmers who had particular problems in the reference year may choose as their reference year a year other than the reference year chosen by the Department.  While this flexibility is obviously most welcome in that it meets the concerns of many farmers who had particular problems in the reference year, it also places a substantial burden on the Department which will have to examine <Col N="575" /> thousands of individual files manually in order to establish the precise entitlements of farmers.  The burden of this work load will fall on the local offices of the Department.</P>
    <P>As the House is undoubtedly aware, the new arrangements also include provisions for the establishment and allocation of a national reserve and a special reserve for the disadvantaged areas.  I expect that there will be a substantial number of applications for these reserves and these will have to be processed by offices of the Department.  The Department will also have to monitor and approve transfers and leasing of quotas.</P>
    <P>On the question of the payment of farm development grants, the fact is that in January of this year £3.882 million was paid to 1,066 applicants under the control of farmyard pollution and farm improvement programmes.  It is estimated that £3.27 million will be paid to 840 applicants in February, while an additional £3.2 million will be paid in March.  The remaining payments amounting to approximately £1.5 million will be paid as soon as they can be processed.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise that it is only the clerical staff of the farm development service who have been transferred; all other personnel in that area will continue working normally.  Furthermore, the assignment of these staff to other duties is a temporary measure and they will revert to their normal duties as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, if I had been treated with the same respect as that shown to a Government Deputy I would have withdrawn this matter.  I have been told by an unofficial source that the Minister has reacted to the pressure brought to bear on him by the INTO, the teachers who are threatening the industrial action on Friday and the Private Notice Question I put down to him on Monday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is distasteful that teachers should be <Col N="576" /> forced, by pressures beyond their control, to threaten industrial action in order to get what they believe they are entitled to.  We entrust teachers with the responsibility of caring for our children in the community.  I do not need to tell the House that good teachers are very responsible.  They do not wish to get involved in street politics, industrial action or any other activities which they would not regard as normal in a civilised society.</P>
    <P>Any inaction by the Government which forces teachers to go on strike has to be called into question.  The teachers of Milford national school have been told by successive Ministers for Education about the plans for the development of the school.  Because these plans have been put on the back burner once too often, the teachers, who are totally frustrated, decided in consultation with the INTO, to take industrial action.  I know many of these teachers personally and they are upright citizens whom the local community respect.  Their services are very much appreciated by the local community.</P>
    <P>I have had the unpleasant experience of visiting that school, which is in an appalling state.  To use a cliché, it would make people in darkest Africa blush with shame; the conditions there are more akin to conditions in schools in the Third World.  This school which was built to cater for 90 pupils and five teachers now has an enrolment of 270 pupils and ten teachers.  There are no proper sanitary facilities in the school and the conditions have been condemned by a senior official of the North-Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>Do the Department of Education officials fully appreciate the conditions which must be tolerated by teachers and pupils in schools in rural Ireland?  During my time in this House I have heard many Members say that the most reactionary Department of State is the Department of Education &mdash; it cannot be told anything; it knows it all.  There appears to be a lack of appreciation at the most senior level of the need to toe the line.  Irish people do not mind paying taxes in order that proper schools can be provided for <Col N="577" /> their children.  However, I am puzzled as to why proper schools are not being provided.  I am annoyed that pressure has to be brought to to bear on the Department of Education before it makes a decision.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will give the House the good news I have heard through the grapevine, but it would have been much more pleasant and more in line with parliamentary democracy if she had given me a copy of the statement she gave to the Government Deputy from my constituency. I do not believe in stroke politics as they will not get us anywhere.  It was said recently that if Deputy McDaid put the ball in the net he should get the credit for doing so.  Some people who put the ball in the net are not regarded as skilled footballers.  Very often they are lazy people who do not do very much work; they fall into the poaching category, they are called good poachers. There are far too many Deputies in this House who fall into that category.  They should get on with the job.</P>

Thank you for acknowledging the fact that I have been a Deputy for this constituency for the past 31 years&rdquo;. As a Deputy who has an interest in this school the Minister should have given me the good news.  I question whether the Minister would make the statement he is about to make to the House if the INTO had not put pressure on the Minister for Education last week, if the teachers had not threatened industrial action, thus bringing other schools out with them, and if I had not put down a Private Notice Question highlighting the problem.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy has given me the opportunity to outline the Department of Education's intentions in relation to Milford national school, in County Donegal.  This school has developed from a small three teacher school in 1959 to the present large rural school consisting of ten teachers with an enrolment of 277.  It is accepted fully that the conditions with regard to <Col N="579" /> accommodation are not satisfactory.  I am sure they are very close to what Deputy Harte outlined to the House.  The Department of Education has, therefore, approved the provision of two new permanent classrooms, one enlarged, and the necessary refurbishment works to the existing buildings.  The Minister is confident that the completion of this project will without doubt raise the quality of the accommodation in the school and make for a more satisfactory teaching environment, which is what the Deputy called for.</P>
    <P>The present position is that tender documents and specification have been prepared and the process for the invitation of tenders has been set in train. The advertisement inviting tenders for the project will be placed in the newspapers at the earliest possible date and not later than the end of the present month.</P>
    <P>It is now understood that the teachers in the school have decided to withdraw their threat of strike action.  I concur that it is a pity that it had to come to that to get a satisfactory outcome.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this important matter and the Minister of State for attending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is almost 13 years since the former Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, promised the immediate development of Burtonport harbour in two stages: first, dredging and, second, an extension to the pier.  Burtonport is one of the most important fishing ports in Donegal, it is second only to Killybegs.  Its further development is being seriously hampered <Col N="580" /> due to the failure of the Government to allocate funds for the planned improvements. Not alone is Burtonport harbour extensively used by fishermen but it also facilitates the Aranmore ferry, the <i>Kilbrannan.</i></P>
    <P>It is the declared aim of the Minister and the Government to develop the fishing industry and create badly needed employment along our coasts.  The Minister is on a familiarisation tour of the nation's fishing ports at present.  He has already visited Killybegs and I strongly advise him to visit Burtonport as soon as possible to witness the utter congestion that prevails there.  Failing such a visit by the Minister we would appreciate a visit from the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>New fishing licences were allocated by the Minister's predecessor more than a year ago.  A new boat purchased in Scotland has now been added to our fishing fleet.  The owners of the boat are from the Gaeltacht but, unfortunately, they cannot be accommodated in Burtonport and have to go further afield.  The situation is becoming more serious with every passing season.</P>
    <P>I note in the Book of Estimates that the budget for fishery harbour development has been increased from £3 million last year to £3.5 million for 1993, a small but welcome increase.  I appeal to the Minister, and the Minister of State, to make an allocation to Burtonport out of this year's funds so that the dredging of the harbour can commence without further delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan) Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to inform the Deputy that major dredging will be undertaken this year at Burtonport harbour.  As the Deputy will be aware, provision was made under the Department of the Marine's Fishery Harbour Development Programme, 1989 to 1993, for such dredging at Burtonport harbour.  This was confirmed last October by the then Minister of State, Deputy Pat the Cope Gallagher.  This work, when completed, will allow Burtonport to handle larger vessels, which are increasingly becoming a feature of the fleet.  The project will attract 75 per cent grant aid from the Department of the Marine and <Col N="581" /> Donegal County Council will be required to contribute the balance.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Marine in progressing this project has, to date, undertaken a hydrographic survey to determine the bed level and a probing survey to establish the extent of rock present.  A site investigation was undertaken last summer and the results of this investigation have been evaluated and will be used in drawing-up the detailed plans for the dredging.</P>
      <P>This project, which is much needed and crucial to improving the facilities for fishermen at Burtonport, has been included in the Department of the Marine's 1993 programme of work for fishery harbours.  The dredging project, which will be undertaken this year, during the summer months, will mean that bigger vessels and more fishermen will be able to land their catch at Burtonport.  The project will be of benefit to the local fishing industry and, by extension, the local economy and will help ensure a viable future for the harbour.</P>
      <P>As regards the further development of Burtonport harbour, the Deputy may be aware that a new fishery harbour development programme for the period 1994-97 is currently being prepared. Donegal County Council has submitted development proposals to the Department of the Marine for inclusion in this new programme.  Burtonport harbour was among the harbours proposed for development by the county council.  Full consideration will be given to the further development of this harbour in the context of the new programme.  However, until the total programme and its financing has been fully settled, I am not in a position to say what development works can be undertaken at Burtonport harbour, or any other harbour, during the 1994-97 period.  I will take up the Deputy's invitation to visit Burtonport.</P>

      <P>Last September a Dunmore East trawler, the <i>Orchidee,</i> was <Col N="582" /> involved in an incident with a very large French trawler in the fishing ground between the Welsh and south eastern Irish coast known as the Smalls, a fishing ground well known for prawns.  As a result of the incident two young fishermen from Dunmore East died.  The third crewman survived.  No report on the incident has been issued.  I should like the Minister to tell me when we can expect the report and what authorities are involved in compiling it.  The incident occurred in international waters which are probably closer to the Welsh and British coast than the Irish coast.  I should like to know if all three countries &mdash; Ireland, Britain and France &mdash; are involved in drawing up the report or if it is the responsibility of the Irish Department of the Marine or the Department of the Marine in France.</P>
      <P>The families of the two young Irish fishermen are disturbed because they do not know what is happening and they have not been kept informed by the Department of the Marine.  In view of the frequency of such accidents off our coast I suggest that the Department should appoint a liaison officer to communicate with families in circumstances such as this.  This is the second incident involving a Dunmore East trawler in the past two years.  In August 1991 a boat called the <i>Stelimar</i> was burned off Howth in the Irish Sea and another crewman from Dunmore East died.  His family has not as yet had any report on the accident. It is poor form that a Government Department cannot inform the family concerned about what is going on, what happened and what action will be taken as a result of the incident in question.</P>

      <P>A collision between the Irish registered trawler <i>Orchidee</i> and the French trawler <i>Agena</i> occurred on 22 September 1992, 50 miles off Dunmore East in international waters.  The <i>Orchidee</i> had three crew members on board.  One crew member was rescued by the French trawler, the two other crew members lost their lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A marine surveyor of the Department was appointed under section 728 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, to report on the accident.  The purpose of the investigation <Col N="583" /> is to determine the cause of the accident and to recommend measures to prevent a recurrence.  The marine surveyor has interviewed the sole survivor from the <i>Orchidee,</i> he has not as yet been able to interview the French crew, nor, as a result, complete his investigation. The reasons for this delay are as follows.</P>
    <P>The French maritime authorities are proceeding with a judicial inquiry into the accident.  The head of maritime affairs in Auray, France has been judicially empowered to carry out the inquiry.  He has advised that he will be forwarding questions relating to the accident to the Irish authorities through the diplomatic channels.  Under this procedure the Irish authorities may at the same time and in the same manner address questions to the French authorities.  A comprehensive list of questions relating to the accident has been prepared by my marine surveyor and transmission through the French Embassy to the French authorities.</P>
    <P>Pending receipt of questions from the French authorities and the hearing of the case, my Department's marine surveyor will not be given access to the French crew for questioning or obtain any other information from French sources.</P>
    <P>The judicial nature of the French inquiry will result, therefore, in some delay in the completion of the Irish investigation. A report of the incident will, subject to legal considerations, be published as soon as possible thereafter.  I wish to tell Deputy Deasy that I will consider the appointment of a liaison officer from the Department to consult with the families of the victims of this accident and any other accidents which may occur in the future.</P>

      <P>As Deputies know, there were virtually continuous storms during an extended period in January.  These storms were particularly bad in the north west, and the direction of the gale force winds, combined with seas as rough as anyone in that area can remember, resulted in major damage along the coast. Some areas which were previously thought to be sheltered and totally safe from such storms were affected on this <Col N="584" /> occasion.  The storms left a trail of destruction along the west Sligo coast from Portavade, to Derk, Dromore West, Carronrush, Easky, Pullaheeney, Lacken and Inniscrone.  Considerable damage was caused to the coastal protection walls which remained after the storms of the eighties.  Some fishermen suffered very big losses to equipment &mdash; one fisherman lost more than 200 lobster pots &mdash; and some roads were ruined.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer tonight to the damage caused to farms and the losses now being suffered by farmers who live beside the coast.  The main damage has been caused by stones and debris of all sorts which has been carried by the sea into the fields along the coast - there are tonnes of stones and debris in fields in these vulnerable areas.  I recently inspected the damage, together with two local councillors, Paul Conmy and Mary Barrett, who know the area well.  It is difficult for anyone who lives inland to fully realise the destruction a storm driven sea can cause, especially when the pounding continues, as it did in January, for days or weeks.</P>
      <P>When a somewhat similar problem arose as a result of storms during the mid-eighties, the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy, adopted a very sympathetic approach and many of the farmers received grant-aid through, I think, the dry land reclamation scheme which enabled them to bring their fields, or what remained of them, back to productivity. I know that the present Minister will be equally helpful in finding a suitable scheme through which farmers, who have to deal with this new problem in addition to the existing problems they share with all small farmers in the west, can be grant-aided.</P>

      <P>A I indicated in my reply to a parliamentary question from the Deputy on 10 February 1993, I am aware that some damage was caused to farm land in west Sligo by the movement of debris from the foreshore during the January storms.  I am also aware that removal of debris from the area was funded under the programme for western development in the mid eighties but this <Col N="585" /> programme ended in 1990.  At present, there are no funds available to my Department which could be used for such cases.</P>
      <P>It would appear that recurrence of the type of damage referred to by the Deputy might be averted by coastal protection measures.  I will bring the matter to the notice of my colleagues, the Ministers for the Environment and Defence and Marine, who have responsibility for coastal protection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise a very important matter tonight. Applications for Land Registry maps have not been dealt with for the past six months due to the fact that the Records Survey Branch of the Land Commission was transferred from 23 Upper Merrion Street, Dublin, to the National Archives, Bishop Street, Dublin, on 17 August, 1992.  There is a huge backlog of applications waiting to be dealt with by the Minister's Department and transfers and sales of property have been seriously hampered by the ridiculous closure of the Records Survey Branch to the general public for such a lengthy period.</P>
      <P>I wish to remind the Minister of a photostat message sent by his Department to the people concerned which stated: &ldquo;The Records Survey Branch of the Land Commission will be transferred from the rear of 23 Upper Merrion Street, Dublin 2, to the National Archives, Bishop Street, Dublin 8.  In order to facilitate the move, the public office of the Records Survey Branch will be closed for approximately three months from Monday, 17 August 1992, and any inconvenience caused is regretted&rdquo;.  This delay is completely inexcusable.  I know it is not the fault of the Minister &mdash; the general election disrupted his activities in the Department &mdash; who is a man of action.  I ask him to ensure that this office is opened tomorrow morning so that the backlog of applications can be dealt with within two months if possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Sheehan has brought this matter to my attention. Because he has raised the matter I <Col N="586" /> will make an additional effort to ensure that it is resolved satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>Following the sale of the Land Commission building, all Land Commission records had to be moved to new premises in Bishop Street.  This was a major undertaking as it is estimated that there were in the region of eight-nine million documents in storage relating to land transactions since 1881.  Clearly such a treasury of records has great archival and historical significance and each one had to be individually catalogued and moved in sequence.  In addition, custom built storage units had to be provided in a controlled temperature environment.  It was necessary to close down the records branch from 17 August 1992 to effect this move and notices were inserted in the national press to this effect.</P>
      <P>All documents were <i>in situ</i> by mid-November of last year and the records branch was open to the public shortly after that date.  Requests for documents have been processed normally.  There has been some delay in issuing Land Commission maps as they were still in storage pending the installation of specialised mapping cabinets.  However, within the past few days some of the mapping cabinets and maps have been transferred to Bishop Street and it is anticipated that the remainder will be <i>in situ</i> within a week or so at the latest.  It will then be a matter for Land Registry staff to process requests for maps as normal.</P>
      <P>I will take-up this matter personally in deference to my colleague, Deputy Sheehan, who raised it in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I must disagree with my colleague, Deputy Sheehan, when he describes the Minister as a man of action.  The issue I wish to raise tonight &mdash; the appeals system for disadvantaged areas &mdash; clearly shows the greatest level of inactivity on any issue I have ever seen in my political history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An appeals body was established in June 1991 to give farmers the opportunity to make a case for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme if they met the necessary criteria.  The deadline for submission of applications was 26 July 1991. There was a great response to the scheme &mdash; 1,539 groups, encompassing 40,000 <Col N="587" /> farmers and 3.25 million acres, applied for inclusion in the scheme.  The deadline for applications for reclassification of areas to a higher status was 6 December 1991. Various Department officials called to farmers after that date to establish the stocking rate, the amount of feed bought in and so on, as part of a wide-ranging survey of the area under appeal.  The survey commenced in December 1991 and every farmer involved was visited by April 1992.  However, practically no progress has been made since then.  Only two people in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry were assigned to assess the survey data at that time.  An additional four people were assigned to that task in the run up to the general election.</P>
    <P>It is disgraceful that the Minister is adopting such a casual approach to the issue of the appeals system.  Farm viability can often be determined by the fact that an applicant is successful.  In addition, the appeals system has not been given enough attention by the farm organisations who have failed, through the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the central review mechanism, to give this matter the necessary impetus.  Fianna Fáil has played politics for far too long with the issue of disadvantaged areas.  Perhaps it is afraid to make the necessary decisions too quickly in case it upsets some of its supporters. As long as Fianna Fáil continues to adopt this wait and see approach farm families will continue to be deprived of essential income.  I call on the Minister tonight to clearly indicate when the appeals data will be processed and presented to Brussels, when the successful applicants will be notified and if they can expect to qualify for the increased aid in 1993.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say at the outset that there has been a number of reviews of the disadvantaged areas scheme over the past ten or 12 years.  To the best of my knowledge, the reviews, including the reviews of the areas I represent, together with Deputy Sheehan and Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, were carried out on the basis of spot checks of individual farms in <Col N="588" /> different townlands.  The outcome of all reviews under different Governments was unsatisfactory, to say the very least. It was decided on this occasion that the job should be carried out in a proper and comprehensive manner.  As Deputy Hogan said, a comprehensive survey was carried out.  An appeals tribunal was established under the chairmanship of Professor Seamus Sheehy.  This tribunal consists of members of the farming organisations who ensure that there is objectivity in the matter.  There are also two Land Commission officials on the tribunal.  The tribunal is actively engaged in the enormous and complex task of analysing the data from the survey of 10,000 townlands.  When one considers that there are three or four farms in each townland this gives an idea of the task facing them.  Farmers in 10,000 townlands appealed their non-inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  That gives some idea of the level of dissatisfaction with the previous efforts in this regard.</P>
      <P>This analysis involves the detailed examination of the data in respect of each townland in order to maximise the area which qualifies under the required criteria. That is the objective of the people on that panel, they have to try to ensure that the maximum number of families, farms and townlands are included under the disadvantaged areas scheme.  As Deputy Hogan said, it is very much to the advantage of Ireland as a member state to have the maximum number of areas qualifying under this scheme. Because of its size and complexity, it is not easy to predict when the task will be completed.  While it is in everybody's interest to have the job done quickly, it is equally important that the panel should carry out a through analysis as a prerequisite to having acceptable recommendations for submission to the Commission in Brussels for ratification. Once the submission is ratified there will be no delay in making payments to farmers in successful areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Priority Question No. 8 and Question No. 46 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will be aware of the commitments contained in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-97</i> in relation to refugees and asylum seekers and I can confirm that I will be taking whatever action may be appropriate in order to meet these commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I think it appropriate, to make the point that Government policy on political asylum is and has been in accordance with our international commitments arising under the 1951 United Nations Convention on the status of refugees, as amended by the 1967 New York Protocol.  In this regard, a procedure was agreed in 1985 with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) providing the administrative structure for the processing of applications for refugee status.  The arrangements provide a comprehensive framework within which the examination of an application for political asylum takes place as well as providing for the participation of the UNHCR and the <Col N="399" /> Department of Foreign Affairs in the consideration of such applications.  The existing procedure was endorsed further by UNHCR in 1991.</P>
    <P>The 1985 Agreement with UNHCR provides for the following:</P>
    <P>(a)  asylum seekers will not be refused entry or removed from the State until given an opportunity to present a case fully;</P>
    <P>(b)  every application is examined in accordance with the 1951 UN Convention;</P>
    <P>(c)  this does not prevent humanitarian considerations being considered which might justify permission to remain in the State;</P>
    <P>(d)  every facility, including interpreters where possible, is provided to help an applicant in making a case;</P>
    <P>(e)  the need for confidentiality and privacy is given high priority;</P>
    <P>(f)  an applicant is informed that he may contact UNHCR or a local representative;</P>
    <P>(g)  each applicant is given a personal interview;</P>
    <P>(h)  UNHCR and the Department of Foreign Affairs are consulted on each application.</P>
    <P>This formal procedural agreement with UNHCR has been found by the Courts to be legally binding.</P>
    <P>In summary, therefore, while accepting the necessity to take full account of comments emanating from reputable sources concerning the practice followed in asylum cases &mdash; and I have already made my position clear in this regard &mdash; it is instructive to recall the extent of this country's extensive compliance with international requirements.</P>
    <P>It is necessary also, I believe, to strike a note of caution concerning the scope for fresh initiatives on this subject.  No matter how one deals with the question of asylum seekers, one has to face the <Col N="400" /> reality that the regulatory regime in place &mdash; and this is the experience in other jurisdictions also &mdash; will be tested on an ongoing basis and that decisions will therefore fall to be made by the authorities which, even though fully in compliance with the law, will be the subject of controversy.  It would be misleading if I, or anybody else, were to pretend that procedural changes would ever get away from the reality that, if the law is to have any meaning at all, some applications by asylum seekers simply have to be refused.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Priority Question No. 9 and oral Question No. 41 together.</P>
      <P>It is not the practice for Ministers for Justice to make statements to the House about specific Garda operations except in singular instances where the circumstances are so exceptional that such a course is deemed to be appropriate.  All I propose to say is that all allegations of the existence of protection rackets are investigated and prosecutions are taken in consultation with the Director of Public Prosecutions where evidence exists to warrant such a course.  I can assure the House that no effort is being spared by the gardaí in dealing with these matters. I cannot however go into detail concerning Garda activities as Garda efforts might well be adversely affected were I to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 50 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that the Garda Representative Association and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors referred a claim to arbitration to have a number of allowances which are paid to members of the Force made pensionable. The Arbitrator recommended in March, 1983 that some of those allowances &mdash; including rent allowance &mdash; should be made pensionable with effect from 1 October, 1982.  The recommendations contained in the Garda Arbitration <Col N="402" /> Board Report No. 15 have been fully implemented.</P>
    <P>The full-year cost in 1993 if rent allowance were to be made pensionable for members and surviving spouses of members &mdash; estimated at 682 and 1,845 respectively &mdash; who retired before 1 October, 1982 is estimated to be about £1.2 million.  This estimate does not provide for retrospection.  An estimate of the cost in subsequent years would require detailed information on, and analysis of, the age distribution and hence the life expectancy of the pensioners in question. The information readily available would suggest that the corresponding cost in 1997 would be of the order of £600,000, falling to some £200,000 by the year 2002.</P>
    <P>The Garda Pensioners Association subsequently asked to have the benefits of the recommendation concerning rent allowance applied to their members who retired before 1 October, 1982.  That Association was informed in August, 1984 that, because of the very considerable additional costs involved and the critical state of the Exchequer finances, the recommendation could not be applied to those members.  There are no proposals to change that decision.</P>

      <P>The Programme for Government embodies a commitment to implement the report of the InterDepartmental Group on Urban Crime and Disorder which contains a number of specific recommendations in relation to the North Clondalkin area.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's description of the situation in Ronanstown. While the report of the Inter-Departmental Group &mdash; copies of which are available in the Dáil Library &mdash; does show that difficulties have certainly arisen in the North Clondalkin area, it also makes it clear that the extent of the problem can be overstated.  The report contains a balanced account of the actual situation and, specifically, adverts to the dangers of overstatement, which certainly does nothing for the people of Ronanstown. Paragraph 2.5 of the report states that:</P>
      <P>One of the unfortunate effects of many of the things that have been said about Ronanstown is that they convey the impression that for most members of its community there is this &ldquo;dark&rdquo; side of experience and little else.</P>
      <P>Nothing could be further from the truth.  What is most encouraging in fact is that the vast majority of people in Ronanstown are just as socially conscious and committed to the development of their area, to the development of positive community spirit and the provision of future opportunities for their children, as they are anywhere else in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since December, 1991, the strength of Ronanstown Garda Station has increased from 46 to 56 Gardaí.  Community policing is a major feature in the fight against crime in the area, and in that connection, there are now one sergeant and ten gardaí working on community policing duties from the station.  The area also has the benefit of the services of two JLO gardaí, one attached to Clondalkin Garda station and the other attached to Ballyfermot <Col N="404" /> Garda station.  Moreover, an additional Garda car has recently been assigned to Ronanstown station.  Finally, I am assured by the Garda authorities that the manning levels at Ronanstown Garda station are kept under continuous review.</P>

      <P>As has been indicated to the House previously, there is an administrative agreement between the British and Irish Authorities applying the rule of specialty whereby, following a person's extradition to the United Kingdom, only the charges on foot of which the person <Col N="405" /> has been extradited may, subject to very limited exceptions, be proceeded with. Overall, those arrangements have operated satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>Section 3 of our Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987 provides for the placing of the administrative arrangements on a statutory footing by enabling the Minister for Justice to make an order applying those provisions of Part II of the Extradition Act, 1965, relating to the rule of specialty, to the arrangements we operate under Part III of that Act with the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>To date no such order has been made because of the absence of reciprocal provisions in United Kingdom law.  The matter has been the subject of discussions within the Anglo Irish Conference and I am pleased to be able to inform the House that the United Kingdom authorities have included provision in their Criminal Justice Bill, 1992 &mdash; which has not yet been enacted &mdash; in relation to specialty.  The enactment of that legislation will enable orders to be made under both it and our 1987 Act and thereby give statutory effect to the rule of specialty in extradition arrangements between the two jurisdictions.</P>

      <P>
        <Col N="406" /> I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>Codification of the criminal law would certainly be a desirable and worthwhile objective.  Our criminal law is to be found in a large number of different statutes, many of them predating the foundation of the State.  However, the goal of codification would not be easily achieved because of a number of factors, chief among them being the question of resources, both human and financial. Even if the necessary resources were provided, the task would (on the basis of experience elsewhere) involve 15-20 years work.  That is on the basis that codification should be accomplished all in one go, so to speak.  But there is another way to approach the problem.</P>
      <P>My general attitude and that of the Government in this matter is to tackle as a priority the individual areas of the criminal law that are most in need of attention and modernisation.</P>
      <P>Examples of that approach can already be found in the laws which were enacted at the instance of the previous Government to update the criminal law in relation to:</P>
      <P>&mdash; incitement to hatred</P>
      <P>&mdash; receiving stolen property</P>
      <P>&mdash; firearms and offensive weapons</P>
      <P>&mdash; abolition of the death penalty</P>
      <P>&mdash; rape and sexual assault</P>
      <P>&mdash; forensic testing, including DNA profiling</P>
      <P>&mdash; criminal damage to property</P>
      <P>&mdash; criminal evidence.</P>
      <P>In so far as future action is concerned, I am happy to say that a Criminal Justice Bill dealing with a procedure for the review of unduly lenient sentences, victim impact assessments in sexual offence cases and compensation to victims will be brought forward shortly.  The Bill dealing with telephone tapping has just been restored to the Order Paper.  In addition, draft Bills are being prepared in my Department in relation to</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="407" />&mdash; fraud and dishonesty</P>
    <P>&mdash; confiscation of the proceeds of crime</P>
    <P>&mdash; criminal insanity including diminished responsibility</P>
    <P>&mdash; suicide and the abolition of the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours and consequential changes in the law in relation to powers of arrest without warrant</P>
    <P>&mdash; miscarriage of justice</P>
    <P>&mdash; extradition</P>
    <P>&mdash; juvenile justice</P>
    <P>&mdash; public order offences</P>
    <P>&mdash; homosexual offences.</P>
    <P>I should also say that all of these Bills are part of the programme of criminal law reform contained in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997.</i></P>
    <P>This is an impressive record by any standard and it reflects the priority which the Government attaches to the development and modernisation of the principal areas of our criminal law.  It will be observed that a number of the items which were regarded by the Supreme Court judge referred to in the question as in need of reform viz., criminal insanity, diminished responsibility, the abolition of felonies and misdemeanours and the powers of arrest without warrant are among the matters in respect of which amending legislation is being prepared.</P>
    <P>I should also say that the Law Reform Commission are currently in the process of examining the law on offences against the person &mdash; another matter of concern to the judge.  The Government will act on this report as soon as it is received and considered and this will result in a major step forward in the codification of this old and relatively obscure area of the law.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>In so far as legislation can combat the abuse of alcohol by young persons, I think we have in place a comprehensive framework to tackle the problem in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988.  Part IV of the Act deals with this particular matter and it reflects the determination of this House to make it as difficult as is legislatively feasible for a person under 18 years to purchase or otherwise obtain drink or to consume it, other than in a private residence.</P>
      <P>The statistics which are available tend to support the view that these measures are having a beneficial effect.  In this connection, I am circulating a tabular statement with my reply which shows a significant increase in the numbers of prosecutions and convictions for offences involving the supply or sale of drink to persons under age since the 1988 Act came into force.</P>
      <P>However, I do recognise that there are no grounds for complacency in this matter.  That is why I fully support the development of voluntary age card schemes organised on a local basis with the cooperation of parents, the Gardaí, vintners, schools and other interested bodies.</P>
      <P>I think we would be fooling ourselves if we thought that under age drinking can be solved by more and more restrictive legislative provisions.  The problem cannot be considered in isolation from the social, cultural and economic factors which are involved.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 57 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>On Monday 8 February last, I visited Cork East Divisional Headquarters of the Garda Síochána at Anglesea Street, and in the course of my visit met with representatives of the following groups: Knocknaheeny Youth Club, St. Vincent's Hurling and Football Club, Muintir na Tire, Community representatives from the Mahon, Togher, Mayfield and Knocknaheeny areas of the City.</P>
      <P>I also met with an interdepartmental group which was set up in Cork city last December to consider what input public authorities (apart from the Garda Síochána) might have in tackling Cork's underlying crime problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anglesea Street station is a large modern building opened a few short years ago.  It offered an ideally located city centre venue for the many groups who wished to speak with me about policing, crime etc. in Cork on the occasion of my first visit as Minister for Justice.  In that sense, it was a &ldquo;first&rdquo;, but I am not aware that it caused any feeling of resentment among the gardaí in Cork, and so I do not accept that it was something <Col N="410" /> that should not have occurred, or should not be repeated.  Indeed, I should add that I met some of the groups concerned at the instigation of local Garda management, and the community gardaí who liaise with these groups were present at the meeting in question.</P>
    <P>As regards the discussions I had with the gardaí I met there, let me say that the local Garda management gave me a comprehensive briefing on crime in Cork and on policing difficulties being experienced in that city.  The Garda authorities informed me that a specific plan of action was drawn up last year to deal with the crime problems being experienced in the Cork area.  This plan includes the greater use and closer co-ordination of foot and mobile patrols, the frequent use of checkpoints at various locations at unpredictable intervals, the surveillance of suspects and the targeting of Garda resources to meet specific anti-crime needs in particular areas.  In addition, Regional Crime conferences are held regularly between officers of the Minster Division to co-ordinate anti-crime activity in the area.  Certain other specific measures have also been taken by the Garda authorities but it would not be in the interest of effective crime prevention or detection to provide any details in relation to them.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities also informed me that community based crime prevention schemes such as Neighbourhood Watch, Community Alert, the Juvenile Liaison Officer Scheme and the Garda Schools Programme, which was extended to Cork last year, are operating very successfully.</P>
    <P>I assured the local management that they and the Garda Commissioner had my full support in their efforts to deal adequately with the problems they face as law enforces in a large modern city.  I was in a position to inform them that eight additional gardaí were being assigned to Cork city later that week and that a substantial number of trainee gardaí would be assigned to Cork from the beginning of June.  In addition, I undertook to review certain matters <Col N="411" /> which the local Garda management consider militate against effective policing.</P>

      <P>Sixty-two members of the Garda Síochana are serving on international peace-keeping missions abroad at present.

      <P>The service of members of the Garda Síochána on such overseas missions have two significant merits.

Second, it provides unique opportunities for individual members of the Garda Síochána to gain valuable work experience at conflict resolution.  Garda management and members at every level are proud of the force's international exposure and I am sure this sentiment is widely shared by Members on all sides in this House.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities are very strongly committed to ensuring that the perpetrators of attacks on elderly people are vigorously pursued.  Indeed, the measures taken by the Garda authorities to deal with the problem have proved to be very effective in that there was a decrease in the level of such attacks recorded in the period 1984 to 1991. While the 1992 figures are not yet available the indications are that there has been no appreciable change in this situation. I mention the figures only in the interest of balance and to show the commitment with which this problem has been and is being tackled.  I would of course never accept any level of attacks on the elderly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities, in conjunction with Muintir na Tíre, are continuing to promote the community alert scheme which is the rural equivalent of neighbourhood watch and which involves local people maintaining contact with elderly people and bringing any suspicious circumstances to the notice of the Garda.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are now 441 community alert schemes in existence in every Garda division outside the Dublin metropolitan area.  I am also informed by the Garda authorities that they are currently involved in the production of a community alert video aimed at increasing awareness among the elderly of measures which can be taken to avoid and prevent attack and which will assist in bringing culprits to justice in the event of attack. <Col N="416" /> Another important initiative taken by the Garda is the inclusion in crime prevention literature of information and advice for the elderly on the action to be taken in the event of attack.</P>
    <P>In addition, the successful community policing scheme, which was put in place in 100 rural stations in September 1991, has enabled the Garda to spend more time on operational duties, including in particular visits to the elderly.  There is a commitment in the Programme for Government to extend this scheme to other stations in the country.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that the Garda and the members of the community involved in crime prevention initiatives will be making a special effort in this &ldquo;European Year of the Elderly and Solidarity amongst Generations&rdquo; to ensure both that our elderly people are not left vulnerable to attack and that the position of the elderly in our society is improved through Garda involvement in such community initiatives as the &ldquo;Reach Out Campaign&rdquo; and &ldquo;Helplink South&rdquo;.  In addition, all members of the Garda Síochána have been encouraged to become involved at local level with community groups involved in work with the elderly.</P>
    <P>I have no function in relation to the question of compelling utility companies calling on senior citizens to display forms of indentification.  However, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Crime Prevention Unit promotes and encourages the implementation of secure identification card systems by companies whose business involves calling upon householders and provides advice on request to these companies on all relevant aspects.  In addition, the Garda Síochána use all available opportunities to advise the public, and in particular the elderly, not to let anyone enter their homes without proper identification.  I would urge all elderly people to exercise caution in relation to dealing with strangers. Elderly people in any doubt whatsoever about the bona fides of callers should refuse them admittance and call the Garda immediately for assistance.</P>

      <P>Sex offenders, in common with other prisoners, have access to a range of medical, psychiatric, psychological and welfare services in the prisons.  During a court hearing on 9 October 1992 Council for the State, through a misunderstanding made claims for those services <Col N="418" /> as they affect sex offenders which were overstated.  At a court hearing on 14 December, 1992 these claims were quite properly withdrawn.</P>
      <P>I endorse the view that one of the primary objectives of the prison system is to provide prisoners with such help, guidance, counselling, education and training as will lead them, as far as practicable, to a constructive life in the community on release.  This rehabilitative objective is very difficult to realise in practice, but I believe that we should never cease trying to achieve it.</P>
      <P>The objective has particular significance where sex offenders are concerned given the imperative of discouraging repeat offences on release. Experience in other countries suggests that there are no easy means of achieving results with this kind of offender.  Nevertheless we must try for the best possible results.  Therefore, I have, endorsed the work of a special group in my Department which is carrying out an urgent study of possibilities.  The group has been asked to advise whether there may be available a programme or programmes of treatment which will be practicable, deliverable, sustainable, susceptible to proper evaluation at all stages and which will be effective and cost-efficient.  I expect to have an initial report from this group within a month or so.  I will make a further announcement when I have considered it.</P>

      <P>There are 547 women members in the Garda Síochána at present.  Their numbers by rank are as follows: Garda, 520; Sergeant, 25; Inspector, 1; Superintendent, 1.  Before 1989, women did not compete on equal terms with men to join the Garda Síochána.  However, approximately one in every three candidates now offered a position in the Garda, following success at the Civil Service Commission interview, is a woman. This percentage success rate is roughly proportional to the number of women <Col N="420" /> presenting at interview to join the Gardaí.</P>
      <P>The effect of the marriage bar, which applied to the Garda Síochána as it did in the Civil Service generally, up to 1973, has severly impacted on the overall number of women in the Force, especially in the supervisory ranks.  There are now equal opportunities for advancement within the Garda Síochána and I firmly expect to see women rising through the ranks in a significant way in the future.</P>

      <P>The information which is available <Col N="422" /> in relation to drug seizures by gardaí and customs officers is contained in the Garda Commissioner's Annual Report on Crime, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.  The 1992 report is not yet available.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure the House that the Garda authorities are treating the problem of drug offending with the highest priority and I fully support their efforts in this respect.  The Garda authorities continually monitor the drug situation in this country and they constantly review and adapt their strategies as appropriate to deal with it.</P>
      <P>In particular they co-operate very closely with the customs authorities to curb the supply of drugs to this country. Such co-operation is all the more important in relation to the open border situation which now exists following completion of the Internal Market and in this respect measures have been taken to ensure that the agencies involved can operate the most effective and co-ordinated programme of enforcement to meet the demands of the new situation.</P>
      <P>Intelligence-based strategies are central in combating the importation of drugs and the closest international co-operation is an essential prerequisite if such strategies are to prove effective. There are a number of important fora for such co-operation.  Of most significance is the decision by the European Council that a Europol Drugs Unit should be established as soon as possible to act as a centralised exchange and co-ordination unit for, in particular, drug-related information between member states.  This unit will be of great practical benefit in combating the international trafficking of drugs and I look forward to the establishment of the Unit at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities treat drug law enforcement as a priority.  All members of the Garda Síochána deal with law enforcement aspects of drug misuse within their operational area and there are now gardaí specially trained in this area in every Garda Division.  In addition, specific Garda drug squads operate in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and <Col N="423" /> Galway and, at present small specialist units are in operation in Dublin's north inner city, Ballymun, Ballyfermot and Tallaght.  Similar specialist units are set up on a temporary basis in other areas as required.  The services of the drug squad are also made available to all areas as required.</P>
    <P>A National Drug Unit, which was set up in 1990 and which is based in Garda Headquarters co-ordinates the Garda anti-drug efforts in this country and also acts as a liaison body with international drug enforcement agencies.  In addition, the Revenue Commissioners have recently established a national drugs team with over seventy staff consisting of intelligence units, maritime units and sniffer dog units, which will be strategically based at locations throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Initiatives have also been taken in the legislative area.  One of the most effective measures which can be taken against drug traffickers is to deprive them of the profits gained from their illegal activity and work on a Bill dealing with this matter is proceeding as a matter of priority in my Department.  I expect to be able to introduce this Bill at an early date.</P>
    <P>While every effort is made to deal with drug abuse through law enforcement, this alone cannot solve the problem.  Every member of society has a role to play and this role can be as important as the Garda response.  The Government is aware that there is a need to tackle the drug problem on every front through a National Drug Strategy.  As part of this work the Minister for Health in 1991 launched the Government strategy to prevent drug misuse, which sets realistic and achievable objectives for the reduction both in the supply of and demand for drugs.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy and the House that the drug problem has and will continue to be the subject of ongoing attention by the relevant authorities.</P>

      <P>A sub-contractor holding a Certificate of Authorisation, C2, issued by the Revenue Commissioners is entitled to receive payments from a principal contractor without deduction of tax.  The Revenue Commissioners became aware of abuses in the system whereby sub-contractors used certificates of authorisation issued in the name of other sub-contractors or used forged certificates.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the new regulations which came into operation on 8 February 1993 were designed to counteract these abuses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new certificates contain the photograph of the sub-contractor.  The sub-contractor must present the certificate in person to the principal contractor before payment is made without deduction of tax.  Where the sub-contractor is a company the certificate must contain the name of a person nominated by the company on its behalf.  The regulations provide that in the case of a company the nominated person must be a director. However, in certain circumstances where <Col N="427" /> it is not practicable, in the opinion of the inspector, to have a director nominated, then a full-time employee of the company may be nominated instead to hold the certificate.  To facilitate companies the inspector is also prepared to issue multiple certificates in the name of different nominees where the circumstances warrant it.  Companies which have multiple contracts with the same principal contractor need only present the certificate of authorisation once a year.</P>
    <P>Discussions were held with the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, and its views were taken on board in drawing up the new provisions.  Further discussions to review the system will be held with the CIF in six months time.  While it is accepted that there is an additional compliance burden the Revenue Commissioners understand that the changes are generally welcomed by the industry as a means of counteracting abuse.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Central Bank, which is the body with primary responsibility for interest rates, that the general rise in retail interest rates in October included a rise in building society commercial mortgage rates.  While one building society has increased its commercial mortgage rates since then, the remainder have not done so.  However, many commercial mortgages (and other borrowings) with other financial institutions carry rates of interest related to the interbank <Col N="428" /> market, and these rates fluctuate in line with interbank rates.</P>
      <P>The Government was very much aware of the burden of high interest rates on both residential mortgage holders and on businesses and their employees, when it decided to devalue the Irish currency. Since the devaluation interbank interest rates have fallen sharply, and many businesses have benefited from this.  Further reductions in interest rates are expected during the course of the year and this will help borrowers in general, including small firms and those in the tourism industry.  In anticipation of these developments, I announced on 30 January that proposed exchange rate guarantee schemes for business and for mortgage institutions would not be implemented.</P>

      <P>The drainage works to which the question refers were carried out by a group representing local landowners.  They were not part of the Boyne Catchment Drainage Scheme and the Commissioners of Public Works have no responsibility for them.</P>

Their precise requirements are kept under constant review, having regard to the availability of new technology as well as changing operational needs as it would be inappropriate to limit their equipment to their requirements and the technology of any particular time.  A current example of a development which may give rise to change is the review of the Garda information technology requirements which is being carried out at present by outside consultants.  The findings of the consultants, which should be available within the next few months, will be evaluated with a view to determining what implications they might have for Garda communications.</P>

      <P>Roscommon and Sligo County Councils have, over the years, examined the possibilities of upgrading or replacing the existing N4 route across the Curlew mountains.  In all, more than a dozen possibilities were considered.  Three routes which the councils considered most favourable on engineering and economic grounds were included for further study in an environmental impact statement (EIS).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July 1992, Roscommon County Council submitted the environmental impact statement to my Department and applied for certification in accordance with Article 38 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1990 as amended.  In November, the county council were informed that a local public inquiry will be held into the environmental impact statement and that the inquiry will also deal with any compulsory purchase order which may be required in respect of the scheme.  They <Col N="435" /> have been asked to take the opportunity to review the environmental impact statement in the light of objections received and any new information on sub-soil conditions and, having regard to these matters, to make any adjustments which are considered necessary in drawing up any necessary compulsory purchase order.</P>
    <P>In view of my quasi-judicial role in the determination of the application for certification and any necessary compulsory purchase order, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further about the scheme at this stage.  My decision will be based on the report of the inquiry, the environmental impact statement and all submissions made to me within the specified period in relation to it, as well as any objections made to me within the specified period against confirmation of any compulsory purchase order.</P>

      <P>The Department of the Marine, in accordance with long established practice, requires a contribution from the relevant local authority towards the cost of development works undertaken at local authority owned fishery harbours.  The level of contribution sought depends on geographic location. A 50 per cent contribution is sought in respect of projects undertaken on the east and south-east coasts and a 25 per cent contribution is sought in respect of projects on the south-west and west coasts.</P>
      <P>I believe that some significant level of contribution to these costs should be made by local authorities towards development works at harbours for which they have responsibility.  However, I do appreciate that in the present financial circumstances many local authorities have great difficulty in meeting the costs of these harbour developments.  This is especially so in the areas where a 50 per cent contribution is sought.  I am therefore proposing to review this position in consultation with the various maritime local authorities and the Ministers for the Environment and Finance.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for the 1991 special beef premium scheme for 27 animals on 12 July 1991.  It was discovered on 28 March 1992 that two of the animals applied for had been sold prior to application which meant that the person named made a false declaration on his application. Under EC regulations he must be debarred from the scheme for 12 months from the date the error came to light.  The application of the person named has been reviewed but there are no grounds for altering the decision to debar him from the special beef premium scheme until 28 March 1993.</P>

      <P>Only one of the persons named is registered as herdowner in this case.  Information has recently come to light which indicated that he may have been given credit for a greater forage area than he was entitled to and the amount of grants due for past years will, therefore, have to be re-assessed. I expect that this re-assessment will be completed shortly and a letter setting out the full position will then be issued to the herdowner involved.</P>

      <P>The provision and upgrading of stations and facilities on the suburban rail network is a matter for Iarnrod Éireann.  However, in this context I would draw the Deputy's attention to the recently published Interim Report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative (in which Iarnród Éireann is an active participant) which includes a recommendation for the construction of new DART Stations at Fairview and Barrow Street.  These recommendations will be subject to further extensive analysis, the results of which will be reflected in the final report of the DTI which is expected in April 1993.</P>
      <P>I would also emphasise that the availability of significant levels of EC Funds will be essential for the implementation of the public transport elements of the DTI.  Both the interim and final reports of the DTI will form an integral part of the Government's input into negotiations on EC Funds for the period after 1993.</P>

      <P>Section 74 of the Child Care Act 1991 which came into operation on 1 December 1991, makes it an offence for a retailer to sell any substance to a person under 18 years where the retailer has reason to believe that the substance or its fumes will be inhaled for the purpose of causing intoxication.  The penalty for an offence is a fine of up to £1,000 and/or up to twelve months' imprisonment.</P>
      <P>The enforcement of this provision is a matter for the Gardaí.  The section also empowers the Gardaí to seize substances in the possession of children in public places which they suspect are being abused.</P>
      <P>The range of solvent based products that can be used for glue-sniffing purposes is extensive.  I understand that the labelling and listing of such products involves consideration of EC Directives on the classification and labelling of dangerous products and on the free movement of goods within the Community. This would appear to be primarily a matter for the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
      <P>My Department's Health Promotion Unit has undertaken a campaign to increase public awareness of the problem and dangers of solvent abuse.  As part of this campaign, the Unit has produced an information booklet for retailers and a guide for professionals and parents.  This material has been widely circulated and I am arranging to have a copy sent to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The objectives of Government health policy, as set out in the report &mdash; The Years <Col N="449" /> Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly is to support the care of dependent elderly people at home for as long as possible and to ensure that when the elderly can no longer be cared for at home, that there are appropriate specialist and extended care facilities to meet their needs.  The priorities of service development at present are to strengthen the capacity of the health services to care for the person at home, to provide more specialist facilities in acute hospitals and to meet the needs of the increasing numbers of elderly mentally infirm.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has been made towards implementing the recommendations contained in <i>The Years Ahead</i>.  In recent years an additional £9 million was made available to the health boards to develop services for the elderly. This extra funding has enabled the health boards to expand home nursing services, to provide day centres and hospitals, to increase the number of physiotherapists and speech therapists to the community and to develop service for the old with dementia.</P>
      <P>Particular emphasis has been placed on the development of assessment units for the elderly in general hospitals and the provision of extended care places.  The development of specialist geriatric departments and the appointment of consultant geriatricians in general hospitals has been one of the most significant advances in the care of the elderly. These departments are now operating in 11 general hospitals around the country.  Arrangements to open departments are at an advanced stage in five other general hospitals.  The departments in operation at present have shown that they restore the overwhelming majority of patients to independent living quickly through a combination of prompt admission of elderly patients to hospital, specialist diagnosis and treatment, skilled nursing and rehabilitation, and in many cases continuing support in a day hospital on discharge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Eastern Health Board area, occupational therapy is available in the assessment/rehabilitation units of the general hospitals and in all the board's <Col N="450" /> institutions.  The board has also developed a programme of Diversional Therapy in its long stay homes.  The board feel that Diversional Therapy is more appropriate to the needs of long term residents.  This therapy encourages residents to develop their hobbies and interests such as arts and crafts and is constantly being expanded and developed.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>

      <Quest>the number of people with a mental handicap who are misplaced in psychiatric hospitals for long term care in each health board area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Many persons with a mental handicap were admitted in the past to psychiatric hospitals who would not be admitted to such hospitals today.  It is the policy of my Department that persons with mental handicap should not be admitted to psychiatric hospitals unless they have an underlying psychiatric disorder which cannot be treated in any other way.  The report of the Review Group on Mental Handicap Services, <i>Needs and Abilities</i> endorses this policy.  It recommends that an assessment be carried out of the circumstances and needs of each person with mental handicap in the psychiatric hospitals.  If the assessment indicates that the person with mental handicap no longer needs care in psychiatric setting, the report recommends that he or she should transfer to a mental handicap service.</P>
      <P>There were 942 people with mental handicap accommodated in public psychiatric hospitals on 31 December 1992.  A further 447 people were accommodated in re-designed units associated with these hospitals but which are now part of the mental handicap service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to inform the Deputy that the transfer of people with mental handicap from a psychiatric to a mental handicap setting is continuing.  In 1992, 40 people with mental handicap transferred <Col N="451" /> from St. Mary's Hospital, Castlebar to Aras Attracta, Swinford; 22 people transferred from St. Otteran's Hospital, Waterford to the Brothers of Charity Services in Belmont Park, Waterford and 22 people transferred from unsuitable accommodation in St. Loman's Hospital, Palmerstown to new accommodation in Maynooth.</P>
    <P>The development of appropriate programmes and the assessment of the needs of persons still in psychiatric hospitals is ongoing.  My Department has appointed an adviser with expertise in the care of people with mental handicap in psychiatric hospitals to work with the health boards and voluntary agencies to further the policy of improving the care of that population.</P>
    <P>Where persons with a mental handicap continue to be cared for in psychiatric hospitals, either because they are not suitable for transfer or a transfer cannot be arranged at present, health boards are being encouraged to care for them in separate accommodation and to develop programmes of activity suited to their needs.  In some cases health boards, with my Department's agreement, have separated the care of people with mental handicap from the care of mentally ill patients and transferred responsibility for their care to the community care programme, which is responsible for mental handicap services generally in the areas concerned.</P>
    <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to the provision of additional funding to speed up implementation of the report of the Review Group on Mental Handicap Services &mdash;&ldquo;Needs and Abilities&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to give details of developments which might be put in place in 1993 at present as the level of funding which may be made available for such developments will not be decided until budget time.</P>
