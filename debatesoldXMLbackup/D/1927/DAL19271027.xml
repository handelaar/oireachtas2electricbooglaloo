      <P>asked the President whether the Local Appointments Commissioners had before them, among the eleven applications for the position of Borough Surveyor for the City of Waterford, the application of a gentleman, born in Waterford, aged 36 years, who is a Bachelor of Engineering, National University, 1913; Assoc. M.Inst. C.E.. who was Assistant Engineer in 1912 during the construction of the Waterford Bridge; Assistant to Mr. Reade, A.M.I.C.E., Waterford, 1913, and conducted the field work and prepared the plans for the Main Drainage of the City of Kilkenny; who was Chief Assistant to Messrs. Delap and Waller, Consulting Engineers, 115 Grafton Street, Dublin, from September, 1913, to September, 1914; September, 1914-April, 1919.  Lieut. R.A.O.C., and Staff Lieut. R.A.F. for two years with the British Forces in France; 1919-1920, Chief Engineer to the Department of Reconstruction, Eastern Macedonia, where he carried out schemes of town planning and reconstruction, including waterworks, drainage, bridges, culverts, light railways; 1920-1924, Municipal Engineer with the Public Works Department, Federated Malay States; 1924 to present time, employed by the Hertfordshire County Council as Resident Engineer; and has prepared plans and drawn maps of the City of Waterford at the request of the late Borough Surveyor, which have been used by the <Col N="466" /> Waterford Corporation for the last 12 years; and if he will state whether any other applicants, including the one selected by the Appointments Commissioners, had anything like the same qualifications; and if he will have inquiries made why this gentleman's name was not submitted to the Waterford Corporation.</P>

      <P>As I stated in my reply to the Deputy on 19th instant, it has not been the practice of the Local Appointments Commissioners to furnish a list of the qualifications of unsuccessful candidates for vacant posts.  In settling their practice in this respect and in regard to the recommendation of one name only to local authorities for a vacant office the Commissioners had regard to the objects of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, which were primarily to secure the election of the best qualified candidate and incidentally to relieve members of local authorities from the embarrassment caused in the past by attempts on the part of candidates to advance their candidature through the exercise of local influence, irrespective of their relative merits.  The submission of the names of all qualified candidates would not be calculated to achieve these objects, and if any name other than that of the best qualified applicant were submitted it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to justify the exclusion from the list of any qualified candidate. Furthermore, if the names of the qualified candidates were forwarded in their order of merit, those candidates who had failed to obtain a high place might with reason be apprehensive lest the publication of such a list would adversely affect their professional prospects, with the result that the field of selection would become limited.  As I have already informed the Deputy, the Commissioners have been requested by certain unsuccessful candidates to with-hold information as to their place on the list.  In the case of the candidate referred to in the question, the Commissioners would not feel justified in disclosing particulars as to the birth-place, qualifications, or the place he secured on the list unless they were definitely assured that he desired that course.</P>

      <P>Is it a fact that a statement was recently attributed to the Appointments Commissioners to the effect that, other things being equal, preference would be given to local candidates; has the President seen the qualifications of the successful candidate and, if so, can he say whether the super-qualifications amounted to the fact that he was born in Cork and did not serve in the British Army?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy might reasonably understand that that is a question of which notice should be given.  I do not, in the first place, acquaint myself with the number of vacancies or the requests from local authorities with which the Commissioners have to deal.  In the second place, neither myself nor any other member of the Government, has any association, direct or indirect, <Col N="468" /> with these appointments.  Therefore, a question such as that which the Deputy has put to me would require examination.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance (a) what amount has been paid out under Dáil Eireann Loan Account; (b) in respect of what amount are there applications under consideration; (c) whether his Department holds receipts in cases where no application has been made, and what steps he has taken to invite applications from such investors, and (d) whether he intends repaying investors who fail to make application.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the question refers to subscriptions to the Internal Loan.  The total amount including interest of which payment has been authorised is £261,842.  I regret that I am unable to give the Deputy a definite figure in reply to the second part of the question.  As regards the third part, an official receipt was issued to every subscriber whose name and address were furnished with the amount of his subscription for registration when the Loan was being raised.  In a considerable number of cases receipts were transmitted to my Department <Col N="469" /> without any covering application and in these cases forms of application for repayment were sent to the subscribers for completion and return.  With regard to the fourth part of the question, it would not be possible for me to repay subscriptions in cases where applications are not made, as in a number of cases the subscribers have died or have left the country, or otherwise changed their addresses since the date of subscribing.  I am considering the question of inserting a further notice in the Press directing the attention of all subscribers or representatives of deceased subscribers to the necessity for making application for repayment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing I could do is to make it as widely known as possible that applications must be made by all people who subscribed, or think they subscribed.  If we have details in the office showing that people did subscribe, repayments will be made, but owing to the imperfect character of the register there will be great difficulty in certain cases in identifying the real subscribers. Every effort will, however, be made to make repayment to everybody who subscribed.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will introduce proposals for legislation to put a tariff on tyres with a view to having a tyre factory established in Dublin; further, if he will state the value of tyres and foreign built motor buses which were imported into the Saorstát during the past two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to recommend to the Dáil the imposition of a customs duty on imported tyres, but if an application is made under the Tariff Commission Act by persons of the representative character required by the Act, I will refer it to the Commission for consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="470" /> The total value of the rubber tyres and tubes imported in the twelve months ended 30th September, 1926, was £446,985 and the total value of those imported in the twelve months ended 30th September, 1927, was £522,159.</P>
    <P>No information is available regarding the value of &ldquo;foreign built motor buses&rdquo; imported into Saorstát Eireann but the value (exclusive of duty) of &ldquo;commercial motor road vehicles&rdquo; (including motor omnibuses) was £64,399 in the twelve months ended 30th September, 1926, and £195,287 in the twelve months ended 30th September, 1927.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. BYRNE Mr. BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that all tyres used in Ireland are foreign-made and that there is no likelihood of the manufacturers making application to the Tariff Commission, will the Minister consider the advisability of putting a tariff on foreign-made tyres so as to compel the manufacturers to start factories here and give employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangement under the Tariff Commission is that only people, engaged either in the manufacture of an article on which it is proposed to put a tariff or people who propose to engage in such manufacture, can make applications.  It is very doubtful whether a customs duty could be imposed with success unless we had some people who were prepared to engage in the industry and who would make a case for a specific duty which would have the effect of starting manufacture here.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works received petitions from <Col N="472" /> occupiers of land in the area through the Leitrim and Longford County Councils for the carrying out of a scheme under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, in respect of the Rinn River. The Councils were informed by the Commissioners on the 28th April, 1926, that the circumstances were not such as to justify the formation of a separate drainage district, as the scheme put forward omitted the Black River which forms an important part of the existing Rinn and Black River drainage district.  It was further pointed out that the proposed scheme did not deal with the outfall into Lough Forbes.  At the same time, the Councils were informed that if a proposal to convert the entire existing district into a new drainage district under the Act of 1925, to include also the improvement of the outfall into Lough Forbes were put forward the Commissioners would consider it.  The Longford County Council at a special meeting in 1926 had the matter under consideration and passed a resolution that they were not in favour of proceeding on the lines suggested whilst nothing further has been heard on the subject from the Leitrim County Council. No petition for a new scheme under the Act of 1925 has so far been received in respect of the Eslin River. There is an existing Eslin Drainage District and the Commissioners had it inspected by an engineer with a view to restoration under the Drainage Maintenance Act, 1924.  It was found, however, that even with the customary Government Grant the charge payable by the owners would be prohibitive and the trustees were informed to this effect on 1st March, 1926.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer question No. 7 and question No. 15 addressed to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health together.  During the past 12 months, two prisoners were transferred to Dundrum Asylum.  One of these was however re-transferred to prison as the asylum authorities were not satisfied that he was insane.  No prisoner was released during that period owing to mental affection.  Forty-three persons imprisoned since the 28th June, 1922, are now inmates of mental institutions, 15 of these being in Dundrum and 28 in other institutions.  Of the 43, 38 were insane on committal or found incapable of pleading, or found guilty but insane by the jury.  There were therefore only 5 persons who apparently developed insanity in prison.  It would take too long to read out the particulars of the 38 cases, but I have circulated such particulars for the information of the Deputy.  I had perhaps better read out the particulars of the 5 cases where it might be said insanity was developed in prison.  (Particulars read.)</P>

No general hold-up for the purpose of detecting motor offences was arranged by the Gárda Síochána for the 15th ultimo, the date on which these offences were committed, but it is, of course, the duty of every member of the Gárda to take appropriate action when such offences come to his notice.  In the case of Mr. Fitzgerald, Sergeant Daniel Scallan, who happened to be on duty outside a polling booth, noticed that no road tax disc was displayed, and instituted proceedings.  In the case of Mr. Regan, the Gárda on duty at a polling booth was aware of the fact that Mr. Regan had been prosecuted and fined in July last for driving a motor car without having a driver's licence.  The Gárda asked Mr. Regan to produce his licence, but he could not do so.  Had similar offences by any other persons come under the notice of the Gárda the same course would have been taken by them.  The Gárda Síochána will act in the future as they have acted in the past with strict impartiality as between all persons irrespective of their political opinions.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he contemplates any modification of the existing regulations in <Col N="478" /> connection with claims for unemployment insurance benefit that preclude insured contributors holding or living with other members of their family on small patches of land from receiving benefit or obtaining a refund of their contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an entire mistake to suppose that any such regulations exist or ever did exist.  A person living on a small holding of land does not have to satisfy any different conditions whatever than any other person. Every claim from every kind of insured contributor is considered on its own facts.  Each claimant must, under the Acts, prove that he is not following an occupation from which he derives any remuneration or profit.  He must also prove that he is available for work, that is to say not otherwise engaged, and finally that he is unable to obtain suitable employment.  It will be realised that claimants living or working on the land at the time they claim benefit may be unable to satisfy one or more of these conditions.  But in evidence of the fact that as a class such claimants are not precluded from obtaining benefit I will quote the figures for the year ending 1st July, 1927.  Two thousand five hundred and ninety-five landholders or persons living with landholders claimed benefit; 1,968 such claims were allowed, 627 disallowed. In other words 75 per cent. of claimants in the class, erroneously assumed in the question to be precluded from benefit, in fact received it.  I hope this statement will serve finally to correct the mistaken impression that any special conditions are applied to landholders. That impression arises from the fact that it is only cases of disallowance which are reported to Deputies, who consequently do not realise that there are three cases of allowance for every one of disallowance.  As to a refund of contributions I have no power to refund, nor is there any case for refunding contributions which a worker pays while in insurable employment, simply because at some particular&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Great Southern Railways Company is empowered to charge 100 per cent. with a flat addition in certain cases over rates in operation in January, 1920; the railways in Northern Ireland reduced their live stock rates some years ago to 100 per cent. over the rates in January, 1920; and the rates in Great Britain are now understood to be <Col N="480" /> 60 per cent. over the rates in operation at that date.  So many variations and adjustments both of general and of individual rates were, however, made between 1914 and 1920, and since 1920, that it would be practically impossible to prepare single percentage figures which would indicate the actual comparative position to-day.</P>

      <P>The returns recently obtained from the inspectors show that apart from the question of the erection of new schools, approximately 550 schools required to be enlarged so as to provide additional accommodation for about 17,000 children. The schools which need enlargement are not confined to particular areas but are distributed over the country generally.  The approximate cost of these extensions alone was estimated at £370,000.</P>
      <P>In respect of 50 of these cases grants amounting to £40,000 have been sanctioned to provide additional floor space for 2,230 children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for a large expenditure for school building purposes is due to a certain extent to the inadequate provision made for this service by the former administration, but particularly to the suspension of building grants during the European War.  The lack of school accommodation has been most severely felt in the Dublin area, since in addition to the causes already referred to there has been here a rapid increase in the school-going population in recent years.  Special efforts have <Col N="481" /> been made to meet this need.  In the city and suburbs State grants have been sanctioned during the past four years to the amount of £108,000 towards the erection of new schools at Blackrock, Sallynoggin, Drumcondra, Marino, North Circular Road, Killester and Inchicore, and for the enlargement, reconstruction and other works of improvement in various schools in and around Dublin.</P>

      <P>The authorities of the Central Markets at Smithfield furnish a daily report, in which particulars are given of the quantities of produce marketed under the following headings:&mdash; Beef and Veal; Mutton and Lamb; Pork, etc.; Poultry and Game; Butter, Eggs, Rabbits, etc.  The countries of origin are given in each case, but the quantities from Great Britain and Ireland are included together under the heading &ldquo;Britain and Ireland.&rdquo;  I am not in a position to state whether the Market authorities could show separately the quantities of each class of Irish produce received in the market, but enquiries are being made on this point.  It should be borne in mind that returns of Irish produce received in this market are likely to be incomplete, seeing that Irish animals shipped alive for slaughter at British centres, and marketed at the Central Markets, cannot in every case be shown as being of Irish origin.</P>

      <P>The number of loans granted by the Department of Agriculture since the 1st April, 1927, under the Scheme of Loans for the purchase of agricultural instruments was 1,057, representing a sum of £15,522.

During the month of August last it became evident that the provision made for this scheme would shortly become exhausted, and the Department accordingly decided on 1st September that, having regard to the applications then in hands, no further applications could be granted.  The provision in the Estimates for this scheme was the same as for the year 1926-7, viz., £15,000, which had been found to be ample for that year.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Deputy Pádraig O hOgáin (An Clár) be appointed Leas-Cheann Comhairle.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I move this motion because I consider that Deputy Hogan is a suitable person to fill this important position. He is a man who has had four years' experience in this House.  Before he entered this House he had been, and is still, connected with several public bodies and he has served on committees of this Dáil.  In addition to his experience he is a man, in my opinion, of tact and ability and sound judgment and eminently suitable in that way to fill the Chair.  I may mention, too, that on a few occasions, being on the panel nominated by An Ceann Comhairle in the Fourth Dáil, he has occupied the Chair already.  He has the further very important qualification, important especially in this Dáil, that he is a competent speaker of the Irish language.</P>
      <P>Deputies who were in the last Dáil will probably remember that I raised an objection to a proposal made with regard to the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle and that I went so far as to divide the House on the matter because I thought a knowledge of the Irish language was a very important qualification. In fact, I would consider no Deputy qualified to occupy the position who was not able to take charge of a debate even if it were wholly conducted in the Irish language.  I am in a position to say that the Deputy I am proposing has that qualification, a fact, no doubt, well known to all Deputies in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say that I am putting forward this nomination not as a party nomination.  We are not nominating Deputy Hogan for the reason only, <Col N="490" /> that he happens to be a member of the Party to which I belong.  And above all I would like to say this: In putting him forward we hope to get no party advantage out of the appointment, because we recognise, fully, that the person occupying the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle, just as the person who occupies the position of Ceann Comhairle, is the servant of the House and must give that service while he is in the Chair impartially to every party and to every individual.</P>
    <P>No doubt the position of Deputy Chairman is somewhat different to that of the Ceann Comhairle in that the Deputy Chairman continues to maintain his party and possibly speak on behalf of his party in debate when he is not in the Chair.  But I should like it to be recognised that once he leaves these benches and takes the Chair he leaves his party affiliations behind him.  That is what we understand, in any case, in regard to the duties of the person who occupies this position.  I go further and say that if it should happen that he is called upon to cast a vote while in the Chair we recognise fully, and I think the House should recognise, that any such vote must be cast not in accordance with any party affiliations he may have when outside the Chair but with certain well defined principles that govern the conduct of the person who occupies the Chair.</P>
    <P>If it happens that such a vote may fall on the side that his Party may be supporting for the time being, it will not be, or it ought not to be, open to anybody to say that he was influenced in any way in giving his vote by the fact that his Party was supporting that particular point of view, just as I would say on behalf of the Party to which he belongs, that if his vote happened to be contrary to their view it would not be a matter of discussion in our Party in any way as to the manner in which he gave his vote.  It would not be a proper matter to discuss or challenge the vote he gave.  It may be advisable perhaps to make this clear and to make it quite definite that whoever is in the Chair, whether the Ceann Comhairle or the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, is one who is and must be the servant of the <Col N="491" /> House irrespective of Parties or whatever views he may hold.  I believe Deputy Pádraic O hOgáin is a suitable candidate.  I believe he will fill the Chair with tact and ability.  I am proposing him entirely on his merits and I believe that if the House elects him to that position he will give satisfaction to every member.</P>

      <P>There is just one point in reference to Deputy de Valera's argument that the duties of Leas-Cheann Comhairle should be performed <Col N="492" /> by an ordinary Deputy without salary.  The duties of taking the Chair and relieving the Ceann Comhairle possibly could be performed in that manner, but the Standing Orders of the Dáil impose an additional duty on the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and that is to take charge and supervise the proceedings relating to Private Bills.  The whole procedure in relation to Private Bills is a very intricate study.  It requires a man to devote a good deal of time to it, apart altogether from the ordinary business of the House.  The promotion of a Private Bill involves the expenditure of a considerable sum of money, not only in passing it through the Dáil and Seanad, but also subsequently. I know I was Chairman of a Private Bill Committee in a previous Dáil, and the amount of money that was required to be expended on the Private Bill was £250,000.  If you are going to have an officer of the Dáil charged with that duty you should put him in a position of independence.  He has really the same position and almost the same responsibility as a Judge.  And while possibly the salary might be reduced, while possibly the salary for Judges might be reduced, I do not think it would be fair to charge a Deputy with all that detail and all that responsibility&mdash;responsibility not only for the money, but for the right of development of enterprise in the State&mdash; and pay him no salary at all.  I think it was suggested by Deputy Redmond in the last Dáil that a Committee should be set up to review the emoluments of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  That Committee was set up, and I hope it will be revived.  I do think if Deputy de Valera would consider the great responsibility that the supervision of Private Bills places on the shoulders of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle he will not persist in his plea.</P>

      <P>So far as we on these Benches are concerned, we do not wish in any way to suggest that the duties attaching to this office are not duties of importance and are not duties which deserve, in the person who is to fill the position, that he should have all the attributes at least that Deputy O'Connell spoke of as being possessed by Deputy Pádraig O hOgáin proposing <Col N="493" /> him for the office.  We do not in any way challenge the suggestion that such qualifications are necessary, nor do we challenge the idea that the office is a responsible one.  In certain times it may be just as responsible as that of the position of Ceann Comhairle, but so far as we have been able to discover, in making inquiries as to the duties that have been performed up to this by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, we have been told that the duties have been negligible, and that is a mild word.  Up to this the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, except for occasionally going into the Chair, has had to do nothing else.  Probably that may be due to the energy and ability of the present Ceann Comhairle. He is always there, we are told, to look after his duties, and always has been, so that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle in the past has not been very frequently called upon.  That may be so, but then at any time anybody, even a person who may be as healthy and energetic as the present Ceann Comhairle, might fall ill, and we realise that it would be possible that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would be called upon for a more extended period of service and for a greater amount of his time to be given to the office.  Even so, we think that a salary of £1,000 a year is such a sum as ought not to be attached to the office, considering even the responsible nature of the post, and more especially the duties that have been attached to it up to this.  Going on what we have heard from inquiries which we have made, we are satisfied that any Deputy could fulfil the duties that may be attached to the office as part of his ordinary work as a Deputy here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considering all these things, the office itself, the duties attaching to it and the state of the finances of the country, we think that a salary of £1,000 a year is an exaggerated sum to be attached to it.  We are supported in that view very largely by the late leader of the Labour Party himself. When this question was under discussion in the Dáil in July last Mr. Johnson then said: &ldquo;I think it will be generally recognised by those who <Col N="494" /> were members of the last Dáil that there was an over-estimation of the importance of the office of Leas-Cheann Comhairle and an over-estimation of the salary value, shall I say, of the office.&rdquo;  Again he said: &ldquo;My view is that the duties of the office do not warrant the payment of a salary of £1,000, that that is a matter that has a right to be considered, and the question will at once arise as to what would be considered to be legitimate and fair remuneration for the office, if the office is necessary.&rdquo;  Mr. Johnson raised two questions there, first as to whether the salary should be as it was then and is now fixed at, £1,000 a year; and, secondly, whether the office is necessary. We have not had the same experience as the majority of Deputies here, but our information, gathered from various sources here, is that the duties are of the lightest nature: that if a Deputy is in attendance in the course of his ordinary duties here the additional trouble that will be put upon him by taking the Chair occasionally will not be such certainly as to warrant anything like a salary of £1,000 a year being attached to the office.  We do not like to be taken as being in any way opposed to the Deputy who has been proposed.  We merely raise the question on the duties attaching to the office, and we look upon as exorbitant the salary that is attached to it.  As long as that salary is attached to the office we feel bound to oppose any appointment being made, and if necessary our Party will go in the Lobby against the motion.</P>

      <P>The only thing I desire to say is that, in my opinion, the question of salary does not arise at the moment. The salary attached to the office has been fixed by Act of Parliament, and I am sure the Deputies who have spoken know that there is a way of changing an Act of Parliament if it is thought necessary and advisable by the House to do so.</P>

    <Title>PUBLIC BUSINESS. - RELIEF OF UNEMPLOYMENT&mdash;MOTION BY DEPUTY MORRISSEY (Debate Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Motion: &ldquo;That the measures hitherto adopted by the Government for the relief of unemployment are insufficient and ought to be extended immediately.&rdquo;&mdash;(Deputy Morrissey). Debate resumed on amendment:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To delete all words after the word `That' and substitute therefor the words&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;recognising that further measures for the relief of unemployment will involve additional provision out of public funds and may consequently impose fresh charges on productive enterprise, the Dáil is of opinion that while no reasonable method of promoting further employment should be neglected, care must be exercised in the adoption of relief measures to ensure that the evil which it is sought to remedy is not aggravated by the placing of an undue strain on the resources of industry and agriculture.&rdquo;&mdash;(Minister for Industry and Commerce).</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking from recollection of what I heard last evening from three Deputies who might be regarded perhaps as the spokesmen of their Party in regard to this motion, there were suggestions that unemployment should be dealt with in a big national way, and I took it from the observations that fell from each of the three of them that the present position as regards unemployment was such that it required some immediate relief. But, in all cases in which there were references to what was called &ldquo;a big national way&rdquo; to deal with the matter, the recommendations were rather with a view to an improvement that might be anticipated in a couple of years time.  In one case we were asked to envisage the possibility of being cut off from the whole world five years from now, and whatever precautions might be taken to meet the situation which would arise in that eventuality, it is quite understood that delay would be inevitable.  In the other case we were told that the proper way to deal with the matter was by the development of our industries and by getting control of our transport, banks and so on. That also would mean delay.  In the third case I think I established to the satisfaction of Deputy Lemass that the development of housing activities in the City of Dublin would take considerable time.  I explained to him at some length that the first step in that connection would be the selection of a site, its lay-out and its development, plans for the construction of the houses, the necessary specifications which would have to be drawn up, then the usual advertisements that appear in the Press asking for tenders, the usual <Col N="499" /> delay which accompanies the delivery of tenders, their examination and acceptance, as well as the delay that occurs before the work commences.  So that from the three prominent speakers of that Party we find there is no immediate method of dealing with the unemployment problem, and that the most constructive suggestions will take some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We go on then to consider proposals that were put forward by, I think, Deputy Mullins, who suggested the extension of the pier at Cloneen at a cost of about £400, the development of another industry down in that district which I understand has ceased operations recently, and the provision of piers at Bandon, and I believe he mentioned Clonakilty.  If there be a case for the construction of a pier at Cloneen it would appear to me to fall more for consideration by the Minister for Fisheries under his Vote than as a matter that should be dealt with by an Unemployment Vote.  If, as the Minister for Finance has said, there is a sound economic case for that proposal, if the construction of a pier would mean an extension of the fisheries in that district, then it is not a matter which should properly fall under expenditure on a relief scheme Vote.  We are faced with the fact that although we were told by the Fianna Fáil Party that there was a sound economic programme, vet everything that is proposed by them would mean delay. Another suggestion was made&mdash;and I think it would not have been made but for the experience of the last two or three weeks&mdash;that with the attention that has to be given to Bills and the time that is absorbed in matters of administration, it is unreasonable to expect from Ministers that attention to the economic policy which it deserves, and consequently there was a recommendation for the setting up of an economic council.  We got no information as to what the constitution of that economic council should be: whether it was to be manned by civil servants, whether business men were to come into it, whether it was to be paid, and to what extent, if any, the Executive Council would be responsible for its <Col N="500" /> proposals.  These are two very fine recommendations to put before the people, splendid things to talk about; but the real thing we have to consider is what we are going to do to improve industry, and that is the only means of dealing with unemployment. In all the statements that I have read or heard in connection with protection I have heard very little in respect of recommendations to the people to buy Irish-manufactured goods.</P>

      <P>It is very hard to keep the President on the right track. If you let him get going at all you cannot keep him on it, so I want to put him right at the beginning.  I did not say any such thing.  I said I was quite sure that the President would tell us <Col N="501" /> of the thousands of houses that have been built and the million pounds provided for unemployment, and he is proceeding to do what I said he would do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Deputy did not want the Dáil to hear it, that he wanted the Dáil to pronounce judgement without having heard it.  In order to judge this matter properly we ought to hear that, we ought to hear some of the difficulties which had to be encountered when public money was available.  We ought to consider what steps were taken during the last four or five years with a view to ensuring as far as possible that new industries would be started and that there should be a development of existing industries.  I find from the report of the Trade Department of the Department of Local Government, in connection with road plant and machinery during the period under review, contracts amounting to £153,500 were entered into directly by this Department with machinery manufacturers, for the purchase and supply of road plant such as road rollers, traction engines, tar boilers, steam wagons, stone crushers and scarifiers, and that in order to secure early delivery it was necessary for one of the officials of the Department to go over to see that no undue delay occurred in transit between steamer and rail, and so on.  Even that one item necessitated very considerable organisation. Other articles which the Trade Department was instrumental in having manufactured in Ireland, although never made here before, were 2,000 wrought-iron fenders, 2,000 sets of fire irons, Civic Guard station badges, 93 sleeping vans, 104 Ford and Dodge ambulances, 2,500 hammered steel road shovels, 120,000 food and drug bottles, 137,880 yards of army grey shirting, watering carts and a quantity of tar compounds.  We will hear, very possibly, during the course of the next few months some criticism of the Trade Department; we will be told that it is costly, and other things like that.  But there is a definite line of policy, traceable down during the last four or five years, having in mind the necessity for helping home industry in every possible <Col N="502" /> way, getting all the articles that it is possible to get in this country manufactured in the country, and all that.  I suppose that Deputies waste no time in reading any of those very important pronouncements that I make now and then, but I will read an extract from one of these speeches, as they may not have heard it before.</P>

      <P>Long before the election.  Here is an extract from what I said: &ldquo;As an example of what our Irish manufacturers and workers can do, it might interest you to hear that in the reconstruction of the General Post Office, the Four Courts and Custom House, the bronze sashes of all sizes are being cast in Dublin.  The drilling, cutting, fitting, bolting and riveting of the steel joists, plates, etc., have been done in the shops of this city, the finish and general workmanship comparing very favourably with, and often surpassing, imported work. Water pipes and pavement lights are Dublin cast; the hammered iron-work has been done by local craftsmen; and the covering with copper of the concrete dome of the Four Courts, a type of work involving high technical skill, is the work of an Irish firm.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear Deputy Morrissey saying &ldquo;Hear, hear,&rdquo; because, if my recollection is correct, another infirmity in his speech was that he hoped no reference would be made to output on the part of Irish workers.  I am paying a tribute to them there.  I thought the Deputy would say that we have not heard enough of that; I suggest it would be a good thing if we did hear more about it.  That is one of the considerations present to the minds of practically all persons who have in contemplation the starting of industries or manufactures here.  We have certain great examples of wonderful success as far as the efficiency of our work-people are concerned. We have Guinness's, Ford's and Jacob's, and quite a number of others; these are outstanding examples. I suggest to Labour Deputies not to leave all this work on the shoulders of the Government, and I suggest they <Col N="503" /> should not lead the people to look to the Government for everything.  I suggest that Labour Deputies might well take out the costs in respect of engineering works and other works, that they should publish all this information and so show that we can compare with other countries.  They should not leave, as it were, the sales, in so far as this country is concerned, to members of the Government.  It should be a matter of pride with them to show that in respect of output and efficiency the Irish work-people can compare more than favourably with others.  I have a reason for all that.  Let us take one particular service mentioned by most of the Deputies on the Fianna Fáil benches.  Few of the Deputies on the Labour benches spoke&mdash;</P>

      <P>There were some suggestions made in connection with the relief of unemployment through the development of our housing programme. For Deputy Cassidy's information, I may say that something like 400 houses have been constructed in Tircónaill, assisted by subsidies from the State.  That is a pretty considerable number.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>During the last four or five years&mdash;since 1922.  The Dublin problem is a problem which, I think, stands out by itself.  As I have said before, insanitary areas in a city such as Dublin are the inevitable outcome of the history of the city.  Insanitary areas in the country are, as the Deputy knows, almost unknown except in the congested districts of Connemara&mdash;Lettermullen and other places like that.  You could scarcely have what would be described as an insanitary area in rural districts.  In the case of a city like Dublin, where the population is increasing and has increased during the last 20 or 30 years, it is obvious that it calls for much more extensive treatment as far as housing is concerned than would rural areas. I mention housing, because during the last four or five years very considerable sums have had to be provided as subsidies towards the construction of houses.</P>
      <P>I do not know that a housing policy such as we have here is in operation in other countries like France, Germany or the United States, or that in any of the countries in Europe of the same population and wealth that we have got there is such housing assistance from the State as there is here. I mention that for the purpose of directing the attention, particularly of the members of the Labour Party, to the desirability of taking out and publishing costs in respect of engineering or other works because those who are interested in seeing the development of their business and industry will look to such services, and they will inquire why it is that such a considerable subsidy is necessary in a matter which is so essential, and which ought to find its own needs, as housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was rather attracted by the proposal <Col N="505" /> of Deputy de Valera in connection with the importation of such things as maize and other feeding stuffs used by farmers; I was rather attracted by his line of policy.  I would say offhand that a farmer knows more about his business than a member of this House who is not engaged in farming.  I would say that an industrialist, a man who has started an industry and has developed it, would know more about it than a Deputy selected from this House who was not connected with the industry.  Now, as to this question of whether or not the agricultural community know their own business and whether we are entitled without an examination of the problem, without going into its merits, to come here and by a stroke of the pen prohibit the importation of certain things if we can produce any of those things in this country, all in order that we may restore our adverse trade balance, I say things are not done that way in business.</P>

      <P>Every few moments I notice that my task is getting heavier, that the education I must dispense here is so extensive as to call for more time than there is at my disposal. During the last few years there has been a considerable change in the incidence of taxation.  Taxes have been taken off the ordinary necessaries of life, such as tea; the tax on sugar has been reduced, the tax on cocoa has practically disappeared and on coffee it is practically taken off.  Not alone has all that been done but there is a considerable increase in the Government's contribution towards the relief of local taxation on agricultural land.  What the Deputy says, that the farmers for whom he speaks are bearing the cost of the Ministers' salaries, is not true.  I say that these farmers are not paying a contribution towards the taxes of the State.  If the Deputy will have patience and bear with me for a moment, I will demonstrate this.  Assuming that the farmer buys Irish-made boots and Irish-made clothes, he is paying no tax on boots and clothes.  If he buys foreign boots and clothes there is a tax. But I want the Deputy to take notice that the trend of the fiscal changes that have taken place during the last few years is towards helping the main industry of the country and lessening the burdens on it by contributing to the cost of the local rates; lessening those burdens and removing from the necessaries of life the taxes that had been imposed on them, and just asking in return only for the purchase of Irish manufactured goods made in this country. This achieves, I think, the purpose which has been dealt with by practically all the speakers on the Deputy's side. We dispute the proposal that we should not concentrate upon the improvement of our exports.  We should do everything that is possible to increase our exports.  It is a strange thing that we are taxed with the fact that the exports and imports totalled together are less than those of five years ago and <Col N="508" /> at the same time that it is not good policy to concentrate as effectively as we can upon increasing our exports. Of course it is.</P>

      <P>Yes, I feel, sir, Deputy Anthony is right, but there are, as I have said before, limits to human endurance.  When I was a member of the Dublin Corporation, I had at one time to go rather minutely into the figures and cost of production of electricity, and I found that while one could produce ten million units of electricity, we will say, at x pence per unit, one could produce fifteen million units at a much lesser price than x pence per unit.  Now, I hope that point has penetrated.  In other words, I am making it as plain as possible, I hope.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make it still plainer and put it this way: If it costs for the manufacture of ten million units of electricity one penny per unit, the manufacture of fifteen million units of electricity would be much less than fifteen million pence.  Now, that point is clear.  That is the point I want understood as regards export.  If we are able to manufacture a sufficient quantity of goods here to increase our export, then the actual cost of the goods that we are going to use ourselves becomes less.  I presume that if that point is not thoroughly grasped now, by tomorrow evening everyone will agree with me, and Deputy de Valera will <Col N="509" /> realise that it is a mistake not to endeavour to increase your exports.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>We are asked to pronounce judgment without hearing the other side.  Fifty-five per cent. of the goods imported into this country, except agricultural produce, are tariffed.  Because the Minister for Finance was sufficiently explicit in his statement as to say that he anticipated a certain income in respect of certain tariffs, we were told that we should not introduce tariffs for the purpose of taxation.  What are we to do with it? Is it to be put into a compartment and kept there?  I submit that during the <Col N="510" /> last four or five years the establishment of one hundred extra industries in this country, employing something like ten thousand persons, is something.  The improvement that has taken place in the marketing and grading of eggs and butter, and the improvement that has taken place in the breeding of live stock, in the distribution of land, and in the drainage schemes which we have inaugurated are important considerations. And in this matter of drainage, might I say for the benefit of those who have not followed our drainage policy very closely that the contribution which the Government makes towards a drainage scheme is thirty-three and one-third per cent. and that if a county council subscribes sixteen and two-thirds per cent. the Government will give an additional sixteen and two-thirds per cent., thus making the Government contribution fifty per cent. of the cost of the drainage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody stated here in the discussion yesterday that the proposals which came from us were not sufficiently attractive to carry out drainage schemes.  We are entitled to ask what the sum is which Deputies think the Government ought to give in order to have drainage schemes carried into operation.  In addition to drainage, distribution of land, reclamation, afforestation, housing, the money spent on roads, the improvement of inland fisheries, the improvement in deep-sea fisheries, the re-organisation of our transport, goods upon which a tariff has been imposed, the products of home industry supported, there has been a very big inroad made on the number of unemployed persons of whom we got delivery five years ago, and there has been a big effort made in providing cheap power for the future in the Shannon scheme.  A sugar beet factory has been started, and we helped industries which of themselves were unable to obtain loans.  That is a list of things which we are invited not to parade before the Dáil in order that judgment may be given in favour of the motion. In addition, we provided compensation for property destroyed during the Anglo-Irish struggle, and we provided compensation for those injured in it. We give better service at lower taxation and we have a sound economic <Col N="511" /> fabric.  We have a negligible national debt.  We have no liability in respect of the Great War, and we are one of the very few countries in Europe which were in that war and which have no liabilities in respect of it.</P>

      <P>On that question of misrepresentation of what Deputies say, it should be remembered that we are here mainly because we disagree, and one of our main purposes is to listen to our mutual disagreements. Except when something personally offensive is said about a Deputy I think the Deputy who is speaking must be allowed to proceed.  That is to say, a Deputy makes a speech, another Deputy makes a speech on the other side, the second Deputy may tell the House what he thinks the meaning of the first speech was, and he may travel very far from the mind of the Deputy who made the first speech. There is no possibility of keeping him right from the point of view of the first Deputy.  If Deputies on all sides would understand that, we would get on much better.  The only thing is to listen to the speech and make a reply to that speech.</P>

      <P>I am giving what I may call the other side of the picture. I do not want to be misunderstood. I am not painting it in too glaring colours.  I say that the worldwide slump in agriculture has made itself felt here, but from what I hear from those in touch with agriculture in the United States and England, we have survived the shock much better than they have in those two countries. I gather from some of the statements made here that it is part of our responsibility to find work for everybody. There is only one country in which I know that that has been attempted, with the usual prospect of success.  I do not know what the population is, but I find that in that country there are something like eight millions of people idle.  That is in Russia.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>From Reuter's correspondent.  All that I am asking for in these matters is to get the other side of the picture.  We are told that there is a low standard of living here. I wonder does anybody know what the standard of living is elsewhere.  Does anybody know of persons who left this country to find employment on the Continent and who gave an account of their pilgrimage?  Whether they were employed in vineyards or in mines, what account did they bring back after their pilgrimage?  If that is on record we ought to have it.  It was suggested that there should be a tax on a portion of exported capital through the banks &mdash;the tax to be maintained on a graduated scale every year until employment was provided for everybody in the country.  The free movement of capital is essential in the modern economic world and attempts to check it have failed.  In France, Germany and other countries in certain crises stringent steps have been taken towards that end but they did not succeed and alternative measures had to be adopted&mdash; stabilisation of currency in a big effort to induce capital to remain in the country, and budgetary reform.  There are certain necessary imports, things which we cannot do without, and only a person who has no experience of industry would suggest peat as an alternative to <Col N="513" /> coal.  We must purchase a certain quantity of coal.  A proposal such as a tax upon capital might cause the migration of the owners of the capital. That happened in countries on the Continent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us understand that.  The banks' dividends would correspondingly suffer.  The ordinary business man seeks to make a profit from one source if he loses from another.  If, as a result of such a policy as that suggested, it was necessary for the banks to make more profit it would mean an increase in the rate of interest, discount rates would go up, and possibly other rates such as the rate on deposit might go down.  If there were migration of the owners of capital the position would be distinctly changed for the worse, and one could not restrict it to banks.  Bank investments must be capable of being turned into money at very short notice.  That is one of the disabilities under which banks suffer.  They get money on deposit and they must be able to produce it at short notice, within one month, or two or three months, according to agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That means they must be able to turn whatever sums they have invested into liquid assets at very short notice. Even if it were possible to effect the purpose in mind it does not follow we will have that capital used to develop industry here at home.  Even if it were so done, if one could possibly bring great compulsion to bear on banks or persons having money, they are entitled to ask a return of some sort on their capital.  They are entitled to ask for a certain dividend, and it is on the cards they would ask the Government to guarantee such a dividend.  The Deputy will see at once the danger there is in a case of that sort.  I think it is very well known that some extraordinary occurrences took place on the Continent in respect to this question <Col N="514" /> of migration of capital.  Now, with regard to banking deposits, comparing the deposits in the year 1924 with the year 1913, we find that as far as banks in the Saorstát are concerned the figures are 2.8, or almost three times what they were in 1913.  A comparison of the statistics in respect of 44 countries published in 1924 shows that the increase over 1913 was greatest in Ireland, excepting Japan, Norway, Spain, and some of the South and Central American Republics, so that as far as money is concerned we appear to be fairly sound.  The amendment takes into consideration the purpose of the motion, which means either extending unemployment insurance benefits or giving money in relief.  The amendment brings before the Dáil a vital consideration respecting any movement of public funds that may seriously hamper industry.  I am satisfied that great care has been exercised during the past five years, and I am prepared to accept the vote of this House on the Government's record on the provision of employment during that time.</P>

      <P>Valuable suggestions have been made by many of the Deputies who have taken part in this debate. It is quite evident there are Deputies who are prepared to put forward schemes without any reference to the question as to how the necessary money is to be found and the conditions under which it is to be forthcoming. I had hoped that the President or some responsible member of the Ministry would have indicated the Government's policy in regard to the question of the new national loan.  On the other side of the House I hoped also that Deputy de Valera would have made some reference to that very important question.  We have seen in the newspapers that it is the intention of the Government to float a national loan in the immediate future of about £5,000,000.  I assume it is the intention to float an internal loan.  I hope the amount the Government have in mind will far exceed the figure mentioned. We have, on the other hand, a statement by Deputy de Valera and leading members of the Fianna Fáil Party that their intention would be to float an external loan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want Deputy de Valera to state in this House and not outside the intention of his Party on this important matter.  It is bound up with the solution of the problem we are now discussing.  During the discussion on the tariff question the other evening I heard murmurs of approval from the Fianna Fáil Benches of the suggestion that there should be an embargo on the export of Irish capital and that we should prevent the importation of outside capital for the development of our industries.  I do not subscribe to that policy.  I ask Deputy de Valera&mdash;does he propose to develop Irish industries by relying solely on capital which could be raised in this country?  If he does he will present himself with a very difficult problem.  When it was proposed to establish the sugar beet factory at Carlow members of all parties were, I think, interested in the proposal.  The authorised capital for this undertaking was £400,000, but notwithstanding that personal appeals were made to influential farmers and business men throughout the country the position in the end was that only £10,000 was subscribed in the country.  If Deputy de Valera and the Fianna Fáil Party were in sympathy with the Beet Factory scheme would they drop the proposal because they could not find in the country the money necessary to establish the factory? That case must be kept in mind when we are confronted with the policy that we should prevent the importation of foreign capital, and that industries must be developed only by means of whatever capital can be found within the country.  I hope that Deputy de Valera or some member of his Party will explain their position with regard to the national loan and state whether any conditions are attaching to their support for obtaining the money which must be found if this problem is to be solved in the immediate future, and whether the Fianna Fáil Party favours an internal or external loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read in the newspapers&mdash;of course they do not always report Deputy de Valera or anybody correctly&mdash;that it was his intention to go to America and enter into negotiations with people who would be prepared to provide <Col N="516" /> £50,000,000.  I cannot understand any man associating himself with a policy of preventing money coming into this country and at the same time favouring an external loan.  This matter, I hope, will not be evaded by the responsible Ministers on the Government side, or the leaders of the Fianna Fáil Party. The political platform in Carlow and Kilkenny is not the place to discuss that question, but in this House.  We must have information of the policy of the Government, and Fianna Fáil must make their policy clear to the investing public who are to be invited to subscribe to the loan in the near future. We had the usual litany from the Government with regard to the assistance they have given during the past four or five years towards the relief of unemployment. I was surprised at the statement by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health that there is a sum of £1,500,000 available for local authorities for road maintenance and construction work.  His reply to a question by a member of his own Party today leads me to believe I would be justified in asking him or some other person to give details of that sum, and to tell us the counties that are sinning by refusing to use the money provided by the Local Government Department for road maintenance and construction work. My information is that in one county of the constituency of Leix-Offaly men have been actually paid off because there is now no money available for further work to be carried out.  Therefore, I think the House is entitled to the details of this amount of £1,500,000.  The Minister, of course, as his predecessor did on previous occasions, told us of what had been done in connection with housing.  Everyone will agree that the President is an expert on the question. He has told Deputy Cassidy that 400 houses have been built in Tirconaill, I presume under the Housing (Building Facilities) Act, but he has not stated how many of these houses have been built through the agency of local authorities.  Money, no doubt, has been available for speculative builders to build houses at a profit and to let them at a rent or sell them at a price which the workingman could not afford to <Col N="517" /> pay.  What is the position of the Local Government Department even now in regard to housing grants?  In the Estimates for the present year we find that as against 1926-27 there is a reduction in the amount available for housing of £80,000.  I presume the Minister accepts that figure.  If not, if he will look at page 142 of the Estimates for Public Services he will find I am quoting correctly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody knows the need in that respect better than the President.  I take it for granted that the amount of money that has been made available under the Housing (Building Facilities) Acts of 1925 and 1926 has been used up by speculative builders, who have built houses entirely for profit, and who have sold them in some cases at prices which workingmen cannot afford to pay.  I have had representations from urban areas in my own constituency, and I have accompanied deputations to the Local Government Department at which it was made quite clear in the case of Tullamore, Birr, and other areas, that it was impossible on the basis of a fifteen years' loan, even with the grants set aside under the Housing (Building Facilities) Acts, to <Col N="518" /> build houses at an economic rent, or at a rent which people looking for them can afford to pay.  Take Tullamore as a case in point.  The matter of a building scheme for Tullamore has been before the Local Government Department for one and a half years.  Notwithstanding the fact that there has been an agreed rent, and that the site has been made available by the Board of Works, it is found impossible to build and let houses at a rent less than 5/9 per week.  In Tullamore the average wage of the workers is about 30/- per week&mdash;it certainly does not exceed 35/-.  Does the President or the Minister for Local Government think that workingmen, whose wages do not exceed 35/-, can afford to pay 5/9 per week for a house?  That problem will not be solved under the regulations laid down in the Housing (Building Facilities) Acts.  The demand made by the local authorities who are anxious to assist in providing the necessary houses is that loans should be made available which would be repayable over a period of thirty or thirty-five years, in order to enable the houses to be let to those who want them at an economic rent.  I want to know why such facilities are not being provided when facilities of the same kind were provided when the British Government were in control here.</P>
      <P>As to afforestation schemes, we were told by the Minister for Finance that they were putting into operation a programme of 5,000 acres per year for the next ten years.  Afforestation gave relatively little employment.  What do we find in the Forestry Vote for this year?  We find that there is a sum of £57,040 provided for the huge scheme outlined yesterday by the Minister. There is a separate sum of £10,000 for the acquisition of land.  Does the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Agriculture suggest that 5,000 acres of land can be provided during the present financial year for £10,000?</P>

I want to know whether the money necessary for the schemes put forward by the Forestry Branch will be made available by the Finance Department, or if there is any reluctance on the part of that Department to provide the money that will enable the schemes already put forward by the Forestry Branch to be carried out.  I notice also in the same Estimate that although 21 employees were provided for in this particular Department in 1926-27, only 19 are provided for in the current financial year, which would go to show that there is a go-slow rather than a progressive policy in regard to this particular grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to drainage, I consider that one of the most useful Acts passed here is the Arterial Drainage Act of 1925.  I expressed the view when the Bill was going through that if it were properly administered it should go a long way to solve the unemployment problem in rural Ireland.  What is the position?  How much money has been spent under that particular Act since it was passed almost three years ago? In reply to a question which I addressed to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance on Wednesday of last week, asking him how many schemes had been submitted by the County Council of Leix, how many had been approved by the Board of Works, how much money had been set aside in connection with this particular matter out of the Votes passed, he stated that nine schemes had been submitted and that not one of the nine had yet been approved of by the Board of Works, notwithstanding the fact that some of these schemes have been lying in the Minister's Department since the Act was passed.  If that is the way the Act is going to be administered there is very little hope that, as was thought at the time, it will go any way at all to solve the unemployment problem in rural Ireland.  We have, of course, <Col N="520" /> lump sums in round figures given in the Estimates, but Fianna Fáil Deputies must not take it that all the money provided here in a particular financial year is spent in the year for which it has been provided.  If they will study the Appropriation Account for 1925-6 or the previous years they will find that these Estimates were exaggerated, or, in other words, that the money that was provided for a specific purpose was not spent on the purpose for which it was provided.  I hope they will not be led to believe at any rate that the £50,000 provided in this year's Estimate under the Arterial Drainage Act is likely to be spent this year.</P>
    <P>I want to associate myself with the suggestion made by Deputy O'Dowd that the Minister for Local Government should take serious thought of the health conditions prevailing in the provincial towns generally in the country. The sanitary conditions prevailing there &mdash;I really should not refer to them as sanitary conditions&mdash;are a disgrace to any civilised country.  That position cannot be relieved by saying it is the liability of the ratepayers.  I have in mind one or two occasions where I put it before the Local Government Department that money should be set aside out of the relief schemes or such funds at any rate to relieve people in areas where sewerage and drainage schemes are necessary in the interests of the public health.  I shall quote a case in point.  A sewerage scheme was put forward six or seven years ago, perhaps it was put forward even previously, for the town of Mountmellick where there are simply abominable sanitary conditions. The estimate was about £12,000 and it was eventually reduced to a figure about £10,000.  If that scheme were put into operation and the liability was made a charge upon the dispensary district area, I understand the charge to the local ratepayers would amount to a sum of 4/11 in the £.  Does the Minister suggest that that scheme should be made a charge upon the local ratepayers and that the people responsible for local rates should be charged with a financial burden of that kind? If he regards the scheme as necessary there should be some alternative for carrying it out.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister for Local <Col N="521" /> Government it would be a great education to him if he would get a report from the Medical Officers of Health in the towns in provincial Ireland where no sewerage scheme is in existence at present.  I suggest if he read the reports of these medical people he would look upon it as his duty to try and solve this great problem.  I think the problem never will be solved if you are going to insist upon placing the responsibility on the local ratepayers because the local ratepayers, as Deputy O'Dowd suggested, in the case of the town he mentioned, could not bear the financial burden involved.  If that is so and there being a national necessity for the provision of sewerage and drainage schemes throughout the country, the responsibility and the liability to provide the money to carry these schemes through must rest with the Minister.</P>

      <P>I do admit that the danger to the public health cannot be removed by the vote of £150,000 provided for in the Estimate, but I suggest that this is a national problem and it is for the Minister to say whether the liability for the carrying out of such necessary work should be made a charge upon the local ratepayers. The Minister for Finance said yesterday that we could get any <Col N="522" /> money we want for productive work and on fairly good terms.  I was very glad to hear that, but he went further and talked about economic schemes, referring to drainage schemes. I wonder how many of the schemes examined by the Minister for Finance he would consider economic schemes? When he talks about schemes being economic, is he looking at them from the point of view of the taxpayer, or does he take the ratepayer's view into consideration in regard to these particular schemes?</P>
      <P>I understood, in the first instance, in connection with the arterial drainage scheme, that the maximum amount from State sources would be limited to thirty-three and one-third.  I am not sure if I am right or well informed, but I understand now the Ministry is prepared to go to the extent of 50 per cent.?&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that. I would like to know how many schemes submitted to the Ministry with the total grant of 50 per cent. have been carried out or are about to be carried out?  I cannot find many schemes that have been carried out under the Arterial Drainage Act.  I suggest to the Minister for Finance that it would be good policy to try and secure the services of qualified engineers in order to enable him to carry out the schemes. I was interested in a scheme in my own particular area, and raised the question here several times, and I found that the delay in carrying it out was due to delay in the preliminary work owing to the fact that the engineers were changed from time to time.  I find that one engineer who had £200 a year secured a job in Rhodesia, and, having found this job, he left the Ministry, with the result that the Ministry had to find another engineer.  A second engineer was sent on the job, and the preliminary work is not complete yet. I suggest to the Minister for Finance that £200 a year is not suitable for an engineer qualified and fit to prepare schemes of this kind.  If the Minister is <Col N="523" /> going to rely upon engineers that accept a salary of £200 a year he will wait until Tibb's Eve before these schemes are carried out to the satisfaction of those who supported him when the Bill was before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully realise that the Government have in many ways, for instance, in the case of the beet sugar, road construction and maintenance work, given a good deal of useful and valuable employment, but I still think there is a good way to travel before it can be said that they have made a serious attempt to grapple with the unemployment problem. So far as rural Ireland is concerned, I think that the unemployment position, instead of being better than it was last year, is much worse than last year.  The real reason for the increase in unemployment is because the producer who is producing wealth is forced to sell in the market below the cost of production, with the result that he cannot give employment to the same extent that he did in the years when he was in a position to find a market for his produce at an economic price.  I urge upon the Minister for Finance the advisability of administering the Arterial Drainage Act in a much more businesslike manner than he has done up to the present.  I think if he would concentrate on the administration of that particular Act he will find that the money made available from State sources would tend to solve the unemployment problem in rural Ireland, and it is the only way that we can see at the moment that the problem can be faced with any certainty of reducing the number of the unemployed in rural Ireland. I notice that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health said in his speech &ldquo;that the Ministry would avoid, as far as possible, road work, because there was at least £1,300,000 for expenditure on roads, but there were other works in the towns and cities which might be undertaken.&rdquo; In the name of goodness, will the Minister for Industry and Commerce give us particulars of the works that can be undertaken in the towns and cities, works referred to by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, which will in any way go any distance to relieve the unemployment that exists <Col N="524" /> in the towns and cities with the sum of £150,000 which he now says is to be made available for the relief of unemployment?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan) Patrick J. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to more amateur economics in this debate yesterday than ever I heard before.  I understand everything is relevant in this debate, but I will just confine myself to one point.  We were told that we must face this in a great national way as a non-party question; we must set up an Economic Commission, and so on.  When I heard talk of that sort I knew perfectly well that the persons who spoke like that have no clear-cut ideas themselves on the question.  But Deputy de Valera used the phrase, and followed that by saying that they had a clear-cut policy and that they had a solution for these problems.  He said that the island had to be reconstructed. That is a tall order.  He said we have to do this, do that, and do the other thing. Apparently everything is wrong.  Agriculture is improperly organised; industry is improperly organised; the railways are wrong; the banks are wrong, the general policy of every organised body in the country is wrong, and we must alter this and alter that.  Who are &ldquo;we&rdquo;?  Are the people to have no say in the matter at all?  Are the farmers to have no say as to how their industry is to be organised?  Are the business men of the country to have no opportunity of saying how their business is to be organised?  Who are &ldquo;we&rdquo; who must change the agricultural economy of the country, who must change the whole industrial organisation of the country, must change the transport system and the banking system?  The Government apparently, or the Dáil, or this commission that is to be set up. They have got to do it.  That is what takes place, and we are told that is a clear-cut policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently there is a clear-cut policy for agriculture, as far as I could gather it, and one item which I should just like to examine is that which prohibits the importation of animal feeding stuffs.  Just let us examine that as a solution for our economic ills and in particular as a solution for the problem of unemploy- <Col N="525" /> ment.  We are to prohibit the import of all animal feeding stuffs.  Very well.  Would it occur to the amateur farmers who are talking, as an extraordinary fact, that generally speaking far and away the greater proportion of imported feeding stuffs goes to districts where there is a high proportion of tillage as compared with pastures? Yet that is a fact.  If you just take that fact and turn it over in your minds I think you will find some doubts as to whether your economic panacea is just right.  Very little imported feeding stuffs go to Meath or to any of the grazing districts of the country.  Most of the imported feeding stuffs go to the districts where there is a high proportion of tillage. Just think of that fact first and think of it in the light of your policy to prohibit imported feeding stuffs in order to encourage tillage and to give the employment that increased tillage affords.</P>
    <P>Take another fact which is also illuminating in the light of that particular policy which has been enunciated. In Denmark there is no grass; nevertheless the Danes import per farmer at least three times as much feeding stuffs as we do.  There is no grazing in Denmark because the land will not remain in grass for two years running. It is not suitable for grazing.  Every acre of land practically that is arable at all, every acre of agricultural land, in Denmark is tilled and still the Danish farmer imports three times as much feeding stuffs as we do.  Put these two facts together and try to square them with the doctrine that we should prohibit the importation of feeding stuffs and then, when you will see you cannot square these two doctrines, enquire why.  The answer is quite simple.  No country can grow economically all the feeding stuffs it requires.  It might be done one hundred years ago.  It might be done at the time when a beast was fattened at five, six or seven years old.  I suppose that was a hundred years ago.  It might be done if we fattened our pigs at two years, but it cannot be done now economically.  You cannot produce the sort of foodstuffs that are wanted for modern requirements on the basis of producing them from food grown exclusively in the country, and <Col N="526" /> we are not unique in that way.  No other country can do it either.  You must have a balanced ration.  You must mix your rations as every farmer knows.</P>
    <P>I suppose there are farmers on the Fianna Fáil Benches who use imported feeding stuffs.  If the import of cotton cake or palm nut cake were to be prohibited; what do they think?  Do they think it would be sound for farming, or do they think it should be done?  If we increase our tillage&mdash;and we can increase our tillage; there is room for increased tillage&mdash;we would want more imported foodstuffs.  We do not grow proteins to any extent, and we do not grow sufficient carbohydrates.  If we cannot grow them and refuse to import them, what can we do?</P>
    <P>Look at it from another point of view.  Supposing you have that prohibition in force, who would be affected but the ordinary farmer who tills a fair proportion of his land at the moment and who gives a fair amount of employment as a result?  Take a specific example, because in a diffuse debate like this we will never get anywhere unless we take some point and examine it closely.  Take a farmer who is, say, a solicitor, with 200 acres.  He has 30 acres of tillage, 60 or 70 cattle, 100 ewes, pigs and fowl.  I am taking a typical case.  Thirty acres of tillage on that farm is a high enough percentage for this country.  That farmer must for winter feeding, in addition to tilling thirty acres, buy about £400 worth of feeding stuffs.  You might say &ldquo;why not produce it in this country?&rdquo;&ldquo;Why not grow sixty acres?&rdquo; Leave out this question as to whether you must have a balanced ration, as to whether you can economically produce feeding stuffs, all the proteins, all the carbohydrates and all the oils that go to making up economic feeding.  Leave out that question and assume for the sake of argument that we are able to do it and do it economically.  Look at it from another angle&mdash;the point of view of the farmer who has 200 acres.</P>
    <P>He has at present thirty acres under tillage.  He has to carry a lot of stock in the summer and in addition to that provide feeding for his stock in the winter.  I am speaking of the average case.  In spite of his tillage he has to <Col N="527" /> buy £400 worth of feeding stuffs.  You may say let him grow more.  Assume that he can grow more and then what do you find?  To grow the additional feeding required he has to till not thirty acres more, but fifty acres more. That is 80 acres in all.  Where does he get that tillage?  He goes into his meadow for it.  His first position was thirty acres of tillage and thirty acres of meadow&mdash;sixty acres in all.  He had say 180 acres entirely.  He has 120 acres left.  He has perhaps 20 acres of waste land, therefore he has one hundred acres of grazing for his stock in summer time.  From that hundred acres he has to till sixty more, in order to feed the same amount of stock in winter as he would feed with the original area of tillage and feeding stuffs he bought.</P>
    <P>Any farmer who has ever engaged in mixed farming will realise that, the moment you put up the proposition that the importation of all feeding stuffs should be prohibited, what you are really asking the farmers of this country to do is to become winter instead of summer farmers.  I do not mind arguing that question if it is realised that it is the question we are arguing.  You could argue it intelligently. We might even agree or disagree on it one way or the other, but at least we would agree or disagree intelligently on it.  What I do complain of is that you have put up here in the most dogmatic and superior way economic doctrines by people who have not the slightest idea of their implications. I ask any farmer in the House, no matter what party he belongs to, if I am wrong in stating that the very moment you put a general prohibition on all imported feeding stuffs what you are asking us to do is to insist on winter farming in this country instead of summer farming.  That is the question that is raised, and it is a very big one. Ought we do that?  I suggest that proposition will not bear a moment's examination. The very fact that the farmers of this country have discovered, during the long experience of 100 years, that summer farming is more profitable for them is enough.  They are pretty good judges.  Farmers, like other people, make mistakes individually. Some are better farmers than <Col N="528" /> others, some are better educated than others, but I suggest that the system of farming which has persisted for such a long time in this country, which has grown up slowly and which is the result of the wisdom of generations of farmers, is generally fairly right. There may be plenty of room for improvement and there may be a need for development.  I think the need is for development, not change.  The idea in this country that what is is wrong, and that what we want is change, is fundamentally wrong.  Here is a prima facie case for what is.  I suggest that a very strong case would need to be put up for what is not before the State should actively intervene on that side.  What you need in this country, as everyone who goes in for mixed farming knows, is not a change in the system of farming, and that need not be argued because farmers will not do it, but development, and the agricultural industry is capable of a lot of development.  I do not mean to say that we should not have more tillage. I think that we should, and I want to see more tillage in the country.  I want to see the big farmers tilling more than they have been, and I want to see the small farmers till, say, an acre more. If they did so it is my opinion that this would be a far wealthier country than it is, but to suggest that the importation of all feeding stuffs is to be prohibited, that everything is to be produced in the country, and that instead of summer farming we are to have winter farming, all that, in my opinion, is simply talking nonsense and is beside the point.</P>
    <P>Let us suppose for a moment that we did that.  You start by forcing the farmers to go in purely and simply for winter farming.  By doing that you ignore the fact that our summer is eight months long.  We have summer farming here, because we have a longer summer than they have on the Continent, and the reason for that is that we have a much more open climate.  The period for our summer farming extends from about 1st May to the end of December, and our winter period from the 1st January to the end of April.  Suppose you did force farmers to go back to winter farming, to feed all their stock from home-grown crops, and to feed <Col N="529" /> only from these, I suggest to farmer Deputies, whether they are on the Fianna Fáil or other Benches, that that is not going to improve the country, that it is not going to make the country more prosperous, because it will mean that we will produce less cattle than we are producing now.  I think the aim should be to produce more cattle than we are producing.  Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that you produce the same number of cattle that you are producing now, even though you have to feed them indoors and with crops grown from seeds that you produce at home.  To start with, we supply all the needs of this country in beef.</P>
    <P>I do not want any Deputy to interrupt me with the irrelevancy that we import suet and other things like that to the value of £130,000.  That is of no account.  The point is that we produce all the beef we require and export nearly £15,000,000 worth of beef.  That is to say, that after supplying all our own needs we have £15,000,000 worth of beef over.  What are you going to do with them when you have finished them by the new method that is proposed? Are we to send them over to England or put them in glass cases?  There is no alternative, because we have fed everyone in Ireland that will pay for the beef.  Again, you will not get the farmer to part with his beast unless he is paid for it.  The farmer, having provided for everyone in Ireland who pays for the beef, sends the balance, up to £15,000,000 worth to England.  He will have to take the same price as he took before, notwithstanding that the cost of producing the animal and sending it over will be far greater than what it is at present, and that is supposed to be good business.</P>
    <P>Take butter.  We produce all the butter we need in this country, all that will be bought and paid for.  In addition, we export £4,000,000 worth of butter.  Do not complicate the situation by reminding me that we import £600,000 worth of butter.  Let us allow for that importation and set off against it £600,000 of the butter that we export. What would the position be then?  The position would be this, that, roughly speaking, we produce all the butter that the country needs, and export over £3,000,000 worth.  What are we going <Col N="530" /> to do with that?  There are some Limerick Deputies in the House and I am sure they would be delighted to hear what is to be done with it.  They would have to calve their cows in autumn and feed the calves during the winter and still sell their butter at the same price they are getting now.  And yet that is regarded as a magnificent prospect. That is what Deputy de Valera really advocates if he only examines it. The Limerick farmer knows that, and that he would still have to sell this £3,000,000 worth of butter, which this country does not need, in the English market at exactly the same price that he is selling it now.  Why is there not winter farming in this country, and why is butter not produced here in the winter?  For the reason that we produce more butter than the country needs, and we have to export our surplus supply.  We export the butter to a market where it is sold in competition with butter that is produced in summer time in New Zealand.  New Zealand summer time is our winter.  If we sent butter in winter to the English market, having provided for the requirements of all our own natives, it would have to be sold against butter from New Zealand that had been produced in that country during the summer which is our winter time.</P>
    <P>There is the same position with regard to bacon.  There is a lot of talk about the amount of American bacon that comes in here.  Roughly speaking, we produce about £8,000,000 worth of bacon in pigs.  We consume at home about £4,000,000 worth, and we export about £4,000,000 worth.  We complete the transaction by importing about £3,000,000 worth.  The point is that we produce all the bacon that we require for the country, and after doing that we have £1,000,000 worth of bacon over. That is really what it amounts to.</P>
    <P>You can put it in another way, that we have enough bacon to supply the needs of the country and to export a £1,000,000 worth.  We are told that bacon is also to be produced in the good old way&mdash;with home-grown feeding stuffs, exclusively, and that it is to be sold&mdash;the same applying to eggs&mdash; and that is regarded as an economic policy, something that will bring about employment and that will make the <Col N="531" /> farmers rich.  It is hard to expect the ordinary farmer to understand the implications of these statements when Deputies will not take the trouble to understand them.</P>
    <P>At present the farmer finds it very hard to live.  His conditions are bad. The conditions of the farmers all over the world are bad.  He can only live by real hard work, by economies and by concentrating on his business.  You have the farmer in that condition on the one side, and on the other you have the prospect held out before him that the State, or somebody, has some panacea by which he can be made rich immediately, by which he can be absolutely assured a market, by which he can get just the price for his produce that he wants.  You have statements such as Deputy de Valera has made, statements such as other Deputies on the same benches have made, that tend to concentrate the farmer on a false issue, tend to concentrate his mind on something that is going to lead to nothing.  As long as you have the farmers taught&mdash;and there are numbers of small farmers who have not a high standard of education&mdash;that there is some short cut to riches by means of protection&mdash;and protection has become a blessed word, like Mesopotamia; it sounds well&mdash;that by some such change in the system, you can get them riches, or at least prosperity and decency, and that they are wasting their time in concentrating and making things meet now, the tendency will be for farmers not to work.</P>
    <P>You talk about protection, you talk about a great national effort and reconstruction and a new policy, and changing everything.  Deputy de Valera's phrase was: &ldquo;The reconstruction of the island,&rdquo; and we are told that we must visualise the future, we must make up our minds as to just what sort of economy we need, and that when we have done that, presumably that economy will establish itself automatically.  What does that come to?  It is, in my opinion, a defeatist point of view.  Deputy de Valera asked us whether we are going to have great industries or rural industries. What answer was expected?  Supposing I said that I am all for ruralisation, <Col N="532" /> would not everyone say that that was grand?  But how are we to bring about ruralisation?  Surely Deputies do not think that we have just to say: &ldquo;We are all for ruralisation and we are not for mass production,&rdquo; and that that will bring it about.  It will not.  I hold that all this talk about protection, about the ruralisation of industries, and the picture that that will bring before your minds of lovely little factories with thatched roofs, and the boys and girls dancing under the trees after work, is all due to a vague idea that we are a chosen people, that we must be sheltered from the world, and that we have not the guts or energy or brains to go out and take our place with the other Philistines.  That point of view is all wrong.  I do not call that an Irish-Ireland point of view.  It took some Deputies five years to discover that we have political independence. Of course I do not expect them to admit it now, but they know it.  Now they tell us that economics is the thing to concentrate on.  I agree, but what are they doing now?  They are preaching a more devastating economic doctrine than formerly they preached in politics. They are preaching a doctrine exactly opposite to self-help and self-reliance. They are telling the farmers, the industrialists and the unemployed that there is some sad fate hanging over the country, that they are enmeshed in a situation, as Deputy de Valera said, that they must not be asked to do the sort of work that the uninitiated are asked to do, that they must not be asked to keep their noses to the grindstone, that they must not be asked to compete with the ordinary foreigner's point of view, that we must have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That point of view is an emasculating one.  You cannot make any decent country with that economic doctrine.  People in this country have to be told the truth; they have to be told that, though times are bad, we are in much the same position as any other country, and that we will only get over it if we stick it, because the man who sticks it longest wins.  The farmer will understand that, that the man who keeps producing wins in the long run.  The same applies to the country as a whole.  The people should be told the truth.  It can be admitted that times are bad, but on the other hand, we have not a monopoly of bad times. You will not improve the farmer by saying to him: &ldquo;This Government should change your whole economy for you, and if you will only listen to us we have some panacea for all your ills,&rdquo; and a panacea which sounds all right&mdash;Protection and national reconstruction. But it does not bear a moment's examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Flinn seems to be a little annoyed that I do not refer to him I will do so now.  I would really like to refer to one of his statements.  He held at great length that as we had only one market, we seemed to be in this position, that our purchasers were in a position to compel us to keep producing for that market at the bare cost of production, added to the bare subsistence.  That was enunciated formally as the profound conclusion of a great economist.  It means, in other words, that when we sell our cattle in England the buyer never asks what is the price of the beast or what is it worth to him; he makes a little calculation and says: &ldquo;This belongs to a small farmer in the West of Ireland. His costs of production are so much and his bare subsistence costs are so much.&rdquo;  Incidentally, they pay more for our cattle per cwt. than they pay the Canadians, who are not in that position.  We are in the position&mdash;the unfortunate position, if you like&mdash;that we sell 98½ per cent. of our produce in the one market.  Canada does not; she distributes her goods in five or six different countries.  But when we compare our prices for, say, bacon, with the prices of American bacon, when <Col N="534" /> we compare our prices for cattle and beef with the prices for Canadian cattle, we find that ours are higher.</P>

      <P>Of course it is.  That is the reason.  The English people do not buy cattle, sheep, pigs or butter for any reason other than that they consider they get value.  That is the only thing they go into and that is the only thing any business man will go into. He will not consider whether we have only one market or two markets, because there are ten or twenty different people competing with these products in the English market.  He will simply ask himself if the article is value for the money, and if it is he will buy it. So far from giving us a lower price than that obtained by other exporters to the British market, in a great many cases, because of the value of the goods we get higher prices.  We get higher prices for our beef&mdash;and now for our eggs&mdash;and our bacon than most, and yet you will find the economist of the Fianna Fáil Party telling us that what really rules the prices of our produce in the English market is some sort of minute calculation made by the English purchaser as to what it costs to produce and what is the bare subsistence for the farmer.  We get nowhere with that sort of generality.  We must just settle down to concrete points and examine them.  I have attempted to examine one of them.  I have attempted to examine the one statement on which Deputy de Valera built up his agricultural policy, having announced that Fianna Fáil had a clear-cut policy.  All I have to say is this, that no group of farmers in this country would think it worth while to give it five minutes' examination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughColohan" hpid="Mr. COLOHAN Mr. COLOHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COLOHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, to which we have just listened, is just a development of the carefully-worded amendment which has been tabled by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the last words of which state:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;care must be exercised in the adoption of relief measures to ensure that the evil which it is sought to remedy is not aggravated by the placing of <Col N="535" /> an undue strain on the resources of industry and agriculture.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That means that the Government is not prepared to make any decent attempt to relieve the destitution that is consequent upon unemployment.  That is quite evident from the amount of the Vote of £150,000, or £6,000 for each county, which the Dáil has been asked to pass.  We know that £6,000 could be spent in any town of 3,000 or 4,000 inhabitants, and that it would not give more than two or three months' work. What is to become of the people for the remainder of the time?  The Minister went in for giving a lecture on high economics.  I wonder how it will be read by the unemployed in to-morrow's newspapers?  I am sure they will want to know if this is a debate on unemployment and on the relief of starvation consequent on unemployment.  I do not think the Minister was speaking to Deputy Morrissey's motion at all:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the measures hitherto adopted by the Government for the relief of unemployment are insufficient and ought to be extended immediately.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the unemployed are to wait until all those grandiose schemes proposed by the Minister are carried out, I wonder where will the unemployed be?  The only solution that I can see is for the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in his capacity as Minister for External Affairs, to select a happier land somewhere outside the Saorstát for the unemployed. I think that might help to solve the problem.  If the Minister does that, I can promise him from 5,000 to 10,000 Kildare men, women and children who would be glad to shake the dust of the county from their feet, as they have had a miserable existence there for the last five or six years, since this Government came into office.  I know what I am speaking about.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said yesterday that the question of unemployment was different from the question of starvation.  I would like to ask the Minister how he could separate the two.  He stated: &ldquo;We do not pretend to set up machinery to give everyone employment, but we have machinery to prevent people from starving.&rdquo;  What is that machinery?  The Minister did <Col N="536" /> not tell us.  We know what the machinery is.  It is machinery designed to demoralise the people.  In the old days things were bad enough, but they are infinitely worse now, because the name and address of everyone who gets a miserable shilling or two in home help in placarded through the country.  I do not know if that has the sanction of the Minister for Local Government, but reports of the amounts given to individuals as home help is published in the local Press.  I ask is that decent treatment for the unfortunate poor? It is time to stop that and to send out instructions to the boards of health that the names of the poor people are not to be published.  I had to refer to this matter before, and I hope that our new Minister for Local Government will see that the people are not blackguarded in this way.  It is no crime to be poor.</P>
    <P>I have visited fifteen or sixteen towns in County Kildare during the last three months, and I was in many of the workers' houses.  The cry in North and South Kildare is: &ldquo;Give us work so that we may not be hungry.&rdquo; Still, we are told by the Minister for Finance that there is machinery to prevent people from starving.  I do not like to have to get up in the Dáil year after year referring to the state of affairs in County Kildare.  What can I do?  I am asked to call attention to this matter, and although I have done so a dozen times every year I get very little redress.  I can point to a few things on which work might be carried out by the different Departments which would come under the heading of Deputy Morrissey's motion to extend relief measures immediately.  Many drainage schemes could be carried out which would provide useful and, I would say, remunerative employment. It is maintained that some of these schemes are not economic, that they are not for the benefit of the land, and would not be sufficient to warrant the expenditure of money.  In the country the people are clamouring for drainage schemes.  Several schemes have been sent up to the Board of Works from Kildare, but as yet none of them have been sanctioned, and possibly they will not be sanctioned.  The procedure under the Arterial Drainage Act of <Col N="537" /> 1925 is so hide-bound that it is impossible to get any scheme passed by the Department.  In the interests of fair play I think that Act ought to be repealed. When it was passed we looked forward to unemployment being relieved to some extent by its administration. As far as I know, there has not been a single drainage scheme started in the Saorstát under that Act. I speak subject to correction, but, judging by the various replies the Minister has made to Deputies, I did not hear of a single scheme being put into operation.  There is considerable distress in Kildare owing to the flooding of the Rye Water River and Clongorey River as well as in other places, but drainage schemes have been turned down by the Board of Works.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance to give these schemes further consideration so that unemployment might be relieved in these districts as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The drainage of the Barrow has given a good deal of employment.  I understand 400 or 500 men are getting a miserable pittance of 30/- a week, but they do not come under the scope of the Unemployment Insurance Act. These men get no benefit when they are idle owing to floods in the river.  I think the Government should not take any advantage of these men because there is periodic flooding, especially in the winter time, when they are thrown out of employment.  They have nothing else to maintain them, so that they can get a bit to eat.  Even when they are working they do not get 30/- a week, because, from one cause or another, owing to broken time, they may only get 30/- a fortnight.  I know of one man who had only five days' wages to get after a fortnight's work, or 12/6 a week.  I say that that is nothing better than home help, and he has to work jolly well for it.  I think the wages on that scheme, considering the deplorable conditions under which the men have to work, are altogether inadequate.  I ask the Minister to increase that wage at least to £2 a week; that amount is little enough for the conditions under which the men have to labour.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the Barrow scheme I may mention there are two tributaries, one of which is the Greece River at <Col N="538" /> Ballytore.  When that tributary is in flood the houses of the people in the vicinity are flooded in some cases to a depth of twelve inches.  I referred to that matter several times in this House and I was told on one occasion that when the Barrow scheme would be started this matter would receive attention. I do not see why a lot of work cannot be done on those tributaries. Even if you cannot sink the full depth, some relief would be given by deepening and improving the tributaries. There is a river near Rathangan called the Cush River and that river could be improved and a lot of the water taken away so as to enable the people to get the turf from the bogs to their homes.</P>
    <P>Coming to the letting of married quarters in military barracks, I think there should be more co-operation between the Housing Department of the Ministry of Local Government and the Department of Public Works.  Much relief can be given to people at present condemned to live in insanitary houses. In Newbridge we were trying to take over some married quarters, but through a hitch in the negotiations, caused by the Local Government Department refusing to give us the grants laid down under the Building Facilities Act, some 20 or 30 houses there are going into dilapidation.  Since we sent in the scheme damage to the extent of three or four hundred pounds has been done, all because of the refusal of the Local Government Department to give us the grants.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance promised me, in reply to a supplementary question some time ago, that he was seriously considering the abolition of the betting tax in connection with racing.  I think he should abolish that tax immediately, because it is ruining racing, and in Kildare, the centre of the racing industry in Ireland, it will have serious effects and cause grave unemployment. I hope the Minister will consider the matter from that point of view.  I want Ministers to remember that it is the duty of each one of them to do what he can to relieve the present terrible situation of the workers.</P>
    <P>I was almost forgetting to refer to the arterial drainage scheme that is to be dealt with by way of legislation <Col N="539" /> soon.  I hope it will not be hedged around by all the red tape that surrounds the Arterial Drainage Act already in existence.  I hope provision will be made to start the work immediately. If that is done it will give a lot of employment in different areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence could do something to help us in this problem. There were some men discharged recently from the Curragh Camp.  I hear the work they were engaged on has been finished, but surely there are other works that can be carried out with advantage. If any new schemes are in contemplation by the Army Corps of Engineers they could be pushed forward now, and in that way there would be some relief for the unemployment that exists around the Curragh.  When providing for next year's estimates I would ask the Minister to make sure that there will be no reduction in the numbers of the civilian staff at present working in the Curragh Camp, Kildare Barracks and Naas Barracks.  We are entitled to a good deal of consideration in these matters, because on the 2nd February, 1922, a very large deputation, consisting of residents representing all classes in the Curragh area, waited on the Provisional Government in the City Hall, and the members of the deputation were promised that the Government would do everything in their power to help the people, fully realising the way the area would be hit by the evacuation of the British troops.  If Deputy G. O'Sullivan were here he would bear me out in that, because he was present on that occasion.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister for Education say that he would proceed with the erection of new schools and class rooms and the reconstruction of old schools.  I think in Kildare he could give a considerable amount of employment because some of the schools are not fit to house dogs or cats.  Still, teachers have to spend almost all their lives there in insanitary schools with class rooms crowded out.  Now that the clauses of the Compulsory Attendance Act are being enforced, I suppose they have not five superficial feet to each pupil.  The Minister should make an effort to <Col N="540" /> speed up school construction, and he should see the specification emphasises the use of local stones and bricks.  At Athy we have millions of bricks, and I do not see why the people of Athy should not get a chance of getting rid of some of the stuff.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has been so often asked to restore uncovenanted benefit that there is no use, I suppose, in asking him about it any further; but I think he should give the matter a little further consideration.  Even with the best will in the world, no matter what schemes are provided I am sure there will be a certain number of men unemployed and they should get the benefit of the Unemployment Insurance Act.</P>
    <P>We have a lot of industries closed down there, and I think the Department should make some effort to reestablish them.  We have a flour mill in Athy, a distillery in Monasterevan, woollen mills in Ballymore-Eustace, a carpet factory in Naas and the Leixlip mills.  Surely it is within the competence of his Department to devise some scheme for setting these industries going again.  It is time to wake up and do something for the working classes. All this talk about economic problems should be given the go-by and let us get down to some solid work for the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands and Agriculture is not present, but I would like to draw his attention to the system by which the lands in North Kildare are parcelled out.  There are very few small cottiers in North Kildare that have got any grant of land.  The Minister is bringing migrants from all over the country, planting them in Kildare in large farms and building mansions for them, while the poor cottiers may go whistle for nine or ten acres of land. I say that it is not right.  As many cottiers as possible, deserving them, should be planted on these lands and it would take them out of competition with the ordinary casual landless labourer.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Fisheries to give those comments of mine some consideration and to give more consideration especially to the class about whom I have been corresponding with him for the last few <Col N="541" /> months.  I would suggest, also, to the Minister for Lands and Agriculture that he should impose a tariff on foreign barley and give the barley growers of South Kildare a chance.  I think the Minister for Local Government and Public Health would be well advised if he would give some of the £1,300,000 to the county councils throughout Ireland and let them start immediately.  I suggest that the main bog roads that are subject to rather heavy motor traffic should be strengthened and improved.  This will have to be done in a very short time at any rate and I do not see why it should not be done now when there are so many people unemployed.  A good deal of employment could also be given in the matter of the improvement of dangerous corners.  I think it is up to the Roads Board to help the county councils in this way.  Some of those dangerous corners mean a lot of expense, and it is not fair that the county councils, burdened as they are, should have imposed on them the further expenditure for what might be called outside traffic. I have put up the question of the widening of the Liffey bridge so many times that people are getting sick of it in this House.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance has promised me that he would deal with that matter.  I hope he will use his influence with the new Minister for Local Government and Public Health and that that work will be proceeded with at once.  That work would give employment to twenty or thirty men in the town of Newbridge where at present men are staggering with hunger about the streets.  I have said already that there should be more co-operation between the Department of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and the Housing Department of the Local Government. I hope there will be closer co-operation in future.  I do not know what I have got to say to the Ministry for Justice. Some time ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was speaking on the motion for the relief of unemployment. The only thing I see the Minister for Justice could do is to secure some grant from the Ministry of Finance to build pounds in the various towns for the impounding of cattle that are distrained for annuities and rates.  That would give some employment, too.  There is another thing that I think I should speak of, too, with respect to the Minister for Justice.  I would ask him to see that justice is tempered with mercy in the case of poor men who are prosecuted for arrears of rent and rates.  I had to speak of this matter before.  Of course, I know that the course of the law cannot be interfered with.  I have nothing to say to the law as administered by our District Justices.  I think we could not get more impartial men or men who temper justice with mercy more than they do.  But still a nod is as good as a wink to a blind horse.  Now that they will have so many cases coming before them it is as well to let them have this reminder.</P>
      <P>We have heard a lot of the friendly spirit with which this motion has been received on all sides of the House.  I hope that that is a good omen for the future.  I know that on the Government Benches we have men who sympathise with the sufferings of the people.  Looking at it from the Ministerial or Governmental point of view, they may say: &ldquo;Well, we cannot meet the Labour Party in this matter.&rdquo;  I would ask them to take the views of the whole House, the views of every Deputy in the House and let the Deputies vote freely.  Let the Whips be taken off and give every man here who is representing the people a chance to vote according to his conscience.  If the Ministry does that they will have done a good deal for the relief of unemployment and for the diminishing of the damnable conditions under which the majority of our people are living today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. AIKEN Mr. AIKEN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. AIKEN</NameTxt>
      <P>Both the President of the Executive Council and the Minister for Lands and Agriculture have spoken at length on what they said was the <Col N="543" /> policy of the Fianna Fáil Party.  They are both more or less fighting shadows. The Minister for Lands and Agriculture started off by saying that Deputy de Valera had advocated the immediate prohibition of all foodstuffs into Ireland. Deputy de Valera did not advocate the immediate prohibition of all foodstuffs into Ireland in his speech yesterday evening, nor on any other occasion.  What Deputy de Valera said was that we in this country were importing at least £25,000,000 worth of goods that we could, with some little organisation and some little trouble on the part of our governing authorities, produce here at home.  He started off and gave a list of the agricultural produce that has been imported into Ireland, or, I should say, imported last year into the Twenty-six Counties.  He read out some figures regarding the imports.  He said that the chief cereal imports amounted to £10,255,000.  That included what was sent out for wheat, barley, maize, oats, wheaten flour, oat products, malt and maize products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I believe that Deputy de Valera was very conservative in his statement when he said that with a little trouble we could produce most of these farm products here in our own land.  He might have added very many other products of the land that we import, and that we could produce them here with a little trouble.  For instance, in speaking of the goods which we could produce here in this country, he did not mention rice or rice flour that Deputy Cooper took great pains to show that we could not produce.  He did not mention the fruit which we import from other countries, an import which last year amounted to £1,231,000.  He did not mention preserved vegetables and edible vegetable oils, which, last year, amounted to £283,000.  He did not mention beer, ale and spirits which we imported into this country, and which are made out of farm products grown in other countries.  We do not make the case that Cumann na nGaedheal never did anything that had the slightest good in it.  We say that they did some things that had some good in them, but that in dealing with the economic conditions of this country, and in the political situation of this country, that they <Col N="544" /> did not deal with the matter as proper Irish representatives should have dealt with it.  They did not protect, first of all, the interests of the ordinary common people, and in framing their policy they gave more consideration than they should have given to the new ascendancy crowd that is growing up in the country.</P>
    <P>We believe that if there were a party of representatives in power here who would produce a policy suitable to the needs of the ordinary mass of the people, the farmers and labourers, instead of salaried civil servants, and if there were fewer of the foreign combines which have a certain grip here, that party could relieve unemployment in a very short time.  Anybody who wishes to relieve unemployment could do so in a very short time if he set about it.  We set ourselves to show how distress caused by unemployment could be immediately relieved.  Unemployment could be permanently relieved in a short time if the representatives of the people who have executive power set themselves to the job.  We gave many instances where little local jobs could be done throughout the country, and many of us gave instances how the relief of unemployment could be tackled in a big national way.  Deputy Hogan gave us a very eloquent lecture on agriculture. I am not going to take up the time of the House in arguing with him the merits or demerits of winter feeding against summer feeding, but I say that I do not believe that he would have the face to contradict me when I say that the Irish farmers could do without a lot of the feedings stuffs which they brought into the country last year. Deputy Hogan talked about Deputy Flinn's suggestion that the British were only giving us the bare costs of the produce which we sent over there. He said that, as a matter of fact, we are getting a better price for our beef and bacon in the English market than the Canadian or American farmers are getting. So we should, because we produce much better stuff.  If Deputy Hogan took a little trouble to show the people how the Americans produce some of the bacon which they send to England and to this country there would be less American bacon bought in England or Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="545" /> If one took the trouble to go to the stockyards in Chicago and other districts in Illinois where most of the bacon is killed and sent over here, he would find that the farmers and stock owners can feed corn to the cattle and feed their pigs on the result of manure. Our bacon is much better than that which the Americans send to England and any which the British buy from us is bought because it is a much better article than that which they could buy from any other country.  You may be sure that they do not buy from us because of their love of us.  The Minister talked of an emasculated policy and said that we were trying to get the people to rely altogether on the Government to do what they should do for themselves.  We do not ask or counsel the people to rely on the Government to do what they should do for themselves, but we say that the Government should do for the people what it is their duty to do for them, namely, to spend the people's money which they have taken from them, in a proper way, and for the benefit of the people as a whole. President Cosgrave said that a farmer has not to give any contribution whatever to the State if he did not buy tobacco take drink. or buy any other article which was dutiable or bore an import duty.  That is like some of President Cosgrave's economics, which he preached outside the House and which I heard before.</P>
    <P>Everybody in the country has to bear the cost of government, no matter whether he be Free Stater or Republican, free trader or protectionist, farmer or labourer.  Certain quantities of goods are produced in this country and there is a certain overhead charge on them for the Government.  If a farmer does not buy drink or tobacco he has to buy feeding stuffs and he has to bear the cost of government because, if he has not money in his pocket which the Government can take, he goes in want of the money which he should have in his pocket.  People throughout the country are at present poor because. first of all, the cost of government is too much, and, secondly, because there is a debit balance of nineteen millions in our trading returns.  We import nineteen millions worth of goods more than we export.  Last year the figures <Col N="546" /> showed that we imported sixty-one million pounds worth of goods while our exports were valued at forty-two million pounds.  That debit balance of nineteen millions has been increasing from year to year.  In 1925 it was eighteen millions, and in 1924 it was seventeen millions.</P>
    <P>As Deputy de Valera pointed out, we are importing twenty-five millions worth of goods, most of which we could produce in a short time with very little trouble.  Our policy for the permanent relief of unemployment is to cut down the cost of government and, instead of sending our money to American, Canadian or Danish farmers for agricultural produce, to give the money which we intend to spend on these articles to our own farmers.  Our policy is &ldquo;The Irish people's money for the Irish people.&rdquo;  I will give the Minister one instance, showing how employment could be created immediately in this country during the coming winter.  Deputy Cooper pointed out yesterday that the imports of foreign barley had gone down last year but he forgot to point out that the imports of foreign malt had gone up, and that we were in a much worse position in that respect than we were in 1925 because, in addition to the loss of employment given in the growing of barley, we also lost the employment given in the production of malt out of barley.  Last year we imported over a quarter of a million pounds worth of foreign malt.  We only imported fifty-four thousand pounds worth of foreign barley.  We suggest, as we can produce more barley than is sufficient to meet our needs, even to meet the export requirements of beer, that with the exception of a little foreign barley that may be required to introduce into the malt to enable the beer to keep, we should prohibit the import of barley except under licence.  Licences should only be given to maltsters or brewers who require the barley to mix with the home-grown product so that the beer would keep longer.</P>
    <P>Whatever may be said for the importation of foreign barley nothing can be said for the importation of foreign malt.  If we want barley let us import it in the raw and not the manufactured state, as we do when it is imported as <Col N="547" /> malt.  There are many other things we could suggest to give permanent employment, and immediately. For instance, take disinfectants. The Minister for Local Government said yesterday that Irish produce got a fair show from the Central Purchasing Board.  I believe they bought some Irish articles, but there were others which they should have bought and did not buy.  One was disinfectant fluid.  I got figures from a firm in Dundalk that manufactures disinfectant fluid.  They say they were not given contracts last year although they tendered for the supply of disinfectant fluid at a lower cost than the British could produce the disinfectant for, and cheaper than the British sell it to their customers at home.  They say that the present price for an English disinfectant fluid&mdash;Jeyes&mdash;in 40-gallon casks is from 3/- to 4/- a gallon wholesale.  During the year expired disinfectant fluid was supplied by Irish manufacturers in 40-gallon casks at 3/- per gallon, which is well under the British average wholesale price.  The price quoted by the cross-Channel contractors for the present half-year is 1/9 per gallon.  This simply means that Irish manufacturers are competing against foreign dumping, and they cannot do that any more than the Irish farmers can.  In the great corn-growing plains of Canada and the United States land can be bought for practically nothing.  Corn can be produced in those places at a very much cheaper rate than our farmers can produce it, and corn and wheat are grown by the 1,000 acres.  Naturally the farmers in these areas can compete favourably against our small farmers if they are given the opportunity, which we claim they should not, to dump their cheaply produced article here, thus driving our people to America, Canada and Australia. The Irish farmer and labourer should be protected against foreign dumping.</P>
    <P>President Cosgrave outlined an economic policy here this evening. He spoke of the revenue they got from tariffs on foreign imports.  We claim that tariffs should not be put on foreign imports in order to produce revenue, that the object of tariffs should be to protect farmers and producers <Col N="548" /> against unfair competition from abroad.  It is not right to impose tariffs on goods and foodstuffs in order to raise revenue.  These foodstuffs are used in the main by people who cannot afford any additional burden of taxation.  If it is necessary to protect a certain industry it should be done in a way that would not add to the burden of the ordinary farmer and labourer.  We claim that a lot could be done to protect our industries without raising the cost of living in the slightest degree for the ordinary farmer and labourer.  Boots that we cannot produce here immediately for our own requirements should be allowed in under licence.  There should not be a duty of 33? per cent. on boots that we know farmers and labourers must buy until our manufacturers are able to produce the class required. With regard to the case that has been made against the whole-hog Protection we stand for, I would like to say that this State is in the position of a farmer who has 100 acres of land with most of it idle while himself and his children are half-starving.  We have in this country millions of acres of arable land that is only producing fourth-rate hay, and in some cases not producing anything and not even stocked, while we have hundreds of agricultural labourers and hundreds of labourers in the towns idle.  We say that as long as our labourers are idle and our land is idle we should not send out money to foreign farmers for farm produce, and that any money we have to spare in that way should be given to our own farmers to keep themselves and their children at home. Another article not mentioned by Deputy de Valera was fish.  We imported into the Free State last year £292,000 worth of fish.  I saw some of that fish being caught outside Boston by Irishmen who had been driven by the economic situation from the West of Ireland.  That fish they cured and sent back to us.  We say that while we have fishermen idle and fish to be caught in the seas foreign fish should not be allowed in here.</P>
    <P>There is one point in the President's speech that I want to refer to because, like the Minister for Agriculture, he was fighting shadows.  Two Deputies from these benches pointed out yesterday, <Col N="549" /> what has been pointed out a thousand and one times in Ireland, that if you put a match to powder it will go off.  Because they did that the President said they were rattling the sabre and that he would never run away from any sabre, no matter by whom it was rattled.  We think he did run away from another sabre that was not rattled by the Irish people, and we would remind the President that the warnings issued by our Deputies were also issued by men who were once very wise in their generation but who were befooled enough to support him. One of them&mdash;A.E Russell&mdash;in his book, &ldquo;The National Being,&rdquo; said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am the friend of revolt if people cannot stand the conditions they live in and if they see no other way.  It is better to be men than slaves.  The French Revolution was a tragic episode in history, but when people suffer intolerably and are insulted in their despair it is inevitable blood will be shed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We do not counsel the shedding of Irish blood&mdash;never did.  We would remind the new ascendancy gang that there was a class in the old ascendancy gang in this country who made the very same claim they are making to-day. Fifty years ago there was a class of people in power in Ireland&mdash;the Irish landlords.  They made the claim that, no matter how many of the Irish people should starve or be in a permanent state of semi-starvation, their rents must be met to the last farthing. You have here to-day a new ascendancy gang wrenching money from the Irish people as the old Irish landlords did.  You have the high salaried civil servants and the Ministers here insisting that Irish farmers and labourers must pay the last halfpenny, even should they and their children starve to pay it.  We say that the Irish people will meet that claim as they met the claim of the old Irish landlords and will beat it.</P>
    <P>There are many other points that one might speak of arising out of the Minister's speeches.  There is a debate coming on soon on tariffs, and we on these benches will have something to say then.  We claim that the Cumann na nGaedheal Party have not done for the Irish people what they should have <Col N="550" /> done for them.  They accepted the Treaty, they accepted every degradation that the British put on this country, on the plea that they would use the powers they got to build up this country economically.  Instead of that, as far as we can see, they have used those powers merely to entrench a new ascendancy crowd in power in this country.  I hope that before long they will be dug out of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance yesterday said that they could get all the money they required at a reasonable price.  If the Minister can get all the money he requires at a reasonable price, why not get it and give it to reputable Irish business men to start industries and keep our people at home?  Deputy Davin, I think it was, alluded to something that Deputy de Valera said about a loan.  Deputy Davin was another man who fought a shadow.  Deputy de Valera did not say that we should go at first to America for a loan in order to build up Ireland.  He said that if necessary, if the Irish people would not put up money for their own industries, there are sufficient friends of ours in America to put up enough money to re-start our industries.  We believe, and have always held, that, given a proper lead, the Irish people have enough confidence in themselves, enough self-reliance, to put whatever money they possess into their industries if they are given a proper chance. But they are not given a proper chance by men who have simply the English outlook.  One of the new ascendancy gang, speaking yesterday, made a boast of the fact that we were spending more money on workhouses and on outdoor relief than in 1913&mdash;almost twice as much&mdash;the same old cry that was made here by the old ascendancy crowd. They started the workhouses, they threw the people they had out of employment and told them: &ldquo;You need not starve; you can go to the workhouse.&rdquo; What is the Minister for Land and Agriculture's complaint of emasculating policies?  We would like to know what he thinks of the policy of the Minister for Local Government in sending our people to the workhouses, instead of giving them decent employment on the farms and in the factories of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>I only heard one voice raised in this whole debate on behalf of the City of Dublin, and that voice, strange as it may be, was raised on the benches opposite.  I began to fear that there were so many claims from different parts of the country that when this £150,000 was being allocated for the relief of distress of unemployment we in Dublin, who are worse off than any part of the country, would be left out of consideration.  I might stress the fact that the City of Dublin is in a worse position than any other part of the country, because the unemployed from the country flock to the City of Dublin, and whatever work is available for the ordinary residents of Dublin, fifty per cent. of that work is monopolised by newcomers.  The result is we have in Dublin a double problem in dealing with this question of unemployment.  I <Col N="552" /> hope when this £150,000 is being allotted the needs of Dublin will not be overlooked.</P>
      <P>I felt very nervous when I saw in the Press that it was to be allocated and spent in the congested areas.  I do not know what a congested area is, but I do hope that the City of Dublin comes into that category and that the unemployed in the City of Dublin, when this scheme of relief comes to be administered, will not be allowed to go to the wall.</P>
      <P>I think in discussing this problem there has been a very reasonable spirit displayed by every Party in the House. It is agreed that the problem is a national one and that the unemployed have a claim upon every section of the House.  Deputy de Valera, the leader of the Opposition, said he would not deal with the problem in the party spirit, but I regretted to hear Deputy Lemass pointing out that in his opinion the proper way to deal with the matter would be to remove the Government Party from power.  I believe, no matter what party is in power, we will always have the unemployment problem.  A change of Government never will affect the unemployment problem, good, bad, or indifferent.  Every country in Europe has its unemployment problem. It has been said that Russia is the most democratically governed country, yet in Russia the unemployed number 8,250,000.  In England the unemployed number 1,135,000, and in Northern Ireland, which is supposed to be a paragon of virtue, the unemployed number 25,000.  Change of Government makes no difference in unemployment, because it is not a political but an economic question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Government's attitude in this debate has been most reasonable and logical.  It has been summed up by the Minister for Finance in three simple propositions&mdash;(1) that the question is non-party, and that sympathy for the unemployed is not the monopoly of any Party; (2) that he was not prepared to say that the measures which the Government had taken were sufficient or that other steps should not be taken; and (3) that the solution of the problem is simply a question of ways and means.  It has been objected by one Party in this House that what the <Col N="553" /> Government has done should not be put before this Assembly.  I think that is a very unfair and illogical way of dealing with the matter.  We must recognise what has been done and give credit where credit is due.  We must recognise that £5,000,000 has been spent on roads and bridges, that £50,000 has been spent on the Barrow drainage scheme, and I believe that a sum of £500,000 has been earmarked to carry that scheme through to completion. We must remember that in connection with the new sugar beet industry £100,000 has been paid in wages, that £68,000 has gone to Irish railways, and I think Deputy Davin will admit that railway workers obtained some share of that money; £30,000 has gone to Irish insurance companies, and £30,000 has been spent in the purchase of Irish materials, making a grand total of £228,000, and £255,000 has been paid for beet.</P>
    <P>The President pointed out that selective protection gave employment to over 10,000 hands and the Shannon scheme has given employment to 3,000 men. After all the problem of unemployment is an economic problem.  What is the first real factor that we in this country should deal with if we are to settle the question?  The first real problem is the supply of cheap power to Irish industries to enable them to compete with foreigners.  When the Government undertook the Shannon scheme they were howled down from every quarter of the Saorstát but in my belief when the Shannon scheme matures the problem of unemployment will automatically settle itself.</P>
    <P>The leader of the Opposition said that we should take steps to ascertain what is the actual position of the country. What is the actual position of the country?  The actual position of the country is this: From 1st April down to the half year for 1927 our income was £12,926,048; for the same period, 1926 our income was £13,838,543; showing a decrease in income for the half year of £457,495.  The expenditure for the same period, 1927, was £12,609,634; and for the corresponding period, 1926, £12,500,901.  So that for 1927 we have an increase of expenditure of £108,733 and a fall in the revenue of £457,495. Any man who has any knowledge of <Col N="554" /> business or who has any idea of conducting the affairs of the country must realise these are significant figures.  The Chamber of Commerce yesterday drew attention to the importance of reduction of expenditure.  The Government have been pressed in every debate that has taken place to increase expenditure. The figures I have quoted will enable Deputies to realise whether there is not a limitation to the ability of the Government to spend as freely as various parties in this House would ask them to do.  It is still, as the Minister for Finance has put it, a question of ways and means, and the ways and means that were laid before us by the leader of the Opposition yesterday were explained by way of an illustration which he gave.  He asked if this Island were cut off from the rest of the world what would be the actual position of the country?  I ask what would be the actual position of the country?  He suggested the country would be a hive of industry, that it would be only a question of organisation and that we would have a new Mecca in Ireland. The fallacy of that argument has been clearly and finally demonstrated by the fall of Germany mainly through the economic problem when she had to undergo the blockade.  It is merely a fallacy for the leader of the Opposition to put before the House such an illustration for the solution of the problem of unemployment.  We have been told here, also, that one means of remedying the unemployment question is by tariffs.  We were told by Deputy Flinn that another means would be to turn our backs upon our opponents.</P>
    <P>He also suggested that we should face facts.  May I for a moment or two trespass upon the time of this House to face the economic facts of the situation as they exist?  I do suggest to any people dealing with the Government of the country, to any Deputies assembled in a House of Assembly like this, that they cannot shut their eyes to the economic laws, to the laws of political science which govern the whole question.  What are the laws of political science that we should apply to this question?  The first law I would ask you to consider very briefly is the law of environment.  The law of environment means that a country <Col N="555" /> must have raw materials for labour. It must have access to markets for the products of that labour and have these products economically produced.  Environment gave to Germany, when she captured Alsace-Lorraine, the position of the premier iron-producing country in Western Europe.  Environment has given one advantage to this country of ours.  Environment here, by the contiguity of Ireland to Britain, furnishes an instance of two countries dovetailed into one another as no other two countries in the world.  We have on the one hand a great industrial country, producing commodities that we do not produce and we have an agricultural country producing other commodities that England needs.</P>
    <P>What is the main logical conclusion to be drawn from this?  We have the finest market in the world at our door. We have a market needing the products of our country and we, on the other hand, are able to exchange our products profitably for the products of our friends across the Channel.  Are we to ignore these economic facts?  I would like just to remind the House that this country before 1823 was more self-contained than it now is.  More of our people were clothed in home-made materials.  We supplied our own bread stuffs.  We exported a surplus to England and we imported no Indian corn. Anybody who knows anything about economics knows that a change was brought about in that system, a change over which no country had any control. In the year 1824 the whole external trade of Ireland was revolutionised.</P>
    <P>The year 1824 marked the beginning of Free Trade between England and Ireland.  In that year we had the establishment of the City of Dublin Steamship Company and the introduction of a common system of weights and measures.  Modern steamship communication brought the products of the great prairie lands of America, especially wheat, about which we have heard so much, to Europe, at prices with which this country could never hope to compete, but if we had losses on the one hand we had gains on the other.  While we had losses of a certain export trade to England and while we were not as self-contained as we <Col N="556" /> originally were, the balance was not struck unevenly.  From that period we may absolutely date the growth of the modern linen trade, the live stock industry, the exports of the great firm of Guinness, and the exports of Jacob's. If we look at our export trade to-day we must recognise that these modern conditions have come and have come to stay.  No party, no Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like the Deputy who raised that point of order to know that I am dealing absolutely with the arguments put forward by his side of the House, that I am dealing with the imposition of tariffs and showing that it is an absolute impossibility and I really submit to the House that I am quite in order.  I have gone back for some little period, I do confess, but why have I gone back?  I have gone back to show that modern conditions have revolutionised the whole external trade of Ireland.  I suggest to the House that in going back to that period &mdash;and I did not occupy three minutes in traversing that space&mdash;I was perfectly justified and perfectly in order. I would like also to deal with the imposition of tariffs and the way that that universal panacea that our friends on the opposite side have as an immediate solution for the problems and the ills of this country has worked in other countries.  I would like to ask how has the policy of protection worked in other countries.  How has it worked in Australia?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with Australia with the permission of the Deputy.  In Australia the National Debt in 1915 was fifty-seven millions sterling.  The National Debt since that period has doubled.  It is now almost <Col N="557" /> one hundred millions.  In ten years, twenty-four million acres of arable land have gone out of cultivation and reverted to prairie land.  Capital in Australia is unnecessarily high.  The cost of production has risen and there is almost complete economic stagnation and export trade is impossible.  Of course, to our friends on the opposite Benches, who do not regard the value of an export trade as an asset to this country, that may make no difference, but I, as a solid, hard-headed business man, think it does make all the difference to this country.  From January to June of this year our exports amounted to £18,858,000, of which Great Britain and Northern Ireland took £17,945,914, and all other countries took £912,196. Are we going to destroy such a market to satisfy our friends on the Opposition Benches?  I suggest that that way madness and destruction for this country lie, and there, there is no remedy for unemployment.</P>
      <P>We are not the only country who have got to face an unemployment problem. We are not the only country who have got to deal with the problem of emigration.  May I suggest, for the information of the House, and I suggest it in all sincerity even to my friends in the Opposition, that we can solve the problem of unemployment, not by the methods they suggest, but by exactly dissimilar methods?  How did Denmark solve the unemployment problem? Denmark solved the problem of unemployment and also the problem of emigration in a simple way.  She solved it by two simple means.  The first means was the application of an intensive cultivation to the soil.  The soil of Denmark is not half as fertile as our own, and yet to-day Denmark for every thousand acres of cultivable land, exports £4,727 against our £1,128.  We can make the fertile soil of Ireland produce equally as well as the soil of Denmark, and if we can make it produce an equal amount the whole problem of unemployment can be solved in the way in which Denmark solved it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Denmark also introduced a Small Holdings Act which settled her unemployed peasants on the soil.  By the Small Holdings Act of Denmark grants were given for building free of interest. The land was parcelled out in holdings <Col N="558" /> from one and a half acres to eight acres, and from eight acres to thirty-seven acres, and Denmark, by such means, has become the first agricultural country in Europe.  In this House, the Minister for Fisheries, the other day, stated that certain lands were to be distributed in Leinster.  I think he mentioned the figure of 635 acres or thereabouts. I think at least 20 people came in to me asking if they were qualified to obtain certain portions of this land, where it was to be obtained, and how it could be obtained.  If we face the problem of unemployment in a commonsense, logical way and not by any airy theories, I think much progress could be made, but if we are to depend upon such a system of economics as has been propounded in this House I think that instead of solving the unemployment problem we will become a nation of unemployed.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government stated that he would be prepared to recommend the raising of a loan of £500,000 for houses in conjunction with the City Commissioners.  I regretted to hear the President say, in dealing with the housing problem, that the maximum of output for the city of Dublin was something like 1,000 houses per annum. I have spent all my life in the building trade, and I cannot conceive how that output cannot be increased.  In England they have built 14,000,000 houses. I do suggest that with care, organisation, thought and method&mdash;we have some members on this side of the House who are interested in the question of building&mdash;the maximum output could be greatly increased.  If that £500,000 loan were raised, if the slum problem in Dublin were dealt with, and if that amount of wages were distributed in the city of Dublin the problem of the unemployed would not be nearly as acute as it is.</P>
    <P>At the same time there is another economic law that would be dealt with, for the law of rent co-relates to the law of wages, and in dealing with one problem you would be dealing with the two.  Not alone would you reduce the numbers of the unemployed, but you would also reduce the cost of living. I sincerely hope&mdash;the Minister for Local Government is in the House listening to me give expression to that <Col N="559" /> hope&mdash;that this problem will be tackled.  I would ask the Minister for Local Government to do one thing. Coming from North Dublin City, I am in a position to state that the housing conditions there are appalling.  I know cases where there are twelve and fourteen people living in one room.  Only within the present week a man came in to me and said there were twelve people in one room.  Two of them were sick.  One, a child, had to be taken away, and there was no hope and no possibility of these unfortunate people being able to obtain a place wherein to lay their heads.</P>
    <P>If the housing scheme which the Minister for Local Government has suggested could be embarked upon, it would be one of the greatest blessings that could be conferred on this country and would immediately fructify.  There is just one word I would like to say before concluding, and it is that if that scheme is, as it ought to be, embarked upon.  I would ask the Minister to do for the workers of Dublin something in the nature of providing them with cheap dwellings.  I have been told that a sum of £1,175,000 has already been spent on housing, but has a single dwelling been erected that the ordinary workingman in Dublin can afford to pay the rent of?  How can a working man in the City of Dublin pay a rent of 14/- or £1 a week?  If we are to embark on a housing scheme in the interests of the unemployed in the City of Dublin, I suggest that we should earmark a large proportion of that sum for the erection of self-contained dwellings for the workers of the city.</P>
    <P>Houses with four bedrooms are available in London at a rental of 8/-.  The Nottingham Council supplies workingmen's houses at 8/4 a week.  The Dundee Corporation have two-roomed houses with kitchenette and bathroom for 6/6.  In Sheffield houses with two bedrooms can be had for 7/10 a week, and with three bedrooms at 9/5.  On the benches on my left we have the members of the Labour Party.  I suggest, speaking with some knowledge of the building trade, that the costs of production in building are excessively high.  I suggest to the Labour Party that they could give considerable help <Col N="560" /> in the reduction of these labour costs, and that by their efforts in that direction they would be doing a good turn for the country and for the class to which they belong.  I hope on this question of the unemployed that we will not hear the last of it when the division bell rings.  In fact, I hope there will be no division at all, but that we all will join and co-operate to do what we can for those who are our own kith and kin and who have claims upon every Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. KENNEDY Mr. KENNEDY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNEDY</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Byrne has given us the key to the difference between Deputies on these benches and those on the opposite benches.  He talked about economic laws and political science, and said that no country had any control over these things.  We would like to know who has the control over economic laws, and, defining the persons who have control over the economic laws, whether the parliaments of nations are but the policemen for carrying out these economic laws.  Deputies on these benches contend that political freedom is without any avail if you have not economic and financial freedom, and what we stand for is the economic and financial freedom of this country.  We deny that we have that at present.  Deputy de Valera suggested that a sub-committee should be set up in this House to be an economic council whose business it would be to report to the House, and President Cosgrave asked what it should deal with.  I suggest that it should deal with four things: (1) the present system of costings; (2) distribution; (3) credit facilities within the nation, and (4) the possibility of a national dividend as a result of labour-saving devices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before dealing with these in detail I might refer to the fact that it was suggested that Deputy de Valera was not a competent person to speak on agricultural matters.  My reply is that you do not set up a tribunal of railway directors to deal with railway rates, and all the great advances for democracy and for the welfare of the workers were not made by the John D. Rockefellers and the great controllers of finance.  The question was asked and was forcibly dealt with by <Col N="561" /> the Minister for Finance: Where are you going to get the money?  If you start relief schemes where is the money to come from?  I agree with him when he says that it is only robbing Peter to pay Paul to put on fresh taxation.  But there is another way of getting money.  Here in this nation you have all the essentials in food, housing and clothing and you have willing workers.  The necessary link that costs nothing to link these things together, to link producer and consumer, namely, capital, money, credit, is not in the hands of the nation.  It is in the hands of a few monopolists. We on these benches stand for a national State bank and the taking of the right of credit issues from private institutions and the passing out of that credit issue as a gift to the nation and let industries hum for the welfare of the nation.  A Deputy on the Farmers' benches and a Deputy on the Cumann na nGaedheal benches dealt with exports.  When the people died by the hundred thousand in 1847, eating nettles on the side of the road, if the trade returns for that period are looked up it will be found that there were large exports.  We lay down as the first principle that the first demand on the produce of the soil of Ireland is the wants of the people of Ireland.  We stand for that economic system.  Moses was not given the present economic laws on Mount Sinai. They are man-made laws and can be changed.  Some people would question the existence of the Deity before they would question the infallibility of these laws.  We stand for an alteration of these laws, to provide the produce of the soil of Ireland for the wants of the people of Ireland, and to export only the surplus in exchange for the surplus of other countries.  In answer to criticisms from these benches the President when dealing with banking read a little banking gem he produced, and I was convinced then that there is very little hope that in the reign of Cumann na nGaedheal we will have financial freedom. Let me quote the Right Hon. Reginald McKenna, Chairman of the Midland Bank, speaking at a meeting of the directors on January 28th of this year.  He spoke on the present <Col N="562" /> banking system with which the Government has consolidated itself by adopting the Banking Commission's Report.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The present system might have suited conditions in 1844, when deposit banking was in its infancy.  It might conceivably suit conditions to-day, but if only as the result of an accident.  It has survived for 80 years by virtue of its own suspension in times of crisis, the phenomenal supersession of the use of currency by that of cheques, and fortuitous discoveries of gold.  The vital need for the future is to ensure that the maintenance of prosperity, with a growing population and everimproving standard of living, both requiring an expansion in the volume of trade, shall not be hampered by false restrictions on the quantity of money.  We need careful and expert consideration of the theoretical basis and practical technique of our credit and currency system, including the position of the Bank of England as the central institution and custodian of our monetary resources.</P>
    <P>Mr. McKenna on another occasion uttered the famous saying: &ldquo;Every bank loan creates a deposit, whilst every repayment of a loan destroys a deposit.&rdquo;  The President referred to deposits, in other words, to liabilities.  They represent the assets which were advanced all over the country and which cannot be repaid now by the small farmers because it was inflated money.  Consequently when the President says that we stand at such a rate with our deposits it simply means we have an abnormal amount of advances unable to be met by the farming and by the business communities.  Consequently, if there is a decrease in wages and unemployment it is because there is a demand on these two parties in the community to pull down the over-drafts and they pull down wages.  This policy of reductions of wages, salaries and dividends makes for smaller consumption.  They issue a dictum to produce more and consume less.  Unless we change that state of things or wait until it is changed in England, with which we are bound up, we will be voting grants for the relief <Col N="563" /> of unemployment, emigration will go on, and we will have Deputy Byrne telling us about the sanctity of political science and economic laws.</P>

      <P>In dealing with this subject there is general agreement that it should be lifted above the atmosphere of Party.  We have no desire to exaggerate the position in the country. I think we must all feel a certain amount of humiliation that the things referred to in this debate exist, so that the actual position should not be overstated. I suggest that it would be a fatal course on the other hand to try and minimise what the existing conditions are.  It shows how accustomed we have become to this deplorable state of things when the situation we are discussing can be referred to as a hardy annual.  I think the position is in the nature of a very big tragedy, and that we ought to concentrate our attention on dealing with the matter in a serious way, realising that it presents one of the biggest dangers with which the people of this country can be faced. We had a very valuable statement from the Minister for Finance yesterday.  He told us that there was no difficulty whatever in obtaining, by borrowing, any amount of money that was necessary. I suggest that in view of the conditions obtaining there is justification for the adopting of this Resolution by the Dáil.  The President stated that this country had no National Debt. When we refer to unemployment in other countries, and when we realise that we are in a happy position, so far as the National Debt is concerned, that other countries are not in, we feel certainly that our duty is clearly cut out, that we should adopt a policy to end the state of affairs that obtains here at present, or to minimise it, at least, as far as it can be minimised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance stated yesterday that no complaints had reached him with regard to deaths from starvation. If there are not many deaths from starvation at the moment there is no earthly use in endeavouring to get over the fact that many people are on the starvation level, and many of us, who have some real knowledge of the condition of affairs in the country, are <Col N="564" /> wondering why there have not been such complaints before now.  The Minister referred to the case that was mentioned here recently.  I have no intention of reviving the details of that case or of making anything in the nature of capital out of that unfortunate happening. I will repeat what I said before, that I consider the Commissioner who was in charge of home assistance in West Cork was one of the most humane men that it was ever my privilege to meet.  I feel that he has discharged his duty to the poor in a very satisfactory manner, and I say that from personal knowledge of his work.  But I say to the Minister that I have no information, even if he and Deputy O'Donovan had that information, that the victims of that situation in West Cork were not normal cases.  It is with very great reluctance that I drag this matter into the discussion, but I would like to give Deputies the benefit of some information for which I can personally vouch.</P>

      <P>This is a purely local matter, and if all the Deputies from the area were to refer to it, it would be drawn across this debate, and that perhaps without any great benefit to the debate.  I do not want to prevent the Deputy from dealing with it, as it has already been alluded to, but to go into all the details might bring up the same question again on the part of other Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. MURPHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to mention the details to show the general position in the area.  Twelve months before this unfortunate happening the man who was subsequently a victim of it got a few weeks work on the roads, after being idle for a very long time. He got it because it was an utterly hopeless task for him to extract any class of living out of the little patch of land he held.  Men who worked with him on the roads informed me that, day after day, when they were taking their food at midday he crept away from his comrades, and when they ascertained the facts they found that he did so because he had no dinner to take and because he was ashamed that those who were working with him should see the state to which he was reduced.  When his home was visited, shortly after the incident I am speaking of, he was asked <Col N="565" /> if he had any bread in the house.  He said that he had not, but that he had a little yellow meal left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not mention these facts to intensify the horror of unemployment and the misery that follows on it, but to show that there are many people who are very hard pressed, who are on the starvation level, but who have a certain amount of pride that compels them to hide the straits to which they have been reduced and enables them to put a far better appearance on things than really exists.  I flatly disagree with the statement of my colleague, Deputy O'Donovan, in connection with the provision of measures to relieve unemployment. I do not think that any responsible section of the people in our constituency would agree that these measures have been adequate.  The Deputy spoke of the working farmers.  I suggest that even from small working farmers in West Cork a note of dissatisfaction will come from the Deputy's statement that adequate provision has been made for the relief of unemployment. I know from personal knowledge that the people who clamour most for an immediate share in relief work, and who rightly clamour, because they are most deserving of it, are the small working farmers in West Cork.  Those who have some experience of the working of public bodies in the constituency, who are members of the County Council, know that streams of people come to them, day after day, asking them to use their influence with the local surveyors in order that they may get a few weeks employment on the roads. They will not accept the statement that adequate, or indeed any provision in reason, has been made to deal with the situation.  Queues of people assemble in order to press their claims for home assistance.  The Minister for Local Government told us yesterday of the very large amount of money that has, unfortunately, to be paid out in home assistance.  I feel that we ought to face the fact that there is growing up in the country the foundations of a pauper State, that people are being reduced to the pauper level in increasingly large numbers, and that the fact that demoralisation and decay in the outlook of the people has set in will prove one of the biggest drawbacks that will have <Col N="566" /> to be faced later when that damage will have to be repaired, if there is ever to be any hope of progress for the people.</P>
    <P>I want to give some instances of the position in the constituency I represent. I have no intention or desire to overstate the position.  In West Cork seven or eight years ago one of the most thriving towns was Bandon.  It had a number of important local industries. To-day that town does not show any sign of life in any industry; the industries are just memories.  All through the town business houses and every other source of activity, every other medium by which employment could be given, are, if not dead, at least dying very quickly.  In many other places in the constituency we also have evidence of that absolute ruin.  Some months ago I visited one of the islands off the coast, one of the unhappy places to which, unfortunately, I had to refer here before, and the appearance of the people was very clear evidence that they were underfed.  The hopeless, half-hungry, half-despairing women and little children, dwarfed and stunted, as they were all over the island, were a picture that nobody who has the unhappy experience of feeling that he had some responsibility for it could forget.</P>
    <P>I was present at a meeting of the Board of Assistance in West Cork some time ago, at which a letter from a clergyman in Castletownbere was read. He would not be likely to exaggerate the position, and he suggested that the letter should not be published.  He depicted the conditions that prevailed there, and said that he did not want to give the matter any great publicity, because a scare might be created and because at the moment he could see no great hope of any improvement of the state of things that existed.</P>
    <P>All over the constituency of West Cork there are to be found traces of the ravages caused by unemployment. We find in the rural areas the names of healthy, able-bodied men who are willing to work being added to the home assistance lists, and they are appearing there because there does not appear to be any other way out of the position. We feel, when the local people complain of the burden that is being placed on the ratepayers as a result of these <Col N="567" /> additions to the home assistance expenditure, that really the matter is one that must be faced here and must be dealt with by the central authority in this country.  It was some encouragement to hear the Minister for Finance saying that suitable schemes would be considered on their merits.  There is certainly very little difficulty in pointing to a large number of suitable schemes that could be tackled if we are in earnest in getting rid of the position that obtains at the moment.</P>
    <P>I feel that a great deal of immediate relief may be given to unemployed people if a considerable portion of the money that may be allocated for this purpose is used in a manner in which it can reach the people who are most in need of it.  I feel that an effort will have to be made to have that money expended in the more remote places in order that it can come within the reach of the people who are most deserving, and who, because of the remote districts in which they live, are unable to bring the facts of their cases to the notice of the proper authorities in the same manner as people who are within easy reach of public representatives and of the centres of local government are able to do.  I am glad to say from my own experience of the manner in which the Land Commission administered the funds supplied for this purpose that a great deal of relief was given to the unemployed and a great deal of useful work was performed as the result of the expenditure of that money.  I do feel also that the right note was struck here by the Deputies who suggested that schemes for the improvement of the water supplies and sewage works might be dealt with by the Government on the basis of substantial grants-in-aid to meet a portion of the expenditure. Any Deputy who is a member of a local authority will know the endless rowing, wrangling, delays and difficulty there are in connection with schemes of that kind.  A loan is applied for and an area of charge is suggested.  Then the row begins as to why people living half a mile outside a town or village should be responsible for the provision of sewage works or water supplies for the people of the <Col N="568" /> town.  At the moment the position is unsatisfactory by reason of the fact that the whole matter is left in the hands of the local authorities.  These local authorities are composed of people representing the rural areas as well as the representatives of the towns, and, because of that, very often they cannot come to an agreement on the extent and size of the particular area of charge for which the scheme is to be prepared.  The result is that numerous schemes of that kind are held up and there is very little prospect of having these dealt with under the existing regulations.</P>
    <P>I feel that the Local Government Department have done a great deal of useful work in connection with the housing policy.  In fact, there are a good many examples of the value of their work in that respect in the constituency which I represent.  I think there is general approval of the considerable amount of good that has been effected as a result of that policy.  I do suggest that the Government should concern itself with the provision of housing in another direction.  One travelling through the congested portions of any constituency could not help being struck by the number of wretched little cabins in which people who have little holdings have to live. A considerable amount of useful work was performed by the Congested Districts Board in the matter of providing houses for such people.  I do not know how such a scheme could be arranged, but it should be arranged on the basis that the people living in holdings of that kind cannot be expected to pay a considerable amount for the building of their houses.  If some arrangement of that kind were made it would mean that a scheme of building houses for these people could be gone on with.  In the remote and congested areas in the different portions of the country a great deal of important work might be done in that direction.  I remember seeing recently&mdash;and it is, perhaps, useful to mention it in this connection&mdash; that a sum of £2,000,000 was spent in this country in fighting disease.  It is places of that kind that are very largely responsible for disease in this country. When one sees a whole lot of children in a wretched little thatched, leaky <Col N="569" /> cabin one can easily imagine the opportunities the parents of the children of that kind have of bringing them up as healthy children should be brought up.</P>
    <P>With reference to the statement of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in connection with the million and three-quarters of money that is available for work, I am afraid that we are not quite clear as to the position.  So far as I understand it, all the money at the disposal of the Department has already been allocated. and I leave the Minister to understand how difficult it is for the local authority to put 200 or 300 men immediately to work on one particular road.  The Minister will understand that the number of trunk roads that there are in any particular constituency is few, and that, in addition to that fact, it must be borne in mind that the councils in the first instance will have to be responsible for the payment of this money, and that after a certain time a refund of the amount expended is made by the Department.</P>
    <P>There are a lot of other points to be considered with regard to the question with which many councils are faced.  There is the question of the inadequacy of their plant to deal with large schemes.  I think that the position with reference to this money has not been made clear, and there is very little prospect of securing from the Department any immediate relief in this respect by reason of the fact that the money has been definitely allocated to work on the trunk roads in the country.  We have heard a great deal in this debate about economic schemes.  I would suggest that the most economic scheme that we could suggest in this connection is the devising of ways and means to wipe out the position that exists in the country.  It would be good business for the Government and for every person in the country if the number of people who are dependent on charity could be reduced substantially, and if we could confine the amount of money paid in home assistance to people who are physically disabled or mentally defective.  As long as healthy men, women and children are compelled to go to the local authorities with their hands out for the dole <Col N="570" /> that they are to receive there will be the demoralisation that that system is bound to bring about.  As long as that state of affairs exists we cannot make very much progress in this country.</P>
    <P>Let it be stated very clearly as regards the matter of output and our contribution to this whole question&mdash;and we have no difficulty whatever in declaring it&mdash;that we have always claimed that the people who work should get a decent wage and we have never suggested anything else than that they should give a fair return for that wage.  The people who ask what our attitude is in this matter can feel assured of our co-operation, in the fullest sense of the word, in doing our part to end the existing conditions in the country.  The President spoke about that matter to-day, and I would like to remind him that two years ago we had a very generous tribute paid to Irish workers by a foreign firm.  I do not know whether I am correct, but I think the people who paid the tribute are the people who later became the contractors to the Government in connection with the Shannon scheme. We might be given credit, at any rate, for being honest in our desire to lessen this problem in every way that we can and in our desire to get our own people to do whatever they can towards meeting the situation.  I feel the Government might approach this matter definitely again and, if suggestions are made as to the manner in which it ought to be tackled immediately, granted the goodwill that this debate has shown to exist in this House, I believe that some reasonable solution of the question will be found. While we are concerned at the moment with immediate relief, we must also endeavour to look upon the matter in the light of a future problem that cannot be shelved.  It is a matter that we should look upon as having the first claim upon our attentions in the future, and it is to be hoped that as a result of our deliberations now and in the future we will do something substantial towards improving the conditions in our country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielVaughan" hpid="Mr. VAUGHAN Mr. VAUGHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. VAUGHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is the most interesting debate we have had since the signing of the Treaty.  I was <Col N="571" /> not much surprised at the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Deputies and their destructive criticism of the Government arising out of the solution of the unemployment problem.  They spoke about emigration and unemployment, but they never made any suggestion that would remedy the unemployment evil.  Their only remedy seemed to be tariffs on imports into this country. We had a very interesting speech from Deputy Flinn of Cork who said he had thirty years of industrial experience. He devoted all his attention to tariffs, and he never spoke of the key industry of the country, agriculture.  He is more interested in the industrial side than he is in agriculture.  We all know that agriculture never suffered so much depression as at present.  The price of our produce was never lower. There seems to be no relief for agriculture. We all know very well that if we take money out of certain Departments to assist the unemployed it will raise taxation; further taxes will have to be put on industrialists and agriculturists. That further burden would have to be faced.</P>
      <P>To my mind the Government have done wonderful work in the past four or five years towards solving the unemployment problem.  They had big difficulties to face.  As in other countries, we had a civil war here and it cost an amount of money which has to be made up for now.  During the past four or five years the Government have built factories, carried out afforestation, introduced housing schemes, road-making and drainage schemes.  We have Fianna Fáil Deputies coming here and using Deputy Morrissey's motion as the basis of mean propaganda.  They do not come down to hard facts.  They make no suggestion towards solving the problem and do not consider all the money that has been spent for the past five or six years.  In my constituency I must certainly say there is a good share of unemployment, but I do not put all the onus on the Government to solve the problem.  I lay it as much on the local authorities as on the Government. The local authorities have powers if they wish to use them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only way to solve the unemployment <Col N="572" /> problem is this: I want a statement from the leader of the Opposition, Deputy de Valera, with regard to the coming National Loan.  If he will make a statement that he will support that loan in every way, I think our credit here will be sound and that it will tend towards stability and law and order in the country and security for those who will invest their money. There are several relief schemes which could be carried out this winter.  I know of one scheme which would be of advantage and which was not mentioned at all here, and that deals with the development of limestone quarries.</P>
    <P>If limestone quarries were worked it would relieve unemployment and those which I know are situated in districts where the liming of land is a necessity. I think it would be a great benefit not alone to the farmers but also to the unemployed.  I would also like to put to the Minister, if he can, to carry out his scheme in towns where there are a great number of unemployed at present owing to the new creamery scheme and I think if he could devise a good scheme to relieve unemployment in the towns it would prevent a great deal of hardship over the winter months.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooper and the Minister for Agriculture spoke of our policy with regard to stopping the import of feeding stuffs.  Deputy Cooper said it was our policy to put a tariff on wheat and it was the first time I heard that it was the Fianna Fáil policy to put a tariff on wheat.  It is our policy to put an embargo on the import of flour and to allow wheat in until we are able to grow it ourselves.  The Minister for Agriculture, when speaking about feeding stuffs and pointing out the great necessity for the import into this country of maize, did not mention a very important fact, that we want all the wheat milled in this country and that if instead of importing £3,103,000 worth of flour we were to import the necessary quantity of wheat there would as a consequence of the milling in this country, be a considerable amount of offals&mdash;pollard and bran&mdash;disposed of for feeding stuffs.  If in addition there was some regulation made with regard to the export of oats and oat products and the import of the same we would be <Col N="573" /> solving the problem of producing our own feeding stuffs to some extent.  The Minister for Agriculture, if he were here, would probably say to me, if he thought it worth while replying, that you must balance your ration.  I started farming some time ago.  I had a great belief in the Department of Agriculture and I got leaflets to see how you could balance your ration.  First I took a leaflet on the feeding of calves.  Deputy Cooper says you must have oil cake or linseed meal to put a good coat on your animals.  The Department of Agriculture in the leaflet says you must have two parts of crushed oats, one of maize meal and one of linseed meal.  Then they say two years later, according to further experiments, that maize meal may be left out and in a footnote two years later that linseed meal may be left out with equally good results; so the Department of Agriculture is teaching the unfortunate farmers in this country that they can feed their calves on oat meal only.  They do not agree with Deputy Cooper that if he wants to bring his calf to the Show that either linseed meal or oil cake is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They adopt a series of experiments with regard to milking cows and they issue a leaflet on the fattening of pigs and give you a choice of nine different rations.  The majority of those rations do not contain any imported foodstuffs. As a matter of fact, a farmer feedings pigs at present knows that it will not pay to fatten pigs on imported foodstuffs.  If you want to buy Indian meal, maize meal or any other imported stuff it will cost, before delivery to the farmer, about £11 a ton.  The Department's leaflet tells us that for a good well-bred thriving pig you have to have one pound of meal to every five pounds of feeding stuffs.  To put on one cwt. of bacon it costs you £2 15s. 0d.  When you have the pig fat you send the pig to the market.  It costs something to send it there, and any farmer knows whether you can have a profit or not on the use of those imported feeding stuffs.  The Minister for Agriculture gives us an instance of a farm of 200 acres with 30 acres of tillage and said that if a farmer was not allowed to import feeding stuffs there he would have to go in for further tillage.  He <Col N="574" /> said that in this instance the farmer was paying £400 a year for imported feeding stuffs.  He said to cover that he will have to go in and do another fifty acres of tillage.  If the Minister for Agriculture is speaking for the Ministry of Agriculture and is going to tell the farmers they will have to till fifty acres to get £400 further for the stuff, the farmers will have a poor lookout if they are to reap £8 worth of produce from every acre they till.  In any case, if he has made a slip through differences in farming, does any farmer think it would be necessary on a 200 acre farm to till 80 acres to keep the stock that a 200 acre farm would carry over the winter?  It is absolutely ridiculous. We must also remember that there are tillage districts in some counties, grazing districts in others.  We are trying to make Ireland a self-contained country.  We never said we wanted to make any farmer a self-contained farmer. We have never said a farmer should till enough for his own stock; he can buy from farmers in some other district.  The Department of Agriculture also tried to educate farmers further. They issued a leaflet on food values, carbohydrates, albuminoids, and fats, and told you the value of one food unit as against another.  If you work out the values of certain home-grown foods at present according to the table issued by the Department of Agriculture, with Indian meal at £10 10s. a ton, oats at 12/8 a barrel, barley at 14/6 a barrel, if the farmer is getting less than 12/8 for his oats it would pay him to feed that oats to his own stock and not buy maize meal at all.</P>
    <P>We will be told that we must balance our ration.  Is it necessary to import maize meal into this country if barley can be produced to meet the requirements at an equal price?  According to the tables issued by the Department of Agriculture, barley can be produced just as cheaply, and it is as good value as maize meal at 14/8 per barrel.  Of course, we will be told again that it is necessary to balance a ration, that it does not contain enough albuminoids. If you go in to any merchant who sells imported meals only, and ask for a ration for pigs, he gives you as a rule&mdash; now, at all events&mdash;19½ cwts. of pollard. Indian meal and meals of that sort, and ½ cwt. of meat meal and fish <Col N="575" /> meal.  A certain amount of meat meal or fish meal can be produced in the country, but perhaps not enough.  I am not quite sure on that point.  Provision could be made for that.  It is only a small item. and those meals could be allowed in if necessary.  That does not say that in order to cater for that small amount of fish meal and meat meal we must permit £3,000,000 worth of wheat to come into this country and over £2,000,000 worth of maize.</P>
    <P>If you took one of these rations as suggested in the leaflet issued by the Department of Agriculture, it does not contain maize meal, because they tell you in all the leaflets that barley meal and maize meal are of the same value. If you took one that contained, for instance, barley meal, pollard, a small amount of oatmeal and some meat meal, and if that could be made up&mdash;as it can be&mdash;altogether from home produce or home-milled stuff&mdash;because we must allow wheat in and import a small amount of fish meal or meat meal as required&mdash;we would certainly be able, without any injury whatever to the farmers of the country, to bring down the imports of feeding stuffs into this country by almost the total amount of feeding stuffs there.  Deputy Byrne talked about free trade and about the measure of protection in certain countries.</P>

According to the Minister's Department, a good, big, thriving, wellbred pig will produce 1 lb. of meat for every five pounds of feeding stuffs. Imported feeding stuffs at the present time cost £11 per ton or £2 15s. 0d. for 5 cwts.  To put on 1 cwt., 55/- would have to be expended on the pig.  I ask the Minister if, at the price at which pigs are selling, there is anything for the Irish farmer in the use of imported feeding stuffs?</P>

      <P>Two months.  Deputy J. J. Byrne gave us his views on protection and free trade.  In order to strengthen his case, he talked about trade in Australia.  He said that the National Debt in Australia has been doubled almost within the last three or four years.  I think he tried to give the impression to this House that that was on account of the protective policy of that country.  From what we can learn, during the last few years in Australia they have built a considerable number of State railways.  Such railways are, I am sure, regarded as an <Col N="577" /> asset.  They have also done a considerable amount of irrigation work.  These are productive works, and if the Government of this country were to run up the National Debt on similar work&mdash;irrigation and afforestation work, for instance&mdash;we would recognise the results as an asset and we would not find any fault with them for increasing the National Debt under that head.</P>

    <P>President Cosgrave mentioned, I think, five points in connection with the question of national credit.  The first point had to do with a balanced Budget.  I suppose the Financial Accounts of the State may be regarded as the balance sheet of the State.  I understand that we are only to take into account normal income and normal expenditure, leaving out of account capital expenditure.  The normal receipts for the period, as far as I can discover from these accounts, were £25,293,628 7s. 11d., and the normal expenditure was £27,025,136 18s. 2d., leaving a deficit of £1,731,508 10s. 3d. for the year.  The Minister dissents.  Perhaps I have overlooked something in the statement.  But there are a few things which I did not overlook.  When we turn to the income which is supposed to be normal income, we find an item under the head of &ldquo;Miscellaneous&rdquo; of £190,005 for Land Bank Shares.  The previous year that was taken as an asset of £203,018.  Now, if a person sells what is regarded as an asset, he does not treat the produce as normal income.  It should be put down as against the National Debt or in some other column, because it certainly was not regarded as normal expenditure when first invested.  If it had been so regarded, it would not be afterwards treated as an asset.  In the second place, there was a loss of about £13,000 on the investment, which should be <Col N="578" /> written off out of normal income.  That would bring the total deficit to close on £2,000,000.  There are other small items which could, likewise, be questioned. For instance, I do not know whether the amount handed over to the trustees of Dáil Eireann could be regarded as normal income or not.  As far as I can see from this statement of accounts, the Budget was not balanced last year.  There was a deficit of about £2,000,000.</P>

      <P>Without desiring to cut short the Deputy's speech, might I draw the attention of the House to the fact that it is adjournment time. I see no prospect of the debate finishing this evening, and I would suggest that the venue of the debate should be transferred to Kilkenny.</P>

      <P>I move the adjournment of the House until Wednesday next at 3 o'clock.  I am assuming that this debate will close about 5 o'clock on that day and that the other two items for which I undertook to provide time&mdash;the items in which Deputy de Valera and Deputy Redmond are interested&mdash;will also be disposed of on that day, so that it will be possible for the Government to get some time for public business.  We have had no time for public business this week.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until Wednesday, November 2, at 3 o'clock.</P>
