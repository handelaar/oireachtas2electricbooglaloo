      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he can state a definite date on which the Board of Works will be in a position to give their report regarding the scheme of arterial drainage formulated by the Mayo County Council some twelve months since, but more particularly with regard to the Rivers Moy, Robe and Deel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works are not in a position to name a definite date on which decisions on the several proposed drainage schemes received from the Mayo Co. Council can be communicated to the Council.  The Commissioners have received 87 schemes under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, from the Mayo Co. Council, and as many of these are very large and complicated it will be readily understood that with the limited engineering staff available several years must elapse having regard to the total number of schemes to be investigated in the Saorstát before all of those from Co. Mayo can be dealt with.</P>
      <P>Engineers are at present engaged on the examination of the proposals received in respect of the Moy and Robe rivers.  The Commissioners have received their engineer's report on the Deel river, but have not reached a decision in this case pending the receipt of their engineer's report on the Moy river, of which it is a tributary.</P>

      <P>I have now read the final report of the Commission, and there is nothing in it modifying the proposals made in the interim report, or affecting the provisions of the present Bill.  Accordingly it is not proposed to delay the passage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I replied to a question in similar terms on the 23rd of February this year, and, as the position has not changed since that date, will repeat the reply.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am informed by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company that the Holyhead and Greenore service has for many years been run at a heavy loss, and that at the present time a service is given by sailings on three days of the week each way, which is found ample for the traffic offering. By discontinuing the conveyance of passengers, certain staff economies have been made possible, but there is still a substantial, though reduced, loss in maintaining the present service.  Under these circumstances the company feels that there would be no justification for a passenger service between Holyhead and Greenore, particularly in view of the other routes to Ireland by which passengers may travel.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Resolution No. 2 has been put forward at the request of the parties in the House collectively, and that request was based on the argument that sending this Bill to a Special Committee in this way will expedite public business.

      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  The object is to prolong the period by another year in which a guarantee may be given under sub-sections I. or II. of Section II. of the principal Act.  It will be recollected that the Banking Commission referred to the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, and pointed out the fact that the Act was about to expire; and it was a question whether it was advisable for the Government to continue this measure of support to business credit. The matter consequently became pressing. The Banking Commission recommended that the Government should withdraw this Act and terminate the guarantee, but there is a recognition that it would be necessary to continue it for a short period in order to carry out the commitments of policies already initiated.  The situation is that there are loans for which guarantees have been practically given.  There are certain others where the Advisory Committee has recommended a loan and where the two Ministers concerned have indicated their sanction, but where the legal formalities have not yet been completed.  There are other cases where the applications are already in an advanced stage, and such advanced stage would be defeated unless this Act were carried forward for another year.  There are certain other applications that have passed the Advisory Committee, but have not yet been considered by the Departments concerned.  In addition, there are, at least, three outstanding and fairly prima facie cases in which a considerable time has been spent and some expenditure incurred in getting the preliminary details settled.  It was thought reasonable these cases should go before the Committee, and have a decision taken on them, and in consequence it is necessary to have the period over <Col N="685" /> which guarantees may be given extended for a year.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Fisheries told us yesterday of the failure to establish a fish-market in Cork, and he attributed that failure to a Press campaign accusing the fish merchants of profiteering.  We have had a very long debate, and I will merely put a few very simple questions to the Minister.  Is it not a fact that on the day this fish-market was to be opened, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, taking with him some choice souls, went down to open the market, the trawler did not come in, and there were no fish?  Is it not a fact that the skipper of the trawler, when he arrived some time next day, said he was not told at what hour he should arrive, and is it not a fact that on subsequent occasions the trawler did not arrive on the appointed day, or at the appointed time, and that it was impossible for the fish merchants of Cork to supply themselves from this trawler because she was never there at the right time? Is it not a fact, further, that the whole thing was conducted in the most unbusinesslike manner possible, and that it could not be regarded by reasonable <Col N="686" /> people or by business people as an attempt to establish a market in Cork? Cork has 76,000 inhabitants, and it is surrounded by a circle of towns inland with large populations&mdash;Mallow, Fermoy, Kanturk, Macroom and Charleville. There is an excellent market, and, if proper measures had been taken, a market could be established, but it would now take a considerable time to create a feeling of confidence in it.  I only hope that the next time the Minister will attempt to establish a market, he will do so in earnest.</P>

      <P>During the time I was able to be in the House yesterday, I listened with the greatest interest to this discussion.  I find that the House is unanimously in favour of protection, as I understand it, for the fishing industry. We had yesterday an eclipse of everything pertaining to the internal life of this country, and a wonderful corona of eloquence as regards our fishing industries.  Recommendations of a business-like character have been given &mdash;and I hope they will be received in the spirit in which they are given&mdash; to write down the depreciated assets of the fishing industry.  I think this is a time of stocktaking as regards this matter, and in all stocktaking assets should be re-valued at their present-day values.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was sorry to note in the discussion a want of constructive criticism.  We heard of inefficiency; we heard that in the past the Minister held up his hands, saying his one cruiser was utterly inadequate to cope with the depredations of the foreign fishing boats along our coasts.  I would like to have heard from some of our Benches constructive criticism along that line.  Having been all my life a lover of the sea in every shape and form, and being known to many fishermen on the coast on account of that love&mdash;known even by my Christian name&mdash;I feel that I have, perhaps, a sympathy which is not shared by everybody who does not love the sea.  I suggest for the consideration of the Minister that a steamer of any kind which shows itself long before it can see anything in the nature of a small trawler, is not the means of dealing with this thing.  We are a new <Col N="687" /> State.  Let us take an imaginative point of view in this matter.  We have several problems.  We have a lifeboat institution largely run by the sisterisle. What is required along our coasts is a quick motor-boat service which could be linked up to do more useful things for our fisheries.</P>
    <P>If we had a combination of interests and took this question of life-boats and tacked it on to the question of how we are to catch these trawlers off Achill Head and elsewhere, then we would have a complete police motor-boat service which could deal with this matter right away.  The fishermen would be protected as regards the depredations that are made on their fishing grounds, while the destruction of the fishing beds in-shore would be prevented.  If the fishermen got into difficulties at sea, practically this service could be employed to get them out of their difficulties. I suggest to the Minister that he should take into consideration the question of putting the policing of the fishing industry on a new and more intelligent basis.</P>

      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Dáil to the sum we are asked to vote on this Estimate, and to the way in which it is made up.  We are asked to vote a sum of £52,306.  Under the first three subheads&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances, Travelling and Incidental Expenses&mdash;the sum that we are asked to vote is no less than £24,506, which represents over 49 per cent. of the total Estimate.  I do not think there is any other Department of the Government where the salaries, wages and allowances, travelling and incidental expenses comprise such a large proportion of the total cost.  On several previous occasions I have suggested that this Department should be abolished, and that the work it is supposed to do should be done by some of our other Departments.  It is true that my suggestion in respect to another Department, the Department of External Affairs, has already been adopted, and that it is now amalgamated with the Department of Justice.</P>

      <P>Well, the same Minister is looking after the two Departments now, and I would suggest that a similar course be adopted in regard to this Department.  There has been a proposal&mdash;it is to take the form of legislation shortly&mdash;that the Land Commission portion of the Department of Lands and Agriculture shall be allotted to the Department of Fisheries.  There may be something to be said for that. There will be this much at any rate, that when this Department comes to be discussed next year, the amount paid in salaries, wages and allowances will not presumably be over forty-nine per cent. of the total cost of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a reduction, but where has that taken place?  On the first three items to which I referred there has been a reduction of £520, but there has been a reduction of £9,700 under the sub-heads dealing with fishery development and rural industries. I think some explanation, further than that given by the Minister, is required for this very large reduction. I do not know if the Minister so far has justified the existence of this Department at all.  There have been several criticisms passed upon his administration and upon the condition of the fishing industry in general, and with respect to the last speaker I think that there have been some useful and constructive proposals made.  There are one or two observations that I would like to make.  In the first place, how is it that up to this there has been no report issued from this Department? As far as I am aware, there has been no report issued since the Department was instituted.  I am informed that in every other country where there is a Department controlling the fishing industry, notably in Denmark, and I think also in the case of the Scottish Department of Fisheries, reports are issued by these Departments.  I think some explanation should be given why such a report is not issued yearly by our Fisheries Department.  I think that a demand, or at least a request, was made for such a report by a prominent member of the Government Party upon the last occasion this Estimate was under discussion, and I hope the Minister <Col N="689" /> will see his way to mend this state of affairs and to issue an annual report, as is done in other countries.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the revaluation of boats and gear.  That, to my mind, is the very first thing that should be done if the fishing industry is to get a chance at all.  Most of the boats in the possession of fishermen, mostly, as we all know, very poor men along the coast, were purchased by them, or a contract was entered into by them for their ultimate purchase, at a time when the price they agreed to pay would represent nothing like the true value of the boats and gear to-day. I have in mind a specific instance where a man agreed to purchase a boat costing at the Department's price £2,000. The real value, I believe, of that boat to-day is about £850.  What I would impress on the Minister is this, that if he is anxious, as I am sure he is, to secure the re-payments of these sums as far as possible by these men, he should offer them some incentive to endeavour to make some re-payments.</P>
    <P>If they think that they will have to pay the same amount, or anything approaching it, as they originally contracted for, they will have no inducement whatever to work to the same extent as they would if they knew there would be an immediate revaluation.  If they knew, in fact, what actually they would have to pay that would be an inducement to them to endeavour, as fast as they could, to repay the proper sum.  When Deputy O'Gorman spoke of the failure of the fish market and the proposal in Cork in connection with the splendid markets that surround it for the distribution and purchase of fish, I was struck by the idea that it will never be possible to develop the fishing industry to any great extent commensurate with the wealth of fish that surrounds our coast until something has been done in regard to the cheapening of transport.</P>
    <P>The question of transport, to my mind, goes to the root of the possible success of this industry.  In other countries special facilities have been given for the cheap and expeditious transport and delivery of fish.  Would it not be possible for the Minister to endeavour to arrange facilities with the <Col N="690" /> existing railway concerns, or if it would not be possible, would this not be a further reason for doing something to bring about a proper transport policy in this State?  I know that the Government have so far announced no transport policy, and this is only another instance of the necessity for such policy being considered and proceeded with. I am acquainted with a large portion of the coastlines between here and the counties of Wexford and Waterford, and I agree with the suggestion that there should be something done towards the development of the lobster industry.</P>
    <P>The lobster industry is different in this respect from the fishing industry in general, because there is, I understand, a more suitable market for that fish.  We have, I am told, a constant demand from the Continent for shell fish, mostly lobsters, and if the Minister could see his way to develop the possibilities and potentialities of this industry, which are very great, especially along the east and south-east coast, I think he would be doing something to justify the existence of his Department. He certainly could endeavour to preserve even the lobster industry which, though small, is being severely hit at present by those very methods and practices which were detailed to us so graphically by Deputy Wolfe yesterday. I know from personal knowledge that foreign trawlers have come in between the Saltee Islands off the south coast of Wexford and the shore near Kilmore Quay, and have taken lobsters out of the pots.  There should be some means of preventing this taking place.</P>
    <P>There are many obstacles, as pointed out by Deputy Wolfe, but it is the duty of the Minister to overcome them. I believe if he sets his mind to it he will be able, either by inducing his colleagues in the Government to bring about an arrangement with the British and foreign Governments, or by some other means, to put an end to it.  The possibilities of the development of the lobster industry are very great, and I do not imagine&mdash;perhaps the Minister would be able to inform us on the subject&mdash;that the cost would be very great if he were to institute State lobster beds, or at any rate to make some experiment <Col N="691" /> in this direction.  I hope the Minister will be able to reply satisfactorily to the statement made by Deputy Wolfe yesterday, because he seemed to doubt its accuracy.  If he is not able to contradict that statement, I hope he will then be prepared to take the Deputy's word for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeating" hpid="Mr. KEATING Mr. KEATING">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KEATING</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak of the fishing industry along the Wexford coast.  Rosslare fishermen have told me that when they catch a certain amount of herrings there is no market for them.  I have seen herrings from Rosslare sold as low as 4d. a dozen, and in the town of Wexford at 2d. per dozen.  Deputy Gorey informed us that they were worth 2s. 6d. a dozen in Kilkenny.  Can the Minister see a way of getting Rosslare herrings to the inland towns by way of a light motor lorry, so that those fishermen could remain out and bring home the full of their boats?  They have to return with a small quantity, because the price is low, and they have no market for herrings.</P>
      <P>As to the lobster business in Kilmore, I have been told by the Kilmore fishermen that very often when they go to raise their lobster pots they find they have been deprived of them by foreign trawlers.  That is a hard thing for men who have no other way of living except the sea, and two or three acres of land, on which they grow potatoes. Mackerel are so plentiful along the Wexford coast that they land high and dry in Harpoonstown, and farmers and farm labourers can pick them up without wetting their feet.  When I asked why they could not make the trade a success they told me that they had no market for their fish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDONOGH</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that Deputies have approached this subject from a wrong angle.  A great many of the Deputies to whom I have listened do not seem to know very much about the subject, and the more one knows about it the more difficult it is to suggest a remedy for the condition of things that exists at present.  My suggestion is that the Dáil should leave all this eloquence aside, appoint a committee of men who know something <Col N="692" /> about the industry, and let them suggest, in collaboration with the Minister, what should be done.  People talk glibly about trawlers.  Trawlers cost anything from £17,000 down to £500. It all depends upon what sort of trawler it is, and what it is used for.  Talking of the use of steam-trawlers, one must pre-suppose a deep-water harbour where there are facilities to take in a cargo and discharge a cargo quickly and easily.  Most of these big steam-trawlers go away, sometimes for a month at a time.  They carry refrigerators. They are boats of 700 or up to 1,000 tons.  Small motor-trawlers are mostly used round the coast of my constituency. They are good enough for the work, considering that most of the time is spent in sailing instead of fishing. Still, the owners make a living. The condition we have to-day is, perhaps, due to the too kind treatment meted out to fishermen by the Congested Districts Board, headed by Mr. W. L. Micks.  After a time, the Dáil will recollect, the railways were broken down; gear got very expensive, and a lot of people went on the dole, with the result that the fishing industry never regained its prosperity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present time, if there was an endeavour made, I think there is no reason why the fishing industry should not be made a success in this country. It is a pity that in Cork, where there is a deep-water harbour, there is not sufficient enterprise amongst the people there to get two or three trawlers and establish a market.  There is no doubt that there is money in the industry, and that it would pay.  I know it from experience.  It will not help the industry to criticise the Minister here.  He may not have much experience of the subject, but even if he had experience, this talk of £150 to equip a boat with nets is absurd.  It depends on what sort of boat is sent out with the net. The gear of some of them would cost anything from £600 to £800&mdash;nets, lines and ropes.  A very small boat could be equipped for £150, but there would be nothing to fall back upon in case they lost some of their train, as they very often do.  Even the line boats along the coast would do very well.  I know that from experience, but they have to <Col N="693" /> be boats properly equipped.  The English and Scotch line boats, as a rule, are steam drifters which have been turned into liners after the net fishing is finished.  They have steam haulers, and the lines alone cost from £150 to £200.  The work is done by steam, and the boats are driven by steam.  They have to be fast, so that they may reach the fishing-grounds quickly, and return quickly to dispose of the catch.  I suggest to the Government to appoint a committee to go into this matter, and to endeavour to do something for the industry, but the first thing the Government should do for the Minister for Fisheries is to give him a free hand, and to place a certain amount of money at his disposal.</P>

It is somewhat longer than the coastline of Donegal, I think, which Deputy White said yesterday was forty miles.  At a place called Mullaghmore there was a pier built some years ago at a cost of about £60,000.  It was built by private enterprise, I am informed, and it is getting out of repair.  The lands there are now sold and have been transferred to the Irish Land Commission. The pier is falling into disrepair, and I would ask the Minister if he is in a position, for the sake of the fisheries, to do something to repair the pier.  There is a pier at another place called Raughley, also an important fishing centre, which, too, needs attention. There is a pier in a third district. Maugherow, in respect of which Father Beirne made a strong appeal some years ago to the Dáil.  I am informed that his appeal was turned down.</P>

I would <Col N="695" /> like the Minister to look into these matters and find a remedy if possible.

      <P>What I have got to say will be entirely confined to inland fisheries.  That is a subject which I should know something about, living as I do at the celebrated Lough Ennel fishery.  On previous occasions when I spoke here, I had to complain of the lack of assistance which we had received from the Minister for Fisheries. Since then the Minister has met us fairly and I do not make any complaint in that regard.  But I do complain that the Government do not pay the attention that they ought to the gold-mine which we have in our midst. They do not seem to appreciate fully what could be achieved by the development of our inland fisheries.  In Westmeath, we have an organisation called the Lough Owel and Ennel Preservation Association.  With a certain amount of assistance from the Department, by the provision of a few hatcheries, etc., a certain amount of local enterprise and by knowing how to handle the matter, we capture a certain number of spawning trout when going up the rivers.  We take from them the spawn.  The spawn is put into these hatcheries at negligible cost.  We had about six of these hatcheries in Westmeath and in the past year we were able to put 370,000 young trout into the lakes.  An &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; representative came down to Westmeath last March, and a very interesting article was written by him on what he saw there.  I took him round during the spawning season and I took him out to the lake where the pike came in to spawn.  During the month of March this year, over a thousand pike were shot, a large number of them being over 30 pounds.  I had the pleasure of shooting for him quite a number of the pike, and this he explained in his article.  I do not think that this is done anywhere else in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="696" /> Deputy Jinks asked the Department to supply Sligo with these ova.  I do not see any reason why Sligo cannot do what Westmeath did or why any other county cannot do so.  We can turn 370,000 young trout into the lakes of Westmeath at practically no cost.  In a tank, six feet by two feet, with a small pipe supplying fresh water to it, in a backyard at Mullingar, I showed the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; representative about 60,000 young trout.  Those trout have been turned into Lough Owel, Lough Ennel and Dervaragh.  That has been going on for the past four years, with the result that the lakes are swarming with fish at present. Owing to the organisation we have, poaching has practically ceased.  I must pay tribute to the Gárda Síochána for their activities in this connection.  Those magnificent fish went up the rivers in former years to spawn and never returned.  They were really useless to those who took them, because, being out of season, they were uneatable.  In years gone by, they were packed in thousands in barrels, salted and used as tinned foods in other countries.  All that has ceased, with the result that the fishing in these lakes is extraordinarily good. Unfortunately, the fishing has not been so good this year owing to weather conditions.  There were only one or two good days, but to give an idea of the class of fishing obtainable, one boat had a catch of 22 and another of 19.  If I were seeking a tribute to the quality of the fish in these lakes, perhaps I could not do better than apply to the President, because it was his brother-in-law who had the best basket.</P>
    <P>With regard to the destruction of the pike, we destroyed well over 1,000 in the month of March.  That has been going on for years and we are putting in the young trout.  In addition to that, we are offering 2s. 6d. each for the destruction of cormorants.  Anybody who brings a cormorant's head to the secretary of the organisation gets half a crown.  In this way, a large number of cormorants have been destroyed.  To give an example of the destruction that cormorants do, I myself picked up a cormorant this year who had a trout in <Col N="697" /> his throat.  He had choked himself in attempting to eat a second trout.</P>
    <P>At the present time, the May-fly fishing is over, but there will be very good fishing from this on with &ldquo;Harrys.&rdquo; The really good fishing will be in the months of August and September with &ldquo;Murroghs&rdquo; and &ldquo;Peters.&rdquo;  I fear that the Government do not appreciate the importance of the inland fisheries, and that sufficient money is not supplied to the Minister for Fisheries for the purpose of development.  The inland fisheries would be a gold-mine if developed. An indication of that is given by the fact that 370,000 young trout can be put into the lakes of Westmeath, the cost of hatching being not more than £5.  I suggest to the people of other counties that they should do as we did before seeking the Minister's aid.  If they do not set about development themselves, I do not think it is fair to put all the onus on the Minister. Great development could take place if a little more money was supplied for what is a very valuable industry.</P>

Deputy Redmond suggests that, in the interests of economy, we should place this most important Department under the control of a Minister who finds that he is unable to attend to the work of his own Department without assistance.  What would we save by the amalgamation?  We would save only the Minister's salary. As representing one of the largest fishing centres on the south-east coast, I express my dissent from Deputy Redmond's view.  I disagree with the speeches of Deputy Redmond delivered both inside and outside the Dáil in connection with the Fishery Department. I claim the credit of having been the first to advocate the re-valuation of boats.  I did that four years ago, and I am aware that the Minister intends to bring in legislation dealing with that matter.  I ask the Minister to bear in mind that if the decision of the Conference <Col N="698" /> is adhered to, the re-valuation of boats will not be of much assistance to the Arklow fishermen.  The Conference only recommended re-valuation of boats from 1917.  I would ask the Minister to make the period extend from 1914.  The men of Arklow have paid more in insurance calls to the British Insurance Societies than they borrowed from the British Government altogether. With regard to loans, the Minister stated the number of loans granted this year, but he omitted to tell us the number of applications refused.</P>
      <P>From year to year I have made an appeal to the Minister in connection with the acceptance of personal security for these loans.  A large number of people made applications for loans, but the applications were ruled out because of the regulations of the Department of Finance.  It appears that no man over sixty will be accepted as a surety. Men under sixty engaged in the fishing industry have very little property, and are, therefore, not available as sureties. In my opinion, the older men would furnish better security than the younger men, because, as they are not going to sea, their lives are fairly safe.  I ask the Minister to waive the point as regards the age limit in connection with any application he considers genuine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also ask the Minister to increase the amount allocated for dredging, especially in connection with Arklow Harbour.  The dredger is required in Arklow up to the month of April. After that it is very little use for the fishermen to get out of the harbour there.  It would take the thousand pounds allocated for dredging to dredge Arklow Harbour properly.  I agree with Deputy McDonogh when he suggests that there should be some conference. I appeal to the Minister to send out one of his inspectors or organisers to consult with the fishermen and organise them from a business point of view, with a view to the disposal of their fish by providing markets and cultivating a taste for fish in this country, and also to consider the establishment of some scheme of insurance for fishermen, who undergo great risks, because owing to accidents or the loss of the breadwinner, many families are left in <Col N="699" /> want and misery.  The organiser should consult with the persons directly concerned in the industry, not with politicians or others who are trying to organise fishermen for other ends than the interests of the fishermen.  I am aware that the Minister has sanctioned one of the recommendations in the report of the Fisheries Conference as to giving loans to fishermen for nets on personal security.  I would ask him to sanction the giving of loans on personal security for new engines.  I am aware of many applications for such loans having been refused, for the reasons I have already mentioned.  If these suggestions are carried out, I think they will be of great benefit to the Arklow fishermen.  If they are not adopted, when the Minister introduces his Bill, we shall have to bring forward amendments to try and secure that the Arklow fishermen who borrowed money from 1914 onwards be given the same concessions as those who received loans from 1917 onwards.</P>

      <P>I am not one of those Deputies who believe that this Department should be abolished or merged in another Department.  I believe that the Department is a very necessary one, and that given sufficient money it would prove its worth.  Comparisons have been made here as to the disparity between the salaries paid and the money expended on development. But that is not the way to look at the matter.  Deputies who have criticised the Department I am afraid have not any knowledge of its working. It is too late in the day to come here at the eleventh hour and say: &ldquo;Why do you not do this, and why do you not do that?&rdquo;  I suggest to those Deputies that the Department of Fisheries, more than any other Department, is open to receive suggestions from Deputies at any time.  If Deputies have suggestions to make they will be listened to, and if found useful will be acted upon.  One of the suggestions I have to make has a bearing on a recent sad occurrence.  I am not sure whether it should be addresed to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs or the Minister for Fisheries.  Within the last month a very violent storm <Col N="700" /> occurred suddenly and, unfortunately, on the north-west coast of Donegal a boat's crew was lost.  My suggestion is that when one of those storms is expected by the Department which deals with the weather conditions a warning notice should be broadcast.  There are numbers of wireless sets now in every village in the country and these warnings could be picked up and, if necessary, conveyed to the Gárda Síochána barracks by telephone.  By that means a warning could be given to all the available fishermen.  In that way you would do away with one of the great drawbacks of the small boats, because we have been told that the owners of those boats are nervous about proceeding to sea.  It has been proved, within the last year or two, that the worst of these storms come suddenly. The ordinary weather forecast is published in the papers, but within twenty-four hours a violent storm may occur.  That has happened a few times this year.</P>
      <P>I think sufficient credit has not been given to the Department for what they have done for the inland fisheries. The results of the recent Act are beginning to show, and I think that if the Department proceeded on the same lines with regard to the deep-sea fisheries the results would be equally beneficial.  I like the suggestion of Deputy Beckett with regard to motor boats.  It has been admitted by the Minister that one cruiser is of very little use, and the cost of a second cruiser would be a very big item.  The present cruiser, I understand, has not got the necessary speed, and the poaching trawlers can show it a clean pair of heels.  Unless it is provided with a long range gun it is useless in many cases.  The cost of a cruiser would provide a number of motor boats, which can do anything up to 20 or 25 knots.  That is sufficient to overhaul any vessel that will be poaching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put those suggestions forward in a helpful spirit.  I come in contact with fishermen as much as any other Deputy, and I have heard very little constructive criticism except from my own county.  I think we should have more of it.  It is up to Deputies, if they have any knowledge of fishing <Col N="701" /> matters&mdash;and judging by the number of Deputies who have spoken there is such knowledge available&mdash;to give the Minister the benefit of that knowledge. I do not agree with some of the remarks which have been made.  I take it, for instance, that the fisherman who went out and found that his lobsters had gone must have slept on it.  I have some experience of lobster fishing, and it is a well-known fact that if the lobster pots are left too long set the lobsters will get out.  That is a common occurrence.  I think if the Minister for Finance would provide more money for this Department it would be most beneficial. It is the one Department in the State, I think, that requires more money.</P>

      <P>In reply to the point made by Deputy Myles, I wish to say that weather reports are issued from the broadcasting station three times daily&mdash;at 1.30 p.m., 7 p.m., and 10.30 p.m.  If it would be an advantage to issue the morning report which we receive from Valentia to Donegal at 5 a.m., it could be done.  I do not know whether these reports are being very generally availed of by the fishing community, but I have heard of a few instances in which they have evidently proved helpful.  I would be prepared to co-operate with regard to this matter.</P>

      <P>It occurred to me, in connection with the suggestion about broadcasting, that if these messages were posted up on the police stations in fishing centres the information would be of very great advantage to fishermen. They would then have an idea of what the weather forecast was.  I have listened to the debate since it started, and I was inclined to be impressed by the suggestion of Deputy McDonogh, that a Committee should be set up, until I was handed a report which deals with practically everything that has been discussed.  That report concerned the Sea Fisheries Conference held in 1927.  Amongst the recommendations I noticed the following, which have been spoken of by practically all the Deputies who took part in the debate:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="702" /> Maintenance of small harbours by central authority, help for part-time fishermen, change in method of guaranteeing loans, provision to ensure care of boats and gear, loans through approved fishery societies, credit facilities for fish-curers, development work on west coast, fishery school at Arklow, fishery schools on west coast, instruction for existing fishermen, fish lessons in school-books, propaganda literature for general public, domestic economy instructresses, special training with regard to fish cookery; organisation, grant-in-aid to an approved voluntary body; approved societies; affiliation with agricultural credit corporation; handling of fish under proper conditions, publication of market prices, Irish fish to be specified in Government contracts and in contracts by local bodies, experiment in inland marketing, illegal trawling, establishment of adequate marine police service and provision for punishment of offenders; cured herrings, special stencilling of barrels; cured mackerel compulsory branding.</P>

      <P>A lot of time would have been saved.  As far as I can see, the industry is either worth protecting or it is not.  If it is the great national asset we have been led to believe it is by different Deputies, it ought to be the duty of the Executive Council to seriously consider the recommendations set out here, and to place at the disposal of the Minister, whoever he may be, sufficient funds to deal with the question on sound national lines so that the best possible results might be attained.  If it is not to be dealt with generously, and on substantial lines, it would be just as well if it did not exist at all, because from the results up to the present it has, apparently, scarcely justified the amount of money spent on it.  I feel confident from the <Col N="703" /> discussion that if the Executive would seriously consider the recommendations, which I take it would involve a considerable sum of money, good results would accrue from the findings of the Fishery Conference.</P>

That is the industry of speech-making.  It is not my intention to trespass on the time of the House further than to ask the Minister, when replying, to say if he has done anything for the fishing industry along the West coast from Ballycastle to Blacksod Bay.  If he has done nothing, will the Minister say if he proposes to do anything in that regard in the near future?</P>

      <P>After listening to the debate I am satisfied that this fishery question is a very important one.  I confess that I thought the grievances of fishermen were confined entirely to Co. Galway, and I had no idea that exactly the same class of complaint against the Department of Fisheries existed in other parts.  I am convinced now that this is a huge national question, and that the sum of money indicated in the White Paper is entirely insufficient to cover the requirements of the case.  I could not say where the money could be found to attend to all the requirements of the fishing industry throughout the country, and for the purchase of apparatus and boats. I sympathise with the Minister, and I doubt if he will find it possible to secure the money to carry out the suggestions of the different Deputies. I warn the Minister, when endeavouring to raise money, not to turn to the farmers or to the commercial community, because these classes are laden down with the weight of taxation.  It will be impossible for them to stand any more until such time, at all events, as they have recovered their financial strength.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to direct the Minister's attention to the conditions that exist amongst the people on the islands of <Col N="704" /> Innisboffin, Innisturk, and Innishark, on the west coast of Ireland.  When I visited that district some years ago I found that a pier which was fully appointed with modern equipment in connection with the curing and transport of fish was a scene of great activity. Large numbers of people were employed in salting and curing the fish and preparing it for transport.  During the recent elections I again visited the same neighbourhood, but it presented one of the saddest and most melancholy sights that ever came under my notice. There was no sign of a boat or a human being on the pier or in the neighbourhood&mdash;nobody to tell the sad tale as to why all signs of activity had disappeared. The pier was more suggestive of a grazing field, as cattle and other animals could graze there.  Standing on the pier, and looking westward, one could see the islands of Innishark, Innisturk, and Innisboffin.  I can assure the House that on my visit to the last-mentioned island some time ago I found the people in most desperate straits.</P>
    <P>The people on that island received a large amount of encouragement and support from the old Congested Districts Board, but during the last few years, according to the complaint made by them to me, they have been completely abandoned, their interests neglected, and they have been brought to a stage of serious privation and destitution.  The land is very poor and sterile, and they have nothing on which to depend for their existence except the harvest of the sea.  I noticed that they were so driven to secure peat and turf that they were cutting the surface of the soil and using it as a substitute. That is a serious state of affairs on an island ten miles from the mainland. I desire to direct the Minister's attention to the condition of things there.  I think it is a scandal to civilisation that they should be allowed to prevail.  I know the people there are in want, and I know from the assurances I received that no attempt has been made by the Department of Fisheries to come to their assistance.  I ask the Minister to apply himself to the matter, and do something to rescue these people from their unfortunate position.</P>

      <P>I would like to know from the Minister whether any steps have been taken by his Department to deal with the serious condition of things in and around Drogheda, where the fish exported by the fishermen have been reported back as being contaminated as the result of Drogheda sewage.  If the Minister has made any investigations in that matter, what is his decision? Does he propose to take any steps to protect the fishermen in that area from suffering such losses?  I also understand that the Minister has demanded a sample of the fish caught in this area, and has been supplied with it, and, further, that he has been satisfied that the fish are not of the type that could be used as food, owing to the contamination of the drainage at Drogheda.  The matter mostly affects Mornington and Drogheda.  I would be glad if the Minister would take steps to rectify the situation there. I am sure that any expense necessary to remedy it will not be opposed by the National Party on the ground of economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. F. LYNCH Mr. F. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opening statement I said that I would be brief, in order, if possible, to curtail the debate, but I am afraid that that statement has had the opposite effect.  Various Deputies from all parts of the Dáil have asked questions and elaborated points which I cut out of my statement in my efforts to be short.  In dealing with the points raised, I think I will have to give first place to Deputy Redmond, because I think his contribution was really the gem of the whole debate. He referred to the fact that the Ministry of External Affairs has now been brought under the Ministry of Justice, and he claims credit for that.  He said that he had always advocated that the Department of Fisheries should be brought under some other Department. He seems to have convinced himself that he was the originator of that particular scheme, but I suggest that he was following a parrot-cry raised in a certain newspaper, and taken up all over the country by persons who rather chose that way of dealing with public matters than thinking them out for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="706" /> He has taken up another parrot-cry which is equally intelligent.  He compares the cost of administration of the Fisheries Department with the amount spent on development, and he said that he was sure that if he went through the Estimates that that would not apply to any other Estimate.  I would invite him to look at the book.  There are 68 Estimates, and I suggest to him that mine is one of the few in which there is anything provided except for administration. My Department does a great deal of administrative work in carrying out the fishery laws.  It has nothing to do with development.  Statutes have been provided for that administration.  The question of steam-trawling was discussed by two or three Deputies, and Deputy McDonogh, who knows something about the matter, contributed most intelligently to the question. Deputy O'Doherty's scheme, or something very like it, was tried almost immediately after it was put before me some years ago.  It was tried by private enterprise in the Deputy's own county where it had every chance of success, but it failed.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, from the very start these trawlers, which originated in Tirconaill, in order to make it anything like paying, had to carry the catches across channel where they were near a big industrial population.  We had that example before us, and where private enterprise failed to make it pay, I am afraid that a State Department would not do better.  I am certain it would do worse.  We have had the example, which has previously been mentioned here in that direction, of Australia, where they had very heavy losses and had to abandon the scheme. Several questions were raised as regards the recasting of loans.  I mentioned in my statement that that is a matter that will have to come before the Dáil by way of a Vote, but, in the meantime, the Department is acting on the fact that we have got Government sanction for the scheme, and pending the legislation which, I understand, will be necessary, we are acting on it. We are not collecting all the amount due on these loans which will come within the purview of the approved scheme.  Had Deputies listened <Col N="707" /> to my opening statement they would have found that I said that there will come before the Dáil another Supplementary Estimate for £7,500 to meet the recommendations of the Fishery Conference in its interim report.  In the meantime we have given orders to firms for these nets.</P>
    <P>We hope to have them supplied any day now.  We have done that on the money we have available in the Department Vote, pending the getting the sanction of the House for the expenditure. Some Deputies, notably Deputy O'Donovan and Deputy Tadhg Murphy from Cork, referred to the necessity for providing slips and piers.  There is provision in the Estimate for these minor works, and we are constantly attending to them in different parts of the country.  One of the things necessary in order to get my Department to give a grant is that there should be some local contribution.  You all know the joke, in the past, about slips and piers all over places near local public houses, and where little or no fishing was done. We insist on getting a local contribution as a guarantee that the demand for a particular slip or pier is genuine. Where the county council or the local authority are prepared to spend money, that is a guarantee to us that the proposition is a sound one.  In Deputy Davis's constituency an application was made for a pier, and we suggested to the County Council this year that we had £1,000 ready as a free grant if the County Council put up their share towards the cost of building a pier at Belderrig.  The County Council did not respond, and the amount has not been expended.  In no given year do we spend the amount set out in the Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDavis" hpid="Mr. DAVIS Mr. DAVIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the proposal was that the County Council should first build a pier and that the Department would then give £1,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It was made specific at a later date, for I had to get the sanction of Finance for the expenditure. I agree with Deputy O'Donovan that some places will be rather hard hit by being excluded from the actual date to date on the recasting of the loans as from 1917 to 1923.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="708" /> The man who got his boat late in 1916 will feel he has had very hard luck, and so with the man who got his boat early in 1924, but you had to begin and end somewhere.  Everything considered, we thought this was a fair proposition as between the State and the fishermen, who were in a particularly bad plight.  Deputy O'Donovan asked that the nets should be manufactured in the industrial class.  I think that is rather absurd, and I think in Deputy O'Donovan's own constituency, in Baltimore, nets are made in the fishery school.  Deputy Jasper Wolfe referred to the encroachment by the foreign trawlers, and he suggested that by merely saying &ldquo;we want so and so done&rdquo; we could get the British Government to agree to any territorial limit we liked.  The facts are not so.</P>
    <P>We have been striving to retain for the State the extra territorial bye-laws made by the Department of Agriculture excluding British trawlers from fishing in certain restricted areas outside the three-mile limit, but within a certain line.  At an early period, I think it was while the Labour Government was in power in England, their law advisers said that they considered the bye-laws were still in force, and we have been acting on that.  Up to comparatively recently we had been prosecuting foreign Powers, but we stopped, because we have not been able to collect the fines.  There were no arrangements for the collection of them. Now we are in the position that we cannot drop our claim to the extra territorial waters and fall back on the three mile limit.  I have been thinking for some time past that if we come to the House and bring forward legislation imposing very salutary fines on any person caught within our territorial waters that would also necessitate asking the House to consent to the provision of at least two other patrol boats. It is a very complicated question.  I have come to the conclusion that our claim to the extra territorial waters at the moment is useless to us, and we might as well face the fact, and fall back on the ordinarily accepted three mile limit, and legislate accordingly.</P>

      <P>The suggestion is that the number of sureties be six, but that they should not be jointly and severally liable; that is, that each man should be responsible for his share of the loan only.  I am acting on that suggestion, and I have sent forward to the Department of Finance one such application for a loan last week.  I have not had any decision on the matter yet.  We are helping the kelp industry by means of negotiations for marketing, and so on.  Conferences are at present being held between officials of my Department and of the Department of Industry and Commerce in connection with the establishment of an iodine factory.  Deputy Lynch referred to the toy factory, and asked if there was some condition attached to the transfer of the factory under which we were transferring the manager as well. There was no such condition.  Questions were raised about the earlier opening of the season for inland fisheries.  This can be done as a result of a public inquiry, at which every side of the case can be put before the inspector who holds the inquiry, and if a case is made for the earlier opening of the season, that is done. That is the only way in which it can be done.  You have to govern the opening of your season by the run of the fish. Deputy Gorey asked for information in connection with the distribution of fry. The principle is that we distribute the fry to approved anglers' associations which make application, and, of course, we have to be satisfied when giving <Col N="711" /> them supplies that we will not be overstocking any particular river, because if that were done we would be doing as much harm as good; if there is not sufficient fish food in the river there is no use putting a great deal of fry into it, and such a step would not improve or increase the stock.  Deputy White raised the question of the motor trawler at Moville.  We are arranging for a motor trawler to be sent there.</P>
      <P>Deputy Anthony referred to the decrease in the amount payable to boards of conservators this year as compared with former years.  The position is that under the Act of 1925 boards of conservators are in a position to collect rates on valued fisheries in their districts. Therefore they get funds that they were not in receipt of before, and in some districts they are practically able to get along without any assistance whatever from State funds.  There are, however, certain districts where the fisheries are only of small value, and these have to continue to receive help from the State.  A number of local points were raised.  For instance, Deputy Everett raised the question of dredging at Arklow.  As far as I know, the dredger is at Arklow most of the time.  More is spent by my Department on the dredging of Arklow than on any other portion of the coast, or on all the rest of the coast put together.  Deputy Keating referred to the fact that there were no markets generally for herrings in the Wexford area.  I do not know whether he expects me to supply transport there.  That is hardly the function of my Department.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask a question arising out of the statement I made yesterday.  First, I would <Col N="713" /> ask him what he has done to carry out the recommendations of the Fishery Conference made in their report in the last week of April with regard to the past fishing season.  Secondly, do the figures returned for the sale of fish at the various Irish fishing ports include the entire return of the fish brought to those ports, or do they only include the amount of fish caught by Irish fishermen in Irish boats?  These are two simple questions to which I would ask an answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>I have three times at least stated that I adopted the report of the Fishery Conference.  If Deputies close their ears to what I am saying, or are so fond of hearing themselves talking that they insist on bobbing up to ask questions, I cannot help that.  With regard to the amount of fish landed there is no segregation.  In the case of Buncrana there were 34,000 cwts. of fish landed, and they were mostly landed by British and Scottish boats, because the Tirconaill boats were fishing at the Downings and elsewhere.</P>

I think it would save time if it was answered on one of the <Col N="714" /> items of this Vote, namely, the status of temporary employees under the Fisheries Board.  I suggested to the Minister that, inasmuch as this is a charge appearing under three heads of other Votes, it might be dealt with as a whole on one of them, and so save time.  If that is agreed to, perhaps the President, in the absence of the Minister for Finance, might appoint a time to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>They have none.  I have considered the matter, and, at least so far, I am not convinced that it is desirable. In the first place, to carry out the Sea Fisheries Acts entails some knowledge of navigation, and that is not generally required by the Gárda Síochána.  It would mean, amongst other things, taking bearings and being able to prove these bearings.  In reply to Deputy Hall, in the case put forward by him on behalf of the Mornington men, we have had a bacteriological examination made of the mussels through a Trinity College chemist.  The Fish-mongers' Company of London and the Public Health Bodies have refused to admit certain mussels unless certified pure by us, and we can only certify those pure that a bacteriologist certifies.</P>

      <P>The Vote before the Dáil for the current financial year is £2,479,915, and the net revenue is estimated to amount to £1,748,980, leaving a sum of £630,935 to be provided by the Exchequer.  The amount to be made good by the Exchequer does not, however, indicate the true financial position of the working of the Post Office Department, and in order to find the actual position we have to look to the Commercial Accounts which are prepared in my Department annually. The Commercial Accounts differ from the general financial statement in so far as they take into consideration items not provided for in the broad comparative statement of expenditure and revenue.  Some of these items refer to superannuation payments which are treated on a pension liability basis.  The main difference, however, lies in the value of work performed for other Government Departments for which the Post Office does not get cash remuneration. We perform for the various other departments many services, such as the conveyance of mail matter without prepayment of postage, payment of old age pensions, work in connection with unemployment insurance, etc., and these services involve, of course, extra expenditure, which is chargeable to the respective departments and not to the Post Office.  A detailed list of such services <Col N="716" /> is given in Appendix E of the printed Estimates, and their cost is estimated at £251,140.  In giving this explanation I merely wish to make it clear that the working of the Post Office cannot be judged on the difference between expenditure and revenue, and that the true position can only be ascertained from the Commercial Accounts which are submitted for audit annually, and which are available for the Dáil.</P>
      <P>On the Commercial Account basis, the loss on the Post Office Department in the first year of its working after the change of Government was £1,108,260, and in the accounts for the last audited year, 1925-26, the deficit was reduced to £413,967.  It is anticipated that the deficit for the year 1926-27 will stand at the same figure approximately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On assuming control of the Post Office Department, I had in mind, firstly, to develop the services which were regarded as being essential and helpful to the life of the country; and, secondly, to cut as far as possible the heavy loss on the Post Office, and as an ultimate aim to make expenditure balance revenue.  In reducing the loss in the vicinity of £400,000, I believe that under present conditions everything has been done that could be.  Internal economies have been effected where possible, and other economies, such as a reduction in certain nonessential and non-paying services, have also been made.  Under existing conditions, it seems to me that it will hardly be possible to reduce further the present figure of loss unless by a restriction of public facilities, or by an increase in the rates charged for Post Office business.  There are obvious objections to either course, which I feel sure will not commend itself to An Dáil.  The Post Office has not been a self-supporting Department in Ireland, and while it can be made so, there are weighty reasons against adopting either of the alternatives mentioned in attaining that end as an immediate step.  I think An Dáil will be satisfied with the gradual financial improvement which has taken place, will be content to proceed on normal lines in awaiting bigger revenue following the development of our industries, and in <Col N="717" /> hoping for a reduction in the cost of living figure, which so materially affects expenditure in my Department.</P>
    <P>The Dáil will be anxious to have some idea of how the loss on the Post Office is distributed over the various businesses, and on this I have ascertained approximate figures which show gains and losses as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>In the postal section it will be seen that the only gain was in the case of letters.  On the other items of business losses occurred.  The chief losses are in printed papers and registered articles. The loss on printed papers is largely due to the excess of circular matter from Great Britain.  In registered articles we, too, dealt with a certain excess, but the loss under this head is in a measure due to the fact that the registration fee of 3d. is not sufficient to cover the cost of the elaborate, but necessary <Col N="718" /> processes of dealing with mail items of considerable value.</P>
    <P>I may explain that in the case of parcels and telegrams received from other countries, we are entitled to make a claim in respect of excess traffic, but as regards other postal items, such as postcards, newspapers, printed papers, etc., we are obliged, under the international conventions, to handle whatever volume of work is addressed to us.  I may also explain here that in respect of parcels we get a substantial adjusting figure from Britain, in the case of Press telegrams we get a small amount, and in the case of ordinary telegrams the balance is against us.</P>
    <P>During the past few years we reduced our charges on parcels, postcards, printed papers and telephones.  In all cases the reductions have had the effect of increasing our loss, and the reduced rates did not respond as much as we anticipated in adding to our business. Except in the case of letters, our rates now closely correspond with those adopted in Britain, and if we were to reduce the letter rate to the British level it would involve an extra loss on the Post Office working to the extent of £250,000 a year.  This loss would not to any extent be offset by increased business.  While I would like to be able to accommodate the views of those who seek for a lower letter rate, I think it is clear that the facts of the case and the existing conditions are not such as to admit of any reduction at the present time.</P>
    <P>I will now give the Dáil some idea of the amount of business which is transacted by the Post Office.  In comparison with the figures which I gave last year, there have been increases in some directions and decreases in others, but on the whole the returns show that we have made progress, that the business is increasing, and it shows signs of further increases.</P>

    <P>As I have already reminded the Dáil, attention to the economic working of the Post Office was not allowed to overshadow the need for improvement in services where such could be effected. An inland parcels post cash-on-delivery service was introduced in 1924 in response to strong demands from Deputies and the general public.  There has <Col N="720" /> been a progressive growth in traffic since, and I am hopeful that in a short time the advantages of this service, which is so beneficially used in other countries, will be more fully realised and appreciated here.</P>
    <P>There has been a further extension of the use of motor traffic for the conveyance of mails.  Nine additional motor car contracts have been arranged, and the total of such services now is 87.  Such services are working satisfactorily, and, as well as resulting in economies, they have made for improved postal services in the districts where they are established. Schemes for further extensions are under consideration.</P>
    <P>Satisfactory progress is being made with the erection of the new General Post Office.  The work was unfortunately much hampered and delayed by the recent coal and general strikes in Great Britain.  It is expected that the public office will be opened about October next.</P>
    <P>During the year 1926 contracts placed by the Department were allotted as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>£257,214 on Saorstát manufactured articles.</P>
    <P>£70,340 on British manufactured articles.</P>
    <P>£53,418 on articles produced in other countries.</P>
    <P>Particular attention has been directed to the need for telephone development. On taking over the service from Britain, the telephone system was inferior and very limited, and the number of telephones in comparison with population was very much below that of other countries.  During the past year 102 telephone exchanges were opened, making the total 501 as compared with 194 in 1922.  Of the new exchanges 20 have subscribers ranging from 4 to 51, and the remaining 82 have less than 4 subscribers each.</P>
    <P>In the Vote now before the Dáil provision is being made for providing exchanges at 44 provincial towns.  The first automatic exchange, with an initial and ultimate capacity for 1,440 and 4,000 lines, respectively, has been installed in the Ship Street portion of the Castle Buildings, and will, it is expected, be brought into use by <Col N="721" /> the end of July.  This will serve an area bounded on the north by James's Street, south by the Canal, Rathmines, east by St. Stephen's Green and Harcourt Street, and west by Inchicore. A second automatic exchange to serve an area bounded on the south by the Canal, Ballsbridge, north by Pearse Street, west by Harcourt Street and Dawson Street, and east by the Canal Docks, is now in course of construction. This exchange will have an initial equipment capacity for 1,800 and an ultimate for 6,000 lines.  It will probably be brought into use before the end of the year.  I may explain that the principle underlying automatic telephony is that of enabling one subscriber to get into direct touch with another without having to go through intermediate operators.  The service will make for greater expedition in effecting calls and an improved service generally. Such a system has been in use in America, and is being more generally developed in England.</P>
    <P>A total of 151 new call offices were provided, bringing the number up to 967, as compared with 592 in 1922. There was a net increase of 2,049 subscribers' stations during the year. Eighteen new trunk circuits with a total length of 503 miles of wire were erected.  Provision is being made in the present Vote for the residue of the expenditure required for trunk services, Dublin to Dunboyne, Dublin-Edenderry, Dublin-Maynooth, Dublin-Mullingar, Killarney-Kenmare, Muine Bheag-Goresbridge, Monaghan-Belfast, Trim-Athboy.  Eighty additional telephone circuits for the Gárda Síochána were provided during the year.  Underground schemes have been completed, or are in course of completion, in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Tralee, Killarney, Greystones, etc.  An agreement has now been reached for the erection of many additional call office kiosks in Dublin.  Kiosks have also been provided in Cork and Limerick, and call offices in cabinets or kiosks have been established at many railway stations.</P>
    <P>As I have shown, the financial improvement in the Post Office since it was taken over in 1922 represents the amount of £700,000 a year.  The belief has been formed that this improvement, <Col N="722" /> or the greater portion of it, is due to retrenchment at the expense of the public services.  I wish to make it clear that such is not the case.  Only about 20 per cent. of that amount has been saved as a result of curtailed public facilities.  And I wish also to make it clear that in the reduction of facilities we did not consider rural as apart from town areas, but made retrenchments general, and where it could be borne with the least inconvenience.  It has been claimed that the people of this country should have equality of services whether they reside in a town area or a rural area.  In a commercial organisation such as the Post Office, services cannot obviously be arranged on such lines.  We have to arrange them on commercial and economic lines; we have to arrange them in accordance with the amount of traffic to be handled at a particular place or in a particular district, and we have to measure cost against revenue in considering all services, both large and small.  That is the basis, and I think the only basis, on which any business concern could carry on.  In this connection I think it is also right to point out that the cut which we have made in certain services is not necessarily a permanent cut.  We have constantly under review all the mail, etc., arrangements, and where we find that traffic is on the increase and would warrant further facilities, or where there are special circumstances, we will not hesitate to provide such facilities as may be justified.  This particularly refers to rural posts, some of which were reduced in frequency in the years 1923 and 1924.  The number of posts reduced was not so large as has sometimes been represented.  In all, about 15 per cent. of the posts were curtailed.</P>
    <P>It has also to be taken into consideration that although we saved a certain amount in the restriction of services in one direction we expended a large amount on the development of other services, such as telephones, which are and will be of greater help to the people of this country.  We have to appreciate that telephones will largely, if not entirely, be the future medium of quick intercourse, and we must provide facilities accordingly.  The telephone service as taken over from the British was not <Col N="723" /> developed&mdash;it was very limited in its scope and the plant was obsolete and unsuitable.</P>
    <P>In the discussion of the Post Office Estimates last year several Deputies referred to what was regarded as an unfair system of levying charges for the delivery of telegrams in rural districts. I promised the Dáil that I would examine into the whole question. As already stated, there is a loss of £163,000 a year on the telegraph service. This works out at about 1/- a telegram.  While, therefore, we make a charge of 1/- a telegram for transmission, it costs us 2/- to deal with.  In the case of residents living some miles from a post office we have to pay for the extra cost of delivery, which, for a person residing five miles from a post office, would amount to 2/-.  At present the delivery cost of 2/- in such a case is borne either by the sender or the addressee of the telegram.  If it were otherwise, the position would be that the Post Office, in charging a shilling for a telegram, would have to expend 4/- in dealing with it.  I am unable to see how, as a business proposition, that could be sustained.  The porterage or delivery charges on rural telegrams are not any source of profit, they are intended to defray, and they only defray, the entire cost of delivery, by reason of the distance resident from a post office. In all cases the first mile is free, and the free telegraph delivery area is a scheme that is in force in many other countries.  A free delivery, irrespective of distance, would work out as I have shown, inequitably.  As promised, however, I examined the whole question with the view of seeing whether it was possible to modify the present system, but so far I have not been able to convince the Minister for Finance that a good case exists for any change in the existing arrangement.</P>
    <P>There is no material difference in the amount of the Vote now presented with that of last year.  An increase of £17,000 is shown, but this is more than accounted for in the fact that the current financial year contains 53 pay weeks as against the usual 52.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JAMES CRAIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a grumble to mention here.  It is an annual grumble, and it is a personal grumble. I have not made friends with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs because he will not grant facilities for giving me my letters in the morning.  I live in the centre of the city, and when I have to leave the house at a quarter to nine it ought to be possible for me to have my letters delivered before that time.  This does not take place.  I have mentioned the matter to the Minister on several occasions, and the suggestion that he offered was that I should send a man to the corner of the Square to collect the letters.  The whole thing simply means starting the postman a quarter of an hour earlier on the delivery of his letters.  I have already pointed out to the Minister that a letter was delivered at my house asking me to attend a Selection Committee of the Dáil at 11 o'clock one morning.  That letter had not arrived by the time I was obliged to leave the house, and consequently I did not receive it until late in the day.  On some occasions I do not receive the letters until 1 o'clock, and amongst them at times are letters summoning me to Committee meetings of the Dáil, sitting at 11 o'clock.  That is my grumble, and I think it is a matter that should be attended to.  My complaint is that I am not getting a proper service.</P>
      <P>The next point that I want to draw attention to is the continuance of the sixpenny tax on the delivery of parcels. I think that charge has caused more grumbling amongst people than anything else in connection with this Department.  I am sorry to find that the reduction in the telephone rates has not led to anything like an increase in the revenue.  That certainly will not encourage the Minister to go on with any further extension of the telephone system.  The telephone rates have been reduced, but the system has not been availed of to an extent that would make it worth the Minister's while to engage in further extensions.  I am sorry to hear that.  It would be a great thing if there was a big extension in the matter of the telephone system throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BRENNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister has not seen fit to withdraw the very vexatious and unpopular charge that is made for the delivery of telegrams in the rural districts.  To my mind nothing has made the Department more unpopular than that particular charge.  The Minister has told us that there has been a loss of £163,000 on telegrams.  He has tried to show us that there is equality of service as far as rural and town dwellers are concerned, but yet he continues this uncalled-for charge in the case of people living in rural districts.  Would the Minister tell us to what extent this vexatious charge is responsible for reducing the loss on that particular service? To my mind it does not reduce it to any appreciable extent at all.  In the circumstances I hold that it is not worth while continuing this special charge.  I am quite sure that the loss of £217,000 on letters and parcels is largely accounted for by delivery in rural districts, but yet neither the Minister nor any member of the House would dream of asking the people to put extra stamps on their letters in order to have them delivered in the rural districts.  What happens is that the charge is increased all round.  It would be more equitable if there was a slight increase in the case of the delivery of telegrams than to have the present system.  If the Minister is not prepared to cut his losses on telegrams it would be better then that he put the charge absolutely and entirely on the rural dwellers.  It is very hard for some people who live in the rural districts, especially those dealing in perishable articles, to conduct their business while this extra charge is made for the delivery of telegrams.  They receive telegrams daily, and many of them have to pay from 4/- to 5/- for their delivery. That is a very great hardship on these people.  Personally I should say that it is not worth while continuing this extra charge for the sake of the slight reduction made in the total losses sustained on the delivery of telegrams.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. DOYLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support what Deputy Brennan has stated with regard to the unfairness of the charge made for the delivery of telegrams in rural districts.  It is an imposition on <Col N="726" /> these people to have to pay these charges, while the people living in towns get all their telegrams delivered free of charge.  I would like to know from the Minister if all the losses that he enumerated are made on the telegrams on which there is no porterage collected. If that is the position, it makes this extra charge on the people in the rural districts all the more unfair.  If the people in the rural districts have to bear the full share of the cost of the telegrams, by paying porterage, then undoubtedly the Minister is conferring a great benefit on the people residing in the towns and within the required limit who get their telegrams delivered free.  That is what I gathered from the Minister's statement is happening.  If the people in the rural districts are paying the full charges, by paying porterage on the delivery of telegrams, then, of course, the Department is at no loss in the case of the rural delivery, so that the position we have is this: that the people in the towns and those residing within the required limit are getting all the benefit of the service while the people outside the limit are getting none.  I would point out to the Minister that the people in the rural districts have to pay rates and taxes to the same extent as the people living in the towns, and, therefore, I think they are entitled to the same treatment in this matter.  This is a very unfair and very obnoxious charge that is made on the people in the rural districts.  It imposes a great hardship on them, because in many instances they have to pay a charge of 2/- for telegrams delivered to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it would be well if I were to clear up now the points raised by Deputy Brennan and Deputy Doyle.  The total loss on telegrams, apart from Press telegrams, is £163,000.  All telegrams delivered within a mile from the post office are delivered free.  That includes free delivery for the type of telegram referred to by the two Deputies, the telegram delivered, let us say, four miles from the post office as distinct from free delivery up to the limit of one mile.  It pays its way between one mile and four miles, but no more than that, but notwithstanding that fact, up to the point <Col N="727" /> of the one mile limit, that telegram involves the State in an actual loss of a shilling.  In other words, it costs the State to bring it to that point 2/-, 1/- being subscribed by the sender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. BRENNAN Mr. BRENNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BRENNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That proves more conclusively than anything else the unfairness of the further charge that is made on people residing in the rural districts.  The Minister admits that there is a loss on all telegrams, but yet he tries to recover practically all the loss from the rural dwellers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount last year was £20,000, and in the previous year £42,000.  The imposition of the charge beyond the mile limit has certainly resulted in a very big decline in the number of telegrams that are being sent beyond that area.  As I indicated last year, I made a proposal to the Minister for Finance in respect to this matter but the Minister could not see his way to accede to the loss which the proposal would involve.  We do not stand alone in regard to this charge for delivery.  Every country that I know of makes a charge in like circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, it is very common.  It appears that there is a universal agreement on this matter. The Saorstát limit is one mile, and the charge beyond that is 6d. per mile or part of a mile.  In Australia the free delivery limit is one mile, and beyond that a charge is made for the actual cost of delivery.  If that cost is higher than 6d. per mile, it is charged.  In New Zealand the free delivery radius is a mile.  Beyond that it is 6d. a mile. In South Africa it is a mile, and beyond that 6d. per mile.  In Belgium it extends to one and a quarter miles, and beyond that 6d. per mile.  In Sweden the position is like that of the other <Col N="728" /> countries mentioned.  I know no exception to this rule.</P>

      <P>The decline in the amount of money recovered proves that the system has not been availed of, and is conclusive proof that it is not worth continuing.  Of the loss of £163,000 we only recovered £23,000 last year.  While there was a net loss of business we had practically the same expenditure.</P>

      <P>This was the main subject of discussion in the Estimates of past years.  As I explained then, the absence of a fee was a great encouragement to people who sent telegrams light-heartedly on trivial matters.  I know in the case of a great many people it is essential.  We realise that fully and sympathise with them.  That the other is also the case, and that the State, the taxpayer, was being unnecessarily involved in expenditure of this kind, we are also aware.  Tipsters, touts, and bucket-shop advocates were freely distributing circular telegrams to people, remotely situated.  I think it will be generally acceded here that monies of the State have some better purpose than finding their way to the employment of messengers for the delivery of telegrams of that kind.  Therefore, there are two sides to it.  Undoubtedly a similar situation exists elsewhere, and there must have been some determining factor in deciding this matter.</P>

      <P>I think the House considers it a great hardship.  I happen to live a few yards outside the three mile limit.  It costs me 1/6 for the delivery of a telegram, so that it is not a question of a mile, but part of a mile, for which the fee is charged.  It does not matter whether it is a yard beyond it.  I think this is a great hardship, and is worth considering.</P>

      <P>I want to have a mild growl at the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  It concerns Post Office workers in Waterford City.  The heading under which I want to bring my complaint is classification for the purpose of maximum salary.  I understand throughout the Saorstát the various cities and towns are classified under three heads.  Dublin stands <Col N="729" /> alone as Class One.  Then you have Cork, Limerick, Dun Laoghaire, and Bray, Class Two.  Waterford City is the fourth in the Free State, and, in other respects, perhaps, more important, because the export trade from Waterford City is larger than that of some of the other cities with a larger population. The Post Office employees in Waterford City have protested against the fact that they come under category Three.  They have protested on several occasions to the Minister, and when the President was in Waterford City last September the matter was brought under his notice.  I know this question has the sympathy of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, but it has apparently stopped there, because nothing has been done.  I understand that this maximum was fixed by the English when they were in occupation here, and the cost of living is not less in Waterford City than in any other city of its size.  I want to know what is the precise position now of these officials, and whether the Minister proposes to rectify it.  I must say, as a citizen of that city, that I have always found the officials in the Post Office very courteous and very efficient.  The staff down there have so far kept very quiet.  They have not carried on any very active hostile agitation, either against the State or against the public.  They have carefully and efficiently carried out their public duties.</P>
      <P>Now I need not magnify the various uses that an efficient service is to business in the State.  Only to-day, when we were discussing the Fisheries Vote, one of the Deputies, very wisely.  I thought, suggested that notification should be sent out, several times daily, to our fishermen in the fishing centres, giving them a forecast of what the weather was likely to be.  That is a very good idea and only demonstrates the excellent use an efficient postal, wireless and telegraph service could be put to.  I should like the Minister to consider this whole question and to get a definite ruling from him regarding it.</P>

      <P>I desire to support the application made by the last speaker.  I have raised this matter previously with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and he has received <Col N="730" /> me in a most sympathetic way.  I know he is in a difficulty in regard to it. However, there is the anomaly, and it calls for adjustment.  As far as I understand, Blackrock is actually in a higher grade than Waterford.  That, without any disparagement to Blackrock as an important centre in the country, is a state of affairs which should be rectified.  The position of the officials in Waterford is hardly a proper one, because of the importance of the centre in which they are engaged and the amount of work which they are called upon to do.  I trust the Minister will give this his careful and immediate consideration and will be in a better position now than he was on previous occasion to indicate whether anything possible can be done in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to repeat the battle royal we had on former years on this question of telegrams.  Any of the old Deputies will remember it. The figures given just now by the Minister prove conclusively the argument we advanced twelve months ago. The total loss on the telegraph service was reduced from about £180,000 to £163,000.  The amount recovered for delivery outside the mile limit decreased from £43,000 to £20,000.  That also proves my contention of last year, that there would be less use made of the telegraph service outside the mile limit.  The Minister says that telegrams have been sent lightheartedly to bucket-shops.  I do not know exactly what the Minister means by &ldquo;bucket-shops.&rdquo; He has not conveyed his exact meaning to me, at all events.  These &ldquo;light-hearted telegrams,&rdquo; whether sent to bucket-shops or other shops, are not sent by people living outside the mile limit.  The fact that one has to travel a mile, two miles or three miles to a telegraph office is sufficient guarantee that &ldquo;light-hearted telegrams&rdquo; will not be sent.  That applies both to delivery of telegrams and the sending <Col N="731" /> of telegrams.  People cannot send telegrams without going to the telegraph office, and when they have to do that they will not send telegrams lightheartedly.</P>
      <P>The amount received by recoveries is so small&mdash;£20,000&mdash;that it is not worth while to make a distinction on account of it between the citizens of the State. The Minister was prepared to suffer an annual loss on telegraphs of £143,000.  The present loss is £163,000. The average charge for delivery outside the mile limit would be 1/-, and £20,000 is the total in that respect.  You must assume then that the rest of the loss of £163,000 is within the mile limit, and that 95 per cent. of the telegrams&mdash; perhaps 100 per cent. of the &ldquo;light-hearted&rdquo; ones&mdash;were sent inside there. I do not ask the Minister to acquiesce in the claim made by Deputy Brennan, Deputy Doyle and myself.  But I do ask the Minister to have a Committee of the Dáil appointed, assisted by some of the postal officials, to inquire into the whole matter and end the bickering which has been going on for the last three or four years.  The controversy that we have had for some time serves no useful purpose.  If we had this Committee appointed we could abide by its report.  This trifling with the telegraph service is an irritation to people living outside the limit, and our own commonsense should suggest a remedy.</P>

I can assure the Deputy that I shall keep a close eye on the subject, and if the financial conditions in the service offer the necessary encouragement we may be able to do something in the line suggested.  Meantime, I think there would be no use in pursuing the matter.</P>

      <P>It would appear to me that a great many of the reductions are brought about by increased charges and the shortening of services.  It is very questionable if economies effected in that way can be placed in the category of &ldquo;reductions.&rdquo;  It is really transferring money from one pocket to another.  Then a great many of the reductions must have been brought about by automatic decreases in wages. Salaries and wages had reached their peak point in 1921-22.  The reduction of stores must also have had a considerable bearing on the savings, as they are explained to us.  It would be well if we had a proper account showing how the reductions in the service have been brought about&mdash;what amounts were in respect of salaries, increased charges and curtailed services.  If we had those particulars, we would be able to assess at its proper value the reduction that has taken place in the cost of working.</P>
      <P>As the Estimate is put up to us at present, we simply get bald figures showing that the expenditure has been reduced by so much.  In my opinion, that is not a reduction.  Increasing charges to show a reduction is not a reduction.</P>

      <P>The expenditure on Broadcasting for the financial year 1927-28 is estimated at £29,055, to provide for the Dublin and Cork Stations. This represents practically no change in the expenditure authorised in connection with the previous Estimates.  During the financial year ended 31st March, 1927, the following licences were issued:&mdash;18,820 at 10/-; 52 at £1; 44 at £5.  The revenue from licences amounted to £9,682; advertisements and other incidental revenue yielded £200, and the receipts from the import tax realised £19,000, making a total of £28,882.  It will thus be seen that even in its infancy Broadcasting has been run without any charge on the State, and the revenue last year, in addition to providing for the running expenses, was also sufficient to meet the capital expenditure.  It is anticipated that the number of licence holders during the current financial year will total <Col N="734" /> 35,000.  Any drop in the revenue from the import tax during the current year will be offset by the increased yield from licences, and it is anticipated that we will again be in a position this year to meet all expenditure in connection with Broadcasting out of that service's revenue.</P>
      <P>Immediately after the passing of the Wireless Broadcasting Act, 1926, empowering me to collect wireless receiving licences, I caused steps to be taken to round up the huge number of defaulters, and I am happy to say that the results have been satisfactory.  In all 340 defaulters were prosecuted, and fines of varying amounts were inflicted in the vast majority of cases.  In addition the number of licences issued following the prosecutions increased very materially.</P>
      <P>On previous occasions, in discussing broadcasting in the Dáil, I informed Deputies that it was the intention to provide a central high power station for the relay of our programmes to the whole country.  I am glad to say that this principle has received the approval of the Government, and proposals to carry it into effect are at present under consideration by the Minister for Finance.  It is considered unlikely that any expenditure in connection with this project will be required during the current financial year, and accordingly no provision has been made in the Estimates.  If, however, any expenditure should be subsequently required for this purpose during the present financial year a Supplementary Estimate will be submitted to An Dáil.  When the high power station is functioning it is anticipated that all citizens of the Saorstát, with the possible exceptions of those resident in Northern Tirconaill and South-West Kerry, will be able to hear and enjoy our programmes on inexpensive crystal sets.  For those citizens outside that radius a one-valve set will suffice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The World Broadcast Wave Band is at present very crowded, resulting in interference by stations with one another's programmes.  Hitherto matters of this nature have been dealt with by the Union Internationale de Radiophonie. The Union, whose head- <Col N="735" /> quarters are at Geneva, is composed of representatives of most of the European broadcasting companies, but has no executive power, and in view of the importance of radio the various Governments have now taken up the whole question, and an International Governmental Conference has been convened to discuss all radio problems. This Conference will be held in Washington in the autumn of this year, and will be attended by representatives of my Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has agreed to my proposal for the issue of free wireless licences to the blind, and the necessary regulation under the Wireless Telegraphy Act has been prepared to be laid on the Table of the Oireachtas. An Advisory Committee, the members of which are representative of all the cultural interests in the Saorstát, has been set up to assist me in the conduct of broadcasting, and has already held three meetings.  I anticipate that as a result of the Committee's help and advice that broadcasting in the Saorstát will rank equally with broadcasting in any other country.</P>

      <P>There is nothing very abnormal in the matter of expenditure or of policy to draw attention to on this Estimate.  There are just a few points that may be remarked upon. Under the combined heading of travelling and salaries there is a slight reduction in the Estimate.  Under the headings K, L, and M, referring to certain services dealing with mothers, medical treatment of children and work of that kind, the Estimate last year was £22,930, and there is an increase of £8,254 this year.  This service arises under Acts passed as recently as 1915, 1917 and 1919, and the figure represents the gradual and normal increase in these recently introduced services. Under sub-heads R and S, referring to housing, the sum of £15,000 under sub-head R is the last of the million grant given for housing in 1922.  It is estimated that that £15,000 will be completely spent during the current financial year.  Under sub-head S, we are dealing with the remnant of the £900,000 that was voted under the 1924, 1925, and 1926 Acts.  The reduction in the Estimate there is simply because of the fact that while £326,000 was estimated for last year, the actual allotment of this money was only £250,000. When we estimate for £250,000 as the <Col N="737" /> allotment from the rest of the fund this year, it does not mean a definite slowing down of building work.  It simply mans that we are measuring our estimate in accordance with the progress up to the present.  Of the £900,000, after the £250,000 which is estimated for is spent, there will remain a sum of £125,000, which it is anticipated will be completely allotted or spent hy the 30th September, 1928.</P>
      <P>A word perhaps needs to be said in regard to roads.  Under the special road scheme introduced last year, £2,000,000 were set aside for special roads.  Of that amount, the allotment of the first section was initiated in July, when £750,000 was allocated.  The remaining portion of this grant was allocated in April, 1927, when a sum of £1,212,033 was finally allocated.  There was a small amount left unallocated of approximately £37,000.  Up to the end of the financial year, 31st March, 1927, of the amount allocated there was actually a sum of £273,491 spent.  It is estimated that actually only £1,000,000 of this money will be spent this year, which will leave about three-quarters of a million to be spent after 1st April next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the Road Fund we have also to remark that authority was given in February of this year for the spending of a certain sum on the upkeep of main roads, as distinct from the improvement of them.  This is the first time a grant has been made from the Road Fund for the maintenance of main roads, as distinct from their improvement. The sum of £211,134 was made available for this purpose, and it is being allocated on the basis of the expenditure of the different public bodies during the year 1926-27 on maintenance.  Fifty per cent. recoupment is being given in respect of the cost of maintenance on trunk roads and 30 per cent. recoupment in respect of other main roads.  In addition there has been allocated from the Road Fund this year a sum of £300,000 for the improvement of main roads, and a sum of £50,000 for the improvement of certain tourists roads. These sums have been allotted to the various bodies, apart altogether from any expenditure that they are involving <Col N="738" /> themselves in in respect of those roads.  The money is being given as a special grant and does not involve any corresponding expenditure on the part of those bodies on those roads. There is, therefore, a change of policy in what has been done&mdash;a certain amount of money has been allotted from the Road Fund for upkeep as distinct from improvement.  There is a difference as between the administration of the Road Fund under the British regime and the administration of it now.  Certain monies are being granted for the improvement of main roads, apart altogether from any obligation resting on the local bodies for giving a certain amount from their own local funds.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask if the Government have any new additions to their housing programme except what is outlined here, because I notice from reading a report with reference to the Fever Hospital that the conditions in Cork are becoming very serious.  I will just read an extract from a paper I received in connection with the Fever Hospital Committee meeting, which will give some idea of the conditions:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The report of the year's working showed that a larger number of infectious cases had been dealt with than in any period for the last twenty years. In connection with the large number of diphtheria cases the Committee expressed the opinion that overcrowding, bad housing, and congestion in the poorer quarters were responsible for the increase.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion, the housing question will not be satisfactorily solved until the Government make a serious effort to deal with the slum and poorer areas. The houses erected under recent schemes are being let at rents out of the reach of the poorer classes.  The sooner that we face the facts in that respect the better.  I can quite understand it being asked where the money is to come from, but the problem is so serious that it ought to engage the very serious attention, not only of the Minister, but of the Executive Council.  They should make a serious effort to get rid of the slum conditions prevailing in our cities.  I thought it right to bring before the House the conditions prevailing <Col N="739" /> in Cork city, especially as the particulars have been furnished to me by a very prominent resident.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I wish to call attention is the manner in which home assistance is being administered. I have here a letter from a constituent of mine, who says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am writing to you this letter, knowing that you will inquire into the matter.  My wife is sick on childbirth, and I made an application for nourishment for her, and got a reply, as you can see in the enclosed form, that I should apply to my Health Insurance Society.  Being an idle man, how can I expect to be in benefit?  There are four children, and we are practically destitute.  The R.O. did not come to the house to see for himself the want and poverty there is there.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is the reply he got from the R.O.:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With reference to your application for assistance, if your wife has been confined, apply to the National Health Insurance Society for your maternity benefit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This man, being a casual labourer, is not in benefit in the National Health Insurance Society, and still he is refused help of any kind under the home assistance system, as it is at present administered.  That, I think, calls for some investigation.  It opens up a very serious condition of things. In fact, as has been stated here during the past week, the whole question of home assistance requires thorough investigation and overhauling, because, apparently, there is a great deal of dissatisfaction existing among the poorer sections of the community at the manner in which they are being treated &mdash;I presume in the interests of economy.  It is not economy to allow sick people to die in want.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to the question of combined purchasing.  According to the Estimate there are a few items of expenditure in connection with it which, added together, total £3,093.  In my opinion, the combined purchasing system requires investigation and overhauling. <Col N="740" /> I am not at all convinced that it is an improvement on the old system. If there is any apparent saving, it is more than counter-balanced by the expense of Government administration and the inconvenience caused to public bodies.  It is a matter that demands inquiry, as, from information at my disposal, the results are not very satisfactory.  I hope the Minister will give consideration, to these matters.</P>

      <P>With reference to the road grants mentioned by the Minister, I do not consider that County Leitrim has got an adequate share of them. Not being a tourist county, we have received very little in grants.  There are 1,100 miles of roads in the county, only 200 miles of which are trunk and main roads.  Owing to the poverty of the county, the expenditure on road maintenance is a very heavy burden, and I hope the Minister will see that the county gets a larger share of these grants.</P>

      <P>I heard the Minister suggest that the Estimate was framed on the immediate wants of the moment, but I regret to say that, in my opinion, the wants of the moment are really of a very pressing nature.  I trust that an appeal coming from these benches to the Minister will not be misrepresented or misconstrued.  In my opinion, true economy is represented by such a reduction as £300,000 on the Army Estimate.  I respectfully suggest that false economy is represented in the reduction of the Housing Estimate by £75,000, because on this Estimate depends absolutely the preservation of the health, the lives and the well-being <Col N="741" /> of the people.  Upon the housing of the people depends the main fundamental for the uplifting and for the progress of human life.</P>
      <P>Upon the housing of the people depends the real decencies of human life. The suggestion of the Minister is that the Estimate has been framed only with a view of the moment.  The problem is so pressing, especially in the North side of the city, from which I come, that I make an appeal to the Minister to give it immediate and earnest consideration. I recognise freely that £1,900,000 has been spent on housing, but still, the terrible fact remains that in 1911 one-seventh of the population of Dublin County Borough, or 43,985 persons, were living four to a room in one-room tenements.  From 1911 to 1926 the Dublin borough population has increased by almost 12,000 souls, and consequently, with that increase there ensues a greater density of population in tenement districts.  Fifty thousand human beings are affected by the Estimate we are now considering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can tell the Minister, and I am sorry to have to say it, but I speak with personal experience of the North side of Dublin, that young children are sleeping upon the floors of these pestilential hovels.  I suggest to the Minister, most respectfully, that the problem of the Dublin slums is a blot on the administration of the housing system.  The cancerous growth of these slums is increasing steadily year by year, and yet we are now faced with a reduction in the Estimate.  I hope we shall hear something from the Minister which will give us a hope of this problem being immediately dealt with.  In the framing of the Estimate I would ask the Minister has any sum been ear-marked to provide dwelling accommodation at rentals, say, for two-roomed flats, with sanitary accommodation, of something like 7/6 per week?  I would even suggest a lower figure if that were possible. I suggest to the earnest consideration of the Minister that people with incomes of from 50/- weekly downwards have no possibility of paying rentals of from 15/- to £1, and sometimes more.  I do not lay these views before the House in any spirit of hostility to the administration, but I <Col N="742" /> suggest they are worthy of immediate consideration.</P>
    <P>Primitive societies held land in common, and to-day we recognise one of the greatest and most mighty institutions of the State&mdash;private property in land.  I suggest to the Minister that there is one predominant want of man, based on every law, human and Divine, and that is ready access to the land. Although I am not animated by any spirit of hostility whatever to the private institution of property as it now exists I venture, with all deference, to remind this House that Nature's law must be obeyed; that the want for the use of land is inherent in every individual in this State; that it is as vital to his well-being as the air we breathe and the water we drink.  I suggest, with all deference, that land, being limited in extent, and incapable of increase by the labour of man, is subject to special economic laws. What I would ask the Minister to consider in as sympathetic a way as he possibly can is: Is the State taking care that this primitive want of every individual, this easy and ready access to the land, is being provided?  Can he do anything to see that that want is reasonably fulfilled?  One of the greatest economists, John Stuart Mill, has laid down a dictum based on the consideration of land tenure in Ireland, that property in land is only justifiable so long as the occupier is a developer of that land.</P>
    <P>I do not lay these arguments before the House in any spirit of antagonism, but I suggest that we have plenty of land to deal adequately with the problem. The density of people to the square mile in England and Wales is 649; in Germany, 328; in Northern Ireland, 240; and in the Irish Free State only 112.  I have had an opportunity of travelling through the major portion of the British Isles, and I can speak from personal experience and say that in no quarter, on any of my visits, have I seen anything like the terrible conditions that prevail in the tenements of the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>There are many derelict sites which could easily be made available for building purposes.  If they were made available, they would afford ready access <Col N="743" /> to the inhabitants living in the midst of towns, and I, as a business man in this city, think that it is not an undeniable truth that it is for the major benefit of the city that we should endeavour to transfer all the population to a distance outside the city itself. I put these arguments before the Minister, knowing very well that in this House there is no person more sympathetic personally to the subject with which I am dealing than the Minister. I know that he has stated that it is one of the gravest national problems at the moment, and I hope he will endeavour to grapple with it at the earliest possible opportunity.  I would like to hear if anything could humanly be done to endeavour to give to the one-seventh submerged population of Dublin habitable dwellings at what has been called an economic rent.  I will only say in conclusion that justice should be done to the submerged one-seventh as readily as to the more fortunate.&mdash;Fiat justitia ruat coelum&mdash;let justice be done though the heavens fall.</P>

      <P>I am sure that the moving appeal which has been addressed to the new Minister by Deputy Byrne is bound to have an effect on both his heart and mind, but I hope that the Deputy's view of housing needs is not the view which he gets from the top of Nelson's Pillar and that he can see further than the view that he gets from the top of that magnificent monument. He appeared to confine his remarks to the housing needs of the citizens of Dublin.  I think in making his moving appeal he has rather confused the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government with that of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture.  Apart from these views, I hope that the Minister will take his courage in both hands and take the responsibility of producing a more courageous policy in regard to housing than we have had so far.  We have in this Estimate a figure of £577,000 in the shape of housing grants for the year 1926-27, and for the year 1927-28, the amount is reduced to £502,000.  There is no Deputy in this House, and certainly no Minister, who said more about the housing needs and <Col N="744" /> about what the Government had done in that respect than the President.</P>
      <P>I read his speeches in the country, and I listened to him on many occasions, and he quoted figures to show that in the year 1914 there were 78,000 houses unfit for human habitation.  I wonder how many houses have been added to that list since 1914?  We have heard, from the President, on the other hand, that only 14,000 have been provided under the various grants given from Government sources.  Surely the President will not seriously suggest that that is a serious attempt on the part of the Ministry to deal with the situation which exists to-day?  Most of the grants have been taken advantage of by speculative builders, who built houses to sell and not to let.  The housing problem will never be solved until provision is made whereby local authorities will be enabled to borrow on long-term loans and to build houses which can be let at rents which people can afford to pay.  That is the demand which comes from my constituency, and, if I know anything about the country as a whole, I think it is the demand which comes from the entire country to the new Ministry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that they will endeavour to meet the situation which calls for the provision, of new houses on long-term loans.  These houses will never be built under the provisions of the Housing Facilities Act, 1925, and the Minister may make up his mind as regards that. I hope that he will signalise his entry into the Ministry by tackling that problem and bringing before us a more courageous policy than has yet been adopted.  I know that in Tullamore, which has not a large population, there are 120 houses condemned as unfit for human habitation.  The urban council there approached the Minister's predecessor and asked him to let them a site which is Government-owned and which is controlled by the Board of Works, but the Minister for Local Government told them that he had no responsibility in the matter.  That shows that there is not a common policy between even two Departments.  The Board of Works had the site and had no one to let it to, and the Urban Council required it to build 28 houses out of the 120 that <Col N="745" /> should be provided.  The same situation exists in Birr and other urban areas where there is an urgent demand for houses to let at an economic rent.</P>

      <P>You referred to sub-heads R and S of the Vote, to which <Col N="746" /> we are asked to agree.  I will, however, leave the matter at that and I will be delighted to listen to Deputy Falvey on this or any other question.  The Minister also referred to the money provided for the maintenance, construction and improvement of main and trunk roads.  I am not sure whether his policy is the same as that of his predecessor in regard to the manner in which that money should be spent.  I heard the late Minister say that it was his intention and, presumably, the intention of the Ministry, to spend any money allocated to roads by giving employment to the greatest possible number of people.  I want to raise, under that heading, a matter which has been the cause of a certain amount of trouble and which led to disputes in my constituency concerning a class of people for whom Deputy Falvey speaks.  In the part of the country from which I come the contract for the construction of these trunk roads has been given to two large contractors. Recently disputes have arisen owing to the fact that these contractors have brought motor haulage into the area and thus prevented the local carters, who are small farmers, the people for whom Deputy Falvey speaks in Clare, from getting work.</P>

I protest against this policy of robbing the farmers with one hand and putting a few shillings in their pockets with another.</P>

      <P>I was mentioning that in connection with the expenditure of this money on trunk road work in my constituency a dispute had arisen as to why these contractors, and they are numerous, should be allowed to bring motor cars into the area and consequently prevent the small farmers from doing the carting.  In one county in my constituency at any rate, and I believe it applies to the other county also, the county surveyor was not allowed any discretion in drawing up the contract.  He had been given mandatory orders from the Department the Minister represents that the large contractors should have any rights they required in this respect.  If the money is to be spent in giving employment to the greatest possible number of individuals I think that policy should be qualified or altered in some way.  I hope the Minister will have a consultation with the Chief Engineer with a view to allowing the county surveyors to have some discretion in drawing up the terms of the contract for money that is to be spent on trunk road construction work.  It is not, perhaps, quite fair to spring these matters on a new Minister, but I hope in the ordinary course of administration he will take particular notice of the matter I have referred to and which has been the cause of trouble in the constituency I represent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>If I mentioned the number 78,000 it was in reference to people, and it is embodied in a report issued by a rural district council in Ireland.  That report stated that the number of persons badly housed in 1914 was 78,000.  That was the total number in rural areas that could be compiled.  If I mentioned the figure at <Col N="748" /> all it was to compare it with the number of people badly housed in Dublin to show that there was a certain similarity between the numbers.  The number in the case of Dublin would probably be 100,000.  Deputy Davin and Deputy Horgan have avoided the real crux in connection with housing.  It is not a question of long term loans.  Anyone who knows anything about the cost of building knows that a house in the city of Dublin, to meet the housing needs, would cost £500 approximately, and a similar house in the country £300.  The interest on £500 at the rate we are paying for the last few years in Dublin would be £25 per annum&mdash;that is, at 5 per cent. interest.  That is very close to 10/- a week.  A long term loan, say a one hundred years loan, adds £5 to the interest.  Paying off at £5 per annum means the cost of the house would be cleared off in 100 years at £30 per annum, which has to be met in paying principal and interest.  I ask Deputy Davin and Deputy Horgan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>And Deputy Byrne if you wish, but he dealt with the question in a different way to the other Deputies.  Deputy Byrne was honest in this, that he mentioned a small house.  It would be easier to provide a small house, as the Local Government Department has specified in connection with grants that the houses must be three, four or five-roomed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection is that Deputy Horgan specially dealt with small houses.  He said houses were being provided of such a character that the people who most required them could not afford to pay the rent for them.  It was to the small houses he specially referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite aware of that.  Deputy Byrne spoke of two-roomed flats, which is a different proposition to that of providing small houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Then a small house is what the Deputy has in mind. If it is to be a house that would be <Col N="749" /> passed by any public authority in the country, it would have to be a three-roomed house, and would have to comply with certain specifications. The cost of a three-roomed house in Dublin would probably be £350, taking it at a low estimate.  If Deputy Horgan wishes for assistance in working-out what the intevest would be in making provision for the redemption of money in 100 years I could tell him that it would be £17 10s. per annum at 5 per cent., and the repayment of the principal would add another £3 10s. per annum, making a total of £21. What I want is a little common honesty in connection with the question, and an admission of the fact that the cost of building houses is heavy.  The State has contributed towards that cost in the last four or five years almost £2,000,000.  The question is whether an additional amount is wanted from the State towards that service.  There has not been enough done&mdash;that is the case.  Very good.  You want more done.  Does that mean you want more money?  Where is that to come from? Now there is silence amongst the economists, the people who spoke about extravagance.  If you want more it must come from taxation, and must be taken out of the pockets of the people or out of the pockets of the people requiring the houses.  As far as the sum in the Estimate is concerned, if more than that be required during the year to fulfil the terms of our Housing Acts we will supply it.  It is not a question of holding back money.  It is a question of drawing up an estimate of the requirements of the country up to the 31st March next, and if all that is used up in March, does Deputy Redmond, Deputy Horgan or any other Deputy who spoke of economy say that the housing problem has not been tackled by us and that more money should have been spent on it?  We are away from and out of the heat of the elections now and in a very calm atmosphere. Deputies should say plainly what is their policy in regard to that and in regard to other matters.</P>

It is not a question of long term loans.  I put it to the Deputy that if they were one-hundred-year loans&mdash;and I do not know of such a thing in connection with housing in any country in the world&mdash;that is not the problem; that the real problem is the heavy cost of the provision of houses. The fact is, as I have said here many a time, that if you build a house now under the conditions that prevail and put it up for sale, you will not get the money that it cost.

      <P>I want to question the policy of the present Minister tor Local Government and Public Health in regard to his action with reference to a medical appointment that was recently sanctioned in County Westmeath.  Last autumn a vacancy occurred for a doctor for the hospital and dispensary in Athlone, one of the most valuable medical appointments in County Westmeath.  Under the Local Authorities Act the Board of Health were given power to transfer to this vacancy an officer already in their service. It was understood during the passing of that Act that this would mean promotion, and that in connection with such promotion on transfer consideration would be given to merit, to length of service, and to the special needs of the locality.  I am sure it will be admitted that a doctor who is to be transferred to a hospital that caters for a large area should have some special training in surgical work.  There were four applications for the position.</P>
      <P>One of these candidates was a distinguished graduate of his University, with a gold medal attached to his degree, and he had either ten or twelve years' service in a Westmeath dispensary district.  The man who was appointed had two years' service, and had not anything like the same distinguished University career as this other man.  I do not wish to make any further comparisons, but I do say that the intention of the Act was not carried out.  The intention was that when a local authority was given the option of making a transfer it should take into consideration the merits and the length of service of the candidates. When the appointment was made some eight months ago the then Minister for Local Government refused his sanction. That refusal continued until the present Minister came into office, and the moment he came into office sanction was given.  This caused great dissatisfaction amongst medical people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had representations from the Irish Medical Association and from two or three other associations all protesting <Col N="752" /> against this appointment.  What I want to ask the Minister is this: If he was compelled to give his sanction under legal advice to this appointment, whether he is prepared to draft regulations to prevent an occurrence of this kind happening in the future.  This is a precedent that will be followed up almost immediately by the things we are trying to avoid under the very Act I am speaking about.  If the Minister would be able to give an assurance that he will draft regulations that would place some restrictions on the Public Health Boards so that they should take into consideration the question of merit and the question of service I shall be satisfied.</P>
    <P>I know the medical profession is very gravely disturbed at this upset of the intentions supposed to be contained in this Act.  I admit that it is quite true that the Act does not specify either of the two words I have been using in the matter of promotion.  It only gives the local authority power to transfer, without mentioning on what grounds the transfer should take place, but I think the matter of such serious importance that it is only right that I should raise it here on the occasion of this Vote.</P>

      <P>I wish to draw the attention of the Minister and of the Committee to a few items contained in this Vote.  There is a provision for £6,584 for 13 inspectors; a sum of £7,500 for 11 medical inspectors, and £4,000 for engineering inspectors, in addition to trade inspectors.  There are two items out of those I have mentioned to which I want to direct attention. The 13 inspectors are engaged presumably on ordinary administration in the twenty-six counties.  Since the abolition of the rural district councils each county contains practically three institutions&mdash;viz., the County Council, the Board of Health and the Mental Hospital.  I think that the allocation of one inspector to every two counties is entirely unnecessary and out of the question.  I have some experience of Local Government administration myself. I know that inspectors are helpful, occasionally, and that it is necessary, probably, to have them, but I <Col N="753" /> do not think it is necessary to have them to that extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In comparison with these thirteen inspectors, let us look at the number of engineering inspectors.  As a matter of fact, the chief engineering inspector is not connected with the roads at all, as far as I know.  In fact there are only two or three inspectors that are connected with the roads.  Considering that the Dáil provides a very large sum of money for road administration all over the country I think there are nothing like enough engineering inspectors to look after that work.  When I say that I am not by any means trying to disparage the county officials responsible for road work, but I think the Department could well afford to lose some of its ordinary inspectors of <Col N="754" /> administration and put some of them on to the roads.</P>
    <P>Ordered: That progress be reported.</P>
    <P>The Dáil went out of Committee.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again on Tuesday, 12th July.</P>
