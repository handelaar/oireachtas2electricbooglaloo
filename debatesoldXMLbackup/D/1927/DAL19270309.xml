      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that since 1910-11 the nominal grant of four shillings a week in aid of the cost of maintenance of each pauper lunatic paid to County Councils out of State funds, under the provisions of Section 58 (2) (c) of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, has been abated, owing to the income of the fund out of which such grants are paid being insufficient to meet the claims in full, and, if so, if he will state (a) what proportion the recoupments made during 1925-26 in respect of the preceding year 1924-25 bear to the total claims; (b) what was the average weekly cost of maintenance of a pauper lunatic in the combined Irish asylums during 1908-9, and what weekly sum was recouped to the County Councils during the subsequent year out of State funds in respect of each such pauper lunatic; what proportion did the sum recouped bear to the total cost of maintenance; (c) what was the average weekly cost of maintenance of a pauper lunatic in the combined mental hospitals of the Saorstát during 1924-25, and what weekly sum was recouped to the County Councils during 1925-26 out of State funds in respect of each such pauper lunatic; what proportion did the sum recouped bear to the total cost of maintenance; (d) what proportion of the total income during 1924-25 of the fund out of which pauper lunatic grants are payable was represented by the proceeds of publicans' licences; and (e) whether a reduction in the number of publicans' licences throughout the <Col N="1532" /> Saorstát will increase the amount of the poor rate leviable by each County Council by reducing the income of the fund out of which the various grants to County Councils specified in Section 58 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, are paid.</P>

      <P>The reply to this question is a very long one and perhaps the Deputy would be satisfied if I were to send him a copy of it and also have it published in the Official Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied.</P>
      <P>Following is the reply:&mdash;The sums payable to the County Borough Councils out of the Local Taxation Account under Section 58 (2) (c) of the Local Government Act, 1898, in respect of patients in mental hospitals have, since the financial year 1910-11, been proportionately abated in pursuance of the provisions of Section 58 (5) of the Act, as the amount paid to the Local Taxation Account under Section 58 (1) of the Act has been insufficient to meet the sums payable thereout.</P>
      <P>(a)  The total claims in respect of the year 1924-25 amounted to £158,467 19s. 3d.  The total payments amounted to £130,060 8s. 10d. or 82.07365 per cent. of the claims.</P>
      <P>(b)  The average weekly cost of maintenance per patient in the combined Irish district asylums during 1908-9 was 8s. 11d.  The weekly sum recouped to the County Councils for each patient in a district asylum for whom the net charge upon the Council (after deducting any amount received by them for maintenance from any other sources other than poor rate) was equal to or exceeded 4s. a week throughout the period of maintenance for which the sum was calculated was a sum of one-half of such net charge or 4s., whichever was the least (see Section 58 (2) (c) of the Act of 1898). In the case of a patient in respect of whom the maximum grant of 4s. was paid this was 44.9 per cent. of the average weekly cost, and generally speaking the maximum grant was payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  The average weekly cost of maintenance <Col N="1533" /> in the combined district mental hospitals of the Saorstát during 1924-25 was 19s. 7d.  The grant was calculated in the manner described above on the basis of a maximum of 4s., but the total sum payable to each Council was, as already stated, abated to 82.07365 per cent. in pursuance of Section 58 (5) of the Act.  In the case of a patient in respect of whom the maximum grant was paid, the grant, after abatement, was equivalent to 16.8 per cent. of the average weekly cost.</P>
    <P>(d)  The amounts payable to the Local Taxation Account in respect of the duties on licences for the sale of intoxicating liquor were standardised under the Finance (1909-10) Act 1910, and were made equal to the proceeds of those duties in 1908-9.  The amount for the whole of Ireland for that year was £166,197 and the amount proper to the Saorstát has been determined by Order under Section 9 of the Adaptation of Enactments Act, 1922, to be £119,449 19s. 10d.  The total net income of the grant for 1925-26 (out of which the grant towards the maintenance of 1924-25 mental hospital patients was paid) amounted to £206,161 8s. 6d.  The proceeds of publicans' licences, being a fixed sum of £119,449 19s. 10d. for the purposes of the Licence Duty Grant, represents 57.9 per cent. of the total grant.</P>
    <P>(e)  As the amount payable to the Local Taxation Account in respect of the duties on licences for the sale of intoxicating liquor has since the passage of the Finance Act, 1910, been a fixed sum of £166,197 for the whole of Ireland and for the Saorstát £119,449 19s. 10d., there is clearly no question of a reduction in the number of publicans' licences throughout the Saorstát reducing the income of the licence duty grant payable to County and County Borough Councils under Section 58 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Dáil sit later than 9 o'clock, and that the motion for the adjournment be taken not later than 10.30.  We hope to be able to complete the Liquor Bill to-day and propose to take after that the Committee Stage of the Land Bill. If that be not concluded at 9.30 I propose to take Deputy Connor Hogan's motion at that hour.  On to-morrow I propose to take the Vote on Account. It will be understood that the Central Fund Bill would have to pass in this House in time to allow for its consideration by the Seanad.  It is not proposed to discuss the Estimates in this Session.  We propose to take the Budget after the Easter adjournment and to have the Finance Bill passed into law.  The Order of Business, therefore, would be to take the Budget after the Easter adjournment and the Estimates after the General Election.  I propose to announce at the end of each week the programme for the ensuing week until the dissolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the President's proposal to appropriate my time.  Under Standing Orders private Deputies are given one and a half hours on Wednesday evenings, but now the President proposes to curtail me to one hour.  I am not prepared to give a second off the time to which I am entitled, and I must have the full hour and a half or nothing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support Deputy Connor Hogan.  It is unfair to private Deputies to have their motions continually postponed, and then to give them time with an &ldquo;if&rdquo; tacked on to it.  I think that some definite time should be fixed for the taking of the Deputy's motion.  What I would <Col N="1537" /> suggest is that it be taken after the tea adjournment this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy must have misunderstood me. What I said was that we would take Deputy Connor Hogan's motion at 9.30.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Even so, that reduces the Deputy's time by half an hour.  He is entitled to one and a half hours under Standing Orders.  I think that an earlier hour should be fixed for the taking of the motion.  The President stated that it was not proposed to discuss the Estimates until after the General Election.  Of course that will not interfere with the right of any Deputy to raise on the Vote on Account any matter in connection with the Estimates which appears urgent and necessary to him.  The Estimates may not be discussed, but the Vote on Account gives the opportunity to discuss certain matters which it may seem necessary to discuss in connection with the Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It is scarcely necessary for me to answer the Deputy's last point.  That has been the practice. What I said was that it was not proposed to take the Estimates after the Easter adjournment, but to leave the consideration of them over until after the General Election.  I hope I shall not be misunderstood when I say that private Deputies in this House have greater consideration than in any other assembly in the world&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and they are certainly not going to dominate the Government here.  As far as being entitled is concerned, let us understand what is meant by that.  It is laid down in the Standing Orders that time is allowed for private Deputies, but that the Government may take that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not proposing to take time without leave.  The question is, whether Government business is more important than that of <Col N="1538" /> private Deputies.  Every possible consideration has been shown to private Deputies in this House, much more than that shown to private members in any other assembly in the world.  The Deputy can look up the records of other assemblies and see if I am wrong in that.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>We just happen to be a little more considerate towards private Deputies, and the consequence is that they have exalted opinions of themselves&mdash;certain of them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the President who said that he is entitled to claim that greater facilities have been afforded to private Deputies in this House than elsewhere, I would point out that that is because we are a much smaller assembly.  We have not the overwhelming amount of business that there is to be attended to in Great Britain, and while they have a House composed of 600 members we have only a membership of about 100.  On Wednesday last, when the President mentioned this matter, I said that I was quite willing to afford private Deputies' time for the convenience of the Government.  I was approached by the Parliamentary Secretary and readily accommodated him.  I was not so disposed to give up Friday, but on second thoughts I decided that I would not make a protest.  On Friday evening I did convey to the President, in a most emphatic manner, that I wanted my full time to discuss the motion to-day.  The motion deals with a most important matter to my constituents, and I claim that we should have full time to discuss it.  I think that an hour and a half would be little enough for its discussion.  I protest against the imperious way in which the President has appropriated my time without consulting me.  It was only when I came into the House this afternoon that word was conveyed to me by the Parliamentary Secretary that I was only being given an hour for the discussion of my motion.  I was not even asked if I were willing to agree to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HOGAN (Clare)</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the President that the motion to be moved by Deputy Hogan is one deserving of much longer consideration <Col N="1540" /> than the President appears to be willing to give it this evening.  The matter is one that has behind it a large volume of public opinion, and it is desirable to have it settled definitely.  The Government has one opinion on the matter, while a large section of the public holds quite other opinions.  It is only right that an opportunity should be given for a full discussion.  I would ask the President to extend the time that he has offered for a discussion on the motion so that Deputy Hogan and others anxious to speak on it may have a full opportunity of doing so.</P>

      <P>On the question of private Deputies, if one were to take a census of the number of them in the House you would probably get the figure of 90.  It is probable that about 90 meetings of the Dáil are held during the year, so that if we were to give to every private Deputy the rights which are so imperiously demanded by Deputy Hogan it would mean that every private Deputy would be entitled to one hour on every day that the Dáil sits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the President that our Standing Orders do give private Deputies greater facilities than they have elsewhere.  I do say, however, that these rights have not been abused by private Deputies by attempting to obstruct Government business or by putting down frivolous motions.  Private Deputies have tried to play the game, and I think the Government should play the game by them.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might say a word on this, as the business that appears to be moving out Deputy Hogan's motion is the Land Bill.  The Land Bill has been before the Dáil for three months.  It was debated <Col N="1541" /> here on Second Reading and sent to a Select Committee.  It then came back to the Dáil, and the position was that we had two Second Reading debates.  Then there was a suggestion to refer it to a Special Committee. Generally speaking, there was an amount of obstruction in connection with the Land Bill, which later went to a Special Committee.  Before the Special Committee the Bill was again debated.  Between 70 and 80 amendments were discussed before that Special Committee, and at length 40 or 50 were agreed to.  Now we are coming again with the Land Bill to the Dáil, having had two Second Readings on it, and after 60 or 70 amendments in connection with it have been debated before the Special Committee. That is really the reason for taking Deputy Hogan's time.  I say that we have not got the amount of co-operation that we were told would be forthcoming when the plea was being made to allow the Bill to go before the Special Committee.</P>

      <P>With regard to the Minister's statement that there has been deliberate obstruction in connection with the Land Bill, I want to say that is absolutely untrue.  In that connection the Minister himself is not without fault.  The Bill, as drafted originally, did not meet all the requirements of the situation, and it was very much improved as a result of the Select Committee.  As far as this Party is concerned, if there has been any deliberate obstruction, it was not in accordance with our intentions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>When the President was dealing with the question of the public business for the remainder of the session yesterday he indicated that it was his wish that the House should meet on Monday at 5 o'clock.  Speaking to-day he indicated he is going to make a week-to-week statement regarding Government measures to be brought forward until the Dissolution. I can assure the President, on behalf of the Deputies on this side of the House, that if he is anxious to take such steps as will lead him towards an appeal to the country at an early date, we will not do anything to prevent him taking such a decision.  We are quite ready whenever he is willing.  It is, however, the duty of the President to let us know now, so far as he can, what the Government's programme is, rather than let us know it from week to week. Are we to meet next Monday evening at 5 o'clock?  No definite decision was taken on that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>We presume that a Bill of this kind will be very technical. It has not yet been circulated; nevertheless, we are expected to come into the Dáil on the occasion of the first sitting next week to pass judgment, on <Col N="1547" /> Second Reading, on the measure without having had a proper opportunity of considering it.  We are having enough of these rushed measures that usually have to be reconsidered and redrafted time after time.  In connection with practically every Bill that was brought in here there have been two Second Readings, because enough consideration has not been given the first time to the Bill following its introduction.</P>
      <P>It is unfair to Deputies to expect them to pass judgment on the principle of a technical Bill, such as we presume the Electricity (Supply) Bill to be, perhaps twenty-four hours after the Bill comes into their hands.  Deputies are not being given sufficient time to consider the whole problem in its proper aspect; neither Deputies nor the people in the country are being given sufficient time.  The Minister is not at all reasonable in expecting us to do the almost impossible.</P>

      <P>I would like to join in the protest made by Deputy Baxter, and to appeal to the Minister not to fix the Second Reading as early as next Monday, as is obviously his intention. This Bill not be circulated before Friday, and there will be really no opportunity of studying it in the interval in a way a Bill of its importance ought to be studied, so that Deputies would be able to make a proper contribution to the Second Reading debate.  I would ask the Minister not to insist on fixing the Second Reading for next Monday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. BYRNE Mr. A. BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I am told that what was suggested first was that a Second Reading speech would be made on the introduction of the Bill or that a statement would be made by the Minister that would give these experts an <Col N="1548" /> opportunity of knowing what it contained. They complain that if this measure is rushed in the way now suggested they will have no time to consider what is in the Bill, nor to call a meeting of their members to consider it and to make suggestions that might be very useful and helpful to the Dáil as well as to the Minister.  In view of that I think that the Minister ought to extend the time for at least another three or four days.  He admits he made a statement leading them to believe they would get time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument should be rather in the direction that more than the usual time will be required between Second Reading and the Committee Stage.  Most people will admit that a Supply Bill is necessary, and the Second Reading of the Bill will go through, but the vital thing will be to decide the details.  It seems to me that the longer period will be necessary between the Second Reading and the Committee Stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand Deputy Byrne's point, if he has been properly advised by the Electricity Supply Association.  My whole discussion with them on this business was on the lines that I could tolerate no interference from them on the principle of the Bill, but that they might be of help, and I thought would be of help on the details.  That being the whole line of our discussion, I fail to see how anybody with the minimum of common sense could take from my words the meaning that I would give sufficient time between First Stage and Second Stage to enable the Electricity Supply Association to forward anything to me.  I feel somewhat impressed by what Deputy O'Connell has said and the way he has said it, but I turn to Deputy Baxter and I find all this hypothetical nonsense he has talked about the Bill&mdash;that he has not got it, that he does not know what is in it, and that he does not know if he will ever be able to master what is in it, on account of the date that is proposed <Col N="1549" /> for Second Reading.  Then he talked of Bills being re-committed and of Second Readings having to be taken more than once.  I know of one great case of that where the Minister for Lands and Agriculture was, unfortunately, weak enough to give in to demands made by the Farmers' Party, and we see as the result the discussion that is to take place immediately.  As far as this Second Reading is concerned, provided we meet on Monday, I would like, at any rate in order to clear the ground, to have an opportunity of making my own statement on the Bill on Monday evening.  I doubt very much if there will be any time for it on Monday evening, and of course if what the President has spoken of to-day happens, if the Vote on Account and certain Central Fund Bill proposals were finished this week, there would be, presumably, no great necessity to meet on Monday, and the Second Reading would be taken on Tuesday.  But I would like to put the Bill down for Monday, with the understanding that if that is done the only thing that will be taken will be my own speech.  As to the principle of the Bill, I do not care how technical it is found to be in its details, the general principle of the Bill will be very easily grasped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>There are obvious advantages in hearing the Minister's statement on the Bill as soon as possible, and if there is a definite understanding that the adjournment shall be taken after the Minister's speech, so that we may have an opportunity of reading the Press reports and of being able to study it in even greater detail before we take a division on the Second Stage, I think that that course might be taken.  But there is one point of great importance that arises on the Second Reading, that is the question as to whether this is to be a State undertaking or whether it is to be leased or otherwise handed over to private capital.  That is a question of principle, and I do not think we ought to be asked to take a decision on that point until we have had ample time not only to study the Bill but to study precedents elsewhere, precedents in Canada <Col N="1550" /> and in other countries in Europe which have hydro-electric power.  So that while I would agree to having the Minister's statement on Monday, I would suggest that the division should not be rushed.</P>

      <P>I understand that a number of country Deputies will be absent, some of whom take a certain amount of interest in this Electricity Bill, and in my opinion it is a Bill that may be of very considerable importance to the rural community.  I think they ought to have an opportunity of being here and of hearing the Minister's statement, and if necessary asking him questions in regard to it.  I do not understand these references to the Land Bill.  The Farmers' Party are not in any way responsible for the reference back of the Land Bill.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation.  Let us clear up this point.  I introduced the Land Bill and got it a Second Reading, and then, at the request of the Farmers' Party, in view of the fact that there were certain amendments which they could not move to the Bill, I agreed to refer it to a Select Committee.</P>

      <P>A good deal was said on this amendment last evening and, owing to the amount of time wasted by the Government to-day, I do not propose to delay the Dáil very long.  The object of the amendment is to give an hour-and-a-half extra to clubs on a Saturday night.  For that hour-and-a-half I am asking two hours less in the morning.  I think the Minister would be wise, especially in view of the General Election, to facilitate clubs and their members by giving this extra period on Saturday night.  Such facilities would not be abused, as clubs, particularly those catering for the working classes, are carried out in a most respectable way.  I do not, of course, know whether there are abuses in connection with clubs where the capitalists resort.  I have experience of workers' clubs and I know there is no abuse there.  In the first place, the members have not sufficient money to spend on a Saturday night, and they pass their time generally in a game of billiards or cards, so that if these facilities are not given on a Saturday night I think there would be great injustice.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In sub-section (1), (c), page 21, line 59, and page 22, line 1, to delete the words &lsquo;or between the hours of three o'clock and six o'clock in the afternoon,&rsquo; and in line 2, page 22, to delete the word &lsquo;nine&rsquo; and substitute therefor the word &lsquo;ten.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am sure that the Minister will agree at least, to this amendment.  A proposal to extend the hours from nine to ten should get general support.  It is a well-known fact that the members of clubs, whether they pay £20 a year, £1 or year, or, as in the case of workers' clubs, threepence or fourpence a week, go out on a Sunday and enjoy themselves in the open, and generally in the evening, having had their tea at home, go to their club to meet their friends and enjoy themselves. When people get together and talk to each other it is generally good for their education, and it is much better for them to meet and discuss things, even politics, than to sit idly by themselves and not meet their friends and exchange views.  It is well known that debating societies, which are generally attached to clubs, have produced much better men even than some of our distinguished colleagues.  By giving this extra hour on Sundays you will be giving people who have been out all day a chance of meeting, and if they succeed in getting a drink between these hours, it will put them in fairly good form.  I have experience of visiting various clubs and I have never seen any abuses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be said that in Dublin, Athlone, Mullingar, or Longford there are clubs which are not run properly, but I have been in clubs in these towns and I always found them run in an orderly way.  Not alone is the amendment in the interest of working men's clubs but it is in the interest of all clubs.  I would like to ask the Minister whether clubs, such as the Kildare Street Club, will have to keep the same hours as ordinary clubs, or will they be allowed to carry on as they like.  If some clubs, especially those to which the aristocrats and lords of the land <Col N="1555" /> resort, are given special privileges I do not see why other clubs which cater for the worker or for the middleman cannot enjoy the same facilities.  Many of these clubs in large towns have a membership of from 400 to 500, and if the Minister does not give them these small facilities it will mean that these people, who would probably be able to control a thousand votes, will vote against the Government at the next election.  This amendment is, therefore, really in the interests of the Minister and the Government, and I am asking them to accept it.  In all fair play, I think that clubs are entitled to an extra hour on a Sunday as compared with publichouses.</P>

      <P>Since the Minister for Justice is adopting a dog-in-the-manger policy, it is hardly worth while for a Deputy to go to the trouble of drafting amendments to any Bill.  The Minister treats these amendments as farcical.  I do not think it is good policy for the Minister to treat the members of those clubs as nonentities.  We should at least have an explanation from the Minister as to what he thinks about these clubs. Does he think they should be licensed at all?  If he is returned at the election, will he deprive all clubs of licences? What is the ground of his objection to giving an extra hour and a half on Saturday nights to clubs?  He will be looking for votes from the members of those clubs, and now he has an opportunity of doing something for them. I do not think it is right that a member of this House should be treated with contempt, no matter what his position in life.  I am only a worker, but I refuse to be treated in the manner that the Minister for Justice has treated me.  I have as good right to get an explanation as to why my amendment is not accepted as any other Deputy.  I was returned by Westmeath and Longford on two occasions.  If I had been a supporter of the Minister for Justice since 1922 I might get better treatment. The Government is the servant of the people and should act in accordance with the wishes of the people.  An employee acts in accordance with the wishes of the employer, but in this case the people are being made the servants. I wonder would a capitalist Deputy who moved the amendment I am moving be treated with contempt.  I object to being treated with contempt by any person.  I am as good as anybody in the State, and the people I represent are as good as any other citizens.  On their behalf, I put forward the amendment, and I do not care twopence whether the Minister for Justice explains why he rejects this amendment or not.  If he refuses to give an explanation, <Col N="1557" /> it only shows his own ignorance.</P>

    <P>This amendment deals with the period of summer time.  In summer people who go for long walks may be detained by friends, and they may require some refreshment.  If the Minister <Col N="1558" /> does not accept this amendment, I trust he will agree to the same hours for the clubs as he has agreed to in connection with the bona fide traffic.  If you fix ten o'clock as the closing hour in summer time, it really means that the clubs will be closed at 8.35 Irish time. At present, we are twenty-five minutes before sun time and in summer time we will be one hour and twenty-five minutes before it.  You will find in the afternoons during summer very few members in these clubs.  But when the day's work is over men adjourn to the club.  That is about 8.30 or 9 o'clock. At 10 o'clock the bar is to be closed down.  Men who work according to Irish time, and who have to walk a mile or two miles in to the club, will not be able to get a drink.  I hope the Minister will at least allow the clubs the same privileges as the licensed houses.</P>

      <P>The general principle that has been followed throughout in connection with clubs is on weekdays to keep the club hours for the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor identical with the hours for the ordinary publichouses.  In so far as there has been any alteration in the hours for the publichouses in rural areas in summer time&mdash;a question of, I think, half an hour&mdash;I am prepared to make that alteration on Report Stage to cover the case of clubs, but I am not prepared throughout the week to provide any different hours for clubs from those which obtain in regard to publichouses. There is a difference in the Bill in regard to Sunday, but on the week days I adhere to the recommendations of the Intoxicating Liquor Commission that the hours for clubs be kept the same as the hours for publichouses.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Amendment 95 not moved.</P>
      <P>The following amendment was agreed to:&mdash;</P>
      <P>96.&mdash;In sub-section (3), lines 51 and 52, to delete the words &ldquo;Good Friday&rdquo; and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;St. Patrick's Day&rdquo; (Mr. Dolan).</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move amendment 97:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (3) (b) (i), line 55, <Col N="1559" /> to delete the words &ldquo;ten o'clock in the morning&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;twelve noon,&rdquo; and in line 56 to delete the words &ldquo;half-past nine&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;eleven.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder would the Minister during the period of summer time agree to give the clubs a little extra time on Saturday night?  The amendment asks for one and a half hours extra.  You will not find many members in clubs looking for intoxicating liquor on a Saturday morning.  In fact, you will not find any members in clubs on a Saturday morning in summer time unless persons who come within the category of drones. The only time on Saturdays that you will find many members in clubs is at night.  If this amendment is accepted it will not mean that people will adjourn from the publichouse half intoxicated and go to the clubs and get fully intoxicated.  That is a thing that will not happen, and I am speaking from my experience of clubs that I have visited.</P>
    <P>During summer time, on a Saturday night when men receive their pay, they go home and give their wives their allowance for housekeeping.  The wife may have to go out and do some shopping, with the result that it is 8.30 or 9 o'clock before she returns.  After his hard day's work such a man might want a drink, but by that time the publichouses are closed, and now he cannot get a drink in his club.  I hold that every man who wishes to have a drink should have the privilege of getting it.  It is not the best way to promote temperance to force our opinion down the throats of other people.  I do not believe in any man or woman taking too much drink, and I would certainly support any legislation the Government brought forward from a real temperance point of view.  But closing the clubs at 9.30 on Saturdays in summer time is not going the right way to promote temperance.  It will mean that if a man cannot get a drink he will get a &ldquo;half-pint&rdquo; somewhere on the sly, and that will mean that he will eventually become a drunkard.  I think the Minister should give some little extra time to clubs on Saturday <Col N="1560" /> night beyond the hour for the closing of publichouses.  I would be prepared to accept a closing at 10 o'clock, which would mean an extra half hour.  A large number of traders, artisans and professional men who work very hard on a Saturday visit their clubs in the evening, and after half-past nine they cannot get a drink if they require it. I do not think it is right for any Government to stand fast by that regulation. I maintain that it is not the best way to promote temperance.</P>

      <P>The Minister has already accepted the principle.  He has stated on other amendments that he would delete the split hours as they would mean too much duty for the Gárdaí to perform.  The Minister stated that he was putting forward an amendment to the effect that bona fide travellers could be served on Sunday between 1 and 7 o'clock in winter and 1 and 8 o'clock in the summer time.  If that is to <Col N="1561" /> be the case for the publichouses why should not the same hours be given to the clubs?  The section as it stands specifies that there shall be a break in the hours, and I want to get the same terms for clubs as the Minister is prepared to give to publichouses.  He has agreed to give the same terms as far as Saturday is concerned and as far as any extension of time during the period of summer time on Sunday is concerned, but I cannot understand why he holds fast to the split hours in one case while he does not hold to them for the licensed houses.  I hold that whatever terms are given to the publichouses should also be given to the clubs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The analogy that the Deputy seeks to draw for the purposes of Sunday between the clubs and the ordinary licensed houses does not, in fact, exist.  In one case you are dealing with the bona fide traffic, but the bona fide traffic does not apply at all in the matter of clubs.  While I do say that it would be a matter of extreme difficulty for the police to administer the two-hours close down in bona fide traffic on Sunday afternoon, there is not the same difficulty with regard to clubs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clubs are situated, for the most part, in towns, and it is a simple matter for the police to see that this two hours' break in the day, in the matter of the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor, does in fact take place.  The recommendation of the Bill with regard to the hours is from 1 to 3, and from 6 to 9.  I consider those hours reasonable. If there is a necessity for reviewing them at all, it would be perhaps in connection with clubs connected with golf or outdoor games of that kind. There might be some need not so much for extension as adjustment of the hours.  I am looking into that matter and possibly I will have an amendment bearing on it on the Report Stage.  But taking the ordinary club, the club that exists here in the city or in the provincial towns through the country, the hours from 1 o'clock to 3 o'clock, and 6 o'clock to 9, seem to me adequate for Sunday, and there is not the same difficulty about enforcing the short break <Col N="1562" /> as there would be in the enforcing of a break in the bona fide traffic which applies to all the licensed houses in the country.  I do not propose to accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to raise, on the section, the question to which the Minister has referred.  Perhaps I can do it now, with advantage. I have not put down any amendment to the section because of various administrative difficulties which I can foresee. I hold no brief for any particular club, but I cannot help thinking that we are not legislating in this Bill, and have not legislated in the past, in a very wise and intelligent way in reference to the clubs.  I draw definite lines of distinction between different kinds of clubs. As far as what I may call the social club is concerned, I do not see that there is any case for the social club having any difference in its legislation as compared with the legislation that exists for ordinary places.  But I do not think that our legislation has been at all wise with regard to the clubs that the Minister has just referred to &mdash;athletic clubs that exist for outdoor sports; I think it has tended to lead to an increase in the output of the bar in these clubs rather than to sport.  I certainly would not plead for any extension of the number of hours in which the club bars should be opened, but I do not think that legislation permits of the opening of those bars at the times most suited to the convenience and the good of the club members.  I cannot help thinking that it should be possible to have a different kind of licence for an athletic club.  It certainly does not require to be open after dark.  It does not require to be open in the winter until 9 o'clock at night.  That is only encouraging drinking.  In the winter time I do not see any real use of the bar being open at a time when it is not possible for sport to be played.  I think it should be possible to institute a kind of licence which would more or less follow the light, so that the club could be opened for a member who enjoys his sport and who perhaps wants to take his meal after his sport is finished and have, if he so desires it, some intoxicating liquor with his meal. <Col N="1563" /> In the summer, that time frequently runs until well after 10 o'clock.  I admit that a difficulty arises.  There seems to be no occasion for a club bar being open except round and about the regular times for members taking their meals.  I daresay the Minister has given this very careful consideration. I hope he will give it more consideration. There are difficulties, but I cannot think that they are insuperable.</P>

      <P>Deputy Thrift was clear that there was perhaps no strong case for any difference between the hours of a social club and the hours of the licensed houses in the area in which the club is situated.  This is not entirely a question of straight lines. There is a certain amount of light and shade in connection with the question of golf clubs, just as in connection with many other questions.  One does hear, from time to time, suggestions that certain golf clubs exist and survive by reason of having a substantial proportion of persons who play golf very seldom, but who join the club and pay their annual subscription, and are, in fact, mere social members of the club rather than enthusiastic golfers.  That is one side of the matter.  Another side of the matter is that one does hear from time to time of particular golf clubs where, undoubtedly, consumption of intoxicating liquor is allowed by a weak or incompetent committee to go to extremes, where there is excess, abuse and so on.  If golf clubs want a statutory recognition, distinguishing them from any other club&mdash;social clubs in the towns, ex-servicemen's clubs, working men's clubs, university clubs, and so on&mdash;if they want statutory recognition as clubs existing for the purpose of outdoor games, then they had better keep the outdoor game aspect of their existence well in the forefront and see that it is not obscured and crowded out by the membership that is a social membership rather than a golf-playing membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that this question of the bar receipts is a very vital matter for some golf clubs, that golf clubs are able to show a credit balance at the end of the year which would be a substantial debit balance but for the receipts from <Col N="1564" /> the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor.  That may not be the whole story.  The whole story may be, possibly, that there are too many of them and that because there are too many of them then you have a situation in which clubs are ekeing out an existence by reason of their substantial bar receipts from the sale of intoxicating liquor.  I have had a deputation representative of golf clubs that put up a certain case, the kind of case that Deputy Thrift puts up, that their clubs are existing for the purpose of an outdoor game.  If one could be quite sure that they were that, and only that, the matter would be simpler, and it would be easier to provide for them a separate statutory recognition.  But, with regard to certain of the golf clubs, one does hear that the social side and the drinking side is at least as much in evidence as the golf side, and it is facts of that kind which render it difficult to legislate for the golf club as such. If it were simply to mean that a certain class of people to whom the annual subscription was a small matter could have the amenities of the golf club and the special hours of the golf club at that small cost, then the matter becomes difficult and you verge on a line of legislation that is open to criticism as being class legislation.  Wealthy people who can afford to pay an annual subscription to a golf club can have special hours for the consumption of intoxicating liquor and the amenities of the club premises.  I am, in fact, examining the matter in consultation and contact with a representative deputation from the golf clubs which came to see me.  I am speaking now merely for the purpose of showing that it is not entirely a question of straight lines.  There is another side to this athletic aspect which Deputy Thrift has stressed.</P>
    <P>There are some golf clubs that it would be straining a point to claim for them that they tended in any serious way to promote athletics.  It might be even suggested that in certain of their sideshows and by-products they were militating against the full development of a man's athletic prowess and vigour. I do not want to say the last word on this question of golf clubs on this stage <Col N="1565" /> of the Bill.  It might be that I will be in a position to bring up an amendment for discussion on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I just want to satisfy Deputy Lyons's mind that as far as the report of the Liquor Commission is concerned they were perfectly agreed that there was to be no class legislation, and he has no right now to suggest that there are certain clubs that will get preferential treatment. The Commission were quite clear that all clubs must be put under the same rule.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I should say it was better for us that there was no evidence given before the Commission with regard to the golf clubs.  I do say, as far as the three or four golf clubs with which I am or have been connected, that there never was anything in the nature of drinking connected with them.  As regards those clubs that do conduct themselves in a respectable way and do not put forward that social aspect, or drinking aspect, that the Minister referred to, I think it is really hard on people who require some refreshment at, perhaps, a later hour than others, if some consideration should not be given to them.  I quite admit the difficulty that the Minister is in.  I can see that it must be a very serious thing if you make any distinction whatever in favour of any class of club.  I hope he will be able to arrive at some decision that will please the members of the golf clubs, because I know at the present time they are not quite satisfied that they are being treated fairly in the matter.  That is, the clubs that are being run on proper lines.</P>

      <P>I do not think I used the term golf club.  Although I was thinking of golf clubs, I was also thinking of other athletic clubs that have licensed bars.  I do not think what I said is open to the imputation that what I was urging was anything like class legislation.  I was rather urging a restriction of hours, that they should not be open as long as others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the fact that they are open so long leads to the abuses which the Minister has mentioned, and that there are people who join certain clubs simply <Col N="1566" /> for the convenience of approaching the bar.  I think it would not be privileged class legislation at all if the opening of the bars was restricted to definite hours, hours very much less in number but much more suited to the convenience of the members.  I was glad to hear from the Minister that he was still continuing his reflections on that point, and I have no doubt they will lead to something useful.</P>

      <P>A deputation from golf clubs came to me to discuss the hours in the Bill.  The discussion really came down finally to the question of the hours on Sunday.  I am prepared to consider as I said, not necessarily an extension so much as an adjustment of hours that might be more satisfactory to them.  If I bring in an amendment on the Report Stage it will be an amendment that will apply to clubs that exist for the purpose of outdoor games.  It would apply to, perhaps, football clubs and golf clubs, and clubs of that kind, but the hours would be not necessarily an extension so much as an adjustment of the existing hours.</P>

      <P>Would the Deputy try to understand me?  I think he does understand me.  The amendment that I outlined in connection with golf clubs <Col N="1567" /> would be not necessarily an extension of the hours under the Bill so much as an adjustment, an alteration, of those hours.  It is not a question of doing away with any break in the day, but it is a question of fixing hours that might be considered more satisfactory for the purposes of a particular game.  That has nothing whatever to do with the question of ordinary social town clubs. On the question of clubs in towns, I adhere to the hours in the Bill, 1 to 3 and 6 to 9.</P>
      <P>What the Deputy is asking by his amendment is that I add three hours to that by doing away with the break between 3 and 6.  I will not do that.</P>

      <P>I hold that the clubs in provincial towns conduct their business properly.  If they did not do that the superintendent of the Civic Guards would object to the renewal of their licences.  By closing clubs between the hours of 3 and 6, I hold that you are going to impose extra duties on the Guards.  If they go to a club premises a few minutes after 3 o'clock on a Sunday and find soiled glasses on the counter, the probability is that they will institute a prosecution, and as their word will be taken in preference to that of the secretary of the club, a conviction is likely to be recorded and the club licence endorsed.  I appreciate the services of the Civic Guards, and I know they would not go into a witness box and swear what they did not believe to be correct, but the fact will be that their evidence will be taken in preference to that of the club secretary, who will also be stating what is correct.  I think that the Minister should reconsider his decision and accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>On the general question, I think it would be advisable for the Minister to take steps to have this section amended on the Report Stage. The section as it stands will go a long way to ruin and destroy the clubs throughout the country.  I think it is <Col N="1568" /> unfair to deny, under this Bill, to members of clubs privileges which they have had up to this.  We legislate in this Dáil for the masses of the people, but I think that during the past five years it was only class legislation that was passed here.  One particular class in the community who have influence and finance can succeed in getting the Government to introduce legislation that they have their hearts on, notwithstanding the fact that that legislation may be detrimental to the interests of two-thirds of the citizens of the State. On the section I appeal to the Minister to extend the hours for opening on week days and Saturdays by at least one half hour, and on Sundays by one hour, and to reduce the split hours period from three hours to at least one and a half hours.  I think it would be quite sufficient if the Minister had to insist that clubs should only be closed on Sundays during the dinner hour. No one would object to that.  I think it is going too far, however, to have the bars in clubs closed for three hours or a Sunday afternoon.  One of the effects of that will be that if friends, having travelled a distance of ten or fourteen miles, come on a visit to a man who is a member of a club in a provincial town, he will not be able to bring them there to give them some refreshment.  The friends, of course, can go to a local publichouse to get some refreshment, being bona fide travellers, but as their guest is a local man he cannot go with them.  I think that is a great hardship on people, and that the Minister should give the concessions I ask.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Johnson, I beg to move amendment 100:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 51 to insert a new section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Any licence holder who employs any person under eighteen years of age other than an apprentice under indenture of apprenticeship made before the first day of February, 1927, <Col N="1569" /> in the bottling of intoxicating liquor or otherwise in such circumstances that the person has direct access to intoxicating liquor not contained in corked and sealed vessels shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof, in the case of a first offence, to a penalty not exceeding five pounds, and in the case of any subsequent offence, to a penalty not exceeding ten pounds, and in any case conviction shall be recorded on the licence of the licence holder so convicted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The object of the amendment is to prevent young boys under 18 being employed in or near where they can have access to intoxicating liquor.  As it is already an offence to sell drink to young people under the age of 18 years, unless it is in sealed bottles, I hope that the Minister will see the reasonableness of this amendment and accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Johnson were here to put this amendment I would ask him for further information about it.  I regret the cause of his absence.  I would like, for instance, to ask him whether it is, in fact, the practice of certain licence holders to adopt such methods of bottling as to prevent employees from getting access to the liquor and, if so, why those methods are not generally adopted.  The amendment speaks of &ldquo;Any licence holder who employs any person under eighteen years of age other than an apprentice under indenture of apprenticeship made before the first day of February, 1927, in the bottling of intoxicating liquor or otherwise in such circumstances that the person has direct access to intoxicating liquor not contained in corked and sealed vessels ...&rdquo;  Taking those two lines into consideration, are there, in fact, any licensed establishments in which the circumstances are otherwise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAlexanderNagle" hpid="Mr. NAGLE Mr. NAGLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NAGLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not really know the arguments in favour of this amendment&mdash;Deputy Johnson did not give them to us&mdash;but I imagine there might be some publichouses where the full-grown adults would do the bottling, and in that case it might not be necessary <Col N="1570" /> to send apprentices who would be under the age of eighteen years to places where they would be directly in touch with the liquor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy in whose name the amendment stands really aims at raising the age for apprenticeship, except in the case of apprentices who entered into their indentures prior to February, 1927, to eighteen years.  But instead of putting down an amendment to that effect and stating that in its simplicity, he puts down an amendment and says that shall be the case save where there is a set of circumstances which, so far as I know, do not exist in any publichouse in the country.  &ldquo;... in such circumstances that the person has direct access to intoxicating liquor not contained in corked and sealed vessels ...&rdquo;  I do not know that there is in the country a publichouse that would fulfil the conditions set out in those two lines of the Deputy's amendment, and, therefore, what it comes to is this: he would like the age of apprenticeship henceforth raised to eighteen years. But he has wrapped that around with a certain amount of verbiage.</P>
      <P>There may be a lot to be said for raising the age of apprenticeship to eighteen; but if there is, why not say the thing simply?  If the view is that persons under the age of eighteen ought not to be employed as bar-tenders, as assistants in a publichouse, I think we ought not to shrink from stating our belief in that proposition, and we should not proceed to enwrap it in a form of words which lays down that if, by any chance, circumstances exist which we know do not exist in any licensed house in the country, that then a person under eighteen may be employed. I am prepared to consider, on Report Stage, an amendment simply to the effect that the age of apprenticeship in the licensed trade be raised, but I would much sooner approach the thing along that line than along the lines set out to this amendment, because I think that is what this amendment comes to, in fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It amounts to this, that you may say to a trader: &ldquo;If your bottles are so corked and sealed that this youth of <Col N="1571" /> tender age could not possibly get access to the liquid that is contained in the bottles, then you will be within the law.&rdquo;  But if he could not get access to the liquid without breaking the seal, that means that every bottle of whiskey in the premises must be hermetically sealed, and, apparently, sealed after each time any of the contents has been taken out for clients.  I do not know that there is any publichouse in the country where, each time a bottle of whiskey has been used and a glass taken out of it, it is sealed again so that the attendant could not, by any chance, get access to the whiskey.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Nagle will consider this amendment he will see whether I am not, in fact, right about it.  Deputy Johnson suggests that no one shall be employed under eighteen unless certain conditions exist, knowing well those conditions do not exist and, in fact, for all practical purposes, cannot exist.  In the circumstances is it not better simply to stand pat on his proposition that a person under eighteen ought not to be employed as a bar tender in a publichouse? In other words, take the pearl out of the shell and let us have it as a simple amendment.  Let the Deputy and his Party express their belief in the view that a person under eighteen ought not to be employed behind the counter in a publichouse. In the meantime, I will look into the matter and consider with the Department of Industry and Commerce whether there is any objection to accepting it&mdash;any objection which we have not seen up to the present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAlexanderNagle" hpid="Mr. NAGLE Mr. NAGLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NAGLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that at a meeting of organised grocers' porters held a few weeks ago they unanimously passed a resolution stating it was undesirable that grocers should employ porters under the age of eighteen, and they asked the Labour Party to put forward an amendment to this Bill to cover that point.  This amendment, as the Minister has pointed out, includes apprentices.  I have no particular views in the matter, but some people think eighteen years would be a rather late age at which anyone should be bound as an apprentice.  I think if the words <Col N="1572" /> after &ldquo;apprenticeship&rdquo; on the third line&mdash;&ldquo;made before the first day of February, 1927&rdquo;&mdash;were deleted, that would cover the point and the amendment would apply only to grocers' porters. In that case there should be no objection on the part of the Minister.</P>
      <P>In the licensed trade anyone who accepts an apprentice accepts a certain moral responsibility for that apprentice during the years of his apprenticeship, but in the case of a young boy who would be employed, as the Minister indicated yesterday, perhaps temporarily, there is no moral responsibility for that boy's welfare on the part of the employer, and it is in order to prevent boys of tender years&mdash;boys under eighteen&mdash;being employed, perhaps casually&mdash;of course they could not be employed permanently under that age &mdash;in or around the place where they bottle intoxicating liquors the amendment is suggested.  I think that is one of the reasons for the amendment.  The deletion of the words &ldquo;made before the first day of February, 1927,&rdquo; would prevent the possibility, and perhaps the Minister will favourably consider the amendment in that light.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>

I will certainly look into the amendment between this and the next stage.</P>
      <P>As I suspect, this amendment is primarily a trade union rather than a temperance amendment.  It has a temperance aspect, and because it has it is relevant to the Bill and might, perhaps, appropriately be embodied in the Bill. But, clearly, the real driving force behind it is the desire that young people should not be employed as messengers by licensed traders&mdash;young people under the age of eighteen.  The idea is that no boy messengers should be employed in the bottling of intoxicating liquor, or otherwise; &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; would cover porters.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 51 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an amendment, No. 101, standing in my name, to insert a new section before Section 52.  I now see it would be impossible to ask the House to pass my new section along with Section 51. Therefore, what I now propose to do is, on Section 51, to give an outline of my proposals.  Section 51, as it at present stands, provides for the continuance and the issuing of wine retailers' off-licences by the Revenue Commissioners, and the only difference it makes in regard to the future granting of these licences from what has been the practice in the past is that the Revenue Commissioners may have absolute discretion in the matter and a right to refuse to grant these licences.  Of course, up to the present anyone who desired and who paid the necessary amount, which was a very small sum, was actually entitled to get one of these licences from the Revenue Commissioners. It is now proposed in this section that in future the Commissioners shall have a discretion.  I ask the Minister to bear in mind the recommendations outlined in the Intoxicating Liquor Commission's Report on this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is with those recommendations in mind that I have proposed my new section.  It proposes that in future no new licence may be granted by the Revenue Commissioners and, secondly, that where an application is made either for a new licence or the transfer or renewal of an old one, that application will have to come before the District Court, and the District Court will have to make an order to that effect. <Col N="1574" /> It is also proposed that notice of the application shall be given to the Superintendent of the Civic Guard.  The reasons for my proposed change are these: The Revenue Commissioners, it is true, will be given a discretion in future, but the Revenue Commissioners, I submit, will not be in the position of a judicial authority, certainly not in practice, and I am not certain whether they would even be in theory, that is, they will not have the means of ascertaining whether, by witnesses or otherwise, it is desirable to grant these licences, and I submit they would have no means, therefore, of exercising any judgment in regard to this general discretion that is being granted to them. Therefore, I think that the proposal to grant a discretion to the Revenue Commissioners is almost a waste of legislation and a waste of purpose.  In the view of the Commission the present wine retail off-licences, which number 714, should actually be abolished.  They went on to say: &ldquo;There is no effective official supervision of the granting of these licences nor limit to their number, and we believe that if our recommendations for the reduction of publichouse licences are carried into effect, these licences will probably increase in number&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the wine licences &mdash;&ldquo;and lead to considerable abuse.  In our opinion there is no property in such licences, and the question of compensation does not, therefore, arise. They are granted to any shopkeeper on application to the Excise authorities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Evidently to meet that recommendation it is suggested that the Commissioners should have a discretion.  I submit that that discretion does not actually meet the recommendation of the Commission, and that to meet that recommendation it will be necessary to make some such provision as I have suggested by way of a new section, namely, that in the first place it should not be lawful for the Commissioners to the case of granting new licences or grant any more new licences, and in transferring old ones that application should be made first of all to the District Court, where there would be an opportunity of hearing evidence, of coming to a conclusion upon such evidence <Col N="1575" /> and of exercising a discretion in the matter.  I think that the Commission must have been very much impressed by the evidence which they heard on this point from people like General Murphy, the Commissioner of the Civic Guard for the Dublin Metropolitan area, who actually stated that, in his opinion, these wine licences, which up to this had been given indiscriminately and to which there was no limit in point of numbers, lead to and actually increased secret drinking, and the very fact of reducing the number of publichouses may in itself lead to an increase of these licences and an abuse of the privilege.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister, if he is not prepared to accept the actual proposal I make, to consider whether his proposal will actually meet the case, and whether it would not be better to give a discretion in the matter of granting these licences to some court other than the Revenue Commissioners, if you can describe them as a court at all, that it would be better, in other words, to give a discretion to some authority which would be in a position to examine the state of affairs, to hear evidence, to come to a considered judgment on the evidence before it and exercise its discretion in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJamesCraig" hpid="Sir JAMES CRAIG Sir JAMES CRAIG">
      <NameTxt>Sir JAMES CRAIG</NameTxt>
      <P>A considerable volume of evidence was placed before the Commission with regard to these wine retailers' off-licences, and from practically every section that gave evidence strong objections were raised to the continuance of these licences.  It was proved that there were 714 of these wine licences, of which 300 were given to people who also had a spirit grocer's licence, and this complicated matters very much.  From the temperance section, the licensed trade, and even from the police, very strong evidence was given to show that there were far too many of these little hucksters' shops with the right to sell wine.  I did not pay a great deal of attention to the stress that was laid upon the fact that this was leading to drunkenness, because, on the whole, I do not think that the use of wine has at all the same tendency to lead to drunkenness that spirits and <Col N="1576" /> even porter have.  But at the same time there was a considerable amount of evidence given that, as far as women and girls in particular were concerned, a large amount of wine was consumed by women and girls, who could step into a small huckster's shop and get it. I quite appreciate the difficulties that the Minister has found in trying to get a clause to suit these cases, because chemists are involved in this matter as well.  They require a wine retailer's off-licence in order to retail the so-called medicated wines.  Evidence was given to us to the effect that there were very many chemists' shops throughout the city that were simply being used for the purpose of selling wine.  I want to dissociate myself from that, because, as far as my knowledge of the reputable chemists is concerned, I know that they do not keep anything but these so-called medicated wines.  There is a certain section of the public which is very keen on these wines.  They think if they are able to buy wine with which a little medicine is mixed they are getting better value than if they bought wine of a better quality for which they would pay a lower price.  I am not satisfied that the section goes far enough.  My chief objection to it is that it leaves to the Revenue Commissioners absolute authority to decide whether they will grant a licence in future or not.  From what I know of the Revenue Commissioners, they are not likely to refuse money, and I want to know whether any instructions will be given to them pointing out that it is not desirable that these licences should continue to be distributed broadcast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Redmond has stated, in the past it was simply a matter of the owner of any little huckster's shop applying for a licence and he would get it.  They could then keep quantities of port, sherry and other wines.  Will the Minister give an instruction to the Revenue Commissioners that it is undesirable that this traffic should be considered? The Commission did feel that if there was a reduction in the number of publichouses there would probably be an increase in the applications for these licences.  It felt also that it would be scarcely fair to the licensed trade, who are paying a much larger <Col N="1577" /> sum for the right to sell wine, to have these people distributing wine at a very small cost.</P>
    <P>The Commission certainly felt, too, that the jurisdiction should be changed, that in all these questions of granting licences for the sale either of wine or spirits the applicants should go before some judicial authority, and that it should not be enough simply to ask the Revenue Commissioners for a revenue ticket which would give them the right to sell these things.  I feel that the Minister has perhaps not gone as far as he ought, and although I say I appreciate the difficulty in which he finds himself with regard to chemists and grocers&mdash;because grocers require to have these wine retailers' off licences as part of their licences, and we had in view the abolition of these and the granting of some specific licence that would cover their case altogether&mdash;I hope that the Minister will assure the section of the public that is very keen on this matter that instructions will be given to the Revenue Commissioners that it is undesirable that these licences should continue to be issued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The position with regard to wine licences hitherto has been that there was power in the Revenue Commissioners to issue, without any certificate from a court, a licence to a person keeping a shop enabling that person to sell wine by retail for consumption off the premises. There are, as the Report of the Commission mentions, 714 such licences.  The ordinary spirit grocer usually has three distinct off-licences&mdash;one for spirits, one for beer and one for wine.  There are in the State 298 spirits off-licences, and we may assume that each of the holders of these has also a wine licence.  If we do assume that, that leaves 416 miscellaneous wine licences.  In the Bill the Revenue Commissioners are given a discretion not to renew any of these 416 licences and not to issue any licences to persons in shops not enjoying them heretofore.  Deputy Sir James Craig asks whether there is an intention to supplement that provision by an instruction to the Revenue Commissioners. It is my intention when the Bill becomes law to ask the Minister <Col N="1578" /> for Finance to give instructions that no wine licences shall be issued by the Revenue Commissioners to any person who does not hold a spirit grocer's licence.  The Revenue Commissioners are given by the Bill a discretion to refuse, and it was the intention to ask the Minister for Finance to give an instruction as to how that discretion would be exercised.</P>
      <P>I wanted simply to leave over any further action in the matter to the later Bill, to which I have referred from time to time, the Bill dealing with certain recommendations of the Commission not covered by this Bill.  Really, I think that for the present, and pending the introduction of such Bill, the provision here meets the case, but if there is any view to the contrary, I am willing to accept the principle of Deputy Redmond's amendment, and to look a little closer into the question of the exact form in which that would be embodied. There is nothing between the Deputy and myself as regards what is sought to be achieved.  It was my intention to strengthen this provision in the Bill by instructions from the Minister to the Revenue Commissioners, but I am willing to accept the principle of the amendment, subject to examination in the draftsman's office of the exact form.</P>

My view is that the former would be more acceptable to the Dáil, and would be more in accordance with general licensing legislation.  I might also mention that in the present wording of the section there is no ground suggested to the Commissioners on which they would be expected to exercise that discretion.

    <P>That for the purpose of any Act of the present session to amend the law relating to the occupation and ownership of land and for other purposes relating thereto it is expedient to authorise:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I.  The charge upon the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof of any sums required for meeting any insufficiency of the Land Bond <Col N="1581" /> Fund for the payment of interest on, and the redemption of any Land Bonds issued for the purposes of such Act of the present session; and</P>
    <P>II.  The payment out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas of</P>
    <P>(a)  sums to be expended by the Land Commission on the improvement of lands;</P>
    <P>(b)  interest and sinking fund upon any losses incurred by the Land Commission in the resale of (1)  Untenanted Land and (2) Land purchased by the Land Commission under the terms of such Act;</P>
    <P>(c)  in respect of lands vested in the Land Commission under Part III. of the Land Act, 1923, which are the subject of a declaration by the Land Commission,</P>
    <P>(1)  so much of any arrears of the annual sum payable by societies or bodies of trustees under Section 54 of the Land Act, 1923, due up to the date of the declaration as the Land Commission certifies should not be a charge upon the lands,</P>
    <P>(2)  interest and sinking fund until the date of resale upon so much of the purchase money as the Land Commission certifies should not be a charge upon the land.</P>
    <P>Under Section 1 of the Bill, the Minister for Finance is authorised to create and issue land bonds for the purposes of the proposed Act, and the sums required for meeting the interest and Sinking Fund payments on the bonds will be charged upon the Central Fund in the event of the money to credit of the Land Bond Fund being found at any time insufficient to meet these payments. The purposes not covered by the Land Act, 1923, for which additional land bonds will be created and issued are three in number.  Section 2 of the Bill deals with the first of these cases&mdash;compounded arrears of rent. Under Section 19 of the Land Act, 1923, the Land Commission had no power to fix the appointed day for a holding until all the compounded arrears had been collected from a tenant.  This led <Col N="1582" /> to a great deal of delay and consequent inconvenience to the vendor in many cases, and this section provides for adding the compounded arrears of rent to the purchase money in cases where the Land Commission deem such a course expedient.  The amount so added will be paid off by additional purchase annuities.  It is estimated that the provisions of this section will lead to the creation of additional land bonds to the extent of £576,000.  Some loss will fall on the Exchequer when land bonds are below par, owing to the fact that income tax due in respect of the holdings will be paid in land bonds instead of in cash in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (2) of the section.</P>
    <P>The second case which will require the creation of additional land bonds is dealt with in Section 35, which enables payment to be made in land bonds in some cases for turbary rights. Under the Act of 1923 no provision was made for making any payment to a landlord in respect of any profit which he enjoyed before the sale of the holding from the right of turbary vested in him, as the price fixed for the tenant's holding was based entirely on the rent. Section 35 enables the Land Commission to make such payment as they may consider reasonable or just to the persons who were entitled to the turbary rights on holdings before the holdings vested in the Land Commission.  It is not expected that this provision will involve a charge on the Exchequer, as the sums received by the Land Commission on the sale of turbary rights will approximate to the sums paid to landlords.  The amount of land bonds issued in respect of turbary rights will be small.  Another case requiring the creation of additional land bonds is dealt with in Section 37 of the Bill. Lands have been bought by committees in recent years for the use of owners of uneconomic holdings, landless men, and other people, at prices which cannot be recovered on sale to the Land Commission.  In some of these cases the Land Commission has no power to acquire the lands so bought as untenanted land under the Act of 1923.</P>
    <P>Section 37 enables the Land Commission to purchase and resell these lands where it is considered desirable. <Col N="1583" /> Some of these &ldquo;committee&rdquo; cases come within the scope of the Land Act of 1923 while others do not.  The total amount of bonds to be issued for all such cases is estimated to be between £360,000 and £450,000.  Additional land bonds will also be required under Sections 6, 7, 9, 10 and 34 of the Bill. Section 6 enables the Judicial Commissioner, in the case of building ground, to exclude only so much of the building ground as is suitable for building.  In the existing state of the law he is bound to exclude the entire holding, though only part of it may be suitable for building.  Section 7 brings holdings with disused mill buildings upon them within the scope of the Act of 1923, provided that the holding is substantially agricultural or pastoral.</P>
    <P>Section 9 admits to the benefit of the Land Act, 1923, tenancies on purchased holdings.  As the law now stands they can neither purchase nor get fair rents fixed, and this section is introduced for the removal of the hardship involved in such cases.  The sub-tenancies are not numerous, but as they are scattered and only come before the Land Commission in individual cases, no estimate of their number or of the amount of land bonds required for dealing with them is available.  The amount is not likely to be large, however, as it was the exception to leave sub-tenants on purchased holdings and permission to sub-let subsequent to purchase has been given in comparatively few cases. Section 10 deals with the question of fee farm grants, renewable leases, and leases for long terms, in the case of land situate in non-congested districts counties.  These already come within Section 38 of the Land Act of 1923. Under the latter section, however, the grantees and others had only power to redeem their rents by means of advances in land bonds.</P>
    <P>The Judicial Commissioner fixed the redemption price and allowed certain costs and an equivalent sum of land bonds was advanced, which was re-payable by the proprietor of the parcel of land by means of annuity.  Under Section 10 of the present Bill the Land Commission may now, by order, declare that a parcel of land shall vest in the <Col N="1584" /> Land Commission on the appointed day. The effect of this will be that the proprietor of the parcel of land so vested in the Land Commission will receive the price of the parcel in land bonds. Some of the land bonds will be used to pay off superior interests, and the remainder will be retained by the proprietor, who will repay the whole amount of the advance by means of a purchase annuity.  It is estimated that the extra amount of land bonds which will be required as a result of the provisions of this section will be very small.</P>
    <P>Section 34 enables the Land Commission to purchase labourers' cottages from local authorities for a price payable in land bonds.  It is not expected that a large number of labourers' cottages will be acquired under this section, but the cottages so acquired will relieve the Land Commission Vote of the cost of erecting new houses for purchasers.  The only charge upon public funds as a result of the provisions of the sections referred to will be the State contribution to price in certain cases and the total amount involved is estimated to be of small dimensions.</P>
    <P>Coming to the second part of the Resolution, it will be noted that Section 21 enables the Land Commission to expend money on the improvement of lands sold under any Land Purchase Act.  It has been held that the Land Commission has power to expend money on improvements only in the case of lands bought under the 1903 Act and subsequent Land Purchase Acts, and it is considered desirable to extend those powers in order to enable the Land Commission to exercise their powers under the Land Act of 1923, where rights of way may have to be given, and for drainage and turbary schemes and the like.  The Land Commission are not in a position at present to give even an approximate estimate of the expenditure that will be involved, but the money expended under this section will, as far as possible, be repayable by the proprietor of the lands by means of additional annuities.  In some cases an additional annuity, when added to the purchase annuity, would make the holding uneconomic and power is taken <Col N="1585" /> to make free grants to meet such a situation.</P>
    <P>Section 24 deals with the cases of losses on re-sales of untenanted land in congested districts counties.  The Land Commission has no power to withdraw from the sale in such cases if they consider the price fixed by the Judicial Commissioner for the land too high, and they cannot ask the purchasers on resale to pay more than they think the land is worth.  The section also deals with losses on the resale of lands which the Land Commission have deemed it necessary to acquire for improvement or enlargement, or the relief of congestion and the like.  The section is a necessary one, as the existing provisions of the Land Purchase Acts with regard to losses on resale are not suitable in the case of operations under the 1923 Act.</P>
    <P>A different class of case is dealt with in Section 37.  In recent years committees, bodies of trustees and societies, assisted in the purchase of lands for the settlement of landless men, uneconomic holders, and the like, in order, largely, to prevent a land war cutting across the national struggle.  These lands were mostly bought at a time when land was fetching enormous prices.  With the slump in land values it would be quite impossible to recover the original prices paid for the lands from the people who are settled on them, unless by fixing purchase annuities at an uneconomic figure.  Section 37 enables the State to come to the rescue of these people by contributing the difference between the present value of the lands and the original price.  It is estimated that the aggregate purchase money originally paid for the lands which will come under this section was between £360,000 and £450,000, and that the loss on resale will be between £120,000 and £150,000.  The land bonds representing the loss on resale will be amortised by annual payments from voted moneys of between £5,700 and £7,125, when all the lands in question are vested.</P>
    <P>Section 41 is designed to meet the similar case of lands purchased by means of advances from the National Land Bank.  There were 49 estates bought by these means, and the purchase <Col N="1586" /> money fixed under the Act of 1923 is estimated to amount to about £360,000 without taking into account the State contribution.  The actual value of the land is, however, about £100,000 less than this sum, and the land bonds representing this difference, which will be the loss on resale, will be redeemed by annual payments of about £4,750 from voted moneys.  This section is retrospective in character, and it is proposed to relieve societies and bodies of trustees from the necessity of paying up so much of the arrears due in respect of the annual sums payable by them from the appointed day as the Land Commission certify should not be a charge on the lands.  It is not expected that the arrears so certified will amount to more than about £7,000. Generally, it may be stated that the annual charge on public moneys necessitated by the provisions of the Bill is not likely to exceed £20,000, exclusive of expenditure on improvements.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 1 as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;When on the appointed day the tenant of a holding owes payment in lieu of rent&mdash;the unpaid amount <Col N="1587" /> thereof may at his request be added to the purchase money of the holding and be repaid by means of a purchase annuity in like manner as is provided for compounded arrears of rent in the foregoing sub-section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In putting down this amendment I had in mind a particular estate in Wicklow.  The tenants on this estate were undoubtedly the most rack-rented tenants in County Wicklow. They were afraid to go to the courts lest the landlord should proceed immediately for arrears of rent.  They did go into court in May, 1923, and proceedings were immediately instituted. The new rent was not fixed until October, 1926, and I understand the landlord is now claiming, and is entitled to claim, all the arrears of the old rent from March, 1923.  I know the Minister will have many difficulties in accepting this amendment.  I know he will give reasons, and probably good reasons, for declining to accept it.  But this is a case of great hardship, and I understand there are similar cases throughout the country.  I hope the Minister will be able to do something for those tenants.  If he could only add one year's arrears to the rent, it would be a great boon to the tenants.  It was for the purpose of directing the Minister's attention to the matter and in the hope of obtaining some relief for the tenants, that I put down this amendment.</P>

If this amendment is not carried, at least in part, and if some of this interest in lieu of rent is not added to the purchase money, I do not see how the people are to meet it.  Therefore, I would appeal to the Minister, with Deputy Byrne, to stretch a point, so as to give these people a fair start, even if he cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I could not possibly accept this amendment.  These <Col N="1588" /> tenants got a reduction of 25 per cent. immediately the Land Bill of 1923 was passed.  This is not a question of arrears of rent.  It is a question of rent accrued since 1923.  The tenants got a reduction of 25 per cent., and the suggestion is now made that the arrears accrued since 1923 should be added to the purchase money.  What about the people who have made these payments in lieu of rent?  Are we going to go back upon their cases and give them a reduction?  If not, why not?  If we proceed with amendments of this class to any great extent, the result will be that nobody will pay anything. No debt will be safe and no payment sacred.  Everybody will have the idea that some time or other a benevolent and beneficent Dáil will come along and wipe out the debts or, as is suggested in this case, add the arrears to the purchase money.  I could not possibly accept this amendment.  1920 was a good year.  1914 was a good year, and 1918 was a good year.  Between 1914 and 1920, there were very few tenants in Ireland in arrear.  At all events there were very few tenants in Ireland who could not pay their arrears, and I am perfectly certain that during that time these tenants could have paid their arrears and could have gone into court and got a fair rent fixed.  They did not do that.  For all I know, they may be judicial tenants.  At all events, they are present tenants.  It is alleged that because of their arrears they could not go into court.  Where is the tenant who could not pay his arrears between 1914 and 1920?  I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 4, which stands in the names of Deputy C. Hogan and myself:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To delete sub-section (3).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with restrictions in regard to the cutting of trees.  As the Bill stands and as previous Land Acts provide, the tenant purchaser is not allowed to cut down even one tree without getting the consent of the Land Commission.  This amendment would only apply to the 1923 Act and to this Bill, whereas if it were to be fully effective it should be so drafted as to apply to all the previous Acts which contain similar provisions.  That is a fault which can be remedied at a later stage if we have the consent of the Minister. The principal argument in favour of the amendment is that we are passing a law which it is not intended shall be enforced.  The Minister and the Land Commission know very well that it is quite impossible to enforce this law in regard to the cutting of trees.  Nor do I consider that it is advisable it should be enforced.  Why then pass a law with the clear intention that it shall not be enforced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well known to the Minister that a farmer must have control, to some extent, of the cutting of his trees.  There are trees which have, of necessity, to be cut.  There is hedge timber which is <Col N="1590" /> very often a nuisance on the farm. Farms may be very considerably improved by cutting down a tree here and there.  Are we to ask the occupier to go to the Land Commission for authority to cut down a tree or two? Doubtless, the argument will be used by the Minister that, in the interest of afforestation, we must permit the power of control in this matter to remain with the Land Commission.  But my experience is&mdash;I think it is the experience of most Deputies&mdash;that farmers are not inclined to cut down shelter belts.</P>
    <P>The farmers, in the majority of cases, want to retain their shelter belts. As a matter of fact, they are looking for opportunities to plant shelter belts rather than to cut them down.  But the farmer must cut down individual trees, and it is ridiculous to suggest that he should go to the Land Commission for authority to do so.  Under this Bill, not only must he do so, but he is subject to the penalty of £5 per tree if he does not &mdash;a ridiculous penalty in my opinion. There is hardly a tree in the country worth £5; very few trees are worth even £1.  The trees that would be cut down by the farmers would be of little value.  Hedge timber is practically valueless except for firing purposes.  I think the Minister ought to accept this amendment.  It has been discussed over and over again, and the opinion generally is that it is inadvisable to retain this power.  If the Minister decides to accept the amendment, I hope he will accept a further amendment which will make its terms applicable to previous Land Acts.</P>

      <P>I beg to support the amendment.  On the Second Reading of this Bill, while agreeing with the Minister on the question of the preservation and extension of forest land, I could not agree to the general terms which his sub-section incorporated in the Bill.  In my opinion, the provision is too wide.  I hold that when land is vested in the Land Commission, if on the inspection which follows, there is found timber which the Land Commission desires to reserve, the Land Commission should have the reservation clearly made and covenanted for on the <Col N="1591" /> face of the vesting order, and the tenant expressly notified to that effect.</P>
      <P>This section goes far beyond that. It proposes that no man can cut a tree on his holding without the prior consent of the Land Commission.  Unless they have expressly reserved the timber, the Land Commission cannot say, without inspection, whether it is desirable or otherwise to cut trees.  There the question of cost enters, and it is really prohibitive.  You cannot have an inspector going on the holdings to determine whether a certain tree or trees shall be cut.  The expense would be prohibitive.  Even if trees were planted by the occupier, in my opinion this section will prevent him cutting down those trees without the consent of the Land Commission.  In other words, a man who has invested money, whether for pleasure or profit, has not the free disposal of the crop which accrues to him.  Even diseased trees could not be cut down.  Trees have a certain life, and at a certain age a tree begins to encumber the land and is better removed. Let a new one be planted if needs be.</P>
      <P>As the openly declared policy of every party here is for a nation of peasant proprietorship, I say you cannot have it both ways.  You cannot have large timber plantations and small holdings&mdash;it will not work.  The amount of arable land is limited, and I say, speaking as a practical farmer, that in a country which has very little sunshine, trees very often cut out the sunshine from crops, and they ought not to be on arable land.  Where they are on arable land, every man should be allowed to determine for himself whether he should retain them or not. The best way of promoting afforestation is to have large plantations.  State forests, perhaps, are the ideal, but these are not always possible.  While I am for the preservation of shelter belts, I think the powers given here are too vague, too wide, and too generous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a further objection to the section which says: &ldquo;without the consent in writing of the Land Commission as well as that of any other person entitled to or having an interest in the timber on the holding cut down or uproot any tree on the holding.&rdquo;<Col N="1592" /> There is a dual penalty attempted to be inflicted here.  The owner of the timber has the right of action against the occupier in respect of the timber that he cuts down, if the latter is not entitled to do so.  But the Land Commission also steps in and imposes a penalty not exceeding £5.  One liability ought to be sufficient to meet the case. If the man is summoned at the suit of the Land Commission, clearly no right of action ought to lie with the landlord. If the right of action lies with the landlord, the Land Commission ought not to interfere, as it has not physical possession of the land.  While I am with Deputy Heffernan that this should apply retrospectively to the Acts of 1923, 1903 and 1909, as well as I remember there was no such provision in the Act of 1903.  It was inserted in the Act of 1909 and made to apply retrospectively.  The effect of this will be to prohibit persons planting timber because they will not have the free disposal of it.  Afforestation will be best served in my opinion by deleting this and making the amendment apply retrospectively.</P>

      <P>It is well known that since the first Land Act was introduced by Lord Ashbourne, in 1885, a great deal of timber has been cut down indiscriminately in a great many counties, especially under the earlier Land Acts, with the result that a great deal of damage has been done to the appearance of many districts, without much value to the owners or improvement to the land, in some cases anyway. There ought to be some supervision over the cutting of timber&mdash;not that a man should not do what he likes with his own.  It must be remembered, however, that under the Land Acts, although a man may be in occupation of a holding, he has to pay an annuity for about 68 years.  The State, therefore, has a right to have a say in the matter of the timber.  I do not say that the State should be tyrannical in the matter, but I think there should be some restraint over indiscriminate felling of timber.  There are some foolish people in the world.</P>

      <P>I try to be.  I think the matter of the timber ought to be left to the Land Commission.  There is also the case of demesnes being divided on which there is very old timber. The Land Commission ought to step in and order that timber to be cut down before it becomes useless.  The tenant might not cut it down where it ought to be cut.  The Land Commission should at least advise that the old timber be cut down and new trees planted if necessary.  As long as the annuity is payable, the Land Commission has control and should go into a matter such as this.  I hope the Minister will not accept the amendment. The Land Commission is the proper authority to have control over such a matter as the planting or cutting down of timber on any property sold under the various Land Acts.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will accept this amendment.  It is going too far to say that the owner of a holding bought under the Land Acts has not the right to remove a tree if it is in the way of his tillage operations.  Such a man would not have the right to cut a tree or a hedge on his land without permission. The section does not specify what kind of trees are forbidden to be cut&mdash;whether large or small.  If, for instance, the section specified ash trees or elm trees of one ton or two tons weight there might be some reason for it.  But if a man cuts a larch tree of one cwt. he is liable to be fined up to £5 for a stick that is not worth 5/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a holding is vested in a tenant the tenant should have it as a freehold. The tenant is paying an annuity for the land that the timber is on and the timber should therefore be the property of the tenant.  I would like to see the waste land of the country planted with trees, but that is not being done. The Department are helping agricultural committees to purchase land for the purpose of planting which if it was divided among people is quite capable of being turned into arable land and utilised in the interests of the State. There is plenty of waste land that <Col N="1594" /> could be planted but is not being planted.  If this section is allowed to stand, a man who wants to cut a tree must communicate with the Land Commission and it may be a month before an inspector is sent down.  What is that inspection going to cost the State in travelling expenses?  If this section is allowed to remain the estimate of the Land Commission will be immensely increased for travelling expenses and for the appointment of new inspectors to go round the country to every small holding where a farmer wants to cut a tree.  All that is going to take time.  If a man wants to till a piece of land in the month of March he will have to write to the Land Commission if he wishes to remove one or two trees that are in his way.  At the end of April perhaps, an inspector will be sent down when it will be too late to till the land.  There is a hardship there and the Minister should accept the amendment.</P>

The section is undoubtedly going to inflict hardship on tenant farmers that we should not stand for. With regard to the question of afforestation and the cutting down of timber we have not heard Deputy Wolfe declare that the Land Commission should have taken action against those landlords all over the country who at the time of the passing of the 1923 Act sold off their timber and denuded the country of trees leaving hundreds of acres of waste land.

      <P>There is no landlord who sold his timber and cleared out of the country with what he got for it who would not make the same excuse. We agree that it was very unfortunate that the country should be denuded of timber, and if action was to be taken against the men who own considerable territory to prevent those people cutting timber I say we could stand for it. But this section would prevent any farmer on these Benches cutting a tree on his own farm?  We cannot see the sense of that.  If the Minister has to go to such extremes as this to preserve the timber throughout the country I think he will want to include something in the Bill that will regulate the elements so that the wind will not blow down the timber.  I hold that Deputy Connor Hogan is right in his interpretation of the section that I will not have the right to cut timber that I plant without the permission of the Land Commission.  I do not think that is justifiable on the part of the Land Commission.  On the other hand, I do not think that this Dáil should take up the attitude that we have to be ringed around with laws that we may do what is right.  The farmer is not that wastrel that he wants to destroy everything that grows.  He is as anxious to see things grow and flourish as anyone else.  Undoubtedly if we are going to put him into the position, as we will by passing this section, that he cannot cut down a tree on his own land it will be asking too much of the small farmer to ask him to assist in afforestation. It would be better to take up the attitude of encouraging the tenant farmer to plant; even from the point of view of planting so that he might have a tree to cut down.  I think that is the policy the Land Commission should take up rather than say, as we blunty say in this section: Even though you plant a tree you cannot cut it down without the sanction of the Land Commission; the Land Commission has a greater interest in your farm and in its appearance than you have yourself.  I do not think our farmers need such correction as that.  I do not think that they should be put into the position of being prevented by law <Col N="1596" /> from doing what they think is right and fair with their own property.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am with the Minister in so far as he seeks to procure powers that would enable his officials to prevent indiscriminate tree cutting through the country.  I believe if the Dáil agrees with the section as it stands that it will place power in the hands of the Minister's officials to do things which he himself does not intend.  I took up a certain case of indiscriminate tree-cutting in my own constituency with the Minister about the middle of December last, and I had a letter from him indicating that it was his intention to introduce a Bill at an early date seeking powers to acquire certain lands by compulsion for afforestation purposes. If it is still the intention of the Minister to introduce a Bill during the lifetime of the present Dáil I think this clause would fit into a compulsory Bill of that kind better than into the Bill before the House.  My own view is that this section can be interpreted in a way that even the Minister himself does not intend.</P>
      <P>In a matter of this kind I would compel the farmers or the owner of the land who cuts down a tree to plant two trees in its place.  I think action of that kind would be far better and more in accordance with the views of the Ministry than imposing a penalty of £5.  The wording of the section is too elastic.  If officials are to be appointed to hear complaints with regard to indiscriminate tree-cutting all over the country it would involve an expense and place powers in the hands of these officials that the Minister may not have intended.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider the wording of the section so as to make it more in accordance with his own intention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to express the same view as the last speaker, that this cannot really be the intention of the Minister.  Is it suggested that no tenant farmer is to have the right, at any time, to cut down any tree upon his holding without first getting the permission of the Land Commission?  I think the clause as it reads, and as it could be read, is far more drastic and sweeping than the Minister can possibly <Col N="1597" /> desire.  I am in entire agreement with the suggestion that instead of there being a penalty of a maximum of £5 imposed there should be some provision made whereby other trees would be planted instead of those that are cut down.  That practice, as far as I understand, obtains elsewhere, and being, personally, strongly in favour of reafforestation and certainly of preserving what little afforestation we have in the country, I would ask the Minister to consider seriously some proposal of the nature outlined by Deputy Davin, whereby trees that were wantonly and recklessly destroyed should be replaced by others.</P>
      <P>The section, as it at present reads, certainly seems to take away a very elementary right from the owner of a farm.  To suggest that he cannot cut any tree, no matter what class of tree it may be, without first getting the formal permission of the Land Commission, I think, is going to an extreme which does not and cannot meet the case which the Minister must have in view.  I would suggest that he consider the alternative put forward by Deputy Davin, namely, whether he could not make some provision whereby if trees were cut down indiscriminately, or to a certain injurious number, that the people who cut them down should have to replace them by planting others.  I think that is a very sound and sensible policy to adopt, and it is not going so far as to suggest that any tenant farmer shall have the right to cut any tree whatever upon his holding without obtaining the formal consent of the Land Commission.  I certainly support the amendment.</P>

The Minister did say last week that it was not his intention that the Act should apply in the case of one or two trees cut here and there through the country. As the Bill now stands, complaints are liable to come up to the <Col N="1598" /> Land Commission and officials are likely to be sent down to investigate whether the cutting was correct or not.</P>

      <P>Like the other Farmer Deputies, I maintain that a farmer who grows timber should have the best right to say whether it is useful or not or whether it should be cut or not. Sometimes trees are very injurious to a field and sometimes they are useless timber.  You must not forget the old fig tree that was of no value and therefore should be destroyed.  Take the ash tree.  We are told, and I believe it, that the length of the roots of the ash tree is equal to its height.  The ground where these roots are could not be even dug with a spade let alone ploughed and the owner of the land has to destroy the tree in order to get out the roots.  Deputy Wolfe lays great stress upon the value of these timbers.  I wonder would Deputy Wolfe say that the Land Commission should have the same right to interfere in the case of every crop the farmer grows.  I cannot see why a landlord or any other man cannot have the right to plant a crop of trees or any other crop he desires.  I planted trees myself with the intention that somebody in the future would sell them.  These trees are not of much value.  There are trees that grow quickly and that come into the market early.  I think it would be a lamentable state of affairs if we could not go on with this planting.</P>

The Land Commission, under it, can take all real power out of the hands of the farmer.  He is left <Col N="1599" /> no power whatever.  The county surveyors used to tell farmers that they must cut a row of trees on their land by the roadside.  If they come along now and give an order like that to the farmer he must go to the Land Commission and acquaint them before he complies with the wishes of the county surveyor.  I do not see why a farmer should not have the right to do as he pleases with his trees.  I am sure there is no farmer who would cut down trees on his land if they were useful to him and formed shelter belts for his cattle. To give this power to the Land Commission which they can use against farmers is one of the worst forms of coercion that one could imagine.  I hope the Minister will agree to wipe out this section altogether.  I am quite sure that farmers would be prepared to plant trees in place of any they cut. If some obligation like that were imposed on farmers there would be some meaning in it instead of forbidding them to cut a single one without the authority of the Land Commission. That is a most objectionable proposal.</P>

I see the view-point of the Minister, and I think it is absolutely necessary that, as far as possible, trees in the country should be preserved.  I think, however, that it is very unfair to put a prohibitive section like this into a Bill of this character, taking away from the tenant the power that should be his of cutting the timber that grows on his land.  I would put certain conditions on a tenant before he would be allowed to cut timber.  One condition would be that recommended by Deputy Davin and Deputy Redmond, namely, that he should plant two trees for every one that he cut.  I do not believe that the tenant-farmers of the country want to destroy the appearance of their farms or to deprive themselves of shelter belts on their land.  I do not believe that any of them would wantonly destroy valuable timber, but there is timber on the land that is not valuable, and no farmer should be asked to retain that on his land.  I think the farmer could be trusted not to destroy timber that would be of value.  The <Col N="1600" /> vandalism to which, I think, Deputy Wolfe referred was not committed to a very large extent by farmers but by others.</P>

That was bad for the country and for the preservation of our beauty spots.  That was not done by farmers, but landlords did it on some of their properties.  I know one estate, a portion of which was sold by the landlord under the 1903 Land Act.  On the portion that he retained himself, he sold £400 worth of timber off it last year.  I suggest that power should not be taken from the farmer to cut timber on his land, but that where he does it conditions might be imposed obliging him to replant trees for these cut down.</P>

      <P>The tenant farmer is in the happy position that everyone is piling compliments on him this evening. He is told that he has always been very careful of his trees.  When he is told that, I think he must just wonder whether the compliments are genuinely meant.  I think we must all admit the fact that as regards the care of trees landlords were more careful than tenants. There is not a farmer that does not know that.  I agree that this section is somewhat vague and wide, but the fact of the matter is that the section has been in operation for the past twenty years, and has produced none of the frightful consequences that some Deputies now seem to foresee. Deputy Connor Hogan made a weighty speech on this.  He talked wise maxims about forestry, and said the peasant farmers of the country could not have large forests.  This is not a question of afforestation, and therefore the Deputy's talk was all irrelevant.  Everyone knows that you cannot have forests on a 25 acre farm, or on a holding with a poor law valuation of £10.  I agree with Deputy Noonan that it is a hardship on a tenant who owns trees to prevent <Col N="1601" /> him from cutting them, and with Deputy Connor Hogan that a man who plants trees himself should not be prevented from cutting them.  This section is inserted in the Bill from the same point of view that a similar section was inserted in the Act of 1909.  Deputy Connor Hogan wants it made retrospective, not from the point of view of afforestation, but from the point of view of security of the holding.  It is intended to cover shelter belts and ornamental timber.  If you begin to think of the sort of timber that should be allowed to stand, the very first thing that occurs to one is that a shelter belt, for instance, is very hard to define.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that a good row of beech trees and elms along a road should not be cut wholesale.  Neither should people be allowed to cut trees if their doing so interfered with the amenities or security of a holding.  Deputy Baxter spoke about the tyrannical and grandmotherly Land Commission Department attempting to prevent a farmer from doing this.  I am glad that the Deputy is coming around to the conclusion that the farmer should get a certain amount of discretion and should be expected to do something for himself. The amendment which I propose to introduce would provide that the tenant would only have the right to cut trees which he owned or planted himself, and that, in addition, the section would apply to ornamental timber and shelter belts.  I have been told that this section will mean a huge accession of staff to the Land Commission.  I doubt if Deputies who make statements like that believe them seriously.  Even if you did compel people to plant two trees for every tree that they cut you would still not be reaching the problem at all. What you really want is something to compel people to protect the trees that they do plant.  There is no use in planting trees if people do not take care of them afterwards.  I am willing to make this more specific than in the Act of 1909 by inserting a provision on the lines I have just indicated.</P>

      <P>A good many Deputies seem to have rather funny ideas with regard to timber on farms.  I should say that 97 per cent. of the timber on an agricultural holding is hedge timber. Very little timber is planted for shelter belts or for ornament.  This hedge timber becomes objectionable at a certain time and age, and it is desirable to have it removed.  Wherever there is old hedge timber, there is bound to be young timber coming on, and you cannot prevent a man from cutting it.  The less interference there is with the farmer as regards this hedge timber the better.  I am sure that on an average I break the law three or four times a week by removing this old hedge timber which is no good.  I suppose that if the strict letter of the law were to be adhered to I would be liable for a penalty amounting to £15 or £20 a week.  The Act has not been carried out and is merely there as a protection. The section, I think, is more or less there for ornamental purposes and serves very little use.</P>

      <P>I will not press the amendment at this stage if the Minister will not accept it.  I desire to say that in actual practice the matter will not be so easily managed; theoretically it is all right.  You may define shelter belts and ornamental trees, but even though you do define them a man down the country may consider that one tree is ornamental and the Land Commission may be of opinion that the tree is not ornamental. As against that the Land Commission may be of opinion that a tree is ornamental and the man himself may consider otherwise.  He has to apply to the Land Commission to decide whether or not the tree is ornamental. Is not that the case?</P>

The Land Commission express the opinion that it is an ornamental tree and they prosecute the man for cutting <Col N="1604" /> it.  Therefore the man has to take a chance.</P>

    <P>(2) Where a holding or part of a holding which is excluded from the operation of the Land Act, 1923 solely by reason or on account of its potential or actual value or utility as building ground, was at the passing of the said Act held by the tenant under a lease (other than a building lease), the tenant shall at the expiration of such lease, if no bona fide occupation of the holding or the part thereof so excluded as aforesaid, be deemed to be a tenant of a present ordinary tenancy from year to year at the rent or apportioned rent as the case may be, and subject to the conditions of his lease, so far as such conditions are applicable to a tenancy from year to year although the lease may not have been existing at the passing of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881.</P>

Provided that no such order as aforesaid shall be made in respect of any lands if the landlord proves to the satisfaction of the Judicial Commissioner that he intends forthwith to resume the same (if not then resumed) with the definite purpose of utilising them as building ground, and the Judicial Commissioner is satisfied that the lands will be utilised for building purposes within such further period of time as may be fixed by him.</P>

      <P>The Minister has certainly advanced a very long distance in this section to meet the requirements of the case, but I feel that in its present form it will hardly give full satisfaction.  It deals with residential holdings and makes certain provision in regard to the portions of these holdings which may be retained by the landlord.  Sub-section (6) provides that where land is retained by the landlord for the purpose of a building he shall build within five years, or if he does not the Judicial Commissioner may order that the Land Act of 1923 shall apply to the whole or to any part of such lands.  The effect of my amendment is to make it mandatory on the Judicial Commissioner to order.  The effect of the amendment would be that after the expiration of five years from the date of the 1923 Land Act if the landlord who had retained portion of the land for building has not built, the land shall pass into the hands of the occupying tenant and the ordinary provisions of the Land Act shall apply.  I think the section in its present form is a little too loose and gives a little too much power to the Judicial Commissioner, that it leaves the thing a little too indefinite. It leaves it to the Judicial Commissioner to say when the landlord may build.  I think that on the whole the acceptance of my amendment would make the section more acceptable and more suitable in every way for those who are concerned.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment and I think Deputy Heffernan's request is reasonable. Those who are familiar with the details of the case in regard to this whole question, that was thrashed out fully in Committee, will recognise that good progress has been made by the Minister towards meeting the position, or at least a great many people who are keenly interested in the question will have to agree that the Minister has gone a good distance to meet them. The arrangement that the land would have to be resumed within five years for the purpose of building, and if not resumed at that time it should be included within the provisions of the Act is, I think, quite reasonable, and in order that there should be no loophole in regard to that I think that the provision should be mandatory.  I think Deputy Heffernan's arguments are reasonable, and while we are willing to admit that the Minister has gone a long way to meet the position, I think that in order to make the matter very definite the section should be amended in the way proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this sub-section is to give a tenant security of tenure during the five years' period, except the landlord resumes for the purpose of building during the period. That is agreed by everyone to be fair. The only person to whom it is unfair is the owner of the land and, as I have already pointed out here, the owners of the land, in a great many cases, especially in these building ground cases, are very often poor people.  This building ground will all be near a town, and very often it is the case of one shopkeeper setting to another, or one labourer, if you like, setting to another. The only party who has a grievance under this section is the owner, and there is a distinct grievance. Personally, I am not satisfied that the Bill will work out as we anticipate. I think that, undoubtedly, I will receive from Deputies of all parties letters and memoranda pointing out the grave injustice in certain cases where the proprietor, being a poor man, has let land two or three years ago and that now the land has been taken from <Col N="1612" /> him and has, perhaps, been given over to somebody who was much better off. There would be numerous cases where poor people let land under short leases any time from 1920 to 1923 to very much better-off people, people who are big shopkeepers and who want a bit of accommodation land, solicitors in a town, clergymen, and so on.  These are the kind of people who usually take land of that sort under the kind of lease that this section applies to, and the people who had the land are in very many cases much poorer people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the section as it stands is to take away all rights from the owner of the land and to give everything to the person in occupation.  I am not satisfied that I have not gone too far, and I think that the Bill, in its operation, will show that I have gone very far indeed.  It is a case of balancing advantages and disadvantages. Undoubtedly there were serious disadvantages in making provision for these buildings.  I had to make provision for them or simply to omit it. I have made provision.  I have left in only one proviso, and that is the proviso that the owner wishes to resume for the purpose of building.  It is agreed by everybody that the owner should have the right during the five years' period, but the case is made that the moment the five years' period has expired the owner should have no such right.  I do not think it is possible to justify that if you realise what exactly we mean by this proviso.  It might be for a hundred and one reasons, the impossibility of getting money, or other circumstances, which might make it impossible for an owner to proceed to resume except just towards the end of the five years' period, and it might very well be, through the law's delay, or other delays, that he might go for the five years' period before actual resumption would take place or before proceedings had been initiated for resumption. It you admit the principle that the owner has the right to resume for the purpose of building why should you penalise the owner because he happens to initiate these proceedings the day after the five years' period has expired and, say, two months before the tenant takes proceedings before the Judicial <Col N="1613" /> Commissioner to acquire the ownership in the lands?  I think that would be arbitrary, and the proviso is the only discretion that the Judicial Commissioner has.  It is perfectly clear that the tenant may purchase, and the Judicial Commissioner must agree to that course except as set out in this proviso. There is just one thing you might say on that proviso.  You might say that the Judicial Commissioner, or any judge, is only human, that he has to depend on the evidence given by the applicant, and may believe that evidence, and the applicant may get the land and then refrain from building on it.  You may take it as certain that within the terms of that proviso, unless the building does take place, the land reverts.</P>
    <P>You can take that as clear.  There can be no such thing as a trick, no such thing as an applicant getting the land and then not building.  &ldquo;The Commissioner is satisfied that the land will be utilised for building purposes within such further period of time as may be fixed by him.&rdquo;  That is the only case which I should be asked to cover.  I have covered it.  That is the case of an owner making application, the Commissioner acceding to the application, and then the owner, having got the land, refraining from building.  What is the objection to giving the Commissioner discretion in that case?  The owner might come before the Commissioner at the last moment and ask to be allowed to retain the land for certain reasons.  I cannot see what objection there is to giving this discretion, once it is admitted in equity that the owner should have that right within five years.  Deputies may ask, why use the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;?  It is simply to have it read properly. I am advised that the only case in which the Judicial Commissioner could exercise his discretion is the case where he is absolutely satisfied that the owner of the land who is applying for resumption intends to, and will in fact build.  I would ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.  It is illogical, having regard to the fact that we are allowing the owner to resume for building purposes within a period of five years.</P>

      <P>I see a great deal of sense in what the Minister says but the principal objection to the proviso is the final line where it says that the extension may be given for &ldquo;such further period of time as may be fixed by him.&rdquo;  That still remains indefinite.  The Commissioner might, in fact, fix a further period of five years.  The general feeling is that if the landlord does not show a clear intention of building within a reasonable time the land should revert to the occupying tenant.  This sub-section leaves it somewhat indefinite, though I agree with the Minister that it makes it mandatory that the building shall take place some time.</P>

      <P>I do not see the reason for it and on general principles it seems to be unsound.  In some cases even a year might be absurd.  A case might come before the Judicial Commissioner in which the building operations were quite simple and in which having regard to all the circumstances the applicant should proceed to build.  Where the Commissioner had grave doubts as to the bona fides of the applicant he might make it short and sharp.  The applicant on the other hand, might require reasonable time and the Judge's discretion is limited by the whole sub-section. The proviso reads: &ldquo;Provided that no such order as aforesaid shall be made in respect of any land if the landlord proves to the satisfaction of the Judicial Commissioner that he intends forthwith to resume the same (if not then resumed) with the definite purpose of utilising them as building <Col N="1615" /> ground.&rdquo;  That makes it clear that the meaning of the sub-section is that building must begin as soon as possible.  It is to meet such cases that you have in the words, &ldquo;within such further period of time as may be fixed by him.&rdquo;  I would leave it to the Judge who must take into account the Act of Parliament, and discretion should be left to him to take the attendant circumstances into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that the Minister has a very vague idea of the time it takes to develop building land. I have an estate in mind in which a large sum was expended more than twenty-five years ago, but the land is still largely undeveloped.  I know another estate upon which large sums were expended close on one hundred years ago and a considerable portion of the land is still undeveloped.  What is to happen under this particular section? If that land is not taken for building purposes within five years all the money spent on it is gone.  Could anything be more confiscatory than this proposal?  It is all very well for the Minister to say that five years is a long period.  When we come to the question of developing a building site, five years is a comparatively short period.  If any Deputy has within his knowledge, as doubtless he has, certain sites let for building will he show me even one site in a most popular position that has been fully developed in anything approaching five years?  The effect of the section will be that not alone will it mean that large sums in development will be lost, but it will absolutely prohibit anybody from <Col N="1616" /> spending money on building land for the purposes of development.  The President has pointed out over and over again his anxiety to get houses and the need for houses, but here is a counter effort, by means of another Bill, to stop the development of that policy.  I leave it to anybody who has any knowledge of this subject to tell me that it is possible to develop building land in five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can bring Deputies to sites in county Dublin and county Wicklow where the exact opposite is true.  This proposal would mean that the large sums, running into thousands of pounds, which have been spent years ago on the land, and which meantime have been producing very little because there was an expectation of a development which has not yet come&mdash; these will all go by the board.  Instead, however, of that development coming, this Bill, if it becomes law, will do away with the whole thing.  To put a clause like this into what you might call practical shape is a matter of very considerable difficulty.  Let me cite a case: A head landlord may have in his mind a certain development and the land may come within the Act and be regarded as suitable for building purposes.  There may be a sub-tenant who may have rights for five or ten years.  The landlord in that case has no chance of developing the land until the tenancy expires.  These are all difficulties that are inherent in building land and show the difficulty of trying to secure any measure that could deal fairly and effectively with them.  I am sorry I was not here when my amendment was reached, but I would suggest to the Minister the reconsideration of this clause as, instead of doing good, it will do a serious amount of injury as it stands.  I cannot suggest any amendment that would meet the particular objects which the Minister mentioned in regard to the necessity for urging the development of building. Deputies may point out that if a man knew that in five years his rights would expire it might be some incentive. It is not the owner himself who builds, but it is somebody else.  It may be an incentive to somebody to build, but I cannot see it.  Suppose it does <Col N="1617" /> not achieve its object, is all that money lost?  These are matters which must be considered from both points of view.</P>

It will be up to the landlord to get to work and to start building.  If he does not, he will lose the land on which the building might take place. My amendment would give a definite stimulus to building.</P>

      <P>He certainly will be able to get the building done. I think Deputy Good has in mind a type of holding which we have not in mind at all.  A great many of the holdings Deputy Good has in mind are not tenanted holdings and are not worked as agricultural holdings. Under this amendment, the holding will have to be agricultural in character. I have in mind a type of holding which exists around a great many of our towns.  Land beside those towns is being held up on the pretence that it is to be used for building, whereas it is not the intention of the owners to use it for building at all.  I have in mind one or two towns where there are examples of that.  Many of those owners have held up the land for many years on that plea.  There has been very little development as regards building around the smaller towns and there seems to be no prospect of further development if the land continues in the hands of the present holders.  If the land passes into the hands of tenants, they will have the right to build at any future time.</P>

      <P>In his reply in connection with this amendment, the Minister stressed, with very good effect, the cases of poor people who had let land of this kind to wealthy people.  The reverse is very often the case, too.  It is for that type of case that I plead now. Numbers of comparatively poor people spent all the money they had in acquiring land of this kind near cities.  There are cases I know in which the tenants are in the unfortunate position that they are liable to be ejected on very short notice.  In some cases they have already been put out.  I think the period proposed of five years is long enough.  Deputy Good suggested that people who have a right of this kind should have a generation in which to build.  But he really objects to the principle altogether, and he seeks to provide an excuse for the people who are holding on to land of this description without any intention of utilising it for building ground at any time.  As regards the time limit, you must have a time limit in every case.  In compensation cases and indemnity you have provided a time limit, and claims which are not made within a certain time will not be dealt with at all.  I think the period in the amendment is reasonable, and I support Deputy Heffernan in his attitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Good undoubtedly made a case for his amendment, although he has not yet moved it. There are two sides to this question. There is the side mentioned by Deputy Good, where large sums of money have been expended over a long period in the initial development of building ground. Such sums have been spent outside Dublin, Cork and such places on holdings which are now agricultural.  There is no doubt about that.  I know examples of it myself around Dublin.  A certain amount of initial work has been done and big sums of money have been spent.  These holdings are now occupied by agricultural tenants, and so are other holdings on which no money has yet been spent, but which are, in fact, building ground.  They are also occupied by agricultural tenants and by agricultural tenants under fair rents &mdash;that is to say, with fixity of tenure. The difficulty is to deal with all those cases in one Bill by one provision.  That is an example of the fact that there is no ideal solution of any of these dilemmas. There is the further hardship to which I referred already.  In the Land Act of 1923, for the first time, future tenancies were included, a future tenancy being a tenancy held subject to the right of the owner to serve notice to quit and resume.  Personally, I agreed to include them with some doubt.  But I came to the conclusion that we could safely include them because of the building-ground exception which was in that Act.  I realised that most of those future tenancies were near towns, and that a considerable number of them would be excluded by the building-clause section.  It was because of that that I agreed to insert a provision in the Land Act of 1923 that such tenancies should come in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These tenancies, to a very great extent, are owned by comparatively poor people and are near towns.  Deputy Murphy pointed out that there are cases where these tenancies are owned by wealthy people.  That is true.  You have both classes, but to a very large extent they are owned by poor people. And to a very large extent they retain their ownership because, notwithstanding that future tenancies were included <Col N="1620" /> in the 1923 Act, these tenancies were excluded by the building clause section. What is done cannot be undone.  We have got beyond that now, and building ground is brought in.  I have no doubt whatever that that will cause great hardships.  That is one side of the question.  There is the side mentioned by Deputy Good&mdash;the case of estates on which moneys have been spent over a long period, but which are not yet developed and which will for a long time not be developed.  There is another side to the case.  There is the case of agricultural tenancies, properly so called, on which no money has been spent but on which fair rents have been fixed.  Under the Act of 1923 they were excluded as building ground.  So far as they were present tenancies without a fair rent, but present tenancies with fixity of tenure, their right to have a fair rent fixed was taken away by that Act and some of them were in a bad position.  Here is an attempt to deal with that.  This section will do grave hardship.  There were hardships caused by the absence of it, but I certainly think we ought not to press the case further than this section puts it.  Deputies will never be satisfied with any Land Purchase Act.  Each one will be made more extreme than the other, and we will just begin to stop land purchase when it comes to affect ourselves and our own particular conditions.  Personally, I stand over this section as it is, with all its disadvantages on both sides, but I will not go any further.</P>

      <P>In the case of a man who has invested large sums of money in making the land suitable for building purposes, there should be an extension of the period during which building operations might commence. That is a very different case from the case of the landlord who has already resumed possession from the future tenant on this plea of building ground or who is prepared to do that and who does not intend to build but to hold on in the hope that something may happen which will leave him in possession. I think the Minister should reconsider the section and see if it could not be redrafted to cover cases where the holding is really agricultural and where the tenant should be protected from the landlord who has no intention of building.  At the same time, provision could be made whereby no injustice would be done to the man who has invested money in making land suitable for building which it would be unfair to take over within a limited time without giving the owner a fair chance to go ahead with his work.</P>

That is to say, where no money has been spent the period will remain five years.  I am simply taking out of this section the sort of case that Deputy Good mentioned first, and that Deputy Baxter mentioned now&mdash;the case where a certain amount of money has been spent already towards initial development of the estate.  In that class of case I propose to add a clause extending the period from five years, which is the period which will cover the ordinary case where no money has been spent, by fifteen years, to twenty years.</P>

If the Minister does not put in a proviso that such consideration will be taken into account, what will happen is that all this estate development for building will cease immediately.  Take the Mount Merrion estate, which Deputies know.  A considerable amount has been spent already on the development of that estate.  I do not imagine that that estate will be fully developed for the next 30 years.  It will be quite good work if it is developed in 30 years.

The Deputy definitely made the suggestion, after Deputy Good spoke, that some method should be found of meeting the case of the man who had spent money already on developing an estate.  I said I would meet him on that, and I will meet him by extending the period to 15 or 20 years.  That is the point we are discussing.</P>

      <P>Before the section is put, I want to get some information from the Minister with regard to a matter that was raised on the Second Reading of the Bill by Deputy Wilson.  It deals with the question of compensation for the tenants in places where they are dispossessed for the purpose of the utilisation of the ground for building.  The Minister did not seem very clear, at that stage, as to what compensation standard was to be.  My opinion is that the compensation ought to be the market value of the land at the time it was acquired. Past Acts do not definitely state on what basis the compensation is to be granted.  I would like to have some kind of assurance from the Minister on that point, so as to guide us at future stages of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The point is this: that the Money Resolution deals with transactions where money is to be provided for the carrying out of the sale of land, the land in question in this case being residential holdings which are regarded as ordinary agricultural land, with the exception of the proviso with regard to residential holdings.  The occupiers of such land have the power to appear before the Judicial Commissioner; as such they <Col N="1630" /> are treated under the previous Land Act.  They have the right under the previous Land Act to appear before the Judicial Commissioner.  We are simply inserting, in this Act, a further provision for the guidance of the Judicial Commissioner.  If the Judicial Commissioner can deal with this particular class of holding under the 1923 Act I maintain we have the right to deal with it in this Bill.</P>

If, as it seems to me, paragraph II (b) does make provision&mdash;it appears to make very wide provision&mdash;this amendment is in order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put it another way.  It is sought to make the case that residential holdings are tenanted holdings.  Supposing that is agreed to, and supposing this section is inserted, the Land Commission will have to expend money in purchasing the landlord's interests in these holdings and reselling them to the man who is now called the tenant.  There is no provision there which would entitle the Land Commission to expend moneys in that way.  They certainly cannot expend moneys for the purpose of buying tenanted land and reselling that tenanted land to the tenant.  The Resolution is to provide &ldquo;interest and sinking fund upon any losses incurred by the Land Commission in the resale of untenanted land and land purchased by the Land Commission under the terms of such Act,&rdquo; the terms of such Act not bringing in residential holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>What happens under the ordinary purchase provisions of the previous Act is that the Land Commission actually do purchase and resell.  They purchase from the landlord and pay in bonds or cash, and resell to the tenants.  If that is the case paragraph (b) of Section 2 of the Money Resolution covers my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will put it in another way.  I will read the Money Resolution from the beginning.  Assume that this amendment is in order. The amendment contemplates that residential holdings shall be regarded as tenanted holdings.  If carried that is what it means, and they must be purchased by the Land Commission as tenanted holdings and resold as tenanted holdings.  Clearly, therefore, the Land Commission cannot spend money for that purchase under the first clause to provide &ldquo;interest and sinking fund upon any losses incurred by the Land Commission in the resale of untenanted <Col N="1632" /> land and land purchased by the Land Commission under the terms of such Act.&rdquo;  That is not an Act passed in this session.  The Act, as it stands at present, excludes residential holdings; it makes no reference whatever to them, and residential holdings can only be brought in now by amendment which will, in effect, amount to a new section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the Minister tried to evade a discussion of this section, because it is a very important matter for the tenants concerned.  The Minister may be tired of it.  The tenants are not tired of it, and we are not tired of it.  It has already been discussed very fully by the Select Committee, but we have not <Col N="1633" /> had an opportunity of letting the people know the Minister's views on it. There was no report of the proceedings of the Select Committee except the the ordinary Imeachta which gives no indication of the reasons given by the Minister for rejecting this amendment. As the Dáil knows, the question of residential holdings is a matter for decision by the Judicial Commissioner.  If the landlord decides that he will object to the sale of land on the grounds that it is a residential holding the tenant has no option but to agree, or else appeal to the Judicial Commissioner.  We do not, by this amendment, prevent that appeal, but we impose a certain restriction in regard to the appeal; that is, that this appeal cannot be made to the Judicial Commissioner if the valuation of the land comprised in the holding exceeds the valuation of the house thereon.  Further, we have a proviso that the land must be worked as an ordinary agricultural or pastoral farm.  I maintain that that is a very reasonable provision and that there are practically no cases in existence, despite the arguments of the Minister, where the value of the land exceeds the value of the house and where the tenant can be regarded as a tenant in the ordinary meaning of the word and I propose that this amendment be accepted by the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy seeks to do is this: there is a fine house outside of Dublin with ten rooms in it.  It is worth £3,500 on the open market.  The valuation is £35.  There are, say 16 acres of a lawn attached to it, the valuation on which is £36.  A tenant was let in about a year ago at a rent of £40 or £50 a year.  What the Deputy is doing is asking the Dáil to make a present of that house to the tenant at a Land Commission price. The 16 acres of land would not be security under any circumstances for more than £400 or £500, and the house would not be security for anything more than about the same sum.  There you have the sum of £1,000 and the proposal is to lend the taxpayers' money to that fortunate tenant for that purchase, the money to be repayable <Col N="1634" /> over 67 years at 4½ per cent.  I could not agree to that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConlan" hpid="Mr. CONLAN Mr. CONLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment affects a great many landholders throughout the country.  In recent years a good many changes have taken place in the country and a great many bona fide farmers have acquired holdings on which there were what we may call a superior sort of house, different from the ordinary farm house and more commodious, and in which the surroundings were somewhat better.  The fact that these men occupied houses of this kind did not mean that they were not bona fide farmers, farming land and living by farming.  I know the case of a man who occupied a house of that sort.  He farmed 60 Irish acres.  His principal means of living, in fact nearly his entire means of living, was farming, but on the grounds that the house was of superior character he was excluded from the benefits of the Act by the Judicial Commissioner.  I think that is a very hard case.  In fact, I have some experience myself personally.  I have been objected to as a tenant on the grounds that I occupy a residential holding.  That shows that there are many grievances in that direction.  I think that the Minister ought to have no difficulty in accepting the amendment. The case that he has put up is a very exceptional one where a man occupied a dwelling in a lawn.  I do not think that we have any intention of pleading for a man of that class.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONLAN</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to call the Minister's attention to the wording of the amendment, which says &ldquo;whose principal or only business is farming.&rdquo; The Minister has given one extreme instance similar to that which he quoted before the Select Committee.  I maintain <Col N="1635" /> that there are no such cases in existence as the extreme one just quoted by the Minister, of a man paying a rent of £50 for a house and 15 acres of land, and where the valuation of the land exceeds the valuation of the house.  Cases of that kind are very rare indeed.  It would be almost impossible to find, even around a city, a case such as that.  My amendment is governed by the proviso that the principal or only occupation of the man must be that of farming, that he must be in <i>bona fide</i> occupation of the said dwellinghouse and working the land as an ordinary agricultural or pastoral farm.  The amendment makes provision to cover the case only of a man who is a real farmer.  Even if the amendment were accepted it would still be open in cases where the valuation of a house exceeded the rent to the tenant to appeal to the Judicial Commissioner, who would state whether such people were tenants in the ordinary sense and entitled to buy.  My amendment deals with a less extreme case, where the valuation of the land is less than the valuation of the house.</P>

      <P>I desire to support the amendment.  I do not think the Minister has met the case at all.  The case that the Minister put up was, in my opinion, a ridiculous one.  It was certainly a very extreme one, even for a county like Dublin.  Very few cases of the kind could, I think, occur even in the County Dublin.  But what about the large number of cases for which the amendment is intended to provide? The Minister put up an extreme case, and said that under Deputy Heffernan's amendment it afforded an opportunity for an injustice being done.  In answer to that, I ask the Minister what about the hundreds of injustices that are to be perpetrated all over the country under the Bill as it stands?</P>

We are thinking of the unfortunate man living in a big house down in the country.  He has it at a high rent, and it is much too big for his requirements.  We are thinking of that man who has to make a living out of the land that he holds. That man is excluded from the benefits of the Land Act, and is going to be excluded in the future unless something is done for him by the passing of this amendment.  The Minister is not making any attempt to meet a case like that.  He has not met the case fairly, but it will have to be met by someone yet.</P>

      <P>Mr. McKenna has been in occupation of a holding for twenty years and probably longer. The landlord objects on the grounds that it is a residential holding.  The valuation of the land exceeds the valuation of the house.  Everybody who knows him can tell that he is a farmer and that his only occupation and means of making a living is that of farming.</P>

      <P>To my mind that case is a condemnation of this amendment, and absolute condemnation of it. A gentleman's name has been put up here, and the case made for him is that he is 20 years in occupation.  He got the house 20 years ago, and by reason of that we are asked to say that he is to have the character of the house changed within the 20 years.  Suppose it was my house, that I was in possession of it and let it at a moderate rent. Let us say that I let it at £1 an acre. If the Deputy thinks that figure is excessive he can mention a sum.  I could have got over £1,000 for that house, but I let it at £50 a year.  Now having let it at £50 it is to be brought <Col N="1637" /> in under the amendment and there is to be a reduction in rent and so on on this 20 year holding.  I think that by quoting that case the Deputy has condemned his own amendment.  A gentleman's name has been mentioned here.  The Deputy could have cited a case without mentioning names, but now I suppose he can go down the country and say that Mr. McKenna's case got no justice in the Dáil.  I am surprised and disappointed at the Deputy.</P>

I said that the man was in occupation as an ordinary agricultural holder, an ordinary tenant farmer.  I would like to point out that Section 24 of the Land Act of 1903 provides that even though land was let as a residential holding, if in the meantime it has lost its residential character it can be brought under the Act.  This has lost its residential character within the last 20 years, and I mentioned that gentleman as one of a type that should not be excluded from the benefits of the Act.</P>

      <P>The 1903 Land Act was introduced at a time when the land agitation was at its height. <Col N="1638" /> Twenty-four years have elapsed since that Act was passed and I do not think it was the intention of those who were anxious to get the 1903 Act passed to bring in those who were going to become either tenants in occupation or anything else after that period.  Now the case is made that this letting made within the last twenty years is to be brought within this Act.  I am astonished at the Deputy.</P>

      <P>There are hundreds of cases up and down the country.  If there were not, why should we be troubling our heads about this?  We are very much concerned about the large number of farmers who hold land and who unfortunately, as I said earlier, have very big houses which are of very little value to them, but on which they have to pay high rents.  It is really a loss to farmers at the present day to have these big houses. They are a hindrance to them in their business.  We have specifically stated in the amendment that the rateable valuation of the land must be greater than the valuation of the house, and it is stated too that the farmer must work the land as an ordinary agricultural holding.</P>

    <P>(1)  Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-sections (1) and (3) of Section 24 of the Land Act, 1923 there shall not be vested in the Land Commission by virtue of the said Act otherwise than in pursuance of a voluntary agreement any untenanted land so long as the Land Commission are satisfied that such land is being used in a bona fide manner as a farm for the purpose of breeding thoroughbred stock which in the opinion of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture is of a nature and character suitable to the requirements of the country.</P>

      <P>This amendment was put down merely for the sake of getting information from the Minister.  I do not quite understand whether this section makes any special provision for the bona fide breeder of pure-bred stock or whether it is possible for a man to evade the operation of the Act by jumping into the breeding of stock.

      <P>The section provides that land used for the breeding of high-class stock shall be excluded.  That applies not only to land used for that purpose now, but land which will be used in future for that purpose.  When an application comes to the Commissioners to acquire certain lands they will have to take into account the circumstances on the date when they received the application. It is intended partly to encourage people to get into the breeding of stock.  If we confine it to the very few people in the country who are breeding high-class stock at the moment it would be quite useless; it is deliberately intended to encourage others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1642" /> It is essential for the economy of the country.  It is business that gives a tremendous amount of employment and brings money into the country, and, incidentally prevents a tremendous amount leaving the country.  It will have a most beneficial reaction on live-stock generally.  It would be quite useless to confine it to the people breeding high-class live-stock now.  Most of them are now breeding racehorses.  This is intended to include people who breed cattle, sheep and pigs principally, as well as people who breed thoroughbred horses.</P>

      <P>Although the wind has been taken out of my sails very considerably, I will move the portion that is in order.  This matter was discussed before the Committee, to which an amendment in exactly the same terms as this was submitted by me. The voting was even, and under the Standing Orders governing the deliberations of the Committee the amendment was rejected for that reason.  This amendment seeks to do something for the evicted tenant.  It is a very old and a very vexed question and one, I submit, that very little has been done to settle.  This whole matter is within the discretion of the Land Commission, and, as far as I know, very little has been done to deal with it in a definite way.  No matter how long we delay, this is a question which, I submit, will have to be dealt with finally.  Power to do something has been given by previous legislation of the Dáil and elsewhere&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation. Might I draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that I think the amendment, with the proviso gone, does not alter the law set out in the 1923 Act?  It still leaves it optional for the Land Commission to deal with an evicted tenant.  I may be wrong, but that is my reading of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. COSGRAVE</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert before Section 13 a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1646" />&ldquo;A person who or whose predecessor, at the passing of the Land Act of 1881, was the tenant of a holding to which the Land Acts apply, and who (or whose predecessor) was evicted from the said holding, since the said date, in consequence of proceedings taken by or on behalf of his landlord and who or whose personal representative has not under any previous Land Acts been either reinstated in his original holding or been given a substituted holding, shall be entitled on making application in the form prescribed under this Act, to be restored to his original holding.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My object in moving that this new section shall be inserted in the Bill now before the House is because of the failure of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture to include in his Bill a clause dealing with evicted tenants. The British Parliament passed three Land Acts dealing with this question. These three Acts, the Land Act, 1903, the Evicted Tenants Act, 1907, and the Land Act, 1909, intended to make provision for bona fide evicted tenants and would have completed the work were it not for the intervention of the war.  The statutes provided for all bona fide cases, and it is only necessary to continue the machinery under the present statute.  Under the Land Act, 1903, Section 2, sub-section (1) (d):&mdash;</P>
    <P>A person who within twenty-five years before the passing of this Act was a tenant of a holding of which the Land Law Acts apply, and who is not at the date of the purchase the tenant or proprietor of that holding,</P>
    <P>Provided that in the case of the death of a person to whom an advance under this paragraph might have been made, the advance may be made to a person nominated by the Land Commission as the personal representative of the deceased.</P>
    <P>By this sub-section evicted tenants were enabled to become purchasers of parcels of land of which they might not previously have been in possession, and Section 53, gave them on being reinstated in their former holdings the <Col N="1647" /> same rights of purchase as if their tenancies had never been determined.</P>
    <P>Under the Evicted Tenants' Act, 1907, Section 17, sub-section (1) (c):&mdash;</P>
    <P>A person who within twenty-five years before the passing of the Act of 1903 was the tenant of a holding to which the Land Law Acts apply, and who is not at the date of the purchase the tenant or proprietor of that holding or in case such person is dead a person nominated by the Land Commission as his personal representative, and</P>
    <P>(d)  any person to whom in the opinion of the Land Commission after adequate provision has been made to satisfy the requirements of the persons mentioned in the preceding paragraphs of this sub-section, an advance ought to be made.</P>
    <P>This sub-section, as far as it applies to the evicted tenants, is not limited in point of time, and although the amount to be advanced is not to exceed £1,000, it may be exceeded at the discretion of the Estates Commissioners.  The bona fides of the claims are admitted in these three Acts, and it is only bare justice that the machinery created by them for making provision for these cases should be reconstituted, and I would earnestly appeal to every Deputy in the House, irrespective of Party, to assist in recreating the machinery for the completion of this national obligation.  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture stated on the Second Reading of the Bill that: &ldquo;Most of the genuine evicted tenants were dealt with long before the Act of 1923, and that a number were dealt with since.&rdquo;  Yes, according to a report of the Estates Commissioners 3,359 were provided for up to 31st March, 1914.  But I am not aware of even one case dealt with since the passing of the 1923 Act, and I will ask the Minister, if he can do so, to give the names and addresses of the evicted tenants who have been reinstated since that date.  He also stated on that occasion: &ldquo;We would love to deal with all of them, but how are we going to do it; where is the land to come from?  There is practically no untenanted land.&rdquo;  I will suggest <Col N="1648" /> to him how he can do it, and where he can get the land.  If you will accept the new section which I am moving to your Bill you will have compulsory power to acquire land, whether it is tenanted or untenanted.  The first to be attacked should be the grabbers. What right have they to retain evicted land for which they never paid a penny fine?  When they grabbed the evicted land they were known as planters or future tenants, but when the Land Act of 1909 was introduced, the landlords made them permanent tenants for the purpose of frustrating the Act.  I hold that tenancies created for such a purpose are invalid, and no one should know that better than the Minister himself. I do not agree with the Minister's statement that you will have to deal with 100,000 evicted tenants if this section is inserted in the Bill.</P>
    <P>From information I have received, I have no hesitation in stating that the number of genuine cases to be dealt with will not exceed 500.  It may be necessary for me to mention a genuine case for reinstatement.  I will do so, and if the House should require it I shall give the names and particulars of many others.  Patrick Madden, Meelick, Co. Galway, was evicted by Lord Clanricarde for non-payment of rent in the year 1893, his holding, consisting of 34 acres I.P.M., was grabbed by a man named Horseman.  This man holds 199 acres at present, 131 of which he has grabbed.  The tenants evicted from 78 acres of the 131 have been supplied with new holdings elsewhere, so that the only land required to be taken from Horseman is Madden's 34 acres holding and 19 acres from which two others were evicted, who have not yet been reinstated or have not got new holdings instead.  If this 53 acres is taken from the grabber he will still hold 146 acres, which, in my opinion at all events, is more than he deserves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Cosgrave's amendment.  I was surprised to hear him say that the Minister stated that if the evicted tenants were to be reinstated provision would have to be made for 100,000 of them.  Surely, if the Government have at heart the interests of the country in general, they <Col N="1649" /> will see that genuine evicted tenants, or their descendants, will be reinstated on the land, and, if they cannot be provided on the holdings from which they were evicted, surely they can be given land elsewhere.  It is all very well to say that all genuine evicted tenants were reinstated prior to the Land Act of 1923.  That is not so.  In Westmeath and Longford there are several genuine evicted tenants who have not been reinstated and who have got no land since the 1923 Act became law.  Like Deputy Cosgrave, I could mention several such cases, but I do not intend to mention names.  I will, however, give full particulars to the Minister.  It is well known that the land of these evicted tenants was grabbed for certain purposes, and that land is still in the hands of the grabber or the grabber's offspring.  In Section 31 of the Act of 1923 it was stated that any evicted tenant who was the tenant of a holding which came under the Land Commission prior to the passing of the Act had a genuine claim to be reinstated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could the Minister say how many, if any, genuine evicted tenants have been reinstated in accordance with that section?  Not one evicted tenant in Westmeath or Longford has got land. Several men came to me and said that their fathers or grandfathers were evicted and their holdings were battered down to make ranches for some great captain or major who fought for the British Government against the Irish people.  These lands were given to such people for services rendered. Notwithstanding the fight made by their fathers and grandfathers, these people are absolutely destitute.  If they possess a cow they cannot get grazing, even on land that was once theirs.  I give the Minister all due respect and I appreciate the efforts which he has made to settle the land question by means of the Act of 1923. When the Dáil was considering that Act I brought up the case of the evicted tenants.  I was at that time really interested in this country, because I thought our own Government would see that justice was done to these evicted tenants and that their sons and daughters, who rendered great service in the fight against the British, would <Col N="1650" /> be given decent treatment.  But for the land agitation and the people who fought in it, the British Government would never have introduced their various land Acts.</P>
    <P>Many of the landlords still remain on the land, whereas the people who compelled the British Government to introduce the various land Acts are still simply the insects of the landlords.  It is a fact that cannot be contradicted that you have to-day thousands of people in the Free State whose fathers and grandfathers, through advocating the cause of the tenants many years ago, were driven from comfortable holdings by the planters, are still dependent upon the county councils to give them road work or the boards of health to give them assistance.  If they could get back their own land they would be independent and useful citizens of the State by utilising that land to the best interests of the State.  The grabbers and settlers are not working the land, but if the original owners, or their descendants, got back that land they would till it and make it arable.  At present you will find that the largest portion of such land is under scrubble. These lands were once capable of growing oats, potatoes, and barley, but now all they grow is ferns and thistles.  I know several portions of land in Westmeath and Longford where the settlers have allowed the land to go into scrubble in order that it may be regarded as fit only to plant as a forest.  The former owners of such lands now live in tumble-down hovels.  My advice to the evicted tenants is, unless the Minister accepts this amendment and makes some provision for them, to rise up in a body and assert their rights.  It is time they were reinstated.</P>
    <P>They are the people who drove the first thorn into the side of the Tory Government.  If our present Government are prepared to do for them nothing better than what the Tory Government did, then I say, God help those heroes who succeeded in getting such a Government established in this country.  These men and women are practically starving to-day.  Their little ones toddle off to school half-naked and badly fed, but if their <Col N="1651" /> fathers and mothers got back their land these children would live in decency and comfort.  I say now, as I said in 1922, when we were considering the Land Bill that I would not give a grabber or a settler one penny compensation for the reinstatement of an evicted tenant because they made a large amount of money out of these seized lands.  We had a man in Westmeath who fought well for the people in putting down landlordism and succeeded with the help of his colleagues at Westminster in getting various Land Acts passed.  That man told the people that if they wanted help they must help themselves, and that if they did not help themselves they would not get any help from the Government. I hope that I will not have to go through my constituency and give the people the same advice but, if it comes to that point, I will not hesitate to do so.</P>

      <P>I sympathise with the objects of the amendment, but I am certain that what the mover of it has in mind could not be achieved without imposing injustice on somebody.  I know one case, and probably there are many like it, in which the holding from which the tenant was evicted has passed through three or four different hands since the eviction took place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. COSGRAVE Mr. COSGRAVE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COSGRAVE</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>The land was sold in the first instance for £400, it then passed on to another tenant for £700, and was eventually purchased by the present occupant for, I think, £1,100. If this amendment were put into operation the holding could be given to the evicted tenant only by doing injustice to the present occupier.  If the present occupier was a grabber or an emergency man I would say that Deputy Cosgrave would be right in insisting on the reinstatement of the evicted tenant.  I take it that the Minister and the Land Commission still have power, and still have a desire, to deal with genuine cases of evicted tenants and that they do not take the <Col N="1652" /> view that all cases submitted to, and turned down by, the Land Commission under the British régime cannot be reconsidered. The Minister surprised everybody when he said that if the amendment were adopted the number of claims to be dealt with would be about 100,000.  I do not think that anybody could imagine that applications from genuine evicted tenants would approach anything like that number.  I hope he will not insist on repeating that statement to-night.  I would like to know how many evicted tenants have been reinstated and how many applications for reinstatement have been sympathetically considered since the evictions in 1881 or 1882.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like if the Minister would give us the approximate figures regarding such cases, and how they were dealt with.  I should like to know if they have been sympathetically considered since the passing of the 1923 Act.  I know of cases brought before the Land Commission in which a number of people claimed to be entitled to holdings as a result of the division of the Luggacullen Estate.  The circumstances are known to many Deputies.  A number of these cases were dealt with, prior to the passing of the 1923 Act, by the British Government.  But there are eight or nine claims still before the Land Commission and I do not know whether they are being definitely turned down or not.  Eight or nine of the Luggacullen tenants who were evicted still claim that they are entitled to reinstatement or to alternative holdings.  I should like to know if there is anything in Section 13 which would prevent the Minister or the Land Commission from sympathetically considering those eight or nine cases.  The objection to the amendment is I think to the use of the word &ldquo;must&rdquo; instead of the word &ldquo;may.&rdquo;  I believe Deputy Cosgrave and the Minister might be able to come to some arrangement with regard to the alteration of five or six words in the latter portion of the Deputy's amendment, which at present could not be carried into effect without imposing an injustice on somebody other than the grabber.  The Minister might assure the House that the claims that <Col N="1653" /> have been submitted&mdash;whether they be 100,000 or 500,000&mdash;will be sympathetically considered by the Land Commission under the powers given them by the 1923 Act, and by this section.</P>

      <P>When I was dealing with the amendments in my own name in connection with this matter, I suggested that, even with altered wording, the amendment I was responsible for would not sufficiently deal with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no question whatever that all the genuine evicted tenant cases have not been dealt with.  From time to time questions have appeared on the Order Paper in the names of Deputy Hogan and myself in connection with the position of evicted tenants in the constituencies which we represent. Frankly, what I gathered from the replies to these questions was that nothing had been done.  In the constituency I represent there are a number of evicted tenants whose cases are notoriously genuine.  Recently I saw documents in the possession of these people informing them that their cases had been noted by the Land Commission, and would be considered when the land was available.  Evidently the cases were accepted as bona fide by the Land Commission.  It seems to me that there is no machinery for dealing with these cases definitely&mdash;that they are dealt with in a haphazard way.  I think Deputy Cosgrave is aiming at the provision of some machinery which will deal specifically and definitely with the cases of evicted tenants.  This question is a relic of a very old agitation. It is unfortunate that, in the new position in which we find ourselves, we are faced with it still.  Up and down the country one finds people who are dissatisfied and who have a genuine grievance in connection with this question.  The Minister stated, I think, during the proceedings of the Select Committee that this Amending Land Bill would probably have to be supplemented in some way later.  I submit to him that no matter how many Land Bills are passed, and no matter what provision is made in other <Col N="1654" /> respects, this question will have to be tackled sooner or later in a definite way.  I am not making a plea on behalf of imaginary cases or on behalf of cases which had their origin in the remote past.  But I do make a plea for the genuine cases, and I suggest that the machinery for dealing with these cases under the Act of 1923 is not sufficiently efficient.  I regret very much that the proviso for assessing compensation in cases of this kind, where land is not available, was not strictly in order, because it would provide an avenue from a very considerable difficulty that the Minister will be faced with.  I suggest to him that this question should be dealt with definitely and specifically, and that power should be given to the Land Commission to go ahead with this work and to remove the last traces of this agrarian evil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConlan" hpid="Mr. J. CONLAN Mr. J. CONLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a remarkable disparity between the figures that have been given us to show the extent of this problem.  We have been told, on the one hand, that there are 100,000 evicted tenants, or descendants of evicted tenants, and, on the other hand, that there are only 500 or 1,000 altogether. I am sure the Minister did not base his calculation upon any definite set of figures, because it is impossible to believe that there could be anything like 100,000 evicted tenants or descendants of such tenants.  At all events, I think Deputy Cosgrave is to be commended on bringing forward this amendment, especially as regards the old plan-of-campaign tenants, who have not yet been settled on the land.  I can bear out what Deputy Davin has stated as to the number of people on the Luggacullen estate who have not yet been restored.  A great many of them have been restored.  Some of them have got rather poor settlements, but they have, at all events, got houses and some land.  With regard to the people designated grabbers or emergencymen, I do not think that they deserve much consideration. We have had, unfortunately, many plantations in Ireland. But it must be said that in the old days the planters carried their lives in their hands and won the land by force of arms.  The planters of later days <Col N="1655" /> sneaked in behind their fellow-farmers and took advantage of the state of affairs then existing to get the holdings for nothing.  The men who did that deserve very little consideration.  The case which Deputy Davin cited, in which the original grabber or emergencyman has been succeeded by purchasers who bought <i>bona fide</i> and paid substantial sums for the farms, are in a different category.  I think it is not at all creditable to the National Government or to the people of the country that men of that class, who went out of their holdings at the direction of the national leaders in the land war, should themselves be regarded as waifs and strays for the past twenty-five years, or that their descendants should now be so regarded.  I trust that their cases will be speedily dealt with and that these people will be provided with suitable holdings.</P>

      <P>I support the principle of the amendment.  But I agree with Deputy Davin that by legislating in the manner set out in the latter portion of the amendment we might bring about a great deal more injustice than justice.  I suggest to the Minister that he should accept the principle of the amendment and that he should bring forward, on the next stage, an amendment which would give him power to deal more fully with the cases of evicted tenants than these cases have been dealt with since the passing of the 1923 Act.  It is evident, all over the country, that sufficient attention has not been paid to the claims of evicted tenants. In some cases where evicted tenants have made application for reinstatement or for equivalent holdings, they have been completely turned down.  I know at least two cases where the representatives of evicted tenants applied for holdings and were turned down without reason assigned.  I think some improvement should be made in our land laws in order to deal more efficiently and more speedily with the cases of evicted tenants.  In this respect, a very great hardship exists throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. DOYLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that this question of evicted tenants has come <Col N="1656" /> to a head.  For the last three years, those evicted tenants have had very little consideration from Deputies or from Ministers.  Provision was made in the Act of 1923 for the reinstatement of those tenants or for supplying them with equivalent holdings but, up to the present, very little has been done in this respect.  I know that inquiries are being instituted into the cases of some evicted tenants, but I am not aware that any of the genuine evicted tenants, up to the present, have been reinstated.  I hope the Minister will adopt the principle embodied in Deputy Cosgrave's amendment and, after long delay, that he will now do something for the restoration of genuine evicted tenants.  Surely those tenants have quite as good a claim as some of the landless men and congests who have been supplied with land. There is as much land at the Minister's disposal to deal with evicted tenants as to deal with those other parties.  I hold that the evicted tenants should get the preference over both of those classes who have been dealt with&mdash;the congests and the landless men.  Many of them went out of their farms during the Land War on principle. They could have remained in possession like many other tenants, but they went out to fight the battle of their fellow tenants, and help to get rid of landlordism.  I believe the sufferings of some of those evicted tenants in the eighties and later were as great as, or greater than, those of the congests or landless men more recently.  I think the time has come to do something to embody the principle of Deputy Cosgrave's amendment in legislation and to rectify the long injustice done to this class of tenant.  The Minister says he cannot find land to deal with those tenants.  I know hundreds of acres of land that are not being applied for and that could be applied for if there was any real desire on the part of the Minister or the Land Commission to deal with those tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing has been done and I know of some of those evicted holdings which are still on the landlords' hands.  I have brought the matter of those evicted holdings under the notice of the <Col N="1657" /> Land Commission, yet nothing has been done.  The representatives of the evicted tenants are there and their holdings are on the landlords' hands, yet no movement has been made to reinstate these people.  I hope the Minister will do something to remedy the great neglect of those evicted tenants since the initiation of this Parliament.</P>

As to the statement of the Minister the other day, I think it is now generally recognised that the assertion that there are 100,000 evicted tenants in the country who have not been reinstated is a gross over-estimate. I suggest that at the utmost there cannot be more than 5,000 genuine evicted tenants, and I believe that that even is an over-estimate.</P>

      <P>I want to emphasise the word &ldquo;genuine.&rdquo;  I know that the Land Commission would get 100,000 applications for reinstatement as evicted tenants, but the great majority of those will not be genuine.  The fact remains that there are still a number of genuine evicted tenants who have not been reinstated.  It would not be necessary to move this amendment if we knew that the Land Commission were trying to carry out the provisions of the Act of 1923 in the spirit in which they were intended.  We know that under Section 31, sub-section (1) (c), the Land Commission have power to make advances for the purpose of placing certain people on the land, and that that refers to persons evicted since 1878. We can only deal with things that come before us individually, and we must take into account the facts as they come before us as to whether the Land Commission is attempting to reinstate those evicted tenants.  The opinion I have formed is that they are not.  It seems to me that when the Land Commission comes to decide between uneconomic holders, landless men and evicted tenants, they put them all on a par and select the men they think are most likely to make the best use of the land that they get.  If that is the standard by which they go, they are not likely to do justice to a great many evicted tenants, because in my opinion, in connection <Col N="1658" /> with evicted tenants it is not a matter of placing men on the land who are most likely to make good use of it, but of righting a grave injustice.  In my opinion it is only comparable with giving a pension under the Military Service Pensions Act to men who engaged in the recent fighting.  Those men deserved compensation for the fight they put up in the land wars.  The Minister is aware, and we all know, that this Dáil exists because of the land agitation and the fight put up by those men. The whole national movement which culminated in the measure of freedom we now enjoy, was built up on the basis of the land agitation.  The Minister knows that well, that Parnell had to build his whole national movement on the miseries and misfortunes of those situated on the land.  There are cases of men who went out of their lands because of principle, and who have not yet been reinstated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It so happens that my attention was called to a particular case on the very day of the Second Reading of this Bill, and it brought to my mind clearly the fact that the Land Commission do not intend to reinstate the evicted tenants, unless they think those tenants are at least equally entitled to land as the other applicants available.  They are not taking into account the services rendered by these men in the past and the fact that this is rather a matter of righting a rank injustice than a matter of selecting men who are the most suitable to go on the land.  I will give particulars of the case to which I have already called the Minister's attention. In my opinion this case absolutely proves that the Land Commission have no intention of reinstating evicted tenants unless they are of the type which corresponds with the other class of people whom they are putting on the land in regard to farming ability. The man I am referring to is a genuine representative of his brother who was evicted from a farm of about 100 acres adjoining one of the principal towns in Tipperary.  This man's brother was evicted during the Plan of Campaign from the Smith-Barry estate at the time when the New Tipperary agitation was going on.  When the tenants of Tipperary went out and abandoned <Col N="1659" /> their holdings and went into huts in order to help the land agitators.  The man evicted was quite capable of paying rent, and had the rent as a matter of fact, but in order to be loyal to his fellow tenants he withheld his rent in accordance with the dictates of the leaders of the campaign.  Because of the non-payment of one year's rent he was evicted from this 100-acre holding.  The holding has been in the hands of the landlord until recently, managed almost all the time by an emergency man, but has recently been taken over by the Land Commission. This brother of the evicted tenant, who is the only surviving relative, except one in America, made an application for reinstatement to the holding and his case has been before the Land Commission who had a full opportunity of considering it.  About three weeks ago the land was divided and this man was not reinstated.  If the Land Commission had any intention of doing justice to evicted tenants they had here a genuine case where the man should have been reinstated.  I have formed the opinion from that case that the Land Commission have <Col N="1660" /> no intention of reinstating evicted tenants.</P>
    <P>There is another side to that case which I do not intend making now. It is another aspect of land settlement and it makes the case worse.  It is the question of the type of people who have been put on the land.  If the people put on the land were uneconomic farmers of the right kind who would be likely to make good use of the land I would have been much slower to take up this case, because I have a good deal of sympathy with the idea of giving the land to uneconomic holders.  But the people who got this land were not uneconomic holders. In my opinion they were quite unsuitable. Even if they were suitable, the claim of this man should have received serious consideration.  If the Land Commission really intend to reinstate evicted tenants they should have reinstated him.  I move to report progress.</P>
