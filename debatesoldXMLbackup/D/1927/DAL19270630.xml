      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he has received a recommendation from the Mayo County Council to the effect that the wages of labourers and carters under the Road Board Schemes in that county should be raised from 25s. and 48s., respectively, to 28s. and 51s., and if he will state what action he has taken, or proposes to take, on this recommendation.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>The recommendation mentioned by the Deputy has been received.  It is not proposed to authorise the increase.  The existing rate has been in operation for over three years, and is, in fact, higher than that paid by the Council to its own workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister for Local Government no power to recommend to the City Commissioners, who are really responsible to his Department, the advisability of taking over this site, and, by so doing, bringing to an end the legal proceedings against, and the persecution of, these unfortunate traders?</P>

      <P>I put forward a proposal that Votes should be taken in the order in which they are down on the Paper, commencing with 56.  I explained to the Committee which met the other evening that I was not a free agent with regard to the discussion of the Estimates by reason of the illness of two Ministers and the absence of a third, that I expected in consequence that I would get some accommodation, and that I had to approach the presentation of the Estimates from the point of view of the Ministers available to deal with them.  Apart from the absence of the Ministers I have referred to, there have been other changes which necessitate a little more consideration in that direction.  I understand that the Committee which met the other evening was to meet again to-morrow morning, when they will have had some experience of the way the work is done. I hope, in view of the absences to which I have referred and of the other changes that have taken place, that no unreasonable objection will be taken to the consideration of the Estimates we have down.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of the Vote which the Minister for Finance has moved, added to the amount taken in the Vote on Account earlier, makes up the full total of £124,009, which is the net sum required under Vote 56 for this year.  The sub-heads are set out in the ordinary way, and the explanation, as is usual, given.  I wish to call attention to three points, as to which I presume my attention will be directed if I fail to notice them&mdash;that is to say, the three sub-divisions of the items which show the greatest increase. The greatest increase is shown in heading A&mdash;Salaries, Wages, and Allowances&mdash;there being shown there a net increase of £13,233.  That is set out in the details of the sub-head later, which will show on examination that that increase is to be accounted for by three sums: a sum of about £2,100, increase in the Secretariat; a sum of about £2,100 odd in the Commerce and Technical Branch, and a sum of about £11,845 in the Statistics side.  The explanation of these items is simple.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the amount of £2,100 for the Secretariat, the explanation is that if certain proposals which are at the moment under consideration go through, a Directorate will disappear from the Industries side and the post of Assistant-Secretary will be created. The new post of Assistant-Secretary is given in the details of sub-head A, page 221.  There has now been added to this Vote for the first time the salary of a legal adviser to the Department.  This is not a new appointment&mdash;neither of the two is a new appointment in the sense of an increase of personnel.  It is simply a transfer of officers from one end to another.  The salary of the legal adviser was heretofore borne on the <Col N="195" /> Supreme Court Vote, but that officer had been pretty definitely attached to my Department and had been giving full-time work there, and he now appears definitely on the expenditure side of my Department.  That item of £2,100 is made up of the post of Assistant-Secretary, who possibly will be a transferred Director from the other side, and, secondly the transfer of the legal adviser's salary from the Supreme Court Vote to this Vote.</P>
    <P>On the Commerce and Technical side, there has been an increase of £2,106. That is expenditure incurred, in connection with the payment of staff for preliminary work in respect to the setting-up of the Patent Comptroller's Office, which was established under the Industrial and Commercial Property Act. Deputies will remember that under the terms of that Act there was what amounted to an appointed day for the opening of the office, but certain preliminary work had to be done beforehand, so that the office would be able to deal with the arrears of applications for patents, trade marks and designs when it is actually and officially opened.  Certain staff had to be allocated to the office therefore before it was formally opened and an expenditure is set down for the staff at the moment of £2,106.</P>
    <P>The largest increase in expenditure has been on the Statistics side, which shows an increase of £11,845.  There is at present work proceeding on three different types of census&mdash;the census of population, the census of agricultural production, and the census of industrial production.  The provision now being made for the census of population amounts to £10,242 out of the increase of £11,845, and the provision made for the other types of census &mdash;agricultural production and industrial production&mdash;amount to about £1,600.</P>
    <P>Deputies will probably be anxious to know what is the actual state of things with regard to the census of population, and what are the prospects with regard to the other two.  The census of population was taken in April, 1926. The papers were all returned by the middle of July of that year, and a preliminary <Col N="196" /> report was published in August.  The compilation of the detailed figures is now being proceeded with.  The work in connection with the compilation of the final figures is very heavy, and has involved in the past year a big increase in, the clerical staff.  As their work has been completed, the staff that was engaged on the preliminary work of punching cards with regard to the final figures, with the exception of two who have been retained for certain work which still hangs over, have been disbanded. By means of sorting and counting machines, by which the main bulk of the work of the future will be done, the work of classifying these figures is proceeding, and the classification is done under a varied group of headings.  The actual population has to be classified by age, a rough classification for the smallest unit of area&mdash;the district electoral division&mdash;with a more precise calculation by unit of age for each county. The younger people will have to be then classified with regard to orphanhood conditions, and others by marriageable conditions.  There has then to be a classification with regard to Irish, religion, housing conditions, birth-place, occupation, industries, industrial status (employer and employee, and so on), unemployment, size of farm worked by the family, the question as to whether people are married, or widows, or widowers with dependents, and certain family statistics got out with regard to the number of children in each family. Then, of course, these classifications have to be crossed one with the other. The results will be published by subjects. It is proposed to publish different volumes upon each subject, and it is expected that about four or five of these volumes will be published before the end of the year, but the earliest of them need not be expected before the autumn.</P>
    <P>The census of industrial production was founded upon the Census Production Order, and in accordance with that all people in the Free State who are carrying on any of the industries, trades or businesses specified in that Order were supplied with questionnaires upon which they were required to furnish certain detailed particulars <Col N="197" /> relating to production during the year 1926.  That Order was issued in June to industries classified in about 40 groups.  The Schedules upon the questions that had to be replied to were issued in January of this year.  Fifteen thousand odd persons, firms, or authorities received these, and the returns were requested to be furnished by 1st March of this year.  But a very small proportion of the returns had come in by that time, and reminders have since been issued from time to time, with the result that returns have been received to date from about 11,000 of the 15,000 people or firms.  The number outstanding, notwithstanding the reminders sent out, is very large&mdash;disappointingly large, even allowing for the fact that it is the first time that a census of production has been taken under the authority of the Oireachtas, and for inexperience in filling returns, and allowing even for mistakes in sending out papers improperly addressed to certain firms and people.  Of course, more drastic action will have to be taken if the returns are not furnished by the 4,000 odd firms which still have to supply the returns.  However, certain further reminders will be sent out previous to any action of a drastic type being taken.</P>
    <P>A scrutiny has already been commenced on the returns received, but no publication of the figures can be thought of until the full returns are received, because until that time the compilation of the final figures cannot be properly approached.  The output of agricultural production is also being determined.  Inquiries were made from about 30,000 farmers.  Special inquiries were addressed to them on the 30th April last.  Inquiries of a similar type will be made at the end of August and December, so as to get data to estimate particularly the output of live stock products.  That is simply proceeding at the moment.  Further similar inquiries will be made from time to time.</P>
    <P>The other items that show an increase are smallish items.  There is an increase under sub-head F&mdash;Fees and Expenses of Medical Referees&mdash;which is further defined in the sub-head as fees and expenses payable under the particular section of the Workmen's Compensation <Col N="198" /> Act, to the medical practitioners appointed for the purposes of the Act.  It is quite clear that at the best this estimate can only be a conjectural one.  One does not know what accidents might occur requiring greater attention and a greater number of visits, much more inspection and much more attention from these people.  It varies from year to year, and no precise calculation can be made as to it.  It is founded upon the best view that can be taken from the expenditure in past years, taking into consideration the increased number of cases on which these people might be called.</P>
    <P>The only other item on the list on. which there has been an increase is in the last sub-head&mdash;the Gift from the Free State to the International Labour Office in Geneva.  It shows an increase of £150, but, of course, it does not mean that the £450 now being voted is supplementing, and in addition to the £300 voted last year.  A sum of £300 was put down last year as the best possible estimate that could be found.  It was then conjectural.  The sum of £450 is now based on a report that a decision had been come to as to the type of gift, and after an expert in the particular work had been to Geneva and had given his best estimate of what the precise gift would cost.  There may have to be further additions made to it later for the cost of sending the gift actually to the office&mdash;the transport and the setting up of it&mdash;but it will be a very small item.  The other items are as they have been explained in previous years, but I would prefer to reply to questions raised later on, rather than enter into an exposition of the details now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidLeoOGorman" hpid="Mr. O'GORMAN Mr. O'GORMAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'GORMAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like an explanation from the Minister of some items which occur in the Vote.  On page 223 I see a sum for bonus.  Last year it amounted to £8,806 and this year it amounts to £10,955. On page 222, we see that the bonus paid last year was £2,624 and this year it is £4,230.  On almost every page we find a very large increase under that heading.  For instance, on page 221, we find that last year the bonus was £743 and this year it is £1,175.  In one or two items there is a very slight decrease. <Col N="199" /> I have read from time to time statements made here that this bonus is protected by the Treaty, but the overwhelming majority of the people object strongly to its continuance.  It was a war measure and the war has long since passed, and this bonus should have been abolished.  It has been abolished by all private firms and the ordinary people of the country see no reason why a certain favoured class should be protected from the vicissitudes which all the rest of the public have had to submit to.</P>
      <P>We find through the country in various counties a very extraordinary state of affairs in connection with this bonus.  We find in one county a bonus is paid to a certain class of official, whereas in an adjoining county precisely the same class of official, with the same salary, performing the same duties, does not receive bonus.  I would point out to the Minister that this increase&mdash;in one item on this page alone it amounts to over £2,000&mdash;may be described as the straw which indicates the way the wind is blowing. He will pardon me for doubting the sincerity of the election promises made by him and his party that they would have due regard to economy.  An opportunity will, I believe, arise of questioning the estimates again but meanwhile I would like to have not only an explanation but an assurance from the Minister that the question of this bonus which has agitated the whole country and which in some of the Departments amounts to very nearly a quarter of a million, will have the full attention of the Minister and the Government. I am not pressing the matter further but I would like to hear the Minister's explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might say a word on the question of bonus.  The position is that whereas in occupations generally, there has been an increase in basic wages, or basic salaries owing to the fall in the value of money which has occurred as a result of the European War, in the Civil Service basic salaries have not been increased.  What has happened is that to salary has been added a variable bonus.  That bonus <Col N="200" /> has fallen very substantially from the height at which it one time was.  It has even fallen somewhat in recent years.  It depends entirely on the cost of living figure or on what we might regard as the value of money.  If Deputies would look to the second page of the Estimates marked IV they will see what the amount of the bonus is. On a salary of £50: where the cost of living figure is £90, which is the figure in these estimates, the bonus is £45. In the case of the higher salaries the amount of the bonus represents a great deal less.  The position therefore is that so far as the lower paid officials of the State are concerned they get an amount of bonus which is calculated to bring the purchasing power of their salaries up to what it was pre-war and no more.  It is to enable an official of a certain grade, to purchase in the matter of the ordinary necessities of life, the same amount that his basic salary would have purchased pre-war. So far as the higher officials are concerned the amount of the bonus has been cut and their salaries have nothing like the purchasing power they had pre-war.  It is impossible&mdash;this may as well be accepted&mdash;to interfere with the bonus.  The great majority of the civil servants are transferred officers and they have rights which we give them by the Treaty.  If these conditions of employment or the rumunerations of any transferred officer are interfered with to his prejudice, he is entitled to retire with added years, which added years reach in certain cases up to seventeen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have mentioned a case in this House which indicates the interpretation which has been placed on those rights of the transferred civil servants.  There was the case of one individual whose pay was not interfered with who was discharging certain work which gave him a position of having nobody over him but the permanent Secretary of his Department.  He was transferred at the same rate of pay to other work, but on that other work there were several officers between him and the Secretary of his Department.  It was held by Mr. Justice Wylie that his position had been interfered with, and that particular individual was able to go out <Col N="201" /> with 17 years added for the purpose of calculating pension, and is now drawing a pension and discharging no duty for the State, so that any attempt to interfere with the Treaty rights of civil servants is not going to produce economy.  It is going to have an entirely opposite effect.  It is impossible to have one body of civil servants who have the Treaty protection on basic salary with bonus, and to have another body of civil servants on, say, the same basic salary without bonus.  In any case, of course, it would be impossible to procure people for the great majority of Civil Service posts at the present basic salary if bonus were not added.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in replying generally, can deal with the question of the increased bonus in this particular vote, but I want to say at this point that the bonus is a thing that we cannot get rid of. It is a thing which takes the place of an increase on basic salaries, and if there were not bonuses the great majority in numbers of basic salaries would have to be increased by something like the amount of the bonus.  In any case that is a matter which will not repay exploration, because we are bound by the terms of the Treaty, and we are obliged to continue this system of bonuses or to face as the alternative an enormous increase in the pension charges and of having a great number of people who are now giving service and giving good service to the State going about drawing pension and returning no service for it.</P>

      <P>The point raised by Deputy O'German is only one of very many points which must inevitably come up in the course of the discussion on the Estimates.  Those of us who have been members of the House for three or four years, and who made an effort time after time to reduce the various estimates, met with very little success.  The efforts that we made in that direction forced us to the conclusion long ago that this question of reducing expenditure in this country is one that will have to be tackled in some <Col N="202" /> other fashion.  Recently, in the Dáil, we gave Deputies an opportunity of expressing their opinions as to the method that should be adopted to bring about reductions in expenditure to a figure that would be nearer to what the people are able to bear than what is expected from them at present.  We put that question to the test when we asked the House to agree to the setting up of an independent Commission which would investigate our whole financial policy.  That motion was moved by a member of our Party, and was, one might say, countered by the Government Party with an alternative suggestion that they were prepared to go a certain distance to meet us and to set up a Committee to do this investigation. We expressed ourselves dissatisfied with what the Government offered us at that time.  We are not a bit more satisfied with it to-day.  I am intimating now that, at an early date, we intend to give the Dáil an opportunity of expressing its opinion as to whether or not another type of committee or Commission is not essential if we are to have a reduction in expenditure: if we are to have an independent investigation of our whole financial policy which will bring about the reductions that the country wants.  I do not propose, nor do the members of my Party propose, to go presently into an examination of the Estimates; into an examination of each of them, such as we made on former occasions in this House, but I am indicating that at the earliest date possible we shall ask the House to agree with us, that the Government proposal is not satisfactory, and that something better must be given to the country.  If those who have talked about economy for a number of years in this House, and very vigorously for a few weeks outside of it, will give us their support, then we will get a body of men set up on the authority of this Dáil that will make such an investigation of our financial position, policy and administration, that will bring the demands of the Minister for Finance upon the taxpayers of this State down to a figure more commensurate with the ability of the taxpayers to bear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMENAMIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood <Col N="203" /> that Deputy O'Gorman wished to know from the Minister for Finance what was his general policy on the question of bonuses.  If that is so I did not understand the Minister for Finance to give any reply to that question. I do not rise to deal with the question of bonuses or the question of high salaries in general, but I rise to get a statement from the Minister, if possible, as to what his policy is with regard to the question of bonus, because in my opinion this question of added bonus to salary in order to provide that the person or persons who draw those salaries will be on the same footing with regard to purchasing power as they were pre-war is fallacious, erroneous, and has led to our present economic and financial position. What is the result of it?  If you take one of the officials set forth in this volume of estimates who draws, for example, a salary of £1,000 and you take that he draws a sum of £200 or any other sum as bonus on that salary, what is the effect of that on the general community?  What is the effect of it on the workman whose wage has been reduced from £2 10s. to 25/-?  There was a question here this afternoon about men drawing 25/- a week.  What is the effect of it on workmen in that position?  It is this. The workman's wage has been reduced from the war figure of £2 10s. to 25/-. That man has to go into a shop, whether it be a grocer's shop, a draper's shop or a boot shop and there compete on his wage of 25/- with the official who is paid a salary of £1,000, plus bonus, in order that he should buy at the pre-war figure.  Hence you have got this position: you have got men, that is to say the tax-paying community&mdash;I do not mind whether they are labourers, farmers, shopkeepers or professional men&mdash;on reduced incomes in every strata and walk of life living on enormously reduced incomes who have to go into the purchasing market and buy in competition with men who have these, in comparison with them, inflated salaries.  Hence you have got this fictitious market and this fictitious economic position driving down the entire community by this <Col N="204" /> impossible burden placed on it.  Hence we are drifting down day by day by adopting and maintaining and, as it were, recommending this fictitious position until ultimately we come to the intolerable position when the general community will be economically put down altogether, in my judgment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HANLON</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief in my criticism of this estimate; in fact I shall not criticise it at all, because, so far as I can see in the matter of criticism of the administration of the State, everybody has been attacking salaries and bonus and, in my opinion, salaries and bonus are the least necessary things to be criticised. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has mentioned in this House the difficulty he has had in getting a census of production throughout the country. The returns are not made.  I think one of the first census of production that we, as representatives of the people, must have, is a census of production in the Government offices by the officials engaged in them, not so much as to their salaries and bonus but as to how much production is given in the offices and whether the salaries paid there are earned.  I belong to the cult that believes in high salaries and wages, always provided the service is satisfactory.  I do not care whether a man is paid £5,000 a year or £500.  He can earn the £5,000 as readily as the £500 if you get the right man for the job.</P>

    <P>The kernel of the whole thing is that setting up a Commission of civil servants to examine their own consciences and to lay them bare before us is not the way to get at the expenditure in Government offices but rather to set up an independent Commission such as Deputy Baxter outlined, composed of men who are sent here to economise and whose duty it will be, to see that every servant of the State, no matter in what department, is earning the money he is paid.  If any department is not doing that, its personnel should be cut down and those doing half a day's work should be let go so that one man at least in every case should do a full day's work.  I do not understand <Col N="205" /> the case as to how we can halve the cost of administration, but I do say it is commonly spoken of.  In the interests of administration and those who are heads of departments, I think it would be very wise to allow an independent Commission to be set up to safeguard themselves and in order that the public may know whether there is overstaffing in offices, and whether the different staffs in the different offices are earning their salaries or not.  If such an independent Commission were set up we would get a proper census of production in Government offices, and we would know whether the administration of the State was cheap or dear.</P>

      <P>We are now discussing a motion for a vote of money to defray the expenditure incurred by the office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  One question raised was that of bonus and salaries of civil servants, and that is a general question that might be raised on the vote for the office of the Minister for Finance.  But seeing that this is the first vote, I think it is not unreasonable to allow that particular matter to be discussed on this Vote.  Deputy Baxter raised the question of an Economy Committee.  He only spoke for three minutes, and he indicated that by way of notice of motion he would give the Dáil an opportunity at an early date of discussing the matter.  But Deputies will realise that we cannot now discuss the merits of the different kinds of Economy Committees.  There may be a tendency to do that, but we cannot do it now, particularly in view of the fact that we are promised on behalf of one of the parties a debate on that particular subject.  We will have to leave that particular matter over.</P>

      <P>I wish to speak on the question of the bonus, as raised by Deputy O'Gorman. I look upon the matter of bonuses in a different light to that of Deputy O'Gorman, because I look upon the question as a matter of increase on the salaries of persons in proportion to the increase in the cost of living.  It comes very strange to some of us to hear the question of bonus raised once again here, because, if I <Col N="206" /> remember rightly, the issue of the bonus was the gist of the issue which Deputy O'Gorman and some others raised at the elections, and they got their answer.</P>

      <P>Viewing the bonus in the proper light, I look upon it as an increase in proportion to the increase in the cost of living.  Yesterday, when the question of unemployment was discussed here, we heard from the Minister for Industry and Commerce that we, on this side, were doing nothing to relieve the position.  If I had an opportunity of speaking then, I would have said that those who had were making no attempt to settle the question, because these people were banded together in the forms of rings, competing against those who looked for an increase in the standard of living, and, if I remember rightly, the people who now ask for the abolition of the bonus are people who themselves believe in the formation of rings.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Gorman and others of his party have now found that they have to meet an increased scale because of the fact that the produce which Deputy O'Gorman and others offer for sale has increased in price, and salaries had to be increased to meet that.  If Deputy O'Gorman and others are able to sell some of their produce at 200 per cent. increase, compared with 1914, the only possible answer is that salaries have to be increased to meet that proportionate increase.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Gorman referred to the bonus, and looked at the matter from the point of view of the bigger salaries.  But the abolition of the bonus on the bigger salaries would mean the abolition of the bonus for people with smaller salaries as well. We have people working in the Department of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, some of whom have a lesser wage than is paid to people working under the Shannon scheme, and if the bonus was abolished in their case many of these people would be working for 15s. or 16s. a week.  We have to look at this matter and recognise that if there is an attempt to abolish the bonus and to save expenditure to the State in that way, some alternative will have to be found to make up for the cut brought about in that way.</P>

      <P>Yes, but give a good return.  I may as well confess at the beginning, to set Deputy Baxter's mind at rest, that I cannot subscribe to the policy of his party, which is that the only way to improve your own position is to worsen everyone else's.  I want to find out from the Minister what <Col N="208" /> is being done by his Department to try to develop and extend industries in the country.  So far as the ordinary man in the street can see, there is very little being done.  Useful work in that direction may be in hands by his Department, but the ordinary man in the street cannot see it.  I am prepared to agree with the President that the proper and most effective way of remedying the unemployment problem is to get our own industries on their feet and to try and get our own people to support home industries and to buy the product of their own country.  I want to suggest that the Government might consider having a publicity campaign in favour of Irish industries. There is no doubt that this is, as we are told, the age of publicity, and there is no doubt that advertising pays, but the trouble in this country, so far as I can see, is that the Irish manufacturers, such as they are, do not advertise. If they do, it is only in a haphazard and slip-shod manner.  There is no combined advertising such as we have in other countries, and it seems to me that it would pay the people of this country to have a systematic and well-thought out plan of publicity in order to try and encourage the people to purchase articles produced in their own country, to keep the money at home, and to try and absorb some of the unemployed.  I think any money that would be spent by the Government on a publicity campaign to try and induce the people of this country to purchase their own goods would be money well spent and would repay the people many times over.  I commend that to the Minister for what it is worth.  What I stood up principally for was to find out from the Minister exactly what his Department is doing to help Irish manufacturers and to encourage the opening up of new industries and the extension and development of existing ones.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to follow on the suggestion of Deputy Morrissey in this matter.  I think it is pretty well recognised that one of the difficulties of Irish manufacturers is to compete in the market with the imported competitive articles and that the greatest difficulty arises from the fact that the public demand the imported articles <Col N="209" /> because they are more familiar with the name of them and perhaps also to a great measure with the method of presentation, packing, and so on.  We are all familiar with, shall I say, the publicity agitation of the publicity agents.  There has been an immense amount of advertisement, naturally supported to a great degree by the newspapers, in favour of publicity and of more expenditure on advertising. The advertisers help the advertisers and the advertising agents promote a campaign for publicity.  Undoubtedly there is a great epidemic of advertising with the consequent effect upon the public mind.  The effect upon the Irish manufacturer is that the greatest advertisers are able to do the greatest amount of business in this country and that Irish traders who are dealing in Irish manufactured articles are not able to create demand because of the competition of more effectively advertised competitive articles which are imported. The fact that, let us say, a British manufacturer or American manufacturer, turns out one hundred or one thousand times the quantity that a competitive Irish manufacturer will turn out makes it possible for that mass-producer to advertise very largely and widely at a low cost per article and the Irish manufacturer is left very much in the dark.</P>
      <P>I want to supplement Deputy Morrissey's suggestion to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and to the Minister for Finance by saying that we should do in this country what is being done in some other countries and tax advertising.  Tax the advertisements which advertise imported articles and use the revenue from those advertisements as funds to advertise Irish-made articles.  That would, I think, go a long way to assist the Irish manufacturer to push his goods in the Irish market and to accustom the Irish consumer to the name, style, and pattern of the Irish products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish producer will inevitably, in my opinion, be forced to think more and more of the Irish market.  In so far as he is looking abroad, until he is well-established in the Irish market, he is not going to have much chance of success.  I think, with Deputy <Col N="210" /> Morrissey, that one of the great needs is to advertise, in Ireland, the produce of Irish manufacturers and that Irish manufacturers ought to be assisted by the State for the purpose of combining the efforts of manufacturers and again I think they ought to be assisted by a fund raised to a great degree out of the revenue produced by a tax on the advertiser of imported and non-Irish manufactured goods.</P>

      <P>Certainly, but it is a proposal that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should examine the situation and consider whether some change should not take place in the policy of his Ministry, and this suggestion is made as one method whereby the change may be brought about.</P>
      <P>There is a paragraph, sub-head H of this Vote, which refers to prizes to be paid by the Departmental Committee on crude alcohol.  There is a reduction in the Estimate.  I think it would be well if we were informed whether there has been any prize given so far, and what are the prospects of any information being given to the public in this matter.  I am not, as is queried, referring to the production of poteen, and I do not think it is the policy of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to frustrate the efforts of the Minister for Finance in this matter and to give prizes for poteen-making.</P>

      <P>There is one matter to which I would like to call the Minister's attention.  He has given us some information with regard to the demand for statistics.  He spoke generally about the query form sent out to firms on which they were to furnish certain statistics.  I have in mind a number of people to whom queries of that kind have been addressed.  In no circumstances could they be described as firms.  I am thinking of small business people&mdash;a cooper who employs nobody but who works in his own little shop, and a carpenter who is in a small way of business.  I have seen some of these query forms, and, to my mind, it is too much to expect people of that kind to give the information <Col N="211" /> asked for.  It is impossible for them to fill the formidable documents sent to them.  One person whom I have in mind, buys timber in small quantities and pays cash for it, as he represents a type that do not get credit. It is impossible to expect persons of that kind to give information as to the amount of timber they purchase in twelve months.  They purchase very little, only buying as they require it. The Minister hopes to get information to aid the census production, but his hopes in that direction are rather unlikely to be fulfilled.  Perhaps when replying he would give information as to how that, situation could be got over.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke about the demand for statistics, but it is a demand which is not met very largely.  Year after year in the last Dáil the Minister was always saying that he hoped to make more statistics available, but we did not get them. Government departments may get them but the ordinary man does not. I would not object to a vote for statistics if such statistics were made available to the people in regard to population, trade, and so on.  We have, so far, got only the first report of the census which was taken a year ago. We are, I think, the only Dominion in the British Commonwealth of Nations which does not produce an annual year-book giving facts and figures as to production, industry, taxation and so on.  They find in Australia, New Zealand, and Canada that these yearbooks are very good propaganda and good advertisement.  It is a great convenience to those who write for the Press to have a book of that character, summing up all information with regard to a particular State, available on their bookshelves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many misstatements are made about, this country which would be corrected if there was some volume of that character available.  In Australia it has been found desirable not only to have a year-book, but also a summarised book which you can carry in your waistcoat pocket, giving all information concerning wages, production <Col N="212" /> and so forth.  I have one of these books and I find it most valuable.  We should do something to get our statistics into the hands and heads of people whose opinions may be of use.  I agree with Deputy Johnson and Deputy Morrissey about the value of advertising and publicity.  There is a form of free publicity which we might get but we are not getting our share of it.  In the morning papers we see large advertisements about South African oranges and grape-fruit issued by the Empire Marketing Board.  We do not produce oranges or grape-fruit.  I have no doubt that the South African products are good and I have no objection to them being advertised in the Dublin and Belfast papers.  We are represented on that Board and we should be getting our share of the advertisements. I am not sure whether the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for External Affairs is responsible.  We should take advantage of every form of publicity. Australia offers an excellent market for our produce, especially whiskey. They import a considerable quantity of whiskey annually.  We do not send them whiskey, but we send them a certain amount of Guinness.  Biscuits are another product which we produce well and we should push them and take advantage of every opportunity of advertising them&mdash;free, if possible, but if not we should pay for it.  The Empire Marketing Board is one way of getting that publicity.  I hope the Executive Council as well as the Minister will be alive to its importance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HORGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>We are asked to vote here a sum to cover the expenses of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, a good deal of which, I understand, has already been spent.  If one is genuinely to criticise the items set out in the Estimate he would have to be fully acquainted with the work of the different departments.  In my opinion it would be next to impossible for any Deputy who is interested in the wellbeing and welfare of the country to say that he would reduce the Estimate by a certain amount because, so far as I can judge, outside this department and, possibly, the Executive Council, nobody has any opportunity of knowing <Col N="213" /> whether they are giving full value for the money voted to them.  I think until the Committee of Investigation, as suggested by Deputy Baxter, is brought into existence and the House and the country made acquainted with the value given for this money by the different departments, you will not be in a position genuinely to analyse these items and say whether good value has been given.</P>
      <P>I think it is at the root of our position in analysing these Estimates to ascertain whether such value is being given.  If it is, it is money well spent; but if not, it ought to be checked. That matter can only be settled through an independent investigation and the sooner such committee is brought into existence the better.  I can honestly say that I cannot conscientiously state that the amounts set out are too great, but I know that the country cannot bear the amount of taxation imposed upon it and that full investigation into Government expenditure is necessary in order that we may start from that bedrock upon which the country can increase and prosper.  I will content myself at present with these few remarks and will await another opportunity to further illustrate my point of view.</P>

      <P>While I agree with Deputy Morrissey that a man should do a good day's work for a good day's wage, still I think that the wages of those who sent me here, owing to the economic state of the country at present, are practically incomparable with those of other classes.  I am referring to the small farmers who produce the greater part of the wealth of the country.  Deputy Quill has advocated a policy which practically means that no matter what salary a man earns, he should get that, or perhaps, more.  I sympathise with that view, and with the Labour Party, if it applies to the man with the shovel or to the man with the pick-axe. I cannot see what sympathy there is between a man earning £1,200 a year and the unfortunate man who works with a shovel on the Clare roads at 35/- a week.  If the people who now have salaries of £1,200 a year or £1,000 a year were brought down to £600 or <Col N="214" /> £800, at which they were glad to get the positions, and if the differences were given in the, reduction of taxation, or in reproductive work, we would be the most happy and prosperous country in Europe.  Deputy Quill talks about 6d. a quart for milk, while 8d. per lb. is being paid for butter in Clare for the last eight years.  In the rural districts the people see very few sixpences for a quart of milk.  Deputy Quill gave the House to understand that the farmers were getting the same price now as they got in war days for their produce. As a matter of fact, prices for produce are as low now as they were in 1910. If a farmer takes a bullock worth £12 to the fair, no matter how that man tries to improve the animal, he cannot make it worth £13.</P>
      <P>In County Clare we have resorts such as Kilkee, Lisdoonvarna, and Mount shannon.  These places are an asset not only to Clare but to Ireland.  Improvements have been made in the different resorts, and the rates of the county have benefited as a result.  However, Clare has been deprived by the Minister of the rates on the Shannon works, although the land on which the works are being erected and on which rates were paid, is being taken from the county.  It is unfair to Clare to deprive the county of the rates on the works when the land on which rates were previously paid has been acquired for the Shannon scheme.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that it will be necessary to have the Appropriation Bill passed by the 1st of August, and as a considerable amount of the money that is being asked for in the Vote must have been spent, we, on these benches, do not intend at this stage to go into as minute or detailed examination of the Estimates as if they were being introduced at the commencement of a financial year.  There are one or two items in this Vote, some of which have already been mentioned, to which I would like to refer.  On the question of bonus I am necessarily in entire agreement with the Minister for Finance.  It would be, first of all, practically impossible to do away with the bonus, and to reduce it would induce those now in the employment of the Civil Service to take <Col N="215" /> advantage of Article 10 of the Treaty. That being the case.  I think it is almost waste of time to mention the matter at all, except that in most of the items in this Vote the bonus has been increased. I am not objecting to the bonus, but I would like to know the reason for the increase.  How is it that the figure in most of the items is higher than it was during the preceding year?  Has the cost of living gone up to the same extent? That seems to be the basis, according to the Minister, upon which the bonus is assessed.</P>
      <P>There is one item under the Statistics Branch, Number Two, Page 223, under the heading &ldquo;Census of Population,&rdquo; where there is a sum of £4,227 allotted for bonus.  This, I understand, was an entirely new branch of the Minister's Department, and I do not know whether these civil servants are temporary or permanent.  If they are merely temporary, I would like to know what is the object of having a bonus at all, and why they are not employed upon a properly established rate of remuneration commensurate with the increased cost of living?  As the Minister for Finance has said, civil servants are different from other classes of employees in that their basic rate of salary has not been increased.  But if the employees I have referred to under this sub-head are merely temporary, why was not a proper basis of wage or salary arrived at, and why was it thought necessary to put down a sum by way of bonus?  Many statements have been made which I think one might admit are slightly outside the range of the discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been stated that nothing can be done by way of proper investigation with a view to reduction of expenditure until an independent inquiry has been made into the whole field of Governmental expenditure.  With the proposals to set up this inquiry I need hardly say I am in complete accord, but at the same time I think it is possible, even during the short time at our disposal before the Appropriation Bill must be sent to the Seanad, at least to draw attention to some of these items and to ask the Minister in charge for an explanation, if he has <Col N="216" /> any to offer, regarding them.  I would like particularly to supplement the question asked by Deputy Morrissey regarding the steps, if any, the Minister has taken towards the encouragement of home industry.  There is no doubt that in certain respects steps have not been taken in that direction.  On the contrary, industries which at one time were thriving and of great value to the country from the point of view of employment, both direct and indirect, have been allowed to reach a stage almost bordering upon destruction.  I refer especially to the brewing and distilling industries. Though new industries may have been started and encouraged, the Government, to my mind, have by their fiscal policy not only neglected but actually assisted in the rapid despoliation of these once thriving industries. The Minister for Finance has refused again this year to reduce the excise duty upon beer and spirits, and he knows as well as everyone else that this policy will inevitably bring about the destruction of these industries.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is in total agreement with the Minister for Finance in this financial policy, and if he is not, then. what has he done or what does he intend to do as Minister for Industry and Commerce to preserve the existing industries or encourage new ones?  In my opinion, it is far better to endeavour to preserve industries that have been tried and proved to be successful in the past than to embark upon new, untried and possibly adventurous schemes the result of which noone can foretell.  I think it is only fair that the Minister should give the House some declaration of policy on behalf of the Government as to their intention in regard to the future.  Do they intend as in the past not only to permit but actually assist the destruction of existing industries, and if so, do they intend in any way, and how, to replace them by new ones?  That, I think, is a broad question which certainly arises directly upon the consideration of the Estimates of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It is a question of policy, and it is a question we are entitled to hear something <Col N="217" /> about from the Minister.  It affects very large numbers of the community. Certainly the brewing and distilling industries not only affect those immediately employed as workmen but affect a very large number of farmers through a very wide area in portions of the country.</P>
    <P>I think it would be well if the Minister could give us some indication as to how he intends through his Department to remedy the conditions of unemployment.  The remedy proposed yesterday by the Labour Party he has absolutely declined.  The proper remedy we all must know and admit for unemployment is nothing in the nature of the dole but the provision of work, and it is surely primarily the business of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his Department to endeavour to do something to provide that work.  It is, of course, the business of the whole Ministry, but I submit that it is particularly the business of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Having refused, as he and his Government did yesterday, to do anything on the lines suggested by Deputy Johnson and others as a temporary expedient, what alternative proposal is he going to make, if any, to meet this problem of unemployment in the way of preserving existing industries or encouraging and creating new ones?</P>

      <P>I think it will be taken more or less as a truism that if one is to set oneself to deal with disease in any way efficaciously, one must be well informed as to the extent of the disease.  When one finds the Minister for Industry and Commerce approaching a certain problem in what one must describe as a very ill-informed fashion, one cannot come to any other conclusion than that the disease is not going to be dealt with efficaciously or properly, and is not likely to be cured. If the administration of the Minister's Department were to be taken as typical of parliamentary institutions, one would be almost inclined to despair of the utility of these institutions.  The attitude of mind that the Minister has exhibited on many occasions towards various problems makes one almost despair <Col N="218" /> of criticising on the Estimates any portion of his administration.</P>
      <P>On more than one occasion in connection with this matter of statistics relative to the extent of unemployment, he has said, &ldquo;Why do they not register?&rdquo; It is on that phrase alone that I want to say whatever little I have to say.  The Minister's attitude of mind when approaching this problem will show in what fashion the Department he controls will collect the information. Why do they not register?  Whenever he approached this problem the Minister dealt with figures as mere symbols completely removed from any connection with human happiness, or any connection with human life.  He gave us dissertations on percentages and graphs and decimals and other such things, just as if these things were to be taken apart from the human problem that faces the country.</P>
      <P>I will give the Minister one or two reasons why people do not register, and they are reasons that ought to be self-evident to any Minister who takes a real interest in the work of the Department he controls.  Let us take the case of a road-worker who is lucky or unlucky enough, just as the case presents itself, to have two or three acres of land.  He works on the road for five or six weeks, or perhaps three months of the year, and gets unemployment insurance stamps.  The amount of money allocated for the portion of the road he works runs out, and he is unemployed. He hands in his card at the Labour Exchange, and proceeds to sign the prescribed number of times.  At the end of three or four weeks he is told he does not fulfil the statutory conditions. Generally such a man does not know what is meant by statutory conditions; he is not quite sure whether it means he is short in chest measurement, in his height, or what.  He goes home and makes an appeal, and he has, perhaps, to be taken over such a distance as from Ennis to Limerick.  Probably he foots that journey.  Is that man likely to register again, or are any men in a similar position likely to register again?  They find they are put to more expense by having to register, and it might be just as well if they were not insured at all.</P>

      <Col N="219" /> Such cases as I have referred to are semi-urban or semi-rural cases.  Has the Minister taken into account the cases that arise in towns?  Does he know the conditions that exist in towns?  Is he aware, as I am, that people steal out to early Mass so that the condition of their clothing may not be discernible to their neighbours? Does the Minister know that poverty, naked and unabashed, runs through the land, and is he aware that there are many people who have no desire to remain barefooted and almost naked in a queue for the purpose of signing their names?  Is this the fashion in which the Minister proposes to collect unemployment statistics?</P>
    <P>The Minister asks why they do not register, at the same time knowing nothing about them.  Furniture and clothing for men of the Minister's type have only one duty to perform.  Furniture and clothing for people of the kind I refer to have several functions to perform. Very often the furniture has to perform the function of being the barricade against utter starvation for men and their wives and children.  I hope that the Minister will consider that human factor, and change his attitude of mind when he next approaches this problem.  I hope he will endeavour to procure proper statistics to present to the Dáil and the country in regard to the unemployment problem.  That is the only matter I desire to refer to at the moment.</P>
    <P>I want to find out the Minister's attitude of mind&mdash;and that is very important&mdash;towards collecting these statistics.  I am anxious to know whether he is going to introduce any other machinery in order to get these statistics.  If a man is unemployed why not get him to post a card to the Labour Exchange and have it marked up there, and why not arrange that the officials would make surprise calls in order to ascertain if the man is or is not employed?  Surely the Minister has a sufficient number of officials for this purpose, and it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that the Minister could fashion some scheme under which all unemployed people could register <Col N="220" /> in a simpler fashion.  The present system is preventing a lot of people from registering, and I ask the Minister in future not to exhibit an attitude displaying such an evident divorce from the realities of the situation.  He should approach this subject in a fashion entirely different from that in which he approaches it at present.</P>

      <P>I rise merely to put right a matter raised by Deputy Redmond.  The Deputy referred to bonuses connected with the Statistics Branch (Census of Population).  It is quite apparent that a new branch has been set up to deal with that matter, and a number of officers have been allocated to it.  There were 38 clerical officers appointed and 26 writing assistants.  The total of the salaries is small and the bonus is set out at £4,227.</P>

      <P>I do not know what was the point of order the Deputy raised.  Perhaps he is new to all this matter, as is also Deputy Redmond, inasmuch as since he took his seat in 1923, Deputy Redmond has never questioned an estimate.  This is the first time he has done so, and of course we will forgive him for not knowing all about it.  Some twelve months or two years ago I was informed that portion of those bonuses is made up of a gratuity to the Civic Guard for their assistance in compiling statistics.  I am not now speaking for the department; the department can speak for itself.  I recognise that this is not the time for criticising and questioning as to whether one class of committee or another is the best to deal with this. The question of a Committee of Investigation will, I think, come up in some form.  I think the proper form will be on the Minister's personal vote.  I <Col N="221" /> think that is the proper place to discuss this.  I shall leave it at that.  I have not altered my view-point with regard to the bonus.  I still hold the view-point that I held three or four years ago.  Whatever influence I have I will exercise it in that direction.  I do not agree with the bonus.  I also notice here that a few sub-heads are being decreased and a few sub-heads increased.  I think the one more or less explains the other.  I do not know that I should occupy more of the time of the Dáil than I have occupied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BECKETT</NameTxt>
      <P>My first attempt to address the Dáil is quite a new experience to me, and I must ask you, Sir, kindly to pull me up if at any moment I overstep the rules of order or decorum.  I say that because, while I have listened with great interest to the discussions and debates in the House so far, you will perhaps have some patience with me if, in the very short time I have been here, I have not been able to absorb all the rules and regulations of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards this question which is before the Dáil at the moment, I must say that I have the greatest sympathy with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is asked to carry on his own shoulders, as it were, the greatest load that this old country of ours at the moment has to bear.  It seems to me that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is being asked to work miracles.  I would suggest to every member of the Dáil that he should put his back into this question of unemployment. We want a new view-point. We want to learn what are the fundamentals governing this question of unemployment. I would suggest to the House that the fundamentals or the foundations of our social life are the ability or the inability of this country to pay wages.  In making that statement I would like to give a definition of what I mean by the word &ldquo;wage.&rdquo; I mean the payment to our fellowman in whatever department of life he is for the work he gives to us.  I have the honour of earning my wage in the payment of wages to a considerable extent for a number of years in this old city of ours.  I contend that that is the only <Col N="222" /> thing that I or any other member of the community can beneficially spend money on.  You cannot pay nature for what she gives us.  We can pay our fellowman.  We can pay the farmer. We can pay the farm labourers for taking from nature and saving for us the blessings of nature.  I am glad to feel that I am in very great sympathy with the Deputies on the other side of the House in this matter, but I would like to go very much deeper into the subject than, so far as I have been able to follow the debate, they have gone. We have got to go right down to the foundations of things.</P>
    <P>This House has been appointed by the country to look after its greatest interests.  The biggest interest at the moment is to find out how the country can give employment, not only to all our workers, but how we can create a future for the employment of our lads and lasses who are growing up.  We have in this State an asset.  Every pound we pay in wages is an asset to this State.  Every pound we pay outside the State is an asset to those to whom we pay it.  I often think it is like dropping a stone into a pool.  I pay a wage to one of my workmen.  I am paid my own wage for the purpose of paying that wage to the workers. When I pay that wage it is as if I dropped a stone into a pool.  Every part of that pool is affected by the stone that has been thrown in.  It is just the same with the nation.  That illustration is the best I can give.</P>
    <P>I say the rate that I pay to my workmen benefits every member of the community. I say the greatest need that we have at the moment is to bring the industries of the country into closer touch with the Government.  By industries I mean every activity in the country in which wages are paid.  We have had suggestions here to-day that committees will be suggested and appointed to inquire into economies in expenditure.  I suggest to this House that the biggest job and the most whole-hearted job for every member of this House, is a committee to inquire into the industries of the country.  The industries seem to have waned.  Some of them are dead, <Col N="223" /> or almost dead.  These are the greatest asset to the country, and they can be made to live again, granted the absence of antagonisms.</P>
    <P>Suggestions have been made that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is in a position in which he can wave a magic wand and bring these industries to life.  I should be very sorry if that were the outlook.  We want to look at the matter from a different aspect.  We want to have a different outlook from that.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is anxious, I am sure, to do the very best for his country, but he must do what this House instructs him to do.  In these discussions, as regards the employment of our fellow-workers in this country, I would like to identify myself with the workers of this country.  I feel I am myself a worker.  I have been a hard worker all my life.  I feel somewhat strange sitting here on these benches away from my work, but, inasmuch as I intend to put in good work here, which I hope will be successful in doing something for my fellow-workers, I am glad to be here. If I find after a due trial that it is impossible for me to do something in this new office in which I have been placed by the electors of South Dublin, I will retire and do my best again in my natural sphere.  You will, perhaps, excuse my hesitating utterances, and the Deputies of the House will, perhaps, excuse them.  It has never been my privilege to speak before in an assembly of this kind.  I feel it a great honour.  I can assure the Deputies of this House that my heart is in this matter, and I wish to say that I want to see, more than anything else at the moment, unemployment reduced in our country.</P>

      <P>I would like to take this opportunity of drawing the Minister's attention to something affecting his own Department.  I trust that the Minister will be sympathetic towards those who are amongst the unemployed, as sympathetic as the Deputy who has just sat down.  Some few months ago the Minister found it necessary to issue an order to the Commissioners of the Dublin Corporation, intimating to them <Col N="224" /> that they were precluded from carrying out any further extensions or any other works in connection with the electricity undertaking, unless they had first received the authority of his Department. So definite was that order from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that the Commissioners, in consultation with the heads of the Electricity Department, were compelled to close down certain works which were proceeding at the time.  The result was that 150 men were immediately thrown out of employment.</P>

      <P>What are the facts? To be fair to the Minister, I should say that prior to to-day he said it was unnecessary that these 150 men should be unemployed.  But what were the statements made to the representatives of these 150 men by those who are, if not under the control of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, under the control of the Minister for Local Government?  Their statement was that, because of the adamant attitude of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, if they permitted the carrying on of another piece of work, no matter how small, the expense would be surcharged against them.</P>

      <P>I am not proceeding on any assumption.  I am making a definite statement of fact.  Even the Minister has admitted that my statement, up to the present, has been in <Col N="225" /> accord with fact, because he admits that 150 men were thrown out of employment and he says it was unnecessary that they should be.  My point is that these men would not have been thrown out of employment if the Minister for Industry and Commerce was more sympathetically disposed towards members of the working class and towards the employees in this case.  If the Minister had been more sympathetic, he would have secured that several weeks would not have elapsed before those 150 men were reinstated.  If that had been done, necessary work would not have cost more than it should have cost.  Owing to the suspension, additional expenditure was incurred which could have been obviated.  If the Commissioners or the heads of the Electricity Department were responsible, there was still a duty on the Minister.  If the persons responsible had misrepresented the Minister's intentions, and if he had put his intentions clearly before them, it should not have been the 150 unfortunate workmen, who had nothing to say to the quarrel as between the Minister and the Commissioners, who should have suffered.  I mention the matter so that if there is a difference between the Minister and the Commissioners or the heads of the Department on another occasion, there may not be a repetition of what occurred in this case.  It was a callous thing to throw 150 men out of employment and to permit them to remain on the streets for several weeks because somebody else had blundered.</P>

      <P>I rose a few minutes ago to express my pleasure at hearing Deputy Beckett's speech and to express my relief to find that the views of the new Deputies of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party are not all like those of Deputy McDonogh, as regards this question of unemployment.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, presumably, has a duty to keep, so far as he can, employment fairly regular throughout the year and to promote it to the highest degree possible.  I want to draw attention as a matter, shall I say, of warning, to the procedure within Government Departments last year, in the hope that the Minister for <Col N="226" /> Industry and Commerce will use his in fluence to avoid a repetition this year. Yesterday the Minister for Finance replied to a question of mine regarding the amount of money, out of the voted sums and the Central Fund grant which had not been spent, though authorised to be spent last year.  In December the Minister for Finance, replying to questions, quoted from the Estimates certain items, the total of which was £3,185,000, to which were added £1,150,000, in respect of road grants, and £1,675,000 in respect of Shannon scheme expenditure. The total was £6,000,000 odd, which were asserted to be moneys likely to promote employment in the Saorstát. That figure of £6,000,000 was quoted as a defence of Government policy in regard to this general problem of unemployment. It was made the basis, more or less, of propaganda on the part of the Government as to what had been done by the Government for the promotion of employment in the country. In December, when quoting that figure of £6,000,000 odd, the Minister said: &ldquo;As far as we can, we will speed up the spending of the money.&rdquo;  In December, we were told that there had been a sum of £2,217,000 spent up to that date and that there would probably be expended in the remaining portion of the year £2,364,000, making a total of £4,582,000 out of the £6,000,000 which had been announced as made available for expenditure during the year.  That was leaving a sum of £1,200,000 which it was unlikely would be spent, according to the Minister for Finance in December.  But in reply to urgings from these benches, the Minister for Finance promised that every effort would be made to speed up the expenditure of any sum that could be spent in the remaining three months of the year.  Yesterday, the Minister told us that out of £4,800,000&mdash;which included a certain additional sum which he hoped might have been spent on road grants out of money saved in previous years&mdash;which he anticipated would be spent after his efforts in speeding up, there was actually only spent £4,015,000, so that, in fact, we had practically £2,000,000 not spent last year on undertakings likely to promote employment in the Saorstát, <Col N="227" /> notwithstanding that the House had given permission to spend that £2,000,000.</P>
      <P>We have a large number of estimates before us to-day.  These estimates do not amount to the sum voted last year in this connection.  As a matter of fact, on the voted moneys I make the calculation that there is very nearly one million pounds less to be spent on services likely to promote employment than there was last year.  But I want to press upon the Minister for Industry and Commerce the view that it should be part of his function in the coming months to urge on other Ministers that all moneys voted for the promotion of employment should be spent, so long as they can be spent economically, that it is not right that Ministers should come to the House for six million pounds and proclaim to the country that so much is to be spent at their instigation on services likely to promote employment, and then, six months afterwards, to say that they spent only two-thirds of it.  If the House is asked to vote moneys it should be somebody's duty to ensure that those moneys are spent within the year for which they are voted, so long as they can be spent economically.  I merely take this opportunity to impress on the Minister for Industry and Commerce that if the Minister for Finance, or any other Minister; fails to keep his promises he should assist such Minister in the spending of these moneys, which are so urgently needed for the purpose of promoting employment.</P>

      <P>I would like briefly to refer to sub-head I (1), dealing with the grant-in-aid of the expenses of the International Organisation of the League of Nations.  It will be noted that there is a decrease in the amount under this sub-head.  I hope we are not to take that as an indication of the Minister's intention to take a less active part in the work of the Organisation, although I note that the amount in the following sub-head remains the same.  I have had an opportunity of seeing the work of the Organisation at Geneva, and I recognise the value of it. <Col N="228" /> I think any Deputy who has taken part In its work will recognise that it is doing good work.  In the discussion on unemployment yesterday, the Minister referred to the difficulties encountered in building up industries and to the competition that our industries must meet.  He pointed out that our produce enters into competition with the produce of other countries.  In this connection it is well to bear in mind that the real work of the International Labour Organisation lies in setting up certain minimum industrial conditions all over the world, and this State should actively participate in that good work.  We know the amount of competition that we have to face, especially in regard to the produce of Eastern countries, where the pay of labour is very low.  The work of the International Labour Organisation is undoubtedly raising industrial conditions in those countries and so helping to dispose of the competition which exists on account of very lowly-paid labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The value of the conventions and recommendations, and of the work generally that is being done in Geneva, will be lost if the work is not followed up and completed by the various national assemblies.  It is well to bear in mind that the Office in Geneva looks to the various national assemblies to see whether or not its work is appreciated. The fact that numbers of conventions have not been ratified by various countries is constantly referred to by the Office as an indication of lack of appreciation of its work by the national assemblies concerned.  For that reason I would urge on the Minister that he should adopt the various recommendations and conventions that have been arrived at.  I would refer, in this connection, to the convention adopted in 1925, dealing with the prohibition of night work in bakeries. That should not present very much difficulty to the Minister's Department, because it is a fact that by agreement between the employers' and the workers' organisations, night baking has practically ceased in this State. Therefore it should not present very much difficulty to the Minister to bring in legislation that would make this prohibition <Col N="229" /> effective.  I hope that the Minister will adopt the conventions and recommendations of the Office, more particularly the convention dealing with the prohibition of night baking, and that he will be able to announce that at an early date he will bring in legislation to ratify that convention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take advantage of this Vote, which includes the Minister's salary, to protest against the Government's go-as-you-please policy and against its failure to control or to regulate the country's transport system.  Previous to the dissolution of the last Dáil the transport system was partially under the control of the Minister for Local Government and of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, while the Minister for Justice had some share of responsibility for the administration of certain laws affecting it.  Under the extension of Executive responsibility, all Ministers being equally responsible on questions of policy relating to this matter, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce being, if possible, more responsible than anybody else, I want to put certain questions before the House and to invite Deputies to express their views upon the administration of the laws passed by this House, and on the failure of the Government, as a whole, to produce any transport policy.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has been tinkering with the railway side of the transport problem.  He was responsible in the last Dáil for the introduction of three or four measures. One of these forced the amalgamation of the railways wholly situated within the Free State, another repealed certain clauses of that Act which gave pension rights to men who lost their employment on account of the amalgamation, and a third was the Railways Omnibus Act, which gave certain rights to the railway companies to run motor buses in certain parts of the country over approved routes and under very severe restrictions regarding fares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am raising this question because it affects the administration of laws already passed and regulations made by the Department, and because of the failure of the Department to insist upon <Col N="230" /> the administration of these laws, which failure has resulted, as far as the railway services are concerned, in the disemployment of almost three thousand railwaymen.  On the hustings during the elections, and in the House the other day, the President appealed to Deputies and to citizens to support Irish manufactures, to do all that they possibly could to help in the establishment of Irish industries, presumably, from the labour point of view, by giving away certain rights and conditions of service.  I wonder what the President has to say with regard to the huge amount of money that has been and is still being exported for the purchase of motor buses, which are being brought in, in some cases, by foreign capitalists, put on the roads and allowed to run where they like, at whatever speed they like, and to charge whatever fares they like.  If the President wants to put his own policy into operation and wants to reduce the adverse trade balance and give more employment, let him deal with the situation that we find ourselves confronted with to-day of millions of money going out of the country to purchase motor buses, thus depriving our workingmen of necessary employment.  I am sorry the President has left the House, but the Minister for Industry and Commerce, no doubt, will speak for him, as he is jointly responsible. I referred to the fact that the Ministry has not carried out the laws and regulations for which the Government is responsible.  There is a number of bus companies, financed in some cases by foreign capitalists, operating in this country.  I have gone to the trouble to get information in order to try and prove my case, because when I raised this matter twelve months ago and suggested that these buses were exceeding the speed limit the Minister for Justice took exception to my statement and said I was exaggerating the position. I am therefore going to put before the House a few cases to prove that what I said twelve months ago is correct.</P>
    <P>The time-table of the Magnet Bus Company shows that a bus leaves Longford, 76 miles from Dublin, at I p.m. and is due to arrive in Dublin at 4.21 p.m.  This works out at an all-over average speed of over 22 miles per hour. <Col N="231" /> What the speed must be on certain stretches of road can be guessed from the fact that the time-table shows six official stopping places between Longford and Dublin.  Apart from these official stopping places, it is well known that most of these buses stop at every town and village along the whole route. Yet an all-over average speed of 22 miles per hour is observed.  A bus leaves Mullingar at 2.6 p.m. and is due in Dublin at 4.20 p.m.  Mullingar is 50 miles from Dublin, so that doing the journey in 2¼ hours, which includes stopping places, leaves an all-over average of over 22 miles. The legal speed limit is 12 miles per hour.  There are buses running long distances between Dublin and Longford and Dublin and Mullingar at an all-over average speed of 22 miles per hour, without making any allowance for the stopping places.</P>
    <P>Again, a bus leaves Dublin at 8.30 a.m. and gets into Kinnegad, 39 miles away, at 10.10 a.m.&mdash;an average speed of over 23 miles per hour, although there are seven official stopping places. The greatest violation of all is, perhaps, in the case of the buses plying between Cavan and Dublin.  A bus is timed to leave Cavan at 8 a.m., and reaches Dublin, 85 miles away, at 11.30 a.m., representing an average speed of 27 miles per hour, although there are 14 official stopping places between the two points.  What has the Minister to say to the way in which the law is being abused by those foreign capitalists who run buses brought into this country?</P>

      <P>I am quoting the railway mileage.  I claim the right to deal with this matter, because it concerns unemployment and is an abuse of the law, and because the unlimited facilities given to bus owners here has resulted in the unemployment of about 3,000 railway men.  I will now deal with another route.  I had the pleasure of pursuing a bus on the route from Dublin to Limerick recently and trying to catch it up.  I told the Minister a story yesterday in connection with that. Although I was riding in a fairly good motor car, I was unable to catch up on this bus on the journey between Monasterevan and Portlaoighise.  The time table is circulated; and can be procured by the Minister or any Deputy, and I am relying on the time table to prove that there is an abuse of the law by these bus owners and companies which must be stopped by the Government or by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who has a share of the responsibility. There is a bus running between Dublin and Limerick and Limerick and Dublin.  I am not going into all the details, but the time table, which is officially circulated, and can be procured at Eason's bookstalls for 2d. or 3d., if the Minister does not know the facts already, shows that this bus leaves Dublin at 6 o'clock in the evening, and is due to reach Limerick at 11.20 p.m.  There is one stop in Roscrea, half-way between Dublin and Limerick, where, according to the time table, the bus stops for fifteen minutes, to get water, I suppose, and cool the engine after the effects of exceeding the speed limit.  In other words, the distance is covered, making allowance for one stop of fifteen minutes at one of the ten stopping points, in a period of five hours.  The Minister can see that in that case, making no allowance for the time lost at any other stopping point, the average all-over speed is 24 miles per hour.</P>

    <P>I want to know from the Minister now, and I think this is the only opportunity I shall have before the Estimates are finished, when he proposes to introduce the promised Transport Bill, which he gave the House to understand before the dissolution was likely to be introduced to deal with the situation. <Col N="233" /> The Minister was responsible for the passing of an Act which gave the railway companies the right to run buses under very severe restrictions and regulations.  By his failure to carry out the law, he is allowing these foreign capitalists to come in here and destroy the railway systems, and thus create unemployment, which could be avoided if there were equally restrictive regulations applied to the other bus owners in this country.  I understand also that on the North side of Dublin young boys under 18 years of age are being employed as conductors on buses, presumably at a rate of wages which would not bear comparison with the wages paid by the railway companies.  I should like to know from Deputy Baxter, the leader of the Farmers' Party, or some of the Deputies of that Party, whether the farmers, who according to Deputy Baxter are carrying the whole weight of the country on their backs, carrying everybody else on their backs, are prepared to tolerate a system which will compel the ratepayers, as it did last year, to provide the sum of £1,199,567 from the rates to bolster up this cut-throat competition by buses run by foreign capital against the railway system in this country.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce fixed the capital of the Great Southern Railways Company at £27,000,000, all of which, I think it will be agreed, was subscribed in this country.  He is now allowing foreign capitalists to come in and destroy that railway system which he himself has set up, and which is working under very severe regulations made by the Minister.  He is allowing it to be ruined at the expense of the railway shareholders, the railway users and the railway workers.</P>
    <P>I asked to-day for figures as to the cost of maintenance of the roads, and, according to the figures given to me. the sum of £1,199,567 was provided out of the rates, at the expense of the farmers presumably; the Government provided, by way of grants, the sum of £813,865; and the revenue from motor taxation amounted in the last financial year to £616,207.  I am not to be taken as entering an objection to the provision of proper roads in this country. I think there is certainly need for better <Col N="234" /> roads than we have, but I say that the cost of the maintenance of these roads must be borne in a fair proportion by those who make most use or cause most abuse of these roads.  I contend that the bus-owners of the country who are ignoring the laws made by our present Government, without any interference, should be and must be called upon to pay a greater share of the cost of maintenance of the roads, if we are to have fair competition amongst the people who provide transport in this country.</P>
    <P>There are other people who have probably greater interests in the railways than I have, but I am speaking on this occasion in order that other members who may hold views on this matter may give expression to these views for the guidance and the information of the Minister.  If this system is allowed to go on, if it is tolerated much longer, there will be a chaotic and a cut-throat competition which the Minister, later on, will find it impossible to control.  It is time that some check should be put on the people who are ignoring the laws. If the Minister wants to prevent unemployment he will have to deal with the bus owners who are ignoring the laws and, by ignoring the laws, are crippling the railway industry, with the result that thousands of railwaymen, from year to year, even from week to week, are being thrown out of employment. I have not heard from the Minister, and I think it is his duty to give the information to the House, as to when he proposes to introduce the Transport Bill.</P>
    <P>We have been told that an InterDepartmental Committee&mdash;I believe the Minister referred to it as a Traffic Committee&mdash;has been set up under certain terms of reference to give-advice to the Minister, but the peculiar thing about the setting up of the Committee is that it consists of officials of different departments, and it has been set up to give advice to a Department which, as far as I can gather, has no general policy itself on the question of transport.  If the Government want the Committee to give them advice they should first of all give the Committee some outline, of the policy which the <Col N="235" /> Ministry as a whole is prepared to pursue.  The Ministry should delay making their pronouncement of policy no longer.  The interests of railway users, railway shareholders and railwaymen are at stake, and the Minister should make some pronouncement as to what the future intentions of the Ministry are in regard to the general problem of transport and the regulation and control of those who use the roads at present.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance has made a statement on the question of the bonus raised by Deputy O'Gorman.  I do not want to say very much about it, except just to add a little to what the Minister for Finance has stated as to the number of public servants who were transferred and who have Treaty rights.  Out of every 18 permanent civil servants in this country, 16 have Treaty rights, and if Deputy O'Gorman and Deputy McMenamin proceed to put into force the policy they seem to have outlined we will arrive at a state of things which, to use the words of Deputy McMenamin himself, would be more fallacious and more erroneous and lead to a greater state of financial despondency than that which we have at present.  Sixteen out of eighteen permanent civil servants have Treaty rights and cannot be interfered with in the matter of bonus.  There is a further point apart from that fact which precludes any handling of that matter&mdash;that justice demands that a bonus should be paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Justice demands that it should be paid.  The civil servant was not given the advantage of the boom years.  The civil servant did not get his salary raised when prices were high.  When the farmer was enjoying big prices for his produce and the business man big prices for his goods, the civil servant was prevented from feeling the good effects of the boom years; therefore he should be equally spared the severity of the slump years.  That is what I call the justice of the case.  The cost-of-living figure on which the bonus is regulated stands at <Col N="236" /> about 90 at the moment.  Still the bonus by no means represents the increase in the cost of living to a man if you take his salary in 1914.  I will take one example.  Take a man with a basic salary of £500.  He does not get now a bonus of £450, which would be 90 per cent. more.  He gets £221 of a bonus. With regard to the taxation deducted from the salary plus bonus, it is also severe.  A man with a salary of £500 in 1914 paid income tax of £12 15s., leaving his net salary £487 5s.  His total salary now is £721, and on that he has to pay an income tax of £80, so that his net salary is £641.  It is quite clear that this man, drawing a salary of £641 under the conditions that prevail now, is a great deal worse off than a man drawing £487 in 1914.  That is as to the arguments on the justice side of the case.</P>
      <P>There has been a whole lot of talk, the usual misleading talk, as to savings. The Minister for Finance made a calculation in his speech on the Budget before the last, in which he said that if 20 per cent. reduction were made on the salaries of all civil servants in receipt of £500, and if an additional 20 per cent. reduction were made on those who had £700 and upwards, the saving would not allow him to give a reduction of one-fifth of a penny in the sugar duty.  That is the net saving that would be represented by the injustice that Deputy O'Gorman and Deputy McMenamin would like to have.  When Deputy McMenamin speaks of an increase, I wonder does he want his idea of a reduction to apply all round? Deputy McMenamin is a barrister. Have barristers' fees been raised since 1914?</P>

      <P>If Deputy McMenamin wishes me to take up Deputy Redmond's point as to practising barrister's income.  I would have to ask for facts as to Deputy McMenamin's practice and what he draws from that: what he gets from his actual practice at the Bar with regard to fees.  When I get that answer I will be able to make some evaluation as to what he knows.  We will then be able to evaluate the evidence he can give on this point.  I reiterate my statement that legal people in general, and people in the profession which the two Deputies represent, which is one branch of the legal profession, had in fact their fees increased, and are therefore in the enjoyment of greater fees. I do not know if these two Deputies <Col N="238" /> will stand for a reduction in them, or move a motion before the Bar Council that barristers should not be allowed to receive in fees more than what they normally did in 1914.  I would like to see what kind of reception they would get from the Bar Council if they proposed it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMENAMIN Mr. McMENAMIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMENAMIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I never suggested anything of the kind either.  I only asked for a statement of policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Redmond was quite clear about that.  I was stating that the salaries of civil servants could not be interfered with on account of Treaty rights.  Deputy Redmond intervened when I was talking of barristers, and that was my only reference to him.  Deputy McMenamin certainly left the House under the impression with all his talk about an erroneous and fallacious policy and of the state of financial despondency we were in, that he stood for a reduction. At any rate, if he wants a statement of policy, he gets it now.  As a matter of justice, as far as I am concerned I hold that it would be quite wrong to interfere with the bonus, and as a matter of policy it cannot be done whether one regards it as just or unjust.  To interfere with it would leave the second state much worse than what the present state is.  Sixteen out of eighteen civil servants could apply to retire and get Treaty conditions.  They would be able to go out and draw a pension for the rest of their lives without doing any work, and the Civil Service would have to be staffed all over again under the new conditions of decreased pay, which would not get us anything great in the way of talent.  There was only one thing in the statement made by Deputy O'Hanlon that I object to.  He left the House under the impression that he would welcome an inquiry, and said that when we had the result of that inquiry people would know whether they were getting value for their <Col N="239" /> money or not.  He indicated prima facie the belief that we were not getting value, but that to my mind was balanced by his other statement that you could get as good work out of a man by paying him £5,000 a year as by paying another man £500 a year, because that is in complete contrast to the ordinary statements made with regard to pay for civil servants.  There has been a pretty definite propaganda and move to single civil servants and public officials out in a particular way.  The idea seems to be prevalent through the country that it is hardly possible to imagine a public servant who is worth more than about £1,200 or, in an exceptional case, about £1,500.  If we are to have that sort of mind ruling in the country it must go further than the civil servants.</P>
      <P>There will be the logical corollary to that, that there ought to be a steeply graded super tax on all incomes of £1,500 and over so that the State would get everything earned over £2,000 a year.  You cannot apply a reduction of that kind to public servants only, and not apply it to people in other walks of life, such as those in commerce and professional life. You cannot reduce the salaries of judges and allow the salaries of counsel to remain as they are.  You cannot expect to have a judge sitting on the Bench at a salary of £1,000 a year and have counsel appearing before him earning three times that amount.  You will have to have a general close down all round.  Deputy O'Hanlon stated that he was opposed to that.  Deputy O'Hanlon said he was in favour of a Committee being set up to see whether the country was getting value for its money.  He was in favour of an inquiry being set up so that we could see whether or not a prima facie case could be made in regard to the charge that is constantly being made: whether a civil servant does in fact give value for his money.  There was an inquiry of the same sort held elsewhere, and the decision was in favour of the civil servants.</P>

      <P>That was not an inquiry conducted by civil servants. <Col N="240" /> I say that it would be in their own interests to have an independent inquiry set up.  The result of such an inquiry would set at rest the idea in the public mind, held rightly or wrongly, that the cost of administration is too high.</P>

My opinion is that the salary of a civil servant, no matter how high the position he holds is, should bear some proportion and relation to the income of the average citizen in the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different point also which is not a popular one: the capacity of the average citizen with regard to earning; because otherwise I think the Deputy would be in agreement with me that if you make a decision on the one hand that the country can only bear earnings of so much, that has to apply to business all round and not merely to the public service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidLeoOGorman" hpid="Mr. O'GORMAN Mr. O'GORMAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'GORMAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated before that in business the payment of bonus was abandoned long ago, but now, as we are having an across-the-table debate I might point out to the Minister that I am strongly of opinion, and the public agree with me, that it is absurd and unjust to add a bonus of £263 to a salary of £1,000 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a point of view that has to be countered in this country, a view from which no good can come.  It would simply mean that you are not going to employ people of bigger brain capacity than £1,000 will remunerate.  In that way there lies <Col N="241" /> disaster for the country.  It will mean that the English Civil Service, as before, mil be manned by the best brains of this country, and that the best brains of this country will not remain here to enter the public service.  Deputy O'Brien asked me with regard to a return of the unemployed.  There is of course a classification dealing with the unemployed, but it comes under sub-head K.  Parts of the country have already been classified according to the various occupations and according to industry.  No return has been made in any part of the country with regard to industrial status, unemployment or dependency. They fall into groups that will be dealt with later.  I am not sure when the volume on that can be promised.  The earlier volume that I spoke of has been promised for this year, but I doubt if the unemployment section will come into that period.  It is being dealt with, however late it may appear.</P>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Johnson spoke of the matter of what the Department is doing to develop existing industries.  Before I come to deal with the details of that, I object to the point of view to which Deputy Johnson gave expression that it is any part of my business as head of the Department of which I am Minister to see that all the moneys voted are spent.  I protested in this House before, and I protest again, against that view that I am Minister for Employment.  I am Minister for the Department which happens to control the unemployment insurance code and fund, and I have certain relations with unemployment in that regard. I have further to do with industry and commerce, but if there is employment outside and beyond industry and commerce, then that is no part of my special function and no part of my special duty.  It is no part of my duties to see that all the moneys voted in this House for road-making which comes within the area of transport services should be spent, even though it may be said that that money provides employment.  That is no part of my task, and it is one which I refuse to accept here and now.</P>

      <P>I do not think it comes within the scope of the present Vote and consequently is no part of my duty, and that, I think, is a verdict in my favour.  I have been asked what is being done with regard to the development and extension of industries, and Deputy Morrissey threw out a hint in favour of a publicity campaign in favour of Irish industries.  The plan referred to is one amongst the earliest that were discussed when trying to help Irish manufacturers, and in giving that publicity it was suggested that there should be a tax upon the advertisement of foreign goods, but that particular way would lead to the definite prohibition of English newspapers in this country or the putting of a tax upon them.  It would have other reactions possibly not clear to Deputies.  The Deputy threw out <Col N="243" /> that suggestion, but so far it is not practicable to adopt that particular device.  There is a further point.  Most Irish manufacturers will tell you&mdash;I believe it is only when they are in a despondent vein that they say this&mdash;that they have from time to time, and very often, to ask the retailers not to admit that the goods that they have are Irish manufacture or else they will not be sold.  As I say, I believe that it is only when they are in a despondent vein they say that, but I know a case to my own knowledge where the matter was tried out for a period of some weeks and where certain boots were bought, and bought without objection, when not advertised as Irish made, but were refused when definitely put before their customers as being of Irish manufacture.</P>

      <P>I think there is necessity for entering upon a campaign directed in another way.  The question was asked one time as to how far trade unions were going to co-operate in any matter of pushing Irish manufactured goods.  Let us take the case of one particular item, namely, matches. Matches made in this country are quite as good, and you get as many to the box and as many boxes to the holder as imported matches from other countries, yet the fact remains that Irish matches are not bought to the extent that they should be, and the reason is that the retailer gets some very small extra profit on a certain amount of matches sold.  It is a small percentage and, apparently, that is handed over to the assistant in order that he may push the matches, because it has been my own experience that you get foreign matches pushed upon you to the exclusion of the Irish.</P>

      <P>No tariff could help a commodity which does not at all complain of underselling in the sense that there is less price for the article.  It is a matter of unfair competition owing to the fact that retailers' assistants push foreign matches as against the home matches.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that retailers can get foreign matches at from 6½d. to 7½d. per dozen boxes whereas they have to pay 9½d. for Irish matches?  I would like to know if the Minister has any ground for the suggestion that assistants are paid part of the profits by the shop-owner to push foreign matches against Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have given an answer.  I am taking comparable boxes of matches. The same number of boxes in the container.  Therefore there is no such distinction such as getting twice the amount of foreign matches for a penny as you will get of Irish.  That does not hold good at all here.  I am speaking from information supplied to me from the match manufacturers in this country, the men most likely to urge this consideration of tariff if they believed they were being undersold.  Without speaking of tariffs or anything of that sort, and taking comparable boxes of matches with very small advantage to the retailer, I cannot understand how the retailers could get so enthusiastic and their employees get so enthusiastic in the matter of pushing foreign matches unless there is some pecuniary advantage given to the employee as well.</P>
      <P>I suggest that there is great room in which trade union activities through the unions could be used so that Irish employees should be got to do their best by giving the benefit of this push to Irish goods to the exclusion of other goods, or in preference to other goods.</P>

      <P>We are in the same position as the Minister is with regard to any of the public services.  He may call for a particular class of service and try to stimulate interest in particular work, but it is not possible to say that the full effect desired would follow, but, so far as the Clerical Workers' Union are concerned, and more particularly the Distributive Workers' Union, they have always insisted in the propaganda, at their annual conferences and in their monthly journal that their members should always give a forward push to Irish goods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it is not understood that I am making any complaint. I am putting it that there is a great deal of publicity with regard to Irish-manufactured goods that can be brought about other than that by Government Departments.  I am, however, now on a different suggestion.  I am accepting the suggestion of Deputy Morrissey that publicity is a thing to be aimed at.  It has been before us for a long time.  But we have found for some years past a reluctance on the part of industrialists to enter upon any publicity campaign; they certainly would not face up to it on their own. They would not face it to-day, even if a Government Department got some <Col N="246" /> of the work done for them.  It is almost impossible to get industrialists in this country to send representatives or exhibitions abroad.  There have been many opportunities afforded them, and even in this country it has been found difficult enough to get them to enter upon any publicity campaign, their excuse being that they were not ready, that the goods were not in a state at which they could be sold, and the time was not ripe.  Other people hold that their goods were sufficiently sound in quality to warrant exhibition, but there was a prejudice against Irish manufactures and so on.  That is disappearing, and quite recently there was a very heartening experience by officials in my Department at a Feis held in Roscommon, where intimation was given that the Department should send down an official to get into touch with the people there and to give them advice in regard to local industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very interesting discussion was the result, which, I think, will bear fruit quite soon.  People of my Department. have been on journeys of that sort trying to get as much publicity as possible for Irish industrialists, and trying to get industries worked up in local centres to the greatest extent possible. There have been, as Deputies previously dealing with the Estimates will realise, advisory committees formed in certain branches of manufacture.  Meetings of these are held from time to time, and even groups are called in to consultation from time to time to see if they know any way that Government activity can be remunerative.  There have been a big number of meetings of these committees held during the last year and in addition to that, there has been an enormous amount of investigation of that kind done as to the possibility of starting industries.  That has proceeded quite steadily during the year, and negotiations for opening new factories and things of that sort have been dealt with.  A great number of firms have sent representatives here, and at conferences have been put in touch with people likely to be of use to them.  In every possible way that a Government Department can intervene there has been intervention with a view to getting <Col N="247" /> local capital and enterprise joined to start new industries.  Information has been sought in a great many places by people interested in the establishment of new businesses in this country. Various information was required, most of which could be supplied by my own Department, but a good deal of it was supplied by other Departments, information as to the possibility of getting the export trade worked up, and questions as to transport costs and labour costs; as much help as could be given was given.</P>
    <P>The other side of the work that that particular section dealt with, that of the development type, would be on the side of mineral resources, and there we were handicapped by the fact that the personnel of the staff we have had was rather small.  A very big demand was made on their time, and unfortunately those demands came in at all sorts of periods when journeys could not be arranged, so as to get the best possible result from the visits of the officials to the country.  There have been a great many inquiries as to the possibility of mineral development. Exploration work, which is necessarily limited, has been going on generally at the request of people who seem to have capital to sink in any sort of mineral development.  As a matter of fact, all this has focussed attention on a certain Article of the Constitution, which is of very doubtful value in connection with the exploitation of mineral resources in the country, and it is quite possible that there will have to be legislation dealing with the granting of leases or licences, for the working of minerals in this country, which will probably come before this House in the autumn.</P>
    <P>Although there has not been visible to people in the country any great publicity with regard to manufacture and there possibly has not been any great evidence to the ordinary outsider of work done in the Department, there has in fact, been a great deal.  It is necessarily limited.  My Department can do a fair amount in the way of collecting information to hold it at the disposal of people who make inquiries, but we cannot, on our own, drive people <Col N="248" /> into industrially developing the country. We can simply assist by having information at our disposal, having it in the most easily understood form, but that is the beginning and end of our activities.</P>

      <P>Might I ask whether the Government would be prepared to consider coming to the House and asking for a certain amount of money, which would be spent on publicity for pushing Irish products?  The Minister will realise, I am sure, and so will the House, that there are others besides Irish manufacturers to be considered in this matter; when you are trying to push the sale of Irish products you are considering more than the Irish manufacturers.  It seems to me that if it is to be done in the most effective and cheapest way it must be done by some central authority.</P>

      <P>In view of a communication I received a couple of days ago, it may be necessary to come to this House and ask for a grant to help, with a certain amount of Government supervision, an outside body to advance upon the road of publicity of which the Deputy spoke.  The whole matter of Government initiation of industrial development in the country is not one I should like to pronounce upon at this time.  It has been stated that there is this question of allowing a Government Department, such as my own, to intervene before the Tariff Commission, with a view to having proposals put forward before the Tariff Commission, to start businesses under the aid of protection. There, again, one has to face the difficulty that if there is not a sufficient body of people interested in the country even to the extent of claiming a tariff, what hope is there in getting people, once a Government Department has claimed a tariff, to come over and operate on it?  If there is no hope are we to take the step that Government Departments are to engage in business? It would require a lot of persuasion to get people to believe that the age of private enterprise is so far past that Government Departments have to intervene in order to get businesses started.</P>

      <P>No.  The particular matter of a Government grant, or Government money with regard to publicity, is a matter that has been considered under about three headings. There has been the question of giving a grant, the spending of which the Government would supervise, to a certain outside body, which seems to be the best to inaugurate a publicity campaign.</P>

      <P>Not by any means.  It is industrial development. That is a different matter.  Those are matters that have to be thought out at the moment.  Certainly I am not in a position to ask for money to engage in any such publicity campaign.  If a suitable demand is made I will put that forward for consideration by the Minister for Finance, and finally for the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cooper has talked of publicity of another type and of statistics. He said I have promised statistics from time to time.  I think my attitude in this House is rather one of refusing statistical information on the ground that giving piecemeal statistics was going to hinder the getting out of the first authoritative publication.  We should wait until we get the census returns and also those in connection with the census of production.  I do not know what statistics Deputy Cooper wants.  He spoke of a year-book. We have not got one.  We could compile one, but it would be full of inaccurate information if we were to compile it just now.  It would be mainly conjecture and guess-work, so that it is better to wait until we have all the census information available, and then we can produce our year-book. It is easy to say that we are the only one of the Commonwealth of Nations which has not a year-book.  I wonder what would be said if that statement was made shortly after Canada, South Africa and Australia had achieved a particular status.  If that comparison were made at a time when it was comparable to our circumstances now, it would not be found so much to our disadvantage.  We can produce an <Col N="250" /> ordinary kind of tourist handbook giving information regarding such matters as historical remains and antiquities.</P>

      <P>Comparisons are odious, and I am avoiding them. Deputy Hogan raised the old question with regard to people who own what is described as a few acres of land, who get employment on the roads, and who, when they become unemployed, are refused benefit.  The Dáil only hears of cases in which benefit is refused, but it never hears of cases in which it is paid.  In a great many cases benefit is paid to people in possession of land.  In the last Dáil I stated that a man was not ruled out of unemployment benefits because he had land.</P>

      <P>I could give a number of cases.  I stated previously that the way the matter runs is this.  A person gets into an insurable occupation, stamps are to his credit, he goes out of that particular type of work and applies for benefit.  At the time he applies for benefit all his circumstances are taken into account, his industrial history, how long he has been in industrial life, and also whether he is an industrial worker or a farmer.  It is also ascertained what use he makes of his <Col N="251" /> bit of ground, and what seasons such ground is of use to him.  These facts are taken into account, not by officials in my Department but by the umpires of the Court of Referees.  There is no rule laid down on which such umpires found themselves, so that they would rule out automatically anybody having land at any period of the year.</P>

If Deputies want that kind of thing regulated remember they are going to leave my Department with more power to insist on an average ruling instead of leaving it to the people on the spot to decide the circumstances.  It is put up here&mdash;I am inclined to think now, Deputy Hogan believes it&mdash;that we are, in fact, taking money from people with land in insurable occupations and refusing afterwards to pay them benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has an easy remedy.  Let him raise this matter on the adjournment some evening and we will argue it.  There is an impression created that we are doing a very unjust thing, namely, taking money from people with land when they get into insurable occupations, and refusing to give them benefit afterwards. If Deputy Davin presses, as I think he did when the Dáil met last week, that these people should be exempt from deductions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>They are.  It is all a matter of circumstances.  Nobody gets benefit simply because there are stamps to credit.  Everybody has to pass the same test as a man or woman with land.  That test is&mdash;is he, or she, unable to obtain suitable employment? These are the circumstances that have to be taken into account.  As I say, Deputy Hogan can bring up two or three cases on the adjournment and let the House decide whether the circumstances were such as to warrant a particular decision.  In the end, I am not bound in these matters, because they go to the highest court and there is no interference there.  The other side of the case is, that if you cannot get them changed it is obviously a case of not asking these men to pay towards the unemployment fund.  If that is the attitude to be adopted county councils and other local authorities will always employ a man with land because he will not be so costly, as they will not have to pay contributions for him towards the fund.  The fund will be <Col N="253" /> considerably weakened in that way, because certain men, who will be regarded as good lives, will be taken out of it and the fund will then depend on the bad lives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There are various ways of phrasing it.  The Deputy's argument comes down to trying to get people to believe that there is a definite rule that a man who has land cannot draw benefit, even if there are stamps to his credit.  I deny that.  We have heard of the bad cases.  Deputy Lawlor raised a matter concerning the City Commissioners and talked vehemently of how someone had blundered. I stated in this House that that <Col N="254" /> has to be related back to the whole incident and circumstances at the time. The circumstances were that I was trying to get through this House a Bill that was rather contentious and had certain reactions on the municipal undertaking here.</P>
      <P>At one moment I found I had a deputation telling me that certain men had been put out of work.  I asked them why, and I was told the reason.  I detailed the circumstances to them, and I got no objection from them to my explanation that day.  The explanation was that certain work by way of extension of the municipal electricity undertaking had first to be sanctioned by my Department, and afterwards there is to be sanction for the loan, looking for borrowing powers by the Department of Local Government.  A practice had been growing up of simply proceeding with the extensions, and then confronting my Department with the dilemma: &ldquo;Are you going to stop work that is being done?&rdquo; The matter became rather critical this year when it was thought to order a very big piece of machinery at a big cost, when a similar type of machinery, costing the same amount and synchronising with the work at Ardnacrusha, would have been of value three years hence.  A piece of machinery might have been ordered, and seemed likely to be ordered, which would mean three years hence that that amount of machinery, worth about £40,000, would be useless.</P>
      <P>Under the circumstances I could not agree until I got detailed specifications and an agreement that certain things were to be looked to.  Having intimated that clearly two or three times, I found men were being put off work on the ordinary extensions in the city, and that it had nothing to do with the turbine I had spoken of.  I think there was something very peculiar about that. One can get a bad impression of what was done at that time.  I am ready to answer any question and to stand any public investigation as to the justice of what I did on that particular transaction, as to whether or not my action had anything to do with the putting of certain men out of employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LAWLOR</NameTxt>
      <P>I only desired the Minister to understand that, from the information it was possible to obtain outside, undoubtedly the responsibility was placed on his shoulders.  If the responsibility was placed on the Minister's shoulders when it could have been placed on the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, at least, would be in a position to have set the matter right. I have a clear-cut statement, made specifically, that the Minister put his foot down on any extensions of the electricity supply, independent of the question of the turbine engine altogether, and that, in addition, the Commissioners would not consider any overtures from the Minister's Department as regards that class of work.  The only guarantee they would take that they could proceed without being pilloried afterwards, would be on the Minister's signature.  The Minister stood on his dignity for three weeks or more before he gave his signature, and the men were walking about.  I am glad I raised the matter, as my intention was, if a similar thing happened again, that at least those who have no control over the matter will not be the only persons to suffer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

      <P>There was no standing on dignity for any period. There was a very definite meeting with people, a clear-cut statement as to the position, and also intimation with regard to the turbine that specifications would have to be insisted upon, but that normal extensions could run. There were certain things we had to have explained to us and we hoped these would follow.  I say again quite clearly that I have nothing to lament, as far as my action is concerned, for what happened.  I think certain people were unjustly treated, but it was not because of anything I imposed on the Commissioners.  It was no intention of mine, and was no ordinary or logical outcome of what I did.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson spoke about a reduction from £1,500 to <Col N="256" /> £1,000 under sub-head H&mdash;Departmental Committee on Crude Alcohol: Prizes.  Originally a resolution was passed in the Seanad and a committee was appointed on foot of that with terms of reference as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That, with a view to the estab lishment of two important industries in Saorstát Eireann, the Seanad suggests to the Government the desirability of offering substantial prizes for&mdash;</P>
      <P>1st.  The most efficient type of in ternal combustion engine developing 15 B.H.P. while using crude alcohol alone as the motor spirit:</P>
      <P>2nd.  The most suitable and economic crude alcohol for the development of power, so treated that it could not be consumed as a drink.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;B&rdquo; part has been satisfied, that there is an engine capable of use in this way, and consequently prizes for the two items have been reduced to the proper amount set out in that section. £1,000 still remains for the A portion. As regards the reduction in the next sub-head, &ldquo;Grant-in-aid of the expenses of the International Labour Organisation (League of Nations),&rdquo; the Free State contribution for the ordinary League of Nations purpose is determined on a proportionate basis. We pay so many units out of the calculated number of the total units required. As the amount required has gone down our proportionate amount has necessarily decreased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to night baking, I think I indicated, in dealing with a certain number of these conventions brought forward that we were pretty clear that the conventions with regard to night baking would be adopted in the Free State.  Inquiries had to be made, and when these are completed of course there will be a resolution here with regard to the convention.  Deputy Davin has spoken of my failure to control transport, and made a statement that all the Ministers now being equal the responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce would be less.  I do not know what that means.  A Bill has not been introduced with regard to transport.  I think I indicated, on the <Col N="257" /> Railway and Road Motor Powers Bill, that only when that particular Bill had been in operation for a year or two would we have reliable statistics as to what it would cost to run motor vehicles on roads, allowing for proper depreciation.  I do not say that if any portion of that Transport Bill had to depend on that particular type of statistics there would be a long time before the Transport Bill would be introduced.  The Deputy has talked of a Transport Committee.  I think if the Deputy looks at the terms of reference he had better call that a Traffic Committee.</P>

I said no, that certain matters were excluded from the consideration of that Committee, which was dealing with one matter, that is, reporting to the Minister who has to deal with traffic regulations.  I doubt even if we get all this co-ordination with regard to transport matters, even if it is desirable, that it will be possible to keep the Minister for Justice out of the police control of traffic regulations in cities.  I think that will always remain unless the Deputy wants to have special transport police under the Ministry of Transport running around trailing buses to find out what could be done and what penalty could be imposed on them.</P>

      <P>I think there is every evidence a comprehensive Transport Bill will be required, but it will be some time before it is ready.  In the meantime, it may be necessary to approach this problem step by step.  I agree that one of the scandals of the road at the moment is the number of these road buses, and the amount of road they occupy outside their own legitimate portion of the road, the speed at which they travel and the fact that they can block the road to <Col N="258" /> the ordinary motor driver, going at a speed, I think, the ordinary motor driver would be summoned for going at.</P>

      <P>As to my collective responsibility, for instance, if fish from trawlers were dispatched to France and not carried over our railways it becomes a transport matter, as I have collective responsibility for fisheries, so that anything can be raised on this Vote of mine.  I have nothing at the moment to say as to buses keeping to their proper speed.  I am not sure that the Deputy's recital as to the time-table is evidence.  I understand the question has been raised in the courts, and that the time-table is not binding on the driver.  It is merely an indication of the time at which people might expect to get to places, but it is not binding. The Deputy would have to travel on one of these buses and go as a witness to prove that the bus has travelled beyond the legal speed.  If evidence cannot be got as to the speed at which buses travel, action cannot be taken.</P>

      <P>This vote is practically all covered by statute passed by the Oireachtas, and the headings show a decrease.  Most of the decreases are explained under the sub-heads.  There are two items that are still in the state of being wound-up, or at least consideration is being given as to whether or not they should be wound up.  Items C and E may be taken together.  C has reference to special railway undertakings, and E refers to payments in respect of the acquisition of land for colliery railways.  B payment is supposed to be sufficient to supply all outstanding sums, so that item next year should disappear from the Estimates, and the same remark would apply to C. Both of these items should disappear, for under the Railway Act these lines were to have been absorbed in the Great Southern Railways, either by agreement or by a decision of the Tribunal.  That matter will come up for settlement in the autumn.  As to item F, Sligo and Belmullet Steam Service, it will probably be remembered that there was a long discussion on that item the first time it made its appearance on any Vote in my Department. The amount we ask for this year <Col N="260" /> to make good the deficit in the working of the service has been brought down to £200.  Definite consideration is being given at the moment as to giving up the steamer service altogether.  I would like Deputies from the areas concerned to give attention when they go to their constituencies to the use made of this service.  We find that it is not supported, and that a rival service is supported instead.  Indeed, there is certain evidence that one of the persons who professes to be mainly concerned in the upkeep of this service is importing all his goods by another service. There is good reason to believe that the service will disappear unless a better case can be made for its retention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ANTHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to item A&mdash;payment to the Great Southern Railways under the Railways Act, 1924, of £48,688&mdash;I want to draw the attention of the Dáil to certain injustices perpetrated and unfair discrimination exerted as a result of the unification of the railway systems of the Saorstát.  I know that certain officials were retired on pensions altogether out of proportion to the services rendered.  But in addition to that, the unification brought about or resulted in the dismissal of many railway workers.  The number mentioned by Deputy Davin is three thousand.  I think that is an underestimate, if anything.  Now for the information of those Deputies who do not understand the term, I may explain that &ldquo;railway shopmen&rdquo; means tradesmen, mechanics, and artisans.  These railway shopmen in many cases, particularly in Cork, have, I know, been placed on half time, three-quarter time, and some of them on no time at all, because they have been dismissed.  In many other cases the men were told they were redundant, and that in a very short time they also would be dismissed or placed on half time or three-quarter time.  This has been one of the evils of the unification of the railway systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Cork there was a very well equipped workshop, which drew from the various inspectors dealing with that department encomiums from time to time as to the skill and efficiency that entered into the construction of railway wagons and the other things required for the railway service.  A committee set up in Cork proved to the satisfaction of some of the directors of the railway, and to the satisfaction of other business men, that there was no economy whatsoever in one of the results of unification, namely, the centralisation of most of their work in another place.  It is, perhaps, one of the problems that will face this country at a later period in the course of its development, whether the continued centralisation of industry in one particular portion of the State would be advisable or would contribute to the progress of the country itself.  So far as we in Cork are concerned, we have found that whilst this unification may <Col N="262" /> have meant a certain amount of economy so far as the advocates of centralisation would lead us to believe, yet at the same time we find that the result in Cork has been very disastrous.  Many of these men have been added to the unemployed list.</P>
    <P>I now want to know from the Minister himself if he considers it wise economy that for the sake of some very small savings, perhaps, in the expenses of railway undertakings, a number of men shall be added to the unemployed list, and as a consequence have to draw unemployment benefit?  I do not want to labour that point too long, but some things occurred in the course of this discussion which I certainly cannot allow to pass unchallenged. Deputy Davin, I think, drew attention to statements coming from the Farmers' benches from time to time.  They would lead us to believe that they, alone, are the people who are carrying all the expenses of the management of this country on their shoulders.  I challenge that assertion, and I think it is about time that we cried halt to this slogan from the Farmers that 75 per cent. of the cost of running this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">

      <P>I want to point out to the Deputy that Ministers have collective responsibility, but for the purpose of the Estimates each Minister is a separate cockshot in himself. The essential thing during the debate is that Deputies should aim at the particular Minister who is the cockshot of the moment.  It is at Deputy Baxter that Deputy Anthony is aiming, but he will have to aim at the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or else he will be firing at the wrong target.</P>

      <P>I do not think I would be out of order in suggesting or saying that we, the working class, contribute relatively, or in proportion, more to the taxation of this country than do the farmer class.  The farmers have asked for an inquiry.  They have asked that an inquiry should be set up in this House relative to the working of the various Departments, and see whether or not we are getting value for our money in this State.  I would also suggest that some Committee should be set up in this House to inquire into how far, and in what manner, some farmers in this country are working their lands. This has some relation to the matter under discussion.  I do know that we have a very large number of small working farmers in the country, and I do not believe that the Deputies on the Farmers' benches speak for them.  We have a greater authority to speak for these small farmers than the Deputies on the Farmers' benches have.  I have said that we contribute more, relatively, in the way of direct and indirect taxation on such matters as tobacco, beer, spirits, and other taxable commodities, than do the farmers represented by the Farmers' Party here. I would ask, before I sit down, that the Minister should state to us&mdash;at some future date, not now&mdash;their intentions in regard to the conditions under which land is held in the Free State.</P>

A payment is made of this £48,688 in accordance with the particular sections of the Railways Act which the last Dáil passed.  Certain recoupment comes afterwards.  The Deputy was really criticising the method of the Railways Company in the management of its own business.  The last Dáil left it to the Railways Company to manage its own business in a certain way, subject to a certain amount of supervision.

      <P>This Vote is much the same as last year.  There are decreases under every head.  The decrease under sub-head A is explained by the fact that it was not found necessary to appoint one of the clerical officers or to appoint a typist sanctioned under the original establishment. Perhaps I may be allowed on this particular Vote to refer to a small matter that I had nearly forgotten to refer to, and which Deputy O'Gorman mentioned. It is the matter of a bonus. The Deputy asked a question with regard to bonuses under a special sub-head of the Statistics Branch.  I should have explained that item definitely shows an increase this year.  The Deputy will observe that a very big number of temporary people have been dismissed and their places are taken by clerical officers.  Temporary people get no bonus; clerical officers do, and that would explain mainly what Deputy O'Gorman appeared to think an unreasonable increase.  It is all brought about by the change from a temporary to a permanent staff.  There is a decrease in the bonus.</P>

When interested parties appear before the Tribunal in regard to certain matters, it is the usual practice to go, as they say, into Committee.  I want to know whether the proceedings at the secret session are recorded in the form of shorthand notes, and whether it is proposed, when dealing with questions of public importance, to continue the work of the Tribunal in a secret session rather than in public court.  I think the Minister will agree that the trading and the travelling public, as well as those who eventually as railway officials have to administer the laws made in this court&mdash;and I presume it is a court&mdash;should have, if required, access to whatever official records are available of the work carried <Col N="266" /> on in committee.

      <P>There is no change in the headings of this Vote from last year.  All the sub-headings show decreases.  Where explanations are required, they are definitely given under the letters relating to the subheads. There has been a small increase in the total for the Mercantile Marine Office, but that is set-off by a decrease in the Survey Services.  The increase with regard to the Mercantile Marine Office is due to the fact that the Cork Mercantile Marine Office was transferred from a building occupied by the Customs and Excise Department to a building occupied by the Department of Industry and Commerce. Travelling and incidental expenses show a decrease.  The sums stated represent the best estimates that can be made, but the figure is, of course, somewhat conjectural.  The estimate is founded upon our experience of past years.  Item BB is merely a token vote.  An accident such as the Lismore case of a few years ago would involve much heavier expenditure, and would have to be met by an increased estimate. The other sub-headings are as explained. Item D (services in connection with wrecks and salvage) is off-set by certain receipts.  The cost of securing and disposing of objects washed up on the coast is almost balanced by an appropriation-in-aid under sub-head G. This almost may be regarded as a conjectural <Col N="269" /> item, because one of the items that will fall to be dealt with under the sub-head of &ldquo;services in connection with wrecks and salvage&rdquo; is expenses incurred in connection with the burial of the carcases of whales which may be washed up.  That is, of course, a matter that nobody can form an estimate of.</P>

      <P>I should like if the Minister would give us a little light as to the duties of the medical inspector of emigrant ships.  I believe there is need for some close inquiry into the whole question of the treatment of emigrants.  While I do not want to raise the question fully now, it occurs to me that if we have a medical inspector of emigrant ships, he has certain duties.  Presumably his duties are more or less to confirm the work of such medical inspectors of Great Britain or Continental countries who inspect the ships before they leave their home ports.  Perhaps the Minister would give me some indication of the duties of this medical inspector.  If he cannot do so, perhaps he will inquire into the matter, and that that will lead to closer examination of the position of emigrants on ships going from Irish ports.  I am told that there is need&mdash;I go no further than that&mdash;for a thorough inquiry into the condition of emigrants going from Irish ports to America.</P>

      <P>I had occasion quite recently to visit many parts of the County Galway.  It came to my notice when visiting Clifden, which is a promontory on the western coast, that telephonic or telegraphic communication with Bofin was unavailable at the time and the islanders were placed in a very parlous position.  Disease often occurs on the island and frequently no doctor is available there.  Nurses have to be found often, and, as this complaint respecting communication was made to me I bring it to the notice of the Minister and hope that he will give it his attention.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Johnson will give me privately any details of his suspicions with regard to what is wanting in the medical inspection <Col N="270" /> of emigrants, or of ships for emigrants, I will get the matter looked into.  There is a certain salary paid the medical officer at Cobh.  Certain duties fall upon him under the practice, backed by regulations.  If the Deputy thinks the regulations are not sufficient or that the practice has been wanting, or that the duties carried out here are insufficient in any way, I will have the matter examined.</P>
      <P>The other question as regards communication between Clifden and elsewhere arises, I presume, in connection with the Coast Live Saving Service. There has been an attempt made to get all the stations joined up by the telephone service.  It must be remembered, however, that we have not built up the whole Coastguard Service, as it was previously under the Board of Trade. There were about 180 stations on the Free State coast; now we have only 53. It is believed that these 53 make adequate provision for life-saving off the coast.  If, in fact, there is any deficiency in the communications between Clifden and elsewhere, I will have the matter attended to.</P>

      <P>A certain amount of the inspection is actually done before the emigrant reaches the emigrant ship.  It is done, as the Deputy may have noticed himself, on the tender taking the people out, say, from Cobh to the boat lying out in the roads.  There is another inspection as to whether or not the ship is a suitable one for carrying emigrants.  That is a different matter, but it is also looked at, and one or two complaints have been made about ships.  One rather serious case arose, but an improvement has been effected.  There is definitely an examination of the people and an examination of the boat.</P>

      <P>This is a new Estimate, but it is merely a segregation of items that had been previously set out in the Vote for the office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. In so far as it really represents old items segregated under a different head, nearly all the items show a decrease. In some small items, such as incidental expenses, there is no change.  The earlier items&mdash;travelling expenses, incidental expenses and telegrams and telephones&mdash;were previously joined up with the same items for the whole Department. There has been a segregation, founded upon experience of the working of some years, as to the actual amount expended upon these three items in relation to unemployment insurance. Certain explanations are attached to the estimate with regard to the other items.  With regard to E, provision has been made for a fee to a barrister, not to exceed £350, for acting as umpire, and there are amounts set aside for fees to chairmen of Courts of Referees. The expenditure will vary according to the number of cases that will fall for examination.  The same thing applies to F&mdash;travelling and subsistence allowances for members and persons required to attend courts, and that, of course, would vary considerably, according <Col N="272" /> to the number of claims for unemployment insurance benefit.</P>
      <P>The State contribution to the Unemployment Fund and to special schemes comes under G.  The method used for reckoning that is based upon the receipts from the sales of unemployment insurance stamps.  The receipts are taken, and then a particular proportion, representing the State contribution of roughly one-third, is provided. Item H is a special provision with regard to contributions that are made towards the administrative expenses incurred by certain associations which are allowed to make arrangements with my Department with regard to the payment of unemployment benefit to their members.  That item will, of course, vary according to the extent of unemployment amongst the members of the associations, and this £350 item is taken as the ordinary average.  Sub-head I is fairly definitely explained in the note.  Poor people are advanced money to enable them to travel to places to take up employment that has been found for them by the employment branches.  Of course, the advances are repaid in accordance with undertakings that are given when the advances are made, and the sum detailed under that is included in the appropriations-in-aid.  The biggest item in the appropriations-in-aid&mdash;item A&mdash; is simply based upon the income of the Unemployment Fund, including the State contribution.  There is a maximum percentage that may be taken by way of administrative expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an interesting comment upon the discussion yesterday furnished by this Vote if one looks at the amount of the contributions to the Unemployment Fund under sub-head G.  It will be seen that the amount is the same this year as the amount that was estimated to be required last year, and last year it was only £5,000 less than what was estimated to be required the year before. Inasmuch as that contribution is based upon receipts from stamps sold, one can see that there is not much faith in the Department in the claim made that there has been a great increase in the number of persons employed, and consequently <Col N="273" /> a great decrease in the number of persons unemployed.  As between the Estimates for 1925-6 and 1927-8 there is a decline of £5,000, which, roughly, means the increased employment of 1,000 men.  Perhaps when the Minister was drawing up this Estimate he was not thinking of the arguments he would use on a discussion on unemployment.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the practice of the Department in respect of appeals in cases of dispute.  The case that I referred to in a question yesterday is one which might be picked out of many complaints regarding the considerable delay that takes place in adjudicating upon cases.  I ask the Minister to bear in mind that while inquiries are being pursued men are out of work and are not receiving money.  Consequently they are suffering to a more or less acute degree, according to their reserves and according to the amount of credit they can get from shopkeepers, which in too many cases is very small indeed, while in too many other cases the men are forced to rely upon what their neighbours can give them by way of assistance pending a decision of the Department.  The case that I quoted yesterday had to deal with a dispute with respect to the validity of certain stamps.  It is a case of three men who were employed by a certain company in County Dublin which, I think, went into liquidation.  The men had a considerable period of employment and their contributions had been deducted by the firm.  They applied for unemployment benefit in the usual course. They were refused benefit, and have now been regularly, signing on for twenty weeks&mdash;in one case I think twenty-one weeks&mdash;and their claims are still under examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be in this case that there has been some wrong-doing on the part of somebody, and it may be that the Minister has had a very great difficulty in pursuing an inquiry.  But it seems to be an unfortunate thing that the men have to suffer as a consequence of the slow progress of this inquiry.  It is now, I think, five weeks since I wrote to the Department, and then the inquiry was being pushed forward and the matter was to receive immediate <Col N="274" /> attention.  I have no doubt that it has been receiving attention, but I am wondering whether the officers concerned have not too little to do, as some Deputies would suggest, but have entirely too much to do and cannot follow up their inquiries with the speed that is necessary.  It is not right that men of this class should be deprived of what may be, and I believe is, a just claim upon the Unemployment Fund for so long a period pending an inquiry.</P>
    <P>I think it is a matter for very earnest consideration as to whether there should not be a means whereby, if there is a prima facie case in favour of the applicant&mdash;that he at least has not been in fraud, that the Department ought to advance the benefit, even awaiting absolute proof of the invalidity.  It certainly seems to me to be very unfortunate and a very great hardship that men of this class should be deprived of their benefit for more than four months pending the pursuit by the Department of an inquiry into the validity of certain stamps.  The Minister says that it is now in the hands of an expert chemist to see whether the stamps are valid or not.  I do not know whether that is the actual inquiry; I only take that from the Minister's statement yesterday. But the fact remains that there has been three or four months' delay in coming to a decision on the validity of these men's claims.  If that were an isolated case one could understand an excuse from the Minister, but Deputies know that it is a very common complaint, that there is too long a delay in coming to decisions regarding the validity of claims, and men who are claiming benefit are deprived of all means of living except by the aid of charitable agencies and friends.</P>
    <P>I want to urge upon the Minister the necessity for speeding up, first, the Department regarding replies to queries sent by individuals, trade unions or Deputies, and, secondly, the necessity for speeding up inquiries that are under question in the Department.  If that requires further assistance and a bigger staff, by all means put in a bigger staff.  I do not credit, either from my observation or experience, the stories about the long, wasteful hours spent by civil servants drawing pay. <Col N="275" /> My experience is quite the contrary. My experience is that civil servants work harder than most commercial servants.  I also dissent from the criticism that is so often levelled, that people do not get courtesy and proper consideration from civil servants when making personal inquiries.  I think that it is quite a false impression to create: that civil servants do not give good service and do not work assiduously and earnestly.  In this case I think we are probably suffering from some of the unfair comments, and that staffs have been unduly cut down, or have not been increased sufficiently to do the work that is necessary.  If that is the reason for the delay in answering inquiries and pursuing investigations into cases, then the remedy ought to be to employ more civil servants on that particular job.  I make the complaint that there is too great delay, and the further complaint that there is no reasonable ground for charging an applicant with fraud in such a case as I am referring to, and that the claim for benefit should be conceded.  If other questions arise later, those who are the culprits should be made to suffer, but the claimant should not be made the sufferer for the delinquencies of other people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister whether he is satisfied that compliance with the Act is as general as it ought to be, and whether his Department took steps during the last year to ensure that there was greater compliance than there had been.  I am satisfied from my own experience that there is not anything like general compliance, and that the State contribution could be very much reduced if the employers and the employees who are liable were compelled to obey the law in this matter.  I think that that particular matter is not being looked after as it should be, because I find very many men, when they are disemployed, coming to me and saying: &ldquo;I have been working with Mr. So-and-so for so many months or years, and he has never stamped a card.&rdquo;  The employee is, perhaps, just as much to blame as the employer, but it shows that there is not that supervision that there should be, <Col N="276" /> and I think the Minister and his Department might give a little more attention to that phase of the question.</P>
      <P>Another matter I wish to call attention to is the method of informing a person that a claim for unemployment benefit has been disallowed.  He gets a form stating that his claim has been disallowed in accordance with Section 7 (4) and so on.  In nine cases out of ten the claimant has not any idea of what Section 7 (4) or 8 (4), as the case might be, refers to, and very often, because he is ignorant of the reason why his claim is refused, and perhaps cannot find anyone to enlighten him, he does not appeal against the decision to the Court of Referees.  I suggest that the Department should state in plain language, as briefly as they can, the reason for disallowing a claim.  It would save some of us a lot of trouble if that were done.</P>
      <P>As to the delay which Deputy Johnson spoke of, it is no uncommon thing for a claim to be under consideration for nine or ten weeks, or even longer. Perhaps one of the reasons for that is the round-about way of dealing with these claims, which go from the branch office to the next office and from that to the central office in Dublin, and then have to come back again in the same way.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether that is essential.  I know it often leads to an unemployed person having to wait for four or six or ten weeks before getting benefit.  That is unfair, and any steps that can be taken to obviate that delay should be taken. Taking everything into consideration, the Department is dealing fairly well with the matter, but there could be an improvement.  There are, however, two matters that the Minister should pay some attention to: one is the question of compliance, as in my opinion hundreds, if not thousands, of people who should be complying with the Act are not complying, and the other is the question of delay.  The Minister might very usefully turn his attention to these.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HOGAN (Clare)</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the <Col N="277" /> Court of Referees, it might be advisable if the Court of Referees held sessions in different centres.  As far as I know, there has never been a sitting held in the County Clare.  People from all parts of the county have to incur the expense of travelling to Limerick. That acts as a great deterrent, and even people who have good cases are prevented from going before the Referees. As to the Exchanges, I know a whole district in Clare where there is no place provided for the making of claims. Ennis, for instance, is the nearest centre to Scariff, which is twenty-two miles away.  Limerick is the same distance. Even the Minister, I feel sure, would consider it a hardship for a man to have to travel 22 miles to make a claim for benefit.  For a man who does not live near a town, it is even a greater hardship to have to travel that distance.  I also am not satisfied that all that might be done is being done in the matter of compliance.  I do not know that the Minister has any responsibility in that matter, but I should like to know if he is satisfied that the present method of securing compliance, by making the officers responsible for National Health Insurance also responsible for Unemployment Insurance, is a suitable method or likely to produce the best results.  Is the Minister satisfied that it is working successfully? As far as I know, the system is working most unsuccessfully in connection with Unemployment Insurance, and certainly working to the detriment of National Health Insurance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. MURPHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the point made by Deputy Hogan for slightly different reasons.  I feel that so far as the Courts of Referees are concerned in large counties, sittings of the court might be held in various centres in the county with advantage to the administration of the Act.  From my own experience in Cork I know that people have to travel very long distances to railway stations from remote portions of the county and attend the court in order to have their cases dealt with.  The arrangement, of course, is that representatives both of the employers and the workmen are to sit as court referees with a chairman.  I have assisted at <Col N="278" /> these courts very frequently and I have rarely seen a representative of the employer or employee there.  The fact that the chairman is a lawyer, as he usually is, is, of course, a great help in interpreting and administering the Act. I think an arrangement could be made with advantage to have direct representatives of the workmen and employers act in conjunction with the chairman at the various sittings of the court throughout the county.  I think it is a suggestion the Minister will find would considerably improve the method by which the Act is administered and which would obviate the delay that is caused because of the disagreement that often takes place between the umpire and the court referees by the reason of the very strict manner in which the Act is administered locally. The point is worth considering, and perhaps the Minister would consider it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GilbertLynch" hpid="Mr. G. LYNCH Mr. G. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like again to emphasise one point on the administration of the Act which I referred to to-day.  The Minister seemed surprised when I produced seven documents that were sent to a worker in a country district. I think he was sincere in his surprise, and we would feel very greatly obliged to him if he would try by some simple means to get the necessary information for the worker concerned. There is another point to be considered&mdash;the question of delays.  I might give as an instance the case of R. O'Molloy, Kilcommon.  The member's number is Galway, 15413.  This man registered on, 12th March, and his case did not come before the Court of Referees until 2nd June.  In this case we had a full court.  We had the chairman, a representative of the employers' panel, and I was on the court myself as a member of the workers' panel.  We went into the whole case, and the unanimous decision of the court was that benefit should be granted.  Yet, up to the time when I left Galway last Monday, he had received no benefit.  Practically four months have elapsed, and the evidence he produced showed that the man was face to face with starvation.  His was a case of undoubted hardship which should have been dealt with quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I came across another very serious <Col N="279" /> case&mdash;the case of a man named John Foley, who applied in Galway for benefit some time ago.  He was informed that some time about 1920 he received credit for 12 stamps which should have been credited to another John Foley, and the result was that 12 of the 18 or 19 stamps he had to his credit had to go to make up the error made by one of the clerks in Dublin in 1920.  That is a ruling that, in my contention, is against all equity and justice.  Even presupposing that that error had been made in 1920, if that error had not then been made it would not in any way have affected the benefit he received during that period, because of the fact that he would receive uncovenanted benefit.  Therefore, it is not right that he should be deprived of benefit at the present time.  Further, we should have proof that it was an error and that the 12 stamps that were credited to him should have been credited to someone else.</P>
    <P>In regard to the working of the Courts of Referees, for two or three years there was no Court of Referees in Galway district at all.  Through the medium of Deputy Johnson I got the matter raised about twelve months ago.  A number of us received notification that we had been appointed on the workers' panel.  We attended the court, and some of the workers' representatives lost time and wages by attending.  We found out afterwards, or at least we were informed, that we were not properly appointed, and the loss was never made up to these men who sacrificed their wages in order to attend.  In fact it is only two months ago that we found out that the panel was in order after a delay of twelve months.  In view of the fact that the regulations have been more than stringently enforced to the detriment of the contributor, it is a very grave injustice that delays of this kind should occur. The Minister should facilitate the administration of justice in the case of all contributors.  If a man pays contributions and has the misfortune to become unemployed, the Government should, like any other body of citizens, discharge its liabilities to that citizen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. COBURN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to call the attention of the Minister to a very great grievance that exists among some workers in the immediate vicinity of Dundalk.  My constituency, being in such close proximity to the Six Counties, it is only natural that some residents in or about Dundalk have to migrate to the Six Counties in search of employment.  I have had brought under my notice cases where men secured employment in the North of Ireland and worked there for one, two, three, four or five years.  Then owing-to the general economic depression, they found themselves unemployed, and, in the natural order of things, their residence being in the Free State, they came back to live there.  I want to give one specific instance where one of those workers, a married man with a family of three or four, was engaged in quarries situated in the North of Ireland.  I think his occupation was a set-maker.  That was a very flourishing industry in the Six Counties for a period extending over forty or fifty-years. This man is unemployed at present, and, naturally, he came back to his wife and family, who are living in Dundalk.  He has lodged his unemployment book in the local labour exchange. He had been forced to contribute every week to the unemployment fund when engaged in Northern Ireland, but up to the present, I am sorry to state, this man has not received a penny of unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister if it is his intention in the future to make some reciprocal arrangements between the Minister responsible for unemployment benefit in the Northern counties and himself whereby residents of the Free State employed in Northern Ireland who have perforce to contribute to the unemployment fund whilst engaged there will be made so that when these men are out of employment and come back to reside in the Free State that they will be assured of their unemployment benefit.  I believe this question was discussed in the late Dáil.  It is a very burning one, and one that perhaps will affect the relationships of the people of the North with the people of the South.  It would be well.  I think, if the Minister responsible here would endeavour, <Col N="281" /> in the near future, to come to some amicable arrangement whereby these people will receive what they are justly entitled to, seeing that they have complied with all the regulations that govern the unemployment scheme.  I avail of this opportunity to bring the matter to the notice of the Minister.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that there is no question to which more attention has been given than the particular matter which he has raised, namely, the question of getging some sort of a reciprocal arrangement entered into with the Northern Government with regard to the disadvantage that residents in both areas labour under when they leave one area to work in another and afterwards return to their own.  At the initiation of the Trades Union Congress various suggestions on that point were carried out.  A further attempt was made to settle the matter when officials from my Department went to Belfast and put up seven suggestions or methods of meeting the difficulty.  I think they exhausted all the possibilities of the situation, but they then discovered, and have since discovered, that it was not the intention of the Northern Ministry to accept any alteration, suggestion or modification of the old law as it existed, and we are at a standstill there.  If the Deputy would care to see the suggestions that were made, or if he wishes to get any further details on the matter, I can place them before him.</P>

      <P>It is not merely asking for belief in the matter.  If the Deputy would let me have his point of view as to whether any further modifications or alterations are possible, other than the ones that my Department offered, then I would be glad to discuss the matter with him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. COBURN Mr. COBURN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COBURN</NameTxt>
      <P>The only reason I can give the Minister so far as relates to the refusal of the Minister responsible in Northern Ireland to agree to this reciprocal arrangement is that the conditions governing the unemployment <Col N="282" /> fund in the Free State were not as favourable as those that prevail in Northern Ireland.  Of course, that raised a very big question, a question of a worker in the Free State receiving 15/-, while the worker in Northern Ireland receives 18/-.  I do not propose to go into that aspect of the situation, because it is quite outside the sphere of the point under consideration. I simply bring up the question in the hope that the Minister responsible, in conjunction with the other members of the Executive Council here, will endeavour, in the near future, to devise some means whereby this difficulty would be got over, because it is really a great hardship. When the father of a family comes to you, and tells you that he has been working for five years in Northern Ireland and has been compelled to contribute to the unemployment fund there, and finds, when he becomes unemployed and returns to reside in the Free State, that he is not entitled to benefit despite the fact that he has been paying contributions during the whole of the period that he had been in employment, it is really very vexing, not to speak at all of the pecuniary loss that he suffers.  He is not entitled to get the unemployment benefit when he comes to reside in the Free State. That means a loss to him of anything from 23/- to 25/- a week, which, if he received it, would be a great help to him to enable him to pay his rent and keep his family in comparative decency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There has been nothing from that side except merely a refusal to consider the various points put up.  The one point on which we could get even an approach was an admission of their willingness to receive <Col N="283" /> representatives of my Department in consultation.  That began and ended the matter.  Nothing emerged from the consultation.  I am quite ready to show members of the Dáil the particular alternatives which we proposed, to see if there is any further alternative that they think might be proposed and the objections made to the proposals which we submitted, and see whether the House believes in the objections made. I recognise that there is a definite hardship, but we have done our best to alleviate it and have not been successful.</P>
      <P>There were some complaints with regard to non-compliance.  Undoubtedly, there is a big amount of non-compliance at the moment, but my officials in the local office and the inspectors under the National Health Insurance scheme, have been ordered to bring to light as many cases as they can.  It seems to me rather unfair to ask the State to incur expense in doing for individuals what those individuals definitely can do for themselves.  There need not be a case of non-compliance if an employee saw to it that his card was stamped.  There could be 100 per cent. compliance to-morrow if the employees would look after it.</P>

      <P>Generally, there is some consideration for not obeying a law, but here is the case of an individual looking forward to a period of unemployment that the Labour Party seems to think is inevitable at the moment, who is going to suffer, and allows himself to suffer by not insisting on the stamps being put on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be a difficulty that way.  We recognise that that is a difficulty, and that is the reason why officials are told to go into the question and investigate and bring to light as many cases as they can.  I believe there is still a large amount of non-compliance, for it is impossible with the staff that we have to get the matter properly adjusted.  I do not <Col N="284" /> know who made complaints with regard to the National Health inspectors operating.  I think that is one of the best ways to get the matter looked to. It obviates the necessity for increased expenditure.  There is no reason to believe that the work is not being done efficiently and earnestly and wholeheartedly by these people.</P>
      <P>The Court of Referees was another matter referred to.  It was suggested that sittings of the Court of Referees should be held oftener, or that special courts of referees should be held at stated times.  As to that, people will have to make up their minds on two points: (a) as to whether there is going to be more or less delay in having actual sittings of the Court of Referees on stated occasions, or whether it is not better to have the sort of system that we have at the moment; and (b) there is the question of expenditure.  I think that the present system gives the best results with an expenditure that is reasonable on those courts.  I think it was Deputy Hogan suggested that at certain periods special sittings of the courts should be held, and that the cases should be tried out.  I should be glad if the Deputy would let me have his views on the matter in writing, setting out the number of court sittings that he would have in regard to a particular area, and let us see what the extra cost would be.</P>
      <P>Then there was the big matter raised about delay.  When this point was raised when the Dáil met last Thursday, I was dismayed by the statement made, particularly by Deputy Davin, I think, with regard to delay.  There has been very little delay in the handling of these cases.  There always has been and will be delay in cases where fraud is suspected, and there I cannot agree with Deputy Johnson's plea in the case that he questioned me about yesterday, where there was fraud suspected. If the fraud is actually there, there is no right to benefit.  Take the case the Deputy raised.  If the stamps have been improperly affixed and have been taken from another book and so on, then the claimant on foot of those stamps has no right.  The whole question, which is fundamental, is: Has he any rights to any benefits whatever?</P>

      <P>If the payments have been deducted from his wages&mdash; and in this matter it is a question whose agent the employer is who makes the deductions&mdash;if in good faith the claimant has allowed deductions to be made from his wages monthly, yearly, and so on, and sees stamps put on his book, and it then turns out, when the claim is made, that somebody has apparently been defaulting, then I think the applicant ought, at least, to get the benefit of the provisional doubt and ought to be paid unless it is proved that he has been a fraudulent conspirator in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to hear Deputy Johnson speaking, not as Chairman of the Labour Party, but as Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, on this subject, if he found my Department appearing before him for having paid a claim before the charge of fraud made was investigated. I think we would get a sharp comment if we entered upon that line of conduct.  Once there is fraud suspected, everything has to be gone about more carefully than where a case seems a straightforward case. There may be collusion between employer and employed.  The whole thing is clothed with suspicion, and, very naturally, such a case will have to be very much more carefully handled than what appears to be a straightforward case.  Most of the cases where there, has been delay have been found to be due to suspicion of fraud or something very near fraud.  Ordinarily speaking, no sub-department of mine has so many inquiries and letters to answer as the section dealing with unemployment insurance.  There is an average of about 70 complaints or letters with regard to unemployment contributions per week.  Take the normal letters written in the normal type of case that calls for correspondence. There have to be a great number <Col N="286" /> of inquiries.  Complaint is generally made either to myself or my private secretary, or the head of the Department here in Dublin.  That necessitates inquiry at the local office, and generally an inquiry from the National Health Insurance to see whether a man has been in receipt of sickness benefit while out of work.  It may, and it does in the big proportion of cases we have to deal with, necessitate inquiry in London as to old payments and old books, and there are a variety of other circumstances to be inquired into.  The most obvious cases of delayed payments would represent the cases of men who had mixed up their unemployment hooks or lost them.  There would be the question there of tracing and so getting sufficient evidence to get on the track of the old books or to make up one's mind as to what the amount of employment has been. There is quite an amount of inquiry necessary in the simplest of these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the speeches made on the opening day of the session upon this matter I asked for inquiries to be made with regard to correspondence, and a certain number of cases filed were taken at random and examined.  Sixty-two files were taken.  These were cases where we had letters either from Deputies or from such bodies as the Trade Union Congress, or some such authority, or from solicitors on behalf of claimants, and where questions followed.  In 55 out of the sixty-two cases taken at random nothing farther was gained by parliamentary questions.  Mainly the parliamentary reply was a repetition of the last letter written either to the Deputy or the claimant.  In seven of the cases there was a certain amount of improvement, but the improvement occurred in this way: In one case the claimant would not complete the answer on the form.  When the Deputy took the matter up it was explained to him that the difficulty arose because of the incomplete forms.  The forms were then completed and benefit paid.  In another case the claim was under investigation and was cleared within a day of the question being put down&mdash;it was on the point of being cleared in any event.  The third case was a difficulty through an unemployment <Col N="287" /> insurance book not being lodged, and by writing back to the person who raised the matter he was able to have the book traced, which the claimant had not been able to do for himself.  There was another case of a book that had gone astray, or of a workman who lost his book, or said he lost it, and it was traced.  There was one case where fresh facts were brought to light through the intervention of the Deputy and where benefit was paid, although it had been previously refused.  That was the only case out of the sixty-two.  There was one other case where fraud had been suspected and the Deputy was informed that the matter was under investigation. The investigation lasted a considerable time longer; eventually a sufficient case seemed to have been made to have benefit paid without pursuing the fraud suspicions further.  I could get a further analysis made with regard to these cases.  The average of the sixty-two cases included a number of cases in which fraud was suspected, and in only one of the cases in which fraud was suspected was the idea of fraud afterwards abandoned. Even allowing for the fraudulent cases, the average period taken to settle these cases was a period of nineteen days including Sundays.</P>
    <P>I do not think that was an unreasonable period if Deputies will take into account what I said, that there has to bean inquiry made at the local office, to the Accountant's Branch and to the National Health Insurance Commissioners, and so on.  I will certainly see to it that there will be no suspicion of avoidable delay.  I would not like to be taken as assenting that there has been any delay, because I do not think it is so.  My Department has had many letters from Deputies, from solicitors, from the outside public, thanking them for their attitude towards these claims and the energy they displayed in trying to get matters settled, and there will not be in the future, as there has not been in the past, any delay that can be avoided.  Deputy Morrissey said that if we could insist on more compliance the Government contribution would go down.  Surely it is the other way, as the more stamps bought the more the fund would increase; but I do not want <Col N="288" /> that to be taken, as meaning that we are in alliance with the would-be fraudulent employer, in order to keep the contribution as low as possible.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £41,358 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1928, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Finance, including the Paymaster-General's Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will see that this Estimate does not differ very widely from the Estimate presented to the Dáil last year.  There have been certain increases in personnel.  There are four principals instead of three.  There are twelve assistant principals instead of ten, and there has been an increase in the number of junior administrative offices.  In part this increase is due to the setting up of the Tariff Commission and the work of the Public Appointments Commission.  The work of the Tariff Commission occupied the whole time of one of the junior administrative officers and a considerable amount of the time of one of the assistant secretaries. The Public Appointments Commission occupies a substantial amount of the additional time of the other assistant secretary.  The work of the Economy Committee, which was set up just before the dissolution, will occupy, for the next year or so, a great deal of the time of a junior administrative officer and also of an assistant principal. There is an increase in the staff of the Paymaster-General's office, and that is due to the work provided for under sub-head G, Repayment to the British Government for work done by the <Col N="289" /> British Government actually in connection with the Teachers' Pension Fund.</P>
    <P>It has been felt, for some time, that the condition of this fund, and its solvency required actuarial investigation. There is no one in this country capable of carrying out the actuarial investigation of the fund.  Actuarial investigation in connection with National Health Insurance has been done for us by the British Government actuary.  He has recently been doing work in this connection. It was considered that the most economical arrangement was to obtain his services for the teachers' fund, for the actual work involved a certain amount of spade work, and that involved an increase of staff in the current year.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I should deal with any general matters.  Obviously, I might be talking about points in which Deputies are not particularly interested.  I think it would be better if I allowed Deputies to open the discussion on such general matters as they think best, and that I should deal with them by way of reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two matters I would like to raise under this Vote.  One of them is the position with regard to subscribers to the Dáil loan, who have not been able to furnish official recipts.  There are quite a considerable number of those who subscribed sums varying from £1 to £15, and some of them never got official receipts from the collectors. Others did, but destroyed them because of the danger in keeping them.  There are a large number through the country who have not any acknowledgment of the State's indebtedness to them, and I would like if the Minister stated his intention with regard to giving them an opportunity of proving that they did subscribe.  Many of them are in a position to name the persons, some of whom hold important positions in the State, who collected the money from them, and in many cases they have written statements stating that those persons got the money and sent it on to the Minister for Finance in the Dáil. I think it is advisable that some means should be found whereby an opportunity would be given to them to furnish proof of the payments made.  I <Col N="290" /> do not think they have been asked officially to furnish proof, except documentary proof, such as receipts.  Many who have no receipts are in a position to prove by affidavit and otherwise that the money was collected from and paid by them.  There are some cases, too, where it is doubtful, although the money was collected by responsible people, whether it reached the Ministry at the time.  I would like to know what the attitude of the Minister to cases of that kind would be.  The money was seized in some cases.</P>
      <P>The other point is: Is the Minister in a position to say what progress has been made with regard to the actuarial investigation into the Teachers' Fund? There is complaint about the great delay which has taken place in connection with this matter.  It is over twelve months since the investigation was promised, and there are very important matters depending on it.  I would like to know when the Minister expects that the matter would be finished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps while the Minister is dealing with the question of accounting, he might tell the House what the position is regarding the American judgment in the matter of the American loan.  I think there was a statement made that the position was under consideration.  It is well to know whether that consideration has come to fruition, and whether it is opportune to make any statement to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister, also, if he will publish, in a convenient form, the accounts relating to unemployment insurance from the time it was taken over in April, 1922.  There were circulated, a couple of years ago, the summary accounts for the years 1922 and 1923.  I think the time is now arrived when full disclosure of the position of the fund should be made and the accounts for the several years should be published, including the position now created, of the acceptance of liability for the pre-1922 overdraft.  I think while we are on that we might ask the Departments concerned to bring together, in one volume, in a more convenient form than is at present available, the various financial accounts of the <Col N="291" /> State.  We have the finance accounts coming at the end of the year, and then we have other odd leaflets occasionally circulated, but if we can have them all in one small volume, it would be an advantage.</P>
    <P>I want also to ask the Minister whether he can follow the practice in Great Britain, regarding temporary borrowing, to publish the price that is paid by the Minister, the, rate of interest he agrees upon.  Also, I think it is not unusual for the name of the person or concern which lends to be published also.  I am not sure on the latter point, but I think it is quite clear that the rate of interest charged for temporary borrowing is published periodically, and that is not the case in the Free State.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister a question as to the conditions of employment in regard to cleaners and charwomen mentioned in the estimate.  How are these persons recruited?  Is due consideration given to widows with families, and is it the Minister's intention that such employment should be entirely devoted to those who have lost their breadwinners, and who are struggling to rear families?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>We have only been able to deal so far with a great deal less than half of the subscribers to the Dáil Eireann Loan, but progress is steadily being made.  Out of 135,000 subscribers we have had application from about 42,000.  Where we have records of the subscriptions of persons and where such persons apply no difficulty arises in connection with failure to hold a receipt, but if we have no record, and if a person applies, we are <Col N="292" /> up against a rather difficult situation. When we have made as much progress as we can make along present lines we will consider the setting up of a tribunal to hear claims.  I do not see any other way out of it.  All sorts of difficulties exist where we have no record.</P>
      <P>A case was brought to my notice in regard to a hamlet where there are only three or four persons residing. Apparently a meeting was held there at which subscriptions were collected, and the names of about forty persons are on the register with the name of the hamlet given as their address.  As I say, only three or four people live there, whereas there might be several John Smiths given on the register with that address but none of whom lives there.  It is difficult to find out what John Smith within a range of three or four miles of that hamlet subscribed, say, £3 or £4 to the loan.  The whole problem is fraught with difficulty.  In some counties practically no question will arise, as we have almost complete records in connection with them, and have had applications from several subscribers. In the course of a short time we will probably get applications from the remainder and we can make repayment. In other counties, however, we have very-defective records.  I do not see how we will be able to deal with the matter otherwise than by the appointment of a tribunal to hear evidence and come to the best conclusion it can.  We are anxious to repay every penny of the money to every person who subscribed, or to his representatives. With regard to the money that did not reach the Ministry, I do not see what we can do.  We are only authorised under the Act to repay money that came into account.  If it did not reach the Ministry of Finance I do not think we could do anything without further legislation.  If there were numerous cases, or cases that involved great hardship, there might be reason to come to the Dáil for further powers in the matter, but at present we are only concerned with the money that actually reached the Exchequer of the old Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that I cannot give an answer on the spot to Deputy O'Connell <Col N="293" /> with regard to the progress of the actuarial investigation in regard to teachers' pensions.  I have not been much in touch with these matters for the past two months, and I could not say how the matter stands.  With regard to the American loan, we have decided not to bring any appeal. Such money as was held in America and was in question in the litigation is being returned to the subscribers.  To that extent our responsibility is lessened except for the question of expense that may be involved.  It is, so far as we are concerned, the same as if we were getting the money, financially, at any rate.  I have always taken the line, no matter what courts outside may say, that we are the successors of the First Dáil.  We are bound to repay that money, and we are certainly bound to repay the portion that came over here and was used. The full text of the American judgment has recently been received in my Department, but I have not had an opportunity of going into it.  It was sufficiently examined, however, to convince us that there was no case for our litigating further in the matter.</P>
    <P>I will look into the question of accounts relating to unemployment insurance. If it was the custom to publish accounts, I think we should publish them.  In any case I think we should publish accounts in reasonable detail, giving the facts, so that Deputies may have them.  I will have that matter examined.  With regard to temporary borrowings, we are at present borrowing simply from one institution.  We were able to get the amounts we required so far, so that we can carry on until we issue a loan in the autumn.  We have been able to get these from the Bank of Ireland. We have a condition that would enable us to borrow temporarily under the conditions under which borrowing takes place in Great Britain.  Whether any announcement in regard to the rates at which we borrow at present would enable us to borrow more cheaply when we are going to issue to the public next November is a matter about which I am not sure.  That is the only question involved.  There is no question of making any mystery <Col N="294" /> about what we are paying.  It is simply a question of the effect that the rates of interest we are paying might have on the public mind.</P>

It has met once.  Naturally, owing to the elections, it was not possible for any Minister to give much time to it, but it will get on with its work.  I hope to be able to announce definitely the name of the permanent Chairman, and it will then be able to get on with its work.  The witnesses will be the officials of the various Departments.  There will not be any public sittings.  I am not sure what the position is in regard to the conditions of employment of charwomen and cleaners.
