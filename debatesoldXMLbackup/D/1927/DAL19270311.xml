      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he can state whether the question of obtaining cheaper monetary accommodation than at presents exists for general State purposes, through the agency of the Post Office Savings Bank from deposits, has been considered by his Department, and whether with a view to attracting increased deposits legislation will be introduced in this Session raising the authorised rate of interest to 4 per cent. per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not considered that the raising of the rate of interest on deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank to 4 per cent. per annum would have the effect of providing cheaper monetary accommodation than at present exists for general State purposes. <Col N="1784" /> The Minister for Finance is under a statutory obligation to invest Savings Bank moneys entrusted to him and, naturally, feels it incumbent on him to pay as high a rate of interest on such part of the moneys as is invested in Ways and Means Advances to the Exchequer as could be obtained by investment of such moneys in the highest class of Government securities. If the rate of interest on deposits were increased to 4 per cent. it would be necessary in the future, if not at present, to increase the rate of interest on Ways and Means Advances in order to secure that the Post Office Savings Bank Fund should be maintained in a thoroughly solvent condition.  It must not be overlooked that the expenses of management of the Post Office Savings Bank Fund are very considerable. According to a return prepared in 1902 the cost of each transaction in the Savings Bank was about sixpence on the average, and it is extremely probable that the cost has increased since then.</P>
      <P>Another effect of increasing the rate of interest on deposits to 4 per cent. would be to leave no money available in the Post Office Savings Bank Fund to be set aside against depreciation in the value of the securities in the Fund, and to deprive the Exchequer of any surplus interest.</P>
      <P>Moreover, if 4 per cent. were paid on deposits it would lead to considerable interference with normal Post Office work, as it is certain that a large number of people, attracted by the higher rate of interest, would transfer their deposits from the Joint Stock Banks to the Post Office, and banking business would consequently take up a considerable portion of the time of Post Office officials.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the cause of the delay by the Commissioners of Public Works in carrying out the drainage schemes adopted by the Westmeath County Council early in 1926; and when it is intended to proceed with the work in Tyrrellspass and Rochfortbridge, Westmeath, in view of the large number of persons unemployed in these districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdmundJDuggan" hpid="Mr. DUGGAN Mr. DUGGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DUGGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the large number of petitions lodged under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, there has been no avoidable delay on the part of the Commissioners of Public Works in investigating the thirteen petitions received from the Westmeath County Council.  Preliminary engineering reports have already been received regarding seven of these thirteen schemes.  In two instances preparations are being made to have the schemes submitted to the occupiers of <Col N="1786" /> land concerned as required by Section 6 of the Act.</P>
      <P>As regards the Rochfortbridge and Tyrrellspass petition the preliminary engineering inquiry has been made, and the Valuer's report has also been furnished and is at present under consideration. It will not be possible, however, to start work early on this scheme because, even if it should appear a promising one from the economic standpoint, detailed engineering inspections and surveys will be necessary so that a complete proposal as regards works and cost can be prepared for submission, after due notice, to the occupiers of the lands to be benefited.  This survey cannot be made in flood conditions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdmundJDuggan" hpid="Mr. DUGGAN Mr. DUGGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DUGGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That will depend, in the first instance, on the owners of the land, who will vote as to whether the scheme will be gone on with or not.  If they do not vote in favour of paying the drainage rate involved in the carrying out of the scheme, well then it simply will not be carried out at all.</P>

His claim was disallowed by the Insurance Officer on the ground that he was &ldquo;not unemployed&rdquo; and &ldquo;not unable to obtain suitable employment.&rdquo;  Mr. Moloney appealed against the Insurance Officer's decision to the Court of Referees, who recommended that the claim be disallowed.

      <P>I was not satisfied on the evidence before me that the claimant had reached the statutory age for receipt of an old age pension and the formal decision disallowing the claim was given on the 15th of December, 1926.  No birth certificate was produced. Claimant was shown as &ldquo;full age&rdquo; at her marriage on the 24th of February, 1892.  Statements were received from two persons who knew claimant for years, but no relevant facts were mentioned in support of their contention that claimant was 70 years of age.  The decision already given cannot be reconsidered.

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture if he has received complaints from the North Cork area as to the large number of bulls rejected on inspection under the Live Stock Breeding Act, 1925, and if he is aware that the effect of the excessive percentage of rejections will be to cause a shortage of breeding stock with consequent loss and inconvenience, and whether he will say what steps he proposes to take in connection with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The information at my disposal indicates that a large proportion of the young bulls exhibited in some districts, including portion of the North Cork area, at the recent inspection, were very inferior in type, and unsuitable for breeding purposes.  The use of such animals would be detrimental to the cattle breeding industry, and their acceptance for licensing purposes would nullify the objects of the Live Stock Breeding Act.</P>
      <P>Farmers have been given ample notice to prepare for the operations of the Act, and having regard to the larger number of older bulls being retained, and also to the additional number of young bulls now being licensed, I do not anticipate that there will be any material shortage of bulls for breeding purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is expected that the total number of premium bulls standing for service in 1927 will be over 2,000, as compared <Col N="1796" /> with 1,600 in 1926 and 1,100 in 1925. This increased provision will assist in meeting any deficiency which might otherwise exist.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that great complaints have been made in several parts of the country with regard to the percentage of bulls rejected in certain districts?  In some districts, as many as 100 per cent. were rejected.  Is the Minister aware that the very high prices for pure-bred stock at the recent bull sale is attributed, to a certain extent, to the number of bulls rejected and the consequent shortage of bulls?  Would the Minister take steps to have re-examination in certain of these districts where the rejections were large, probably due to the particular inspector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There are centres within three miles of each other and it is quite possible that, at one centre, all the bulls might have been rejected but it would be most unusual.  I do not anticipate any real shortage.  There were, as a matter of fact, far too many bulls in the country.  Further, we are faced with very serious opposition, and it is absolutely essential to grade up live stock if we are to meet that opposition successfully.  The standard under the Live Stock Breeding Act has been gradually raised.  There were 25 per cent. of rejections on the first occasion; on the second and third occasions there were somewhat more, and last time the percentage was higher.  The farmers got ample notice and, though there has been a very high percentage of rejections in some districts.  I do not anticipate any shortage of bulls.  I am quite satisfied that the judges in question could not very well have passed the bulls they rejected.  Take Waterford, <Col N="1797" /> for instance.  One of the best farmers in Ireland and one of the best judges of bulls in Ireland acted as inspector there.  All the inspectors are, as a matter of fact, first-class farmers. I am quite prepared to read out a list of the inspectors and to get the comments of any Deputy.  I should be interested to hear it asserted that any one of the inspectors is not able to do his business properly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret I have to oppose the Second Reading of this Bill.  This is a Private Bill, and to pass the Second Reading would mean accepting the expediency of the Bill, granted that the allegations as to the facts in the Bill can be proved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To pass the Bill would commit us to the principle of reconstructing Butt Bridge, and from information at our disposal it is not considered that a bridge on a site so far west as Butt Bridge would enable the traffic to be dealt with satisfactorily &mdash; in other words, that a bridge much more east than Butt Bridge would be required to <Col N="1804" /> deal with the traffic difficulty.  In opposing this I am not concerned with what has appeared in certain publications &mdash; with the proposal to make a parking place for motor cars in the present Custom House Docks.  I do not believe that is a practical proposition. To make it a practical proposition it would be necessary to cover in the docks, which would be a very expensive proceeding.  A roadway would be required to portion of it, and I am not in a position to say where the money is to come from for that particular experiment. We must, I think, take into consideration in connection with this Bill the extension that has taken place in the city during the last fifty years. Butt Bridge was constructed about fifty years ago.  At that time probably the site of the bridge was suitable.  Considerable changes, however, have taken place since then.  One can get a better idea of the changes when it is remembered that the Custom House was at one time on the south-east corner of Grattan Bridge.  Since that time what was called the Rory O'More or O'Connell Bridge has been constructed, and Butt Bridge was also constructed since that time.  I do not think it is necessary to go into the merits of the particular bodies concerned in this, although I must say I regret very much that I feel called upon to oppose a Bill promoted by an important local authority in the Metropolis.  This particular local authority has control of the bridges. The bridges when constructed are paid for by the municipality of Dublin, and at least to some extent by the Dublin County Council.  In other words, the Port and Docks Board promotes the Bill, provides for the flotation of whatever loans are required for the work, and gets paid in return for the cost of the Bill, and the cost and maintenance of the bridge, by the citizens of the City and County of Dublin.  My objection is based entirely on the proposed site of the bridge.  I am satisfied from my examination of the problem that the site is not far enough east, that the bridge would require to be constructed some 200 or 300 yards further east in order to relieve the traffic.</P>
    <P>A census of traffic taken in 1923 and again in 1925 shows an increase of <Col N="1805" /> something like 60 per cent. in important centres in the city.  The traffic problem of the future, even if the increase does not continue at that rate, is going to be a very serious one, and it is a matter for serious consideration whether the sum of £90,000 should be spent on a bridge on the present site. I understand there were conferences between the Commissioners of the City of Dublin, the Port and Docks Board, and the Public Works Department.  My information is that at that time the estimate for the bridge was about £40,000, while the present estimate, I am informed, is about £90,000.  If the bridge be constructed as is proposed in this measure it may delay the construction of a bridge at a more easterly point, and I cannot emphasise too strongly the views that have been placed before me by those responsible for regulating traffic.  I need hardly say that the cost of regulating traffic has increased very considerably in the last few years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the view put forward by the President on this important matter. The position of bridges in the city must, as he insists, be considered primarily from the point of view of future traffic.  The traffic problem, owing to the development of transport in recent years, is a notoriously difficult one in all the great cities, and the cost of regulating traffic in the City of Dublin has, it is well known, increased very much along with the difficulty.  This proposal to rebuild Butt Bridge on its present site would not relieve congestion in the precise points at which congestion is most felt and where it militates against the welfare of our Dublin traders.  There is a bottle-neck at College Green, and through that passes, at certain hours of the day, a huge volume of traffic from the docks.  The reconstruction of Butt Bridge will not relieve that pressure; it will merely provide an avenue of approach for more traffic into that bottle-neck.  As a sequel to this reconstruction, I understand it is intended to widen Tara Street.  That would be a costly business, and it will merely bring relief to one small portion of the city streets, <Col N="1806" /> while enhancing the difficulties opposite Trinity College and the Bank of Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is quite feasible, as the President suggests, to construct an entirely new bridge in a new situation further east of the Custom House.  The objection to that that occurs to the man in the street is that it would impede shipping, the arrival and departure of steam boats.  Anyone who is acquainted with the way in which those problems have been solved in continental ports is well aware that, for example, at Rouen there is a transporteur bridge &mdash; a mechanical arrangement is devised giving a moving platform or ferry, and vehicles and foot passengers go at street level on to that and are conveyed across, and there is not the slightest impediment to shipping.  A replica of that was constructed at Newport, called the transporter bridge.  A construction of that type is less costly, much more efficient, and provides the further facility of leading up to the clearing of practically derelict property and slums and getting an egress in the neighbourhood of Lombard Street.  So that with such a bridge it would be possible to have a straight run practically from Clontarf district, through Amiens Street, right along one continuous thoroughfare out to Ballsbridge.</P>
      <P>In view of those possibilities it would be utterly wrong to sanction the expenditure of a huge sum on a proposal which does not take account of the existing conditions, and, what is worse, does not take account of future development. The proposal is bound up with the whole question of town planning, and what the City Commissioners are thoroughly alive to is the urgent need for the setting up of a town planning authority.  It would anticipate town planning and would frustrate proper town planning if this Bill were allowed to go through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in a somewhat difficult position, because as a member of the Port and Docks Board I am called upon to justify the proposal of that Board in face of opposition from the President, followed by opposition from Deputy Magennis, who sits <Col N="1807" /> for a Dublin constituency.  The difficulty in connection with this matter is that the majority of Deputies are not in a position to form a proper judgment even on any argument I may put forward or that is put forward by the President on a matter which is really a domestic one concerning the City of Dublin, the Port of Dublin, and the area surrounding Dublin.  The ordinary procedure in connection with Private Bills is that a Second Reading is taken as a matter of course, and all the arguments for and against are thrashed out in Committee.  The President contends that the Bill should not be submitted for examination to a Joint Committee. It seems to me, apart from the merits or demerits of the Bill, that this is a somewhat drastic method of dealing with a Bill promoted by the Dublin Port and Docks Board after consultation with the other bodies, particularly the City Commissioners, and after an agreement had been come to on the matter before the Bill was promoted. But, of course, I could not expect to carry the Bill in face of the opposition that is manifested, nor do I think it would be desirable that the Port and Docks Board should persist with the measure when it has been received by the House in this spirit.  I would like, however, to go as briefly as possible into the merits of the case, as a member of the Port and Docks Board who has, for the past twenty years, urged and impressed, on every occasion that presented itself, the necessity for rebuilding Butt Bridge.  The bridge was originally constructed as a swing bridge for the purpose of preserving the river for shipping west of it.  The bridge was built in 1877, but shortly after it was built the project called the Loop Line was initiated, connecting by rail Westland Row and Amiens Street stations.  The building of that line definitely confined the limits of the Board to the east of Butt Bridge, because the Loop Line became an obstruction which could not be negotiated by ships, and therefore the upper reaches were permanently thrown out of use as far as port purposes were concerned, and could only be used for navigation by <Col N="1808" /> small craft, such as Messrs. Guinness's lighters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody who knows Butt Bridge will recognise that it should never have been erected as it is, that it is quite unsuited to the changed order of traffic and conditions, and is quite unable to deal with the traffic going over it.  Objection is raised to the Bill on account of the idea, based on traffic considerations perhaps, but largely because the traffic is going to be altered, in view of the alterations in the neighbourhood of the Custom House docks by extending Amiens Street to the quays, and it is suggested that that traffic should be carried by a bridge which would have its base at Moss Street.  The merits of that proposal have been considered by the Port Board.  They do not believe that a bridge built there would materially alter things as far as traffic is concerned, while it would sacrifice a very valuable portion of the river for port purposes.  They also maintain that even if that bridge were built, the reconstruction of Butt Bridge would still be necessary.  As between the merits of the two arguments, I think the matter would lead to a great deal of contention on both sides, which would be very difficult for the House to settle. What I suggest is, if possible, that the House should hold up the Second Reading of the Bill and give an opportunity for some independent body, or some people who would be nominated, to consider the whole question in all its bearings.  We might then be able to arrive at some conclusion, because if this Bill is refused a Second Reading the position is that you refuse the opportunity that the Port Board presents of dealing with a question which is not of to-day or of yesterday, but which has been a pressing question for the last twenty or thirty years.  As the President has said, the Port and Docks Board is the bridge authority.  Whether it is right or wrong that it should be so, I will not argue, but it is the authority, and you could not possibly expect the Port and Docks Board to promote a Bill to build the Moss Street bridge, which would have such a detrimental effect on the port, because you must remember that the portion of the <Col N="1809" /> river that would be cut off from use by the erection of that bridge is a portion that is particularly valuable.  There are two lines of cross-channel steamers there, there is practically all the cement trade of the city there, and practically the whole of Guinness's traffic is handled there.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that Deputy Johnson is not here, because he would probably have taken the opportunity to abuse the Port and Docks Board, but I maintain that the members of the Board are actuated by such motives that, even if the erection of such a bridge were found to be against their interests, they would not oppose it except they were fully convinced that the other bridge would be of so great an advantage to the city and neighbourhood that it would justify them in doing so.  That is the position they maintain, and they say that with the rebuilding of Butt Bridge on the lines they propose, it would be able to deal adequately with any traffic problem that is likely to arise, in the near future, at all events. I think that the traffic problem is sometimes inclined to be exaggerated in the minds of people who have high ideas about town planning.  The Port and Docks Board may be wrong in their view.  That is a question for argument, but it is the very definite opinion of members of the Board, who are conversant with the traffic problem on and in the neighbourhood of the quays.</P>
    <P>Deputy Magennis has suggested a transporter bridge.  The Port Board are not in any way opposed to transporter bridges, but their view would be that a transporter bridge, so near Butt Bridge as Moss Street, would be an expensive and an entirely unsuitable erection.  No matter what you do you cannot abolish Butt Bridge, and with Butt Bridge the monstrosity it is, I say that the question as to whether further facilities are required should be considered in the light of going down a great deal further eastward than Moss Street, that the maintenance of a bridge at Butt Bridge, if it is not to be abolished, and the maintenance of another bridge a hundred yards down the river, is, in my opinion, a ludicrous proposition, and one that will not stand examination. Instead of killing the Second <Col N="1810" /> Reading of the Bill, leaving the Port Board no further forward and put in a position where they would not be willing to promote a Bill on the lines of Moss Street, if the President could see any way out of the impasse it would be well.  Various questions that arise, such as the Port Board being the bridge authority, are questions that really depend on the future.  I say that this Butt Bridge question is a very urgent matter, and I am perfectly certain that the Port Board will fall in with any suggestions that will get this thorny question settled, before there is any wrangle on it, either in the House or before a committee, on the recommendations of anybody in an independent position to examine the whole position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hewat deprecates the proposal not to give this Bill a Second Reading, but Deputy Hewat, I am sure, appreciates the point made by the President, that to give this Bill a Second Reading in fact commits one to the principle of the building of a bridge at Butt Bridge, and excludes the consideration of alternative competitive schemes.  One then goes on to examine in detail the proposal to build at Butt Bridge.  Anything else is out of order.  I understand that when certain schemes for the development of electric power from the Liffey were under consideration any references to the Shannon Scheme were out of order. That is the difficulty.  If we give this Bill a Second Reading to-day we are confined to the consideration of the proposal that there be a bridge built at Butt Bridge, and no considerations, such as the alternative proposal for a bridge further east, are in order. Deputy Hewat was quite candid.  The discussion, as far as it has gone, manifests a conflict between traffic and town planning considerations on the one hand, and berthage considerations on the other.  Deputy Hewat says that some people have the traffic complex overdeveloped and perhaps do not advert to the value of berthage consideration. That may be so or it may not be so. But I suggest that this conflict that is revealed by the discussion is a real one, and is not one regarding which the Dáil ought to take a hasty decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make this suggestion to Deputy <Col N="1811" /> Hewat: that we ought not to-day give this Bill a Second Reading; that the Second Reading of the Bill be postponed for quite a long period, three weeks or one month, and that within that time a Committee of the Dáil be asked to consider the merits of the Bill, unfettered as they would be by the passing of the Second Reading.  They would be unfettered to this extent, that they would be free to consider alternative proposals, free to explore the whole field of traffic considerations, town planning considerations, and so on, and they would not be rigidly confined simply to details of the proposal that there be a bridge at Butt Bridge. If we proceed from Second Reading to the Committee Stage of this Bill, then all these important considerations that have been urged by the President and Deputy Magennis would really be relevant.  The other proposal is, perhaps, unusual; perhaps not strictly within the four corners of any code of procedure known to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I submit that from the practical point of view it is desirable that this Bill be put back a month or six weeks; that within that time a Committee of the Dáil informally &mdash; if that is preferable &mdash; be asked to weigh up these considerations urged for and against, and to decide on this conflict of berthage versus traffic and town planning. Traffic is a very real and very important consideration for the citizens of Dublin, and I certainly would like that on that matter the Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána, or his nominee, be heard by the Committee of the Dáil. I think such a committee might also hear the Borough Surveyor and others. I think the net result of their examination would be that they, and through them the Dáil, would ultimately be in a better position to weigh justly the considerations for and against that have been urged here to-day.  But if we were asked to decide on them to-day, I submit the average Deputy would find himself wholly unfitted to take such a decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with the Minister if that could be done.  So far as the Port and Docks Board are concerned they would, in fact, be grateful <Col N="1812" /> for an examination of the proposal by a Committee of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an important point in this which should not be overlooked.  It is not the case in connection with a Private Bill that this particular motion for a Joint Committee which, in effect, asks the Dáil to agree with the principle of the Bill, should always be passed.  The contrary is the case.  When in the House there is opposition to a Private Bill, root and branch, it is at this stage the opposition ought to be manifested in justice to the promoters.  It is better to say to them at this particular point: &ldquo;Your Bill, in principle, is objectionable to the Dáil,&rdquo; than to allow them to go to the expense of appearing before a Joint Committee on Private Bills and, later reject the Bill for a reason that concerns its principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a Private Bill is referred to a Joint Committee the procedure is not the same as it would be in the case of, say, a Select Committee on a Land Bill.  The Deputies on that Joint Committee would be selected as people who would not, in fact, have any local or personal interest in the Bill.  The Deputies selected in this case might be from the West, from Donegal or from Cork; the selection might be Deputy Roddy, Deputy Myles and Deputy Murphy of Cork.  They would approach the Bill in a semi-judicial spirit, and they would not be able to consider alternative proposals.  They would, of course, have observations from Government Departments, and it is nearly certain that in face of a report from the Minister for Justice on the lines that the Minister has now given us, the Committee would take the line of specially reporting to the two Houses &mdash; at least to this House &mdash; that they thought the other proposals should be investigated.  But the Committee's difficulty would be to travel in any way outside their own strict terms of reference, namely, to find whether, in the first place, the Preamble of the Bill was proved.  When a Private Bill is referred to a Committee at all, expenses are undertaken by the promoters.  Therefore, the procedure of opposing a Private Bill at this stage, when the opposition <Col N="1813" /> is to the Bill, root and branch, is quite proper.</P>
    <P>It is quite simple to amend this motion so that consideration of the matter could be taken this day month, if necessary.  In the interval a Committee could be appointed, such as the Minister for Justice has suggested, or any other form of investigation could take place.  I think the only proposal we could take now is one to postpone consideration of this motion for a certain period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to fall in with that suggestion.  If the matter is to be postponed, a month may not be sufficient; probably it will require a longer time, because the various witnesses who are likely to come forward will take a considerable time to make preparations.  It will be more for the convenience of the Committee to have ample time to spare so as to examine the whole question.</P>

      <P>Pending the consideration of the desirability of such a development as Deputy Magennis mentioned, there is need for some better information of the merits of this proposal than at present exists for members of the Dáil.  It might be in conflict with our defined procedure here without passing the Second Reading to set up a Committee of the Dáil to weigh the pros and cons of the proposal embodied in the Bill.  But on the basis of a long postponement of the Second Reading I think it would be easy by agreement between parties to ensure that such an examination would, in fact, take place, and then people would be in a better position to discuss and weigh the points each way after, say, a six weeks' postponement.</P>
      <P>I think there would be very little difficulty in securing that the officials primarily concerned in matters of traffic and other issues that are involved would attend before a Committee, even if that Committee were not a Committee of the Dáil in the full sense of the word, but a Committee set up by agreement amongst the groups within the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the introduction of the Supplementary Estimate, in view of the importance of the matter and the interest taken in it in the South, I ask the Minister to supply the Dáil with some more information than is usually given beforehand in regard to estimates.  For instance, he might give us some details as to the financial arrangements which have been entered into with regard to <Col N="1816" /> the taking over of these creameries. That course would facilitate the discussion on the matter very considerably. Otherwise we will have only the statement of the Minister at the time, and there may be very many points of importance which we will not have time to study or to understand.</P>

There is no alternative to adopting the usual procedure; that is, giving notice of the Supplementary Estimate now and stating the position in full, after due notice, on Tuesday.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Dáil agree with the Seanad in the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Section 1, lines 25-36, inclusive, deleted and the following substituted therefor:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The member of Dáil Eireann who is the Chairman of Dáil Eireann immediately before a dissolution of the Oireachtas shall, unless before such dissolution he announces to Dáil Eireann that he does not desire to continue to be a member thereof, be deemed without any actual election to be elected in accordance with this Constitution at the ensuring general election as a member of Dáil Eireann <Col N="1818" /> for the constituency for which he was a member immediately before such dissolution or, in the event of a revision of constituencies having taken place, for the revised constituency declared on such revision to correspond to such first-mentioned constituency.  Whenever a former Chairman of Dáil Eireann is so deemed to have been elected at a general election as a member for a constituency the number of members actually to be elected for such constituency at such general election shall be one less than would otherwise be required to be elected therefor.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When this Bill left the Dáil, the position in regard to the Ceann Comhairle was that he would be automatically returned to the next Parliament following a general election as an additional member of the Dáil, and not representing any particular constituency. He would be a member of the Dáil but would be attached to no constituency, and would be a member over and above the number provided to form the membership of the Dáil.  If he is re-appointed to the chair, the position would be the same as that in the previous Parliament, but if he is not reappointed he would be an extra member of the Dáil, not specially concerned with any constituency within the State and, presumably, on the look-out for a constituency for the purpose of the next following general election.</P>
    <P>In the Seanad exception was taken to that position.  The spare part aspect was drawn attention to &mdash; a member of the Dáil with a roving commission and assigned to no particular constituency. Finally, the suggestion embodied in this amendment emerged.  That proposal has this advantage, that it is, in fact, the application to the proportional representation system of election of what takes place by agreement between the heads of parties in Great Britain.  It ensures the return of the Speaker to the next following Parliament as a representative of the constituency which he represented in the former Parliament. Speaking of the system that obtains in Great Britain, I said that there was no way under proportional representation of securing that, that <Col N="1819" /> there was no way, with P.R. prevailing as an electoral system, of earmarking a particular seat as the Speaker's seat and reserving that for him.</P>
    <P>This amendment of Senator O'Farrell's which was carried in the Seanad does, in fact, find such a way.  It proposes to return the Speaker automatically to the next Parliament, representing his former constituency, and that the constituency elect one member less. Let us take the position of the constituency. A Parliament meets, a member is called from its midst to act as Ceann Comhairle, and for most practical purposes he ceases to represent his constituency in any active sense and he becomes the representative of the Dáil in effect.  That position obtains throughout the lifetime of the next Parliament.  After the next general election the former Ceann Comhairle returns to the Dáil deemed to have been elected as a member for his former constituency.  Either he is reappointed to the Chair or he is not.  If he is reappointed to the Chair the position of the constituency is, in effect, what it was in the lifetime of the previous Parliament. If he is not reappointed, the constituency has effective representation in the body of the House.  It seems to me that the proposal secures all that it was sought to secure, all that was, in fact, aimed at by the Bill as it left the Dáil, and I recommend the acceptance of the amendment.</P>

It has the further advantage that, if by any chance he was not reappointed to the Chair, he would still represent a constituency and would still have the interests of his constituents to guard. The previous proposal was that if he was not reappointed to the Chair he represented no constituency, and there was the further disadvantage that it might bring him into competition with members of his own Party.  I do not think that that should be so, and I am glad of this proposal.</P>

      <P>I am glad to say that in the revised text of this motion the error which I pointed out yesterday has been amended, and now all the sixty-eight items in the vote are brought into line.  It might seem a small point, but it is important as showing the final establishment of uniformity in the public accounts of this country.  I would like to draw the attention of the House and the Minister, as this is the only opportunity we will have of discussing Estimates, to the great improvement in the form of the Estimates which we have received this year as compared with those which we received in the last few years.  At present all the items have been brought into line and very good work has been done in the way of simplifying public accounts.  The Estimates which were received in the early years of the establishment of the State, in 1922, 1923, 1924, and 1925, were extremely complicated and very hard to understand so far as Deputies were concerned, and practically impossible to understand so far as the outside public were concerned. As I say, very good work has been done in the direction of simplification, but there is one dark spot in the form in which these Estimates are presented, and that is that a certain item which appears in most of the Estimates has not only not diminished but has seriously increased, namely, Appropriations-in-Aid. We are asked to vote a sum of over £8,000,000 to tide over the period until after the general election, but during that period probably the sum of £8,400,000 may be actually spent by the State.  It does not appear in the Vote on Account.  That £300,000 or £400,000 extra will be spent by departments in running the administration of the country out of moneys which they collect, and which are put <Col N="1822" /> down here as Appropriations-in-Aid.  I think, five years ago, the Appropriations-in-Aid were not more than £400,000 or £500,000.  This year, for the first time, they have passed a million.  That is to say, a million pounds are being collected by departments, and a million pounds are being disbursed in the public administration without that money being actually voted by the Dáil.  That is, I think a retrograde step, and one which should not be allowed to continue.  Many of these items of this money which will be collected will be, as far as I can make out, practically in the nature of revenue while, on the other hand, other sums have been simply transferred from one department to another.  That is, I think, the principal objection that I can find to the form of the Estimates which we have received this year.</P>
      <P>There was an ancient resolution proposed, I think, in the British Parliament that the power of the Crown has increased, was increasing, and should be diminished, and if the motion of Deputy Baxter could possibly be interpreted as meaning that Appropriations-in-Aid had increased, are increasing, and should be diminished, then I would be very glad to vote in favour of Deputy Baxter's motion.  I am afraid I cannot read such an interpretation into his motion, and certainly not in the remarks with which he explained the reasons for which he put it down.</P>
      <P>I would point out that American experts were brought over to investigate the estimates of Northern Ireland some years ago, and whereas they found that the British system of estimates was, on the whole, sound, the one thing they could not understand was this antiquated survival of Appropriations-in-Aid which denies the Parliaments the right to vote certain moneys which are, in fact, collected and spent by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the general debate on this motion is concerned, I will not detain the Dáil very long.  I think yesterday's debate was quite long enough, but there was nothing of particular importance, certainly nothing new, raised in the course of the criticisms of the Government's financial proposals for the coming year.  It was simply a rehash  <Col N="1823" /> of very well-worn catch-words which have been indulged in both in this House and out of it during the course of the present Parliament.  There has been, I regret to say, a great inconsistency amongst various proposals that have been brought forward for a reduction of expenditure.  Perhaps such liberty and self-contradiction is permissible amongst the different Parties who occupy the central Benches in the Dáil; they allow a wide liberty of self-contradiction to their members. But it is very painful to see that this incoherence, with regard to the proposals for a reduction of taxation or criticisms of the votes has spread, with disastrous results, into the ranks of the Irish Labour Party.</P>

Let us hope that, although their criticisms of the votes which we are asked to pass have been entirely contradictory, after some time they will once more recover their unity because, now that they have had time to live down the fools they made of themselves when they excommunicated the Shannon scheme, they are, after all, one of the only two possible Parties in the State to-day.</P>

      <P>There have been proposals for the abolition of departments of State.  I submit, a Chinn Comhairle, that these proposals, in this debate, are out of order, as such abolition would involve legislation in order to change the existing terms of the Ministers and Secretaries Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1824" /> There have also been proposals for the suppression of the Army.  There have been proposals, as I mentioned last night, that the State should retire from the League of Nations and take no part in promoting the peace of the world.  The nett result of these proposals is, naturally, that we should hand over the political and military protection of this people to some outside State.  If such proposals were made in any other country in the world they would not be considered merely as verging on disloyalty, but as definite treason to the nation and to the State.</P>
    <P>Deputy Baxter, in explaining the reasons why he put down his motion, demanded a reduction in the cost of the administration and a corresponding increase in the Pensions Bill of the State. There is general agreement, amongst all sections of the House, that the country is suffering from over-taxation.  There is complete disagreement, in all parts of the House, as to how that over-taxation is to be remedied.  That is very natural, seeing that the reduction in the cost of administration must, necessarily, be a very complicated matter and one which will require expert study.</P>
    <P>The President of the Executive Council, some time ago, when protests were made to him as to the cost of the Government, said that the people were getting damn good value for their money.  I do not think that is the general opinion of the country.  I do not think myself that that is accurate. I think that there are very few instances in any branch of life in this country in which we get good value for our money as compared with many other countries.  But just as the cost of good government is high in this country so the cost of good commodities in other directions is high, and it will take a very long time, and a great deal of work on the part of the people, to improve the quality and to bring about that state of affairs which the President maintains is already in existence, whereby we will get good value for our money.  The financial proposals of the Government this year do not substantially differ from those of last year, but they differ very considerably from the proposals of the Government three or <Col N="1825" /> four years ago &mdash; the criminal period in the life of the present Government &mdash; when they refused to recognise any difference between the extraordinary expenditure of the State and the ordinary recurrent expenditure.  During the first three years of the life of the State the people were overtaxed very many millions.  They were forced to pay out of revenue very large sums which were expended on services which were of a non-recurrent and extraordinary nature.  But when a proposal, made in 1924, clearly to distinguish between all those sections in the Estimates which may be considered as capital charges and all those which were definitely recurrent, the proposal was met, with disapproval by members of the Farmers' Party; it was described by Deputy Hewat, on behalf of the Business Party, as leading inevitably to national bankruptcy.  But in the following year, 1925, the Government definitely adopted this principle and they made a division between the ordinary and the extraordinary Budget.  But in making that division they left out one very important item which, I maintain, and other Deputies maintain, should not be borne upon the vote as a recurrent liability which has to be met out of taxation, and that is the enormous sum, which Deputy Baxter in his motion proposed to increase, which we have to pay for pensions, superannuation and retired allowances.  It is mostly made up by the cost of paying for the late R.I.C., and is legitimately to be considered as part of the foundation charges of this State.</P>
    <P>If it was so considered by the Minister, and if steps were taken to fund this great amount and to spread it over a large number of years, enormous relief could be given to the taxpayers of this country.  Proposals have been made here, not only in the course of this debate but previously, for the appointment of a Committee of Inquiry into the cost of administration. The Government have pointed out the difficulty of putting into the hands of any body of experts the responsibility of deciding on national policy, of deciding what departments are more important than others, those which should be suppressed and those which <Col N="1826" /> should be increased.  I think that, in view of the political speeches which have been made in this debate, the Government would be very wise if they accepted that suggestion and appointed such a Committee.  Apparently it would have to sit for many years, possibly until the election after next, but if it were appointed it would be a very subtle and, I think, rather underhand trick on the part of the Government, because by appointing it they would remove the principal and, in some cases, the only plank of a certain number of parties that are going to appeal to the electorate.  It would be a very underhand trick for the Government to do so, but, of course, the Government, as we all know, is capable of anything.  If this Committee were appointed it is quite obvious that it could not consider the question of a reduction in the cost of administration without taking into consideration the whole question of the operation of Article 10 of the Treaty, which is the millstone around the neck of the present Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance described Article 10 of the Treaty as the worst Article in the Treaty.  If I, myself, had to choose which Article should be removed from the Treaty, I think that probably it would pay the country better in the long run to have Article 10 of the Treaty removed instead of the Article which prescribes the oath. I am quite sure that the Irish signatories to the Treaty never intended that this Article 10 should be a constant source of difficulty, or that it should prevent economical administration in this country.  The Minister and the Government would be entitled, as well as any Commission they set up, to go into this whole question and approach the British Government with a view to funding the sum which is required to carry out the terms of Article 10 of the Treaty.  I do not see why the British Government should have any objection to such a course.</P>

      <P>The old saying that it is the duty of the Opposition to oppose, no matter whether a case is good or bad, has, I think, never been better illustrated than by the debate that has taken place on Deputy Baxter's amendment to reduce the Vote on Account.  The Deputy wants to have a reduction, but, as Deputy Sears pointed out, he is not willing to have any of the big items interfered with. He has an academic idea in his mind that a reduction could take place, but does not say where.  His idea is somewhat like that of Alice in Wonderland: &ldquo;off with his head.&rdquo;  The Minister for Finance is to be executed, but the Deputy does not say in what manner the execution is to be carried out.  Deputy O'Connell is going to vote for the amendment, and says that the money of the country should be used for the benefit of the classes requiring it.  I think that there is a fair distribution of money amongst the wage-earning classes as far as the Government can carry out such a distribution. Nothing is perfect, unfortunately, but the Government has made a good attempt to have a fair distribution amongst all classes.  Deputy Byrne and Deputy O'Connell alluded to the unemployment which, unfortunately, is still frightfully rampant through the country.  A good deal of money has been spent on the roads, on the Shannon scheme, and there is a substantial sum in the estimates for the carrying out of preliminary work on the Barrow scheme.  All that money, to a great degree, will be distributed amongst the workers of the country.  Of course, work like the Barrow drainage scheme will benefit the whole area, farmers and all others concerned, eventually.</P>

      <P>I am sorry.  I think it was Deputy O'Connell who referred to the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy said, I think, that the reduction of a shilling in the income tax last year did not produce the return that might be expected in the matter of providing more employment.  We all realise, of course, that if income tax were lowered sufficiently and the county rates as well, that people would spend more money on improving their land &mdash; on drainage works and schemes like that.  The present rates of income tax, as well as the county rates, are a frightful drag on anyone who at the present time is anxious to improve his property. If you had reductions in both these directions a good deal of constructive work would, I believe, be carried out, and labourers at present unemployed would be given work.  I might mention that a year ago I improved a mile of the river running through my place in the hope that I would be recouped more or less in the way of income tax reductions.  The income tax was reduced 1/-, but I found that was not enough.  If it had been reduced by 1/6 it would have made a very great difference to me, and, I am sure, to a great many other people who feel as I do on the matter.  I think that if income tax were reduced it would offer a great inducement to people with capital on the other side to come over here.  For instance, if the rate here were lower than it is in England, I am certain that many people on the other side, people fond of sport and so on, would be delighted to come and settle here, and also that it would have the effect of inducing the best elements amongst those who left us to come back. Several suggestions have been made with regard to saving money, but many of them, I think, are not feasible.  Suggestions have been made to reduce the Army and to do away with the Ministries of Fisheries and External Affairs. I think that these things are all quite <Col N="1829" /> impossible.  In my opinion the Ministry of Fisheries is one of the most important that we have.  The fisheries of this country constitute one of our greatest assets.  I think, so far from doing away with that Ministry, that more money ought to be given to it to enable it to increase its usefulness.</P>
    <P>As regards the Department of External Affairs, I think it would be very ill-advised to abolish that Department, since it is the badge of our freedom.  It shows that we have a right to negotiate as a free nation with any other nation.  If we had not a Minister responsible for our foreign relations, we would have no such outward indication of the powers we possess.  What has been said about the reduction of the Army is, in great part, ridiculous.  I am convinced that it is absolutely necessary for us, as for every other nation, to have a small, effective Army for defensive purposes.  It is only for defence that we want it.  Deputy Redmond asked what was the good of having an army which was not able to repel invasion.  If our Army would not be able to keep a foreign enemy permanently off, it would, at least be able to keep them at bay for a certain time, until our friends would come to our assistance.  A case in point is Belgium.  If it had not been for the breathing space that the small army of Belgium gave to France at the commencement of the Great War, it might have meant disaster for the French. Deputy Redmond stated that as the Army could not repel invasion there was no use in having it.  When I was a student at the Royal Military College many years ago, we were taught by the professors that it would be impossible for the British Army to prevent a landing, and that, moreover, it might be undesirable to prevent it.  The suggestion there put forward was that on landing the invaders should be trapped between a force further inland and the Navy.  The English did not propose then to disband their army because it could not repel invasion.  Even apart from that, I do not think that our country is in such a state of perfect quietude that we would be warranted in bringing the strength of the Army much below what it is.  It might be reduced <Col N="1830" /> slightly, but I do not think it should be brought much below its present strength.</P>
    <P>Every week we read of arms being recovered, and even yet we know that there are a few individuals &mdash; they are very few &mdash; who have told us in no uncertain terms that even yet they would not mind having another &ldquo;go&rdquo; if it were possible.  That being so, the suggestion that we should do away with the Army is ridiculous.  We would, too, be robbing ourselves of a certain amount of dignity if we, of all the nations, with the exception of Denmark, were to have no army.  Some of the Deputies recommended that we should have an army only for ornament. Other Deputies suggested that we should not have an army at all, because it was ornamental.  I think it was Deputy Redmond who said that we might have a small army for ornamental purposes.  I suppose the purpose would be to provide a bodyguard for the Governor-General.  If we are to have an army at all, we should have a small, efficient army.  That is what the Government are working for.</P>
    <P>Deputy Good touched on the Land Commission.  He did not altogether damn it, but he expressed no great hope for the future of land division.  I think the Commission are distributing the land fairly well.  We would all like if they could do it more speedily, but it is a matter in which it would be possible to go too quickly.  It is evident that in some cases the occupying owners have found great difficulty in carrying on. I was greatly struck by the reference by Deputy Roddy to the system in Germany, by which the Commissioners there, when distributing estates, lend money to the new occupiers to enable them to work their holdings.  There is the same difficulty as regards working capital here.  In a great many cases the lands which have been newly divided are being let out on the eleven months' system.  The occupiers have not got the money to stock the farm. That is not desirable, and I think the German system is worthy of consideration, so that these newly-appointed land owners may have a chance of success. Otherwise there is, for many of them, only too good a chance of failure. <Col N="1831" /> It is in the interests of all that the division of land should go on as quickly as possible, and that it should be a success.  At the same time, we must realise that it must be done carefully or the second condition might be worse than the first.</P>
    <P>Whatever may be the result of the coming struggle at the polls, whether the present Government retains office or whether another Government succeeds them, the foundations of the State have been well and firmly laid for those who are to legislate in the future.  They will not have the difficulty that this Government had four years ago, when it took office and found everything in chaos.  The present Government will leave the State in good order and, on that foundation, I think there is just reason for hoping that a great superstructure will be erected which will do credit to this country before all the nations of the world.</P>

      <P>The opinions which I have to express may be, to a certain extent, in the nature of repetition. The fact that they are in the nature of repetition will not weaken them in any way if they be true.  We have to examine this vote in the same way as a business man examines his balance sheet and takes stock at the end of the year.  We have to do that in order to arrive at an appreciation of the conditions in the country.  There must be some relation between taxation and the economic conditions existing. One has to examine somewhat into the economic conditions in order to arrive at a conclusion as to whether the taxation which is being imposed is more than the people can bear.  I do not like to be too pessimistic but, in my opinion, the economic conditions in the country have not improved since this time last year, when we dealt with a similar vote.  In fact, I think the economic conditions have disimproved.  I arrive at that conclusion from my own experience and from the information obtained from the statistics placed at our disposal by the Government.  I am largely judging the conditions by my knowledge of affairs in the country. I am sorry that I cannot regard the condition of affairs in the rural districts <Col N="1832" /> or in the country towns as in any sense satisfactory.  Everywhere we find complaints.  We find them particularly in the towns.</P>
      <P>The reason is that the towns are a reflection of the conditions existing in the country.  If the farmers have not much money available for spending, the effect is very soon felt in the towns. There is grumbling and growling proceeding in all the small towns of Ireland, and there is open and plain evidence of a depressed economic condition. There must be a relation between the economic condition of the people and the taxation they are called upon to bear.  Remembering that, I have constantly expressed the view that every effort should be made by the Government to bring taxation to a level commensurate with the ability of the people to pay.  Since I have come into contact with Government departments I have begun to realise the difficulties Ministers are faced with when they endeavour to economise.  I realise that it is not nearly such an easy matter as I thought in the beginning.  At the same time, it is a case with us now of &ldquo;Needs must when the devil drives,&rdquo; and if the money is not available to meet the demands made for taxation we will have to find some way of cutting expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not necessary to deal with figures to any extent, as there has been no great change in the Estimates as compared with last year.  There has been no appreciable reduction in the expenses of administering the depart ments due to the special efforts of the Ministry to economise.  The reductions which we find here are largely automatic. They have not taken place because of any particular efforts on the part of the Government.  They were normal reductions which would take place in any case.  If I dwell to a great extent on the condition of the farming community, I will make no apology for doing so, because the whole basis of our industrial structure depends upon agriculture, and if agriculture is not prosperous the country cannot be prosperous. With the exception of one or two industries, practically all the industries of the country are to a certain extent parasitic upon agriculture.  They <Col N="1833" /> are either providing the agriculturists with the means of subsistence and production or taking their products and marketing them.  The whole basis of our economic structure rests on agriculture, and the condition of the agricultural community at present is a very serious one.  I have definitely come to the conclusion from observation and information I have received that a great number of farmers are not making ends meet; that their outgoings are exceeding their incomings and that they are drawing on capital.  I am confirmed in that by the reports of the Joint Stock Banks, which shows that deposits decreased last year and have been decreasing from year to year.</P>
    <P>Simultaneously with this decrease, there is also a decrease in the investments of those banks in Great Britain, which is a pretty clear indication that some portion of the community is living on its capital.  To a certain extent that theory is confirmed by our growing adverse trade balance.  That is, we are buying more than we are paying for in goods; we are, in fact, withdrawing our investments in Great Britain to a certain extent.  If that is the position it is unsatisfactory, and it cannot continue &mdash; it must come to an end.  We have to find out how we are to bring it to an end.</P>
    <P>I recognise that this is a problem that is very difficult to solve.  I am not going to state that over-taxation is the whole cause of it &mdash; I do not believe it is &mdash; but I believe it is an important factor in placing people, particularly agriculturists, in the position that they are not able to make ends meet.  In most countries taxation has a tendency to find its way eventually on to the producer. It is passed from one to the other until it eventually stops with the producer.  I do not say that all taxation comes down to the producer.  I agree that income tax and perhaps other taxes do not finally come down to the producer.  But I think it is generally acknowledged that taxation in this country has a tendency to be pushed on to the producer, and the farmer is the main producer.  It does not come on always in the form of direct taxation, but in reality the farmer pays taxation on almost every <Col N="1834" /> article he buys; he pays taxation on those he produces and distributes.  The result is that the farmer is finding himself faced with a cost of production on the article he is producing which makes it impossible for him in many cases to make the production a paying one.  The worst feature is that the cost of production is, to a large extent, out of his control.  He has to make those payments.</P>
    <P>I have heard the Minister for Finance state that he does not believe taxation can be reduced, but that he does believe the capacity of people to pay can be increased so that they can meet the present taxation by increased production.  I take practically the opposite point of view in that regard.  I do not agree that taxation can be met by increased production.  I believe that exactly the contrary must take place &mdash; that we must have reduced taxation before we can have increased production, and that when we have increased production it is quite possible that we can again have increased taxation.  The producer, particularly the farmer, who finds himself faced with certain definite fixed charges, knows that if he endeavours to produce to a greater extent these fixed charges will be applied to the extra production.  It is well known with regard to agricultural produce that increased production in many cases means increased cost per unit of production, with the result that, while overhead charges remain too high, to stimulate the farmer in any artificial way, or force him in some way to produce more, may actually cause him to increase his losses rather than decrease them.  If we are to have increased production, the first necessity is that we should have decreased cost of production, and inasmuch as taxation forms part of the increased cost of production, then I am against the present taxation.</P>
    <P>The Minister might very well ask &mdash; he has already asked us several times &mdash; how we propose to have taxation decreased &mdash; are we merely expressing a pious opinion, knowing quite well that it cannot be carried out?  I say that taxation will have to be reduced, and that if the Government does not reduce it the economic conditions in the <Col N="1835" /> country in a short period will be such, and the demand for relief will become so overwhelming, that this Government, or some other Government, will have to face up to the problem and find some method of reducing it.  When they are up against it, some method will be found.  It has been stated that Deputies should point out, after an examination of the Estimates, where the cost of Government Departments can be reduced.  I stated that I did not believe that could be done &mdash; that the examination which the Estimates receive here will not allow Deputies to point out any particular items which can be reduced.  I have confirmation of that statement from the interjection of the Minister for Finance yesterday when Deputy Cooper was claiming credit for certain reductions in the Army Vote.  The Minister for Finance practically said that these reductions were not due to the Deputy's criticism. I believe that they were not very much due to that criticism &mdash; they may have been partially due.  Although I have great respect for Deputy Cooper's powers of criticism, I do not believe that the result of that criticism would be effectual reductions in the Army Vote or the other votes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Very small ones, I must say.  I believe, and I have been supported in that belief by members on the Independent Benches, that the only really effective means of dealing with this and finding out where reductions can take place is by appointing a committee of inquiry.  I believe that the Minister will eventually have to give in to that demand.  I believe that such a committee must deal not only with the details of departmental administration, but with policy, and must make recommendations with regard to policy.  I am not in a position to state whether such a committee can make recommendations which will result in any appreciable reduction. Similar committees in Great Britain and the United States, however, have made such recommendations.  Even the Government of Northern Ireland were <Col N="1836" /> not above appointing an individual to go into their departmental administration. The Minister stated that a departmental committee had been appointed and was making inquiries with a view to pointing out where reductions might be made.  I believe that that Committee is working, but I have no faith in the recommendations of departmental committees composed of civil servants as to possible reductions. Civil servants have certain ideas fixed in their minds after long terms of service, and if we are going to have any change in regard to our departmental methods we will have to get men with fresh minds free from the red tape of officialdom.  There may be many possible economies that could be made in administration which the Minister has no possible chance of discovering and which will not be brought before him by a departmental committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the Committee I have suggested would find itself in a position to make recommendations as to policy, and that such recommendations should be made and should be considered. We have been told that if we are to have reductions we should point out where reductions can be made which will affect policy.  We have not hesitated to do that.  We had the moral courage to suggest considerable reductions in the upkeep of the Army and Gárda Síochána.  I am glad to see that the Army Vote has been reduced very close to the amount estimated by the Minister in his speech last year &mdash; £2,000,000.  I still maintain that we do not require an army costing £2,000,000 I do not say that we should not have an army, but I believe that we can maintain an army for £1,000,000 sufficient to meet any possible military or other requirements.  The argument that we should keep an army for the sake of the maintenance of our national prestige is one that we cannot tolerate in the present economic condition of the country.  Existence comes before prestige.  While we have people on the verge of starvation we cannot argue in favour of the maintenance of an army for the sake of the upkeep of our national prestige.  I regard the argument that the Army may have to be used at some period, either in coalition with <Col N="1837" /> England or independently, to repel invasion as a really fantastic one.  That position is not likely to occur in our generation.  I believe that the only purpose of the Army is the purpose of maintaining law and order, of keeping internal order and peace, and that, in fact, it is only another police force. Why is it necessary to have another police force?  Have we not a large and very expensive police force at present, and is that force not sufficiently powerful to maintain law and order and internal peace?  I maintain that it is, and that the Army, as at present constituted and at present acting, is not in any way helping, except that it may be regarded as a menace to those who are likely to create trouble.  I would further point out that a standing army without any possibility of active service, except internally, which I regard as very unlikely, becomes in itself a menace and is liable to give opportunities for intrigue of an undesirable kind, and may sometime, as we know from the experience of other countries, result in very undesirable happenings within the country.  For that reason I believe that we are justified in our demand that the Army be reduced to a very low level, and that one million pounds would be sufficient to pay for its maintenance.</P>
    <P>There were one or two statements made by Deputies to which I would like to refer.  In particular, it was stated from the Labour Benches that proper provision was not made for unemployment, and I understood Deputy O'Connell to say that State aid ought to be given for increased production. I have a good deal of sympathy with the request from the Labour Benches for something to be done to relieve unemployment, but my view is that it must be brought about eventually by means of stimulated individual production rather than by State aid.  I believe that the continuation or the extension of State aid to the unemployed, or even of State aid for the purpose of producing employment, is rather a dangerous policy and one that is not likely to improve conditions.  As a rule, State interference with business is never successful, and I think it is wrong to believe that the State ought to embark <Col N="1838" /> on large business undertakings or on large commitments for the sake of producing employment.</P>

I do not disapprove of the State endeavouring to relieve unemployment, but I believe that the fundamental job for the State is to improve economic conditions and to give individual employers a chance of building up their industries, thereby giving employment. When the State does give a loan to a farmer to improve his homestead, it probably also gives him an opportunity of employing labour.</P>

Carried too far, I think that that is liable to be dangerous for any class.  It is likely to take away reliance and self-confidence to have everybody running to the State, as they have very often been doing.</P>

It is rather a mystery to me where these people get the money, but as far as outward appearances are concerned they are getting it.  I believe that if things are to be put right economically it will not all have to depend on reductions in taxation.  In regard to the question of land settlement, I agree with Deputy Roddy's remarks, and I think very serious consideration ought to be given to them by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture.  I believe that in the present economic conditions if the Land Commission persist in settling men who have little or no capital on the land, without providing some other form of assistance for them, it will fail, and that it is already failing in many cases.  I believe it is a fact that lands, which have quite recently been divided, have gone out of the hands of the men who got them, that they have been letting the land for grazing, and often surreptitiously, without the knowledge of the Land Commission.  If that continues we will have a real crisis in a few years.</P>

There is room for economy, and economy can be effected.  I believe if this committee which I suggest is appointed that its appointment will eventually result in recommendations which will produce economy.  If the Government goes to the country without showing that it is prepared to take some very definite steps in the nature of reducing taxation I believe that the answer it will get will not be in accordance with the opinion which it holds now as to the possibilities of the election.</P>

      <P>I listened with a good deal of amusement to the speech made by Deputy Esmonde, and the more I listened to it the more amused I was. It is quite clear to me that his trip around the world had not the same effect upon him as in the case of Deputy Cooper.  Deputy Esmonde came back here, and neither the mighty spectacle of Niagara nor the invigorating air of the Blue Mountains of Australia clarified his thoughts or enabled him to weigh or size up the importance of the language he uses here.  That was quite the contrary to the case of Deputy Cooper.  Speaking here on the 8th February, Deputy Esmonde used these words: &ldquo;Although the disloyal, unpatriotic and rapacious civil servants are to-day secure, and while they are appealing across the water to what the Minister for Justice has described as &lsquo;a bad, useless and unnecessary court....&rsquo;&rdquo;  With the question of the appeal to another court I do not propose to deal, but I do propose to deal with Deputy Esmonde's allegation that civil servants are absolutely unpatriotic and rapacious. No Minister, according to the official report, appeared to consider it worth his while to reply to the charges made by Deputy Esmonde, and perhaps on consideration there was a reason for that.  After the nonsensical questions as to the colour of the National Flag, and as to what was the National Anthem, which have recently been put by Deputy Esmonde, one perhaps ought not to take too much notice of what Deputy Esmonde says.  But lest he might imagine by the Ministerial silence <Col N="1841" /> that his statement was irrefutable, I want to take this opportunity of protesting in the strongest possible terms against that libellous statement regarding civil servants.</P>
      <P>Nobody has served this nation in its new-found freedom and its new-found course better than the civil servants.  Their service has drawn encomiums from Ministers time and again, and every Deputy who has had recourse to different Government Departments knows perfectly well the consideration and the attention which he receives from civil servants.  Deputy Esmonde may not have got that, but perhaps there may have been a good reason for it.  If Deputy Esmonde makes the same class of statements in these departments as he makes here one could sympathise with the uncivil civil servant who happens to deal with him.  I think every Deputy will recognise, as every Minister has recognised, that the civil servants have served this nation well during a time of evolution, during a time of revolution, and during a time of experiment, and I think it ill becomes a Deputy to charge civil servants with being absolutely unpatriotic and rapacious. If Deputy Esmonde thought he was doing a service to the nation by making these allegations I want to assure him that, so far as the Civil Service and so far as the mass of intelligent public opinion is concerned, Deputy Esmonde will be regarded as doing a great disservice to the nation.</P>

      <P>One must realise that in this House Deputy Esmonde's Party is the personification of unity, thinks with a single thought, moves with a single action and, generally, has a singleness of purpose in its conception and in its outlook; and that is, perhaps, more than any Party in this country can say to-day.  When Deputy Esmonde made some inquiries about, and reviewed the position of, the Labour Party, I thought he was considering the question of making overtures. That would be nearly as serious as Deputy Esmonde's speech on unity; not quite, but very nearly as serious. It was rather interesting to me because all the indications are that, notwithstanding the smoke screen last night and to-day, Deputy Esmonde is negotiating for a return to his original and, perhaps, natural home.</P>

    <P>I intend to take this opportunity of referring to the work of the Civil Service Commission.  I will not deal with the way in which it fills appointments; that is not a matter I want to deal with here.  I really want to criticise the class of papers that are set at examinations held under the auspices of the Civil Service Commissioners. The Urban District Council of which <Col N="1843" /> I am a member, the Rathmines Urban District Council, proposed some time back to promote a person to the rank of clerk, his duty being to send out accounts, invoices, etc.  Before he could be promoted he had to be examined&mdash;to undergo an educational examination.  A representative of the Ministry attended and duly examined him.  Two of the questions that were put to him were: &ldquo;Who was the author of &lsquo;Dracula&rsquo;&rdquo; and &ldquo;Who wrote &lsquo;The Riddle of the Sands&rsquo;&rdquo;?  I ask the Minister for Finance, in all seriousness, what has &ldquo;Who wrote &lsquo;The Riddle of the Sands' &rdquo; or &ldquo;Who was the author of &lsquo;Dracula,&rsquo;&rdquo; to do with the sending out of accounts or invoices by the Rathmines Urban District Council?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy asking us further riddles?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. NORTON Mr. NORTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have another illustration. The Civil Service Commission recently held an examination confined to auxiliary and temporary postmen with a view to appointing them to the establishment.  If they were appointed to the establishment they would start off on a basic wage and bonus, combined, of 38/- a week, and after about eleven years of service would come to a maximum of £3 12s.  The Civil Service Commission set examination papers for those men, and, considering the nature of the post, one would not imagine that the papers would be unduly severe.  The men turned up for examination and they found themselves asked to describe the main features of the Saorstát Constitution.  I would like the Minister for Finance to ask members of his own Party what are the main features of the Saorstát Constitution. I venture to say that the replies would be nearly as interesting as the replies which the Civil Service Commission got to that question when it was set to auxiliary and temporary postmen.  These people have been away from school for ten or fifteen years. They were asked in another paper &ldquo;Who was Godfrey O'Donnell?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>No, Godfrey O'Donnell. It would be more reasonable if it were Ramsay Macdonald; he would be of greater public interest, at any rate. In the name of all reason, what has the identity of Godfrey O'Donnell to do with filling the appointment of postman?  What has it to do with delivering letters?  The fact that a man would know who Godfrey O'Donnell was is no indication that he could deliver letters.  The Minister should take some steps to have examination papers set which are reasonable and which bear some relation to the position to be filled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. EVERETT Mr. EVERETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. EVERETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with other Labour Deputies in protesting against the reduction in the amount allocated for the relief of unemployment. First, I would like to refer to Deputy Redmond's remarks.  I happen to represent one of the largest fishing centres in all Ireland, not in the Saorstát alone, and I do not agree with Deputy Redmond that we should abolish the Department of Fisheries and leave it the Cinderella of the Department of Lands and Agriculture. That is the parrot cry of a Dublin daily paper that has been attacking this and another Department for a considerable time.  I notice that it has been silent for the last six months.  I wonder at what price is that paper silent?  I would like to know from Deputy Redmond is it the policy of his new Party to abolish the Department of Fisheries? If it is, it will be news to some of my constituents.  In an important portion of my constituency Deputy Redmond addressed a large meeting some weeks ago and he gave promises of what he was going to do in the interests of the fishermen.</P>
      <P>I also disagree with Deputy Redmond on the question of external affairs. Some time ago, when Deputy Magennis was in the Government Party, he gave us a lecture on what the Department of External Affairs signified; he indicated it was the outward and visible sign of a separate nation.  I agree, and for that reason I object to this particular office being abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lyons made a rather peculiar statement here last night&mdash;to solve the <Col N="1845" /> unemployment problem by creating further unemployment.  He held that in the Local Government Department there were too many officials and large numbers could be dismissed.  I speak as one who has some conception of the work of the officials engaged in that department, and to my own knowledge I know that heads of that department have put in over twelve hours a day and have often worked on a Sunday. That applies to the Roads Department and to other sections.  I am sure other Labour Deputies who have approached the Local Government Department on behalf of constituents will bear me out in that statement.</P>

      <P>They are breaking the Trade Union rules in various departments. I am glad the Minister for Education has come in.  I can now mention that there are great complaints in my constituency over the Compulsory Attendance Act.  While I agree with it, I think it should not have been enforced until better sanitary accommodation was provided in the schools. The schools should be improved to meet the increased attendance that will take place.  In some rural areas children have to walk over three miles often in inclement weather.  There are other disadvantages, and I ask the Minister to have some arrangements made during the winter-time, at least, so that where there is not proper accommodation the Act should not be enforced.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to draw the attention of the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Industry and Commerce to a great grievance that prevails amongst my constituents touching on the question of <Col N="1846" /> Workmen's Compensation.  A sailor injured in England in a boat registered in England brought forward his case in the Free State Courts.  Having heard doctors, solicitors, and witnesses, the Court held that as he was injured in a foreign country the Irish Courts had no jurisdiction.  They advised him to take up the case in England.  He went to England, and after legal arguments the English Courts held that inasmuch as he was domiciled in the Free State, under the 1925 Act they had no jurisdiction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. EVERETT</NameTxt>
      <P>He was nobody's child in that particular case.  I think some arrangement might be made to meet such cases.  The English arbitrator will not grant any award to any injured sailor if he is domiciled in the Free State.</P>
      <P>We have heard a lot about the Shannon Scheme.  The Labour Party did approve of the Shannon Scheme, but there are certain matters in connection with it open to question.  We have heard a lot about the relief of unemployment. How can we expect to relieve unemployment if thousands of pounds worth of machinery and girders that could be manufactured in the Free State are being imported from Germany? While the workers in Irish foundries are idle Irish workers are being asked to erect iron girders that are manufactured in Germany.  The wages they receive for that work amount to 30/- a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is noticeable that the reduction which has taken place in the Estimates is mainly on such items as the improvement of estates and other work likely to give relief to the unemployed.  While I agree that the Government is making a case for the abolition of the Ministry of Fisheries by curtailing grants and refusing to give the Minister the money he requires in order to assist fishermen.  I notice that no arrangements are made for sailors.  The Minister for Finance is really the man against whom the fishermen have a grievance.  No matter what expenditure the Minister for Fisheries proposes, it is generally turned down in <Col N="1847" /> the Ministry of Finance, probably by some official who knows nothing about the needs of the fishing industry.  In regard to the Local Government Department, I desire to draw attention to the orders that are being sent out to public bodies in reference to vaccination. I remember, during the Sinn Fein days, that the Dáil made a decree in 1919 giving the Irish people the same right to conscientious objection as existed in England.  I do not know if any Act has been passed here empowering the Local Government Department to enforce vaccination in the Saorstát. I do not know if that decree of the old Dáil in 1919 has been rescinded here. The Government have no mandate, and the Local Government Department have no authority from the people to enforce compulsory vaccination.</P>

      <P>I want Deputy Everett to observe the difference between the cost of the Local Government Department, namely, £486,793, as against the amount for unemployment, namely, £233,526.  My point was that every office in Government Departments is overstaffed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>A great number of points have been raised, but I do not know that I will be able to touch on all of them.  There were certain points which were discussed by various Deputies which I could not undertake to meet at present.  Reference, for instance, was made to income tax and corporation profits tax.  If I had anything to say on these subjects I would not say it now.  The question of income tax and the question of corporation profits tax are matters that should be discussed when the Budget is before the Dáil.  Deputy Esmonde made a criticism of the form of the Estimates, and I may say that I am, to a considerable extent, in agreement with him.  The question as regards Appropriations-in-Aid has been considered by the Public Accounts Committee, and that Committee did not recommend the abolition of such appropriation.  They found that they were assisted in their investigation of the work and expenditure of the various Departments by the existence of these Appropriations-in-Aid, but I think that there are items which appear as Appropriations-in-Aid and which ought not to appear in that form.  We find, for instance, in the Vote for the Department of Justice there is an appropriation in connection with the Gárda Síochána of £53,000, and of that sum £39,000 represents the Police Rate.  I do not think that that should appear as an Appropriation-in-Aid, because its appearance in that form, deducted from the gross vote, tends to disguise the total cost of the police.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are several items which by statute must appear as Appropriations-in-Aid at present, but I think an opportunity ought to be taken to alter them, In the Secondary Education Vote there is a sum of £36,600 from local taxation duties.  That, I think, should not really appear there, although it must appear <Col N="1849" /> at present by statute because it reduces the net Estimate to an extent to which it should not be reduced.  There are similar sums in the Technical Instruction Vote and in the Vote of the Ministry of Lands and Agriculture.  In the last vote there is a sum of £58,750 coming from Excise and Customs duties and the Church Temporalities Fund. That reduces the net amount of the vote of that Department below the net cost.  There are other cases where considerable sums appear as Appropriations-in-Aid, but they appear quite properly. In the Army Vote there is, for instance, an Appropriation-in-Aid amounting to £60,000 for surplus and unserviceable clothing in store.</P>
    <P>That appears properly, because the net cost of clothing can only be ascertained when we deduct that sum from the cost of new stores.  I have felt for some time that this whole question of Appropriations-in-Aid should be examined. It is possible that the Public Accounts Committee, having had experience of the present system for a few years, may be able to pronounce a more definite opinion upon the matter than they were able to pronounce previously when it was before them.  I always thought that the demand for economy by the abolition of the Ministry of External Affairs was a particularly senseless demand.  You save very little by abolishing a Department if its work is not abandoned.</P>
    <P>Sometimes you may not save and efficiency is lost by abolishing a Department. The work of that Department needs to be done unless this country is content to sink to a status to which I do not believe it would be content to sink.  You do not save by pushing the work on another Ministry and by having another Parliamentary Secretary, except perhaps you save the difference between the salary of a Parliamentary Secretary and that of a Minister.  That, of course, when one is talking about over-taxation and the need for economy, does not carry us a very considerable distance.</P>
    <P>I also thought that there has been no Department more maligned and misrepresented than the Fisheries Department. The fisheries problem is an extremely difficult one, and can only get <Col N="1850" /> adequate consideration by having a separate Ministry.  If that Ministry were joined with the Ministry for Industry and Commerce or with the Ministry for Lands and Agriculture that problem would not get the attention it needs.  Our fisheries are in a bad way. It is necessary that something should be done and that the Minister should be invested with the responsibility for examining the problem and devising a policy.  I do not say that everything which the Minister for Fisheries has proposed in the way of expenditure has been agreed to.  The Department of Finance should not be blamed for the state of the fisheries.  The difficulties of the whole position, such as the lack of capital and the lack of skill and enterprise in the industry, are matters that cannot be settled merely by the granting of funds, either for propagandist or instructional purposes or even by loans from the Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin stated that the beet sugar subsidy has been increased without the leave of the Dáil.  It was not increased.  The amount of the subsidy was laid down in the Act, and that cannot be varied.  The only thing that happened was that, perhaps, the pessimistic view that was formed of the lack of readiness, with which the Irish farmer would take up the cultivation of the new crop has proved to be ill-founded. Instead of finding difficulty in getting 4,000 or 5,000 acres for the first year, it was found possible to get a great many more acres.  The first year was good for the growth of beet; there was a good crop and a high sugar content.  There will be no difficulty in getting an increased acreage in the second year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to clear up one particular point <Col N="1851" /> which seems to be in doubt as the result of a statement recently made in the country.  Are we to understand that there is no hope of an additional subsidy for another factory, even in two or three years' time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  If an offer were received from a reputable firm to put up another factory, and at a substantially reduced rate of subsidy, it would be considered, but no second factory would be sanctioned at the present rate of subsidy or anything approaching it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at present.  We would need to have experience of two sugar seasons to have absolutely firm grounds on which to work for the future.  If we had the experience of the work of two seasons and the knowledge of the profits made we would have firm ground for fixing the rate of subsidy for further factories.  We would certainly not be anxious to go ahead before that.  Unless we got some extraordinary good offer we would not consider going ahead before that. Deputy Davin said that there was provision in the Estimates only for preliminary work in connection with the Barrow drainage.</P>
      <P>It is not customary to anticipate legislation in the Estimates, so that when the legislation is passed further sums, if they are necessary to be voted will be voted.  It may not be necessary to vote them, because it may be possible to find money to carry on in the Local Loans Fund.  In any case, when the legislation has been passed, the necessary steps will be taken to provide the funds to give effect to that legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no provision for relief grants in this year's Estimates.  We have been reluctant heretofore to provide substantial funds for relief grants at this time of the year.  In the past the major portion of the money that was expended on relief grants was provided by way of a Supplementary <Col N="1852" /> Estimate in the autumn, so that the expenditure might take place in the winter, that period of the year when employment is most difficult to get and when the hardships of life are greatest. It is for that reason that no funds are provided now.  I think it is just as well to evade the provision of small funds before an election, because it would certainly awaken all the feelings of cupidity that are existent.  While we may, after the election, provide £30,000 or £40,000, I felt very strongly that it was most undesirable to do it now and that the small sums that may have been provided would not have given any substantial relief to such distress as exists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">

      <P>Does that mean that the proposals put up by the local authorities to the Minister for Finance, through the Department of Local Government, must remain over until the general election has taken place and that the people who should be provided with employment must wait until some Government is returned at the next general election?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can get the information he wants by way of question, at any time, or he can raise the matter on the adjournment.  Deputy Baxter spoke about the general need for reducing expenditure and Deputy Heffernan spoke much on the same lines, but with somewhat different emphasis.  The adverse trade balance is to some extent alarming, but it would be easy to be too alarmed about it.  All that it means is that certain national reserves are being eaten into.  But an adverse trade balance <Col N="1853" /> will not, in itself, bring about any break up here.  An adverse trade balance, many people have pointed out, is a thing that will ultimately be rectified without any particular action being taken.  Of course, it will only be rectified when the national reserves have been depleted to an extent that may prejudice future development. The actual adverse balance of trade is undoubtedly much less than the apparent or visible balance of trade. I have never been able to get sufficient figures to come to an absolutely firm figure in regard to what the actual adverse balance of trade is, but undoubtedly there are big sums coming into this country from investments abroad, as well as from such things as pensions to British ex-Service men and what is called the American letter. Against that we have certain sums going out by way of dividends, although they are not so much, and we have sums like land annuities.  I do not think so much at all goes out by way of pensions, because a great number of the pensioners live here, and it is difficult to say what the actual adverse balance of trade is, but certainly the invisible figures are in our favour. There is a great deal more money coming in than going out; that is the dividends on investments, the pensions and the other money remittances are greater than the remittances going out.  But there does, of course, remain an adverse balance of trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>At a certain time we will be able, in our income tax papers, to give further details that have been available heretofore.  I do not think, at the present time, anything like complete figures can be given.  There is no use regarding this whole matter in the abstract; there is no actual benefit in comparing the figures of a number of years ago with the present figures and expecting that any lessons can be drawn from the two sets of figures, without explanations and without regard to the conditions; there is not much use in saying there is an adverse <Col N="1854" /> balance of trade, and that taxation must be reduced.  Often we hear things joined together which do not always logically follow upon one another.  It does not follow that every reduction in expenditure is necessarily beneficial.  There may be reductions in expenditure that would be harmful.  I think everybody will admit that there is State expenditure which is beneficial and there is State expenditure which directly or indirectly is productive.</P>
      <P>I have already said in the Dáil that there would be nothing easier than to reduce expenditure if we were prepared to reduce expenditure regardless of consequences, but I do not stand, and I do not think many responsible people will stand, for a policy of reducing expenditure regardless of consequences. Some of Deputy Heffernan's remarks seem to be &ldquo;We must reduce expenditure regardless of consequences or other people will reduce expenditure regardless of consequences.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the wrong thing is going to be done I presume it is going to be done, but we should try to do the right thing; we should not stand for a policy of reducing expenditure regardless of consequences.  The Government that is in existence has tried to reduce expenditure and has tried in this matter to take always a middle course, to consider all interests, to consider the immediate needs of the nation and the future prospects of the nation.  There are cases in which by disregarding future prospects, by simply putting off the evil day, you can reduce expenditure. We have not tried to do that.  We have tried to deal with the whole thing in a reasonable, business-like and moderate way.  In my last Budget speech I showed a certain division of expenditure; I took six or seven items and showed that they absorb by far the greater portion of the money allocated for State services, and they were things which I asserted, and I do not think I was seriously challenged, in which expenditure could not be reduced.  I do not believe that any benefit will come to the State by reducing expenditure on education.  We may try to get better value, we may try to carry out reforms and reorganisations and adopt new systems and new plans, but I do <Col N="1855" /> not think there is going to be any benefit to the State or to the taxpayers by a reduction of expenditure on education. I have stated already that you cannot get any benefit by reducing salaries further than they have been reduced.  The result would be that the difficulty of getting suitable men for the teaching profession would be increased. I do not think anything can be gained in that direction.  I do not think you are going to gain anything by reducing expenditure on the Department of Lands and Agriculture.  On the contrary, I think, with the consent of the Dáil, the accounts provided for the Department of Lands and Agriculture have increased and the services of the Department have been extended, and I do not see that there is going to be any change in that policy.  I do think that the money that is expended on the various services of the Department of Lands and Agriculture is money well expended and money that will give a return, and to cut down that expenditure, and to cut down the various activities of that Department, would not improve the condition of the people of the country; it would disimprove it. You can go to various other services to which the same thing applies.  The money we expend&mdash;and this is a factor which is not without significance, and which I think should be borne in mind &mdash;on the various Government services is very largely derived from the taxation of luxuries; that is very largely taxation which people need not pay, if they do not want to pay.  In so far as it is not that, it is taxation on income which must be earned, broadly speaking, before there is any tax on it. Blessed are they who pay income tax, because they have the income to pay it. But leaving out income tax, and the estate duties, which provide, perhaps, a little over a quarter of the total tax revenue, the remainder is raised on the liquor tax, the amusement tax, the tax on motor cars, and the tax on motor cars is very largely a luxury expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a certain <Col N="1856" /> amount from boots, but it is a comparatively small proportion of the tax revenue.  The major portion of the tax revenue is something in the nature of a tax on luxuries.  I need not repeat the things I said before about the Geddes Committee.  I do not deny that you may have circumstances in which such a Committee would do service of value. I do assert, however, that those circumstances do not exist now.  The circumstances which existed when the Geddes Committee operated in Great Britain do not exist here, nor any circumstances like them.  I think such a Committee could only be effective, as the Geddes Committee was effective, in reviving and enforcing the demands of the Treasury or the Finance Department, but so far as any radical exploration goes it cannot do it effectively, and no Committee that can be got up will do it; that is, dealing with department expenditure and dealing with policy.  Policy is not a matter for such a Committee; policy is a matter in which the Dáil can take its own decisions, decisions on which it can obtain information, and it would be a mere shirking of responsibility for the Government or the Dáil to set up a Committee to deal with matters of policy. Deputy Cooper talked about the savings effected in the Army Vote.  It has seldom happened that things have been raised by Deputies on votes which have not already received some attention from the Department concerned, or from the Department of Finance. Occasionally it may be that discussions in the Dáil will lead to a saving, but on balance the effect of discussions on Estimates is to lead to increased expenditure. The weight of argument and of discussion is in favour of further expenditure, and on the balance saving is not, and cannot be, the result of discussions in the Dáil.  I do not think it ever happens that the contributions of individual Deputies make towards economy.  I do not say that Deputy Cooper need take that to himself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the discussions on Estimates as a whole, there <Col N="1857" /> are more demands for expenditure and more insistence for increased expenditure than for economy as a result of them, and that is, perhaps, a natural thing.  There is a responsibility in departments, and in the Department of Finance in particular, to urge economy and to try to eliminate items of expenditure which are unnecessary or largely excessive.  By no device can you get economies effected unless the departments concerned, and more particularly the Department of Finance, do their duty.  You cannot get them by means of a discussion in the House, or by any sort of an ad hoc outside Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cooper referred to certain increases in the staffs of departments. There was one factor which, perhaps, he did not entirely take into account, namely, that in the early days many of the departments bore on their votes the salaries of staffs that were on loan to other departments.  Recently that has almost disappeared, and officers have now been transferred and allotted to their new departments, and their salaries appear on the vote of their new department.  So that some apparent increases and some apparent decreases are really a regularising of the position that arose when the Government was newly set up.  Of course, there are departments in which there are actual increases of staff.  The Board of Works is one.  Acts like the Drainage Act involved an increase of staff there.  The increase resulted from a decision of policy of the passing of legislation by the Dáil.  The Revenue Commissioners' staff has been increased because the new Customs duty demanded it.  Last night Deputy Nolan suggested that £600,000 out of the £690,000 which the Revenue Commissioners cost might be attributed to the cost of collecting income tax.  That, of course, was a statement very far from the facts.  Probably the cost of collecting income tax would be about £170,000 or £180,000, and by far the greater portion of the remainder is the cost in connection with the Customs and Excise duties. Certainly the cost in connection with Customs and Excise duties is substantially <Col N="1858" /> over three times the cost of collecting the income tax.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not give the exact figure, but if the Deputy looks at the Estimates he can make a fairly close calculation for himself.  If he looks at the Estimates he will see that where the office of the Chief Inspector of Customs and Excise costs about £225,000, the corresponding office on the income tax side costs about £70,000 or £75,000.  There have been increases in the personnel of the Land Commission.  The new Land Act necessitated that, and the urge of Deputies is all for greater expedition.  If there is any attempt made to meet that it will mean, of course, increased staff.</P>
      <P>Various Deputies said that the Government was set up on too expensive a scale.  A certain scale was inherited and a certain form of organisation. It may be that if we had started from scratch we could have done better.  I believe that we could, but we have tried to adapt the machine to the new requirements.  We have gone a very considerable way in that direction, and that is a process which continues.  We have effected many readjustments which have led to greater economy and efficiency, and they are going on.  Deputy Connor Hogan said that huge capital schemes should not be entered on except on special conditions. Without saying that huge capital schemes should be entered upon, I take the opposite view to him. I think that we should never hesitate in our position to enter on sound capital schemes, no matter how big they may be.  We have a comparatively small National Debt.  We have a country that is in great need of development, we have a tide of emigration and a certain amount of unemployment, and if we could get good capital schemes the thing to do is to go on with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You see sometimes in speeches in the newspapers a lumping together of current expenditure and capital expenditure. With the total arrived at the Government is held up to opprobrium because expenditure is so high.  In some cases, I think, we might be more <Col N="1859" /> justly held up to opprobrium, because the total was not high enough, and because there was not enough capital expenditure added on to the current expenditure. It is really the current expenditure that matters, and that is borne on taxation.  Capital expenditure, provided always that it is sound, is not a burden or a disadvantage at all.  We have tried to provide employment by various types of capital expenditure, and if there is a diminution in the figures providing for certain types of capital expenditure that is not due to any alteration in policy but rather because it is difficult to estimate exactly for a vote such as, say, the Local Loans Fund.  It is difficult to estimate exactly in the case of that Fund, because the estimate will depend on so many factors: the number of applications submitted which can be got through; the number outstanding and nearly completed before the beginning of the financial year, and the repayment of loans already outstanding. The Local Loans will be given out on the same conditions as last year.  In view of the conditions that obtained it was not found necessary to provide so much for the coming year as last year in order to continue in the same way. The same consideration applies to housing.  We have not altered our policy in regard to housing or in regard to local loans.  I do believe that the Local Loans Fund, as soon as a new National Loan has been issued, and when money is available, should be made open for additional purposes, but I do not think it would be wise at the present stage to open it for the very considerable demands that, for instance, would arise if we were to open it to housing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>And for repayments over an extended period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the principal arguments in favour of opening it for such a purpose; to give a longer period for repayment.  Some Deputies talked about the delay in putting the Arterial Drainage Act into force.  I do not think anyone can say that there has been delay up to this.  If there are not a sufficient number of <Col N="1860" /> schemes in the course of construction this summer, then it will be time enough to talk about delay, but there was no possibility of having schemes in operation before next May.  That was to be the starting point, and it would have been impossible to have any schemes before then.  This Act, so far, has demonstrated one thing, and that is that a great lot of the schemes which it was desired to have carried out are bad schemes and should not be carried out.  Of the one hundred schemes submitted by the county councils and examined by engineers and valuers, sometimes by an engineer alone, only a small proportion of them seem to be good ones.  If, ultimately, 700 or 800 schemes are submitted and examined, I do not suppose that more than 100 of them will be found to be really good schemes that ought to be carried through.  Of the 100 schemes that have actually been examined, there is only one of them, I think, that could be carried out without a grant, while the number that could be carried out with a 33 per cent. grant is small. If the Dáil were willing to agree to a policy of paying 80 per cent. or 90 per cent. of the cost, of course you could get plenty of schemes.  In regard to arterial drainage the real fact is, as I think I stated before, that already the best drainage schemes, broadly speaking, have been done.  Those that remain to be done are the middling and bad schemes.  Some are so bad that they should never be done.</P>

      <P>No, it is based on the information at present available.  I admit that there is a certain amount of force in the remarks made by Deputy Nolan with regard to the substitution of some sort of a luxury tax for income tax.  However, I do not believe it is practicable, and at any rate this is not the time to discuss it.  I admired the skill with which Deputy Norton kept if not quite within order, certainly out of order most of the time, and I do not propose to reply to his particular point.</P>
