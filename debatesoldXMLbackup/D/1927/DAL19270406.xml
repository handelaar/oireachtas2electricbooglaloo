      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture if he will state why the Irish Land Commission have not replied to a registered letter, dated 12th February, 1927, from the tenants on the John A. Lewis estate, Woodford, County Galway (Folio No. S. 1990), requesting the Irish Land Commission to carry out the agreement arrived at on the 21st day of June, 1926, between their Inspector and the Chairman of the Tenants' Association regarding the final settlement of this estate.</P>

      <P>I move for leave to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Constitution by repealing Article 17 thereof.  I will explain the measure fully on the Second Reading.  I am sure Deputies will all agree to this Bill.</P>

      <P>The First Stage of this Bill will be opposed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The First Stage is being opposed.  Standing Order No. 82, which is the Standing Order referring to the First Stage of a Bill, provides that the Deputy giving notice shall move for leave to introduce the Bill, and that if such motion be opposed, the Ceann Comhairle, after permitting an explanatory statement from the Deputy who moves, and an explanatory statement from the Deputy who opposes, may, if he thinks fit, put the question thereon.  The Standing Order seeks to achieve that on the First Stage of a Bill no discussion shall be allowed except by way of explanatory statement. The number of such explanatory statements is left to the discretion of the Chair.  Usually, in the case of a Government measure, only a statement by the Minister moving for leave to introduce the Bill and a statement by a Deputy opposing would be permitted. In the case of a Bill introduced by a private Deputy, and opposed by the Government, it has been indicated already from the Chair that a somewhat different treatment would be given and that somewhat more latitude would be allowed to the promoters.  In the case of this Bill the promoters are Deputies Breen, Everett and Hall.  In <Col N="991" /> agreement, therefore, with the view already expressed, I am prepared to allow explanatory statements from two of the Deputies promoting the Bill, from Deputy Breen and one of the others, and a statement in opposition to the motion for leave to introduce.  I will then put the question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielBreen" hpid="Mr. BREEN Mr. BREEN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BREEN</NameTxt>
      <P>My principal reason for introducing this Bill here is that I am convinced that there will be no prosperity, there will be no political unity in the national affairs of this country until such time as the test which debars one-third of our representatives from attending here is removed. That is my principal reason for introducing this Bill.  When I took my seat in this House, I explained to my constituents that I would do everything in my power to get Article 17 removed. I am now putting this Bill before the Dáil and I ask the Deputies for the sake of the country to give it full consideration, and I am sure when they do give it full consideration that they will realise the necessity for having the Oath removed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make it plain, before I make any statement, that I am acting in an individual capacity in the matter of my promotion of this Bill and that it has no connection with the Party to which I belong.  I believe that it is only right and proper that the Bill should get a First Reading in the Dáil, so as to give the Deputies an opportunity of considering the Bill when circulated and so that a broad and more intelligible view than that which could be expressed now, would be expressed in the next stage of the Bill.  I believe that a Bill of this kind is essential either now or in the near future.  I support it on its First Reading and I ask the President to allow it to get a First Reading in order that it may get proper consideration on the next stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose the First Reading of this Bill in the name of the Government.  I oppose it because <Col N="992" /> it seeks to remove a fundamental provision of our Bun-Reacht, a provision which arises from and has its roots in the Treaty.  It proposes to take out of the Constitution the Oath prescribed in the Treaty.  That Treaty bears the signature of five Plenipotentiaries appointed by Dáil Eireann, and it was approved by Dáil Eireann.  On the first occasion that the people had an opportunity of registering their opinion they returned a majority of representatives in favour of the Treaty.  The proposed Constitution was published on the morning of the General Election in June, 1922.  The Constitution was then considered, amended and passed by Dáil Eireann and during the passage of the Constitution Bill this very issue which the present Bill raises was made a matter of confidence by the Government.  Within fourteen months another General Election took place on a new and extended franchise, and the result was an overwhelming majority for the Treaty and Constitution. We have had since then, twenty-one by-elections and the result of these may be summarised as 17 for the Treaty and Constitution and four against.  In only one case was there an election for a seat vacated by an anti-Treaty T.D. and the anti-Treaty Party lost that seat to the candidate in favour of the Treaty.  So much for popular opinion on the matter.  I do not intend to discuss the political side of the question, or to enter into any explanation, defence, or criticism of the Constitution that was passed nearly five years ago in the Dáil.  The Government opposes this Bill.  We oppose its First Reading because we believe in honouring our bond, we believe in the sanctity of international agreements.  We oppose its First Reading because our honour as the representatives of a nation which has approved of that Treaty is bound to the carrying out of our part of the transaction.</P>

    <P>FIRST SCHEDULE.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAlexanderNagle" hpid="Mr. NAGLE Mr. NAGLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NAGLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to move amendment 110:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before paragraph 1 to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Every person who was employed by an authorised undertaker or a statutory undertaker for a period of not less than two years before the first day of March, 1927, and was so employed at the date of an order made under this Act requiring such undertaker to cease wholly or in part to use a generating station as a generating station, but who at that date had been so employed for less than five years, and who by reason of such generating station ceasing <Col N="995" /> wholly or in part in pursuance of such order to be used as a generating station has suffered loss of employment, shall be entitled to a gratuity calculated on the basis of one-sixth of his annual remuneration and emoluments for every completed year of his employment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Schedule as it stands makes provision for compensation to employees with five or more years' service. The amendment aims at giving compensation in the shape of a lump sum or gratuity to employees with two years' service or under five years' service.  It merely follows the example of the Railways Act.  The numbers affected may not be very large and I think the Minister could very easily accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to go so far as to accept the principle of a gratuity, but I am not accepting, for the time being, the amount stated here.  I am accepting the principle of a gratuity for people with less than live years' service.  There are two points I would like to hold over for further consideration.  The Deputy has brought in the phrase &ldquo;ceasing wholly or in part.&rdquo;  A point was raised yesterday in regard to a similar matter and the consideration that shall be given to that point will operate on this one also.  I would like to have a further opportunity of considering the amount of the gratuity. I will undertake to introduce an amendment on the Report Stage regarding these gratuities and the Deputy will then be entitled to amend the sum if he does not think it sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. BYRNE Mr. A. BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister also consider the advisability of recommending to the Board that where employees lose their employment as a result of control, they shall be supplied with other employment, if other employment is going, and that younger men shall not get priority over old hands?  Small gratuities are all very well in a way; they get people out of temporary difficulties, but it is rather hard on a man to lose his employment and get small compensation and then see somebody else later on <Col N="996" /> getting the post he formerly occupied. I would like the Minister to consider favourably the employment of the old hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The point does not and cannot arise.  If the Board under control shuts down a generating station, then the First Schedule will apply.  If it does not shut down the station, then the First Schedule has nothing to do with the matter, and the employees are no worse than under the original undertaker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. BYRNE Mr. A. BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>But there might be vacancies in other departments under the Board for which these employees would be quite eligible and naturally they would think they had some claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Board would not dispossess them.  If a generating station is closed down, either by order of the Board or by the Board actually in control, then this Schedule applies and the Deputy's point does not arise.  In the matter of appointments, priority will be given obviously to the efficient man.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesSprouleMyles" hpid="Major MYLES Major MYLES">
      <NameTxt>Major MYLES</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 111&mdash;</P>
      <P>In paragraph I to delete all words from the word &ldquo;Every,&rdquo; line 15 down to and including the figures &ldquo;1927,&rdquo; line 17, and substitute therefor the words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every person who on the 1st day of March, 1927, was for a period of not less than five years employed by an authorised undertaker or by a statutory undertaker or by any other person engaged on an undertaking for the generation of electricity other than for his own business.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The difference between the amendment and the original position is that the amendment would include those men who are employed by non-statutory and unauthorised undertakings. I hope the Minister will not make a differentiation as between the employees in the section and in these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This point <Col N="997" /> would fall for consideration on the general discussion I promised with regard to the position of unauthorised undertakings.  If the unauthorised undertaker is going to have a certain basis of compensation given him&mdash;and I promised to consider amendments along that line&mdash;I think the question of the employee of an unauthorised undertaker who is put out of employment by the closing down of a generating station, run by the unauthorised undertaker, will also have to be given consideration.  All these amendments which seek to insert the words &ldquo;or other&rdquo; would naturally come up for consideration on the question of the unauthorised undertakers' position generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister considered the possibility that the unauthorised undertaker, even though compensated, might not compensate his employees except steps were taken to ensure that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  May I put the position this way?&mdash;I am pretty well accepting the principle that where a generating station is closed down, it really does not matter whether it is under the control of a municipal authority, an authorised company or an unauthorised company.  There will have to be a relation between the terms of the compensation fixed.  One might, in fixing the terms of compensation of the unauthorised undertaker, put in an allowance for payment to employees, because they will have to be considered&mdash;each individual.  If an amount for compensation were put in there, it would have to be ensured that that amount would, in fact, go to the employees dismissed.  But we might deal with it as being an addition to this First Schedule.  That might be the handiest way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesSprouleMyles" hpid="Major MYLES Major MYLES">
      <NameTxt>Major MYLES</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is right that an employee should be penalised because of the fact that his employer did not possess certain powers.  He might be quite as good a man as the employee of the authorised undertaker and I think the Minister should have no doubt about accepting the amendment.  If he makes a distinction, he is going to penalise a workman <Col N="998" /> because his employer did not do certain things thirty years ago, though that man may be in exactly the same grade as the employee of an authorised undertaking in the neighbouring town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The question as to whether he is or is not the same type of man may be material but there is a much more material consideration.  In the case of the authorised undertaker the employee, at least, saw before him a better chance of continuous employment, because the authorised undertaker had reserved to him an area within which he was given a monopoly. That was not so in the case of the unauthorised undertaker.  Secondly, the employee of a generating station run by an unauthorised undertaker had to look forward to the fear, at least, of some other unauthorised undertaker setting up in that particular area and knocking him out of his employment. All these considerations will have to be taken into account on the argument regarding these unauthorised undertakers.</P>

      <P>In paragraph 1, line 16, after the word &ldquo;period&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;(including employment with any such undertaker).&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to ensure that service with any undertaking will be reckoned&mdash;that in the event of a man having been employed in an electrical undertaking and leaving that for an undertaking which is now about to be abolished, then his period of service <Col N="999" /> with the previous undertaking will be reckoned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

      <P>&ldquo;For the purpose of computing the period of employment of a person who is entitled to compensation ... the employment of such person with any authorised undertaker or any statutory undertaker shall be deemed to be employment with the authorised undertaker or the statutory undertaker by whom such compensation is so payable.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move amendment 117&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In paragraph 3, after the word &ldquo;schedule,&rdquo; line 58, to insert the following words &ldquo;with an addition <Col N="1000" /> thereto based on the number of completed years of his service and calculated according to the following scale:&mdash;</P>
    <P>If he has twenty or more completed years of service, an addition of ten-sixtieths of his remuneration and emoluments; if he has fifteen or more completed years of service and less than twenty such years, an addition of seven-sixtieths of his remuneration and emoluments; if he has ten or more completed years of service and less than fifteen such years, an addition of five-sixtieths of his remuneration and emoluments; if he has five or more completed years of service and less than ten such years, an addition of three-sixtieths of his annual remuneration and emoluments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The compensation provided by paragraph 3 to the schedule to the Bill is limited to an amount equal to one-sixtieth of the annual remuneration and emoluments.  This is a serious interference with the rights of a Local Government officer under Section 44, sub-section (2) of the Local Government Act, 1925, which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>A local body shall, with the consent of the Minister, grant to a pensionable officer in their employment who has at least ten years service and (a) who is removed from his office for a cause other than misconduct or incapacity or (b) whose office is abolished, or (c) whose position has in the opinion of the Minister been materially altered to his detriment, owing to changes in the conditions of his employment made without reasonable cause and who resigns his office with the consent of the Minister, an annual allowance for his life not greater than two-thirds of his yearly salary and emoluments.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government and Public Health in a circular of the 4th April, 1925, to each local authority stated the general policy in regard to superannuation and compensation and promised in addition to the normal amount of one-sixtieth of the annual remuneration and pensionable emoluments in certain cases, i.e., in cases <Col N="1001" /> where officers' employment may be terminated through no fault of theirs, the rate of pension may be increased by one-half.  The Railways (Officers and Servants) Act, 1926, provided a special compensation for officers and servants similarly affected by the amalgamation of the railways.  It fixed, in addition to the amount calculated at the rate of one-sixtieth of the annual remuneration and emoluments for each completed year of service, an amount calculated in accordance with the same scale as set out in the amendment.</P>
    <P>The present Bill proposes a monopoly of the production and supply of electricity, and an engineer who suffers loss of employment through the closing by the Board of the generating station in which he is employed will find it extremely difficult to obtain any other suitable appointment within the Free State.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Provided also that if at the date of his entry into the service of the authorised undertaker or statutory or other undertaker any such person had special qualifications or experience specially qualifying him for employment by the authorised or statutory undertaker or other undertaker <Col N="1002" /> his actual period of service with the undertaker or undertakers shall be increased by such number of years not exceeding twenty as may seem just having regard to the particular circumstances of the case, and thereupon his compensation shall be calculated on such increased period of service.&rdquo;&mdash;(Deputies Hewat and Myles.)</P>

      <P>I wish to support the amendment moved by Deputy Doyle.  In this amendment the generally accepted principle of added years is involved.  This principle has been accepted in legislation passed by this House, where men have been deprived of their livelihood under abnormal circumstances after a certain number of years' service.  In these cases they were given the privilege of having a certain number of years added for the purpose of increasing their pension.  I think the amendment deserves support.</P>

      <P>I can do that.  I would also have to consider the whole effect of this special proviso and the <Col N="1003" /> addition that it will make to the burden that will have to be borne by the electricity consumer.  With regard to the added years, Deputy Doyle has referred to certain rights guaranteed to local employees.  I am prepared to agree to an amendment to this schedule that if any person to whom the schedule applies enjoyed on 1st March, 1927, better terms and better conditions than those set out in the schedule he will get these better terms or better conditions. That will meet the point in regard to municipal employees, but I would like to have a little more consideration on the added years question, on that one simple point.  Added years have been given to railwaymen, but that was on the basis that there were certain points surrounding the employment of railwaymen which were supposed to indicate something in the nature of permanency, and it was because that permanency was broken in on that years were added.  There were various arguments used here to that effect, and reference was made to the fact that the Unemployment Insurance Act did not apply after three years and so on.  Similar conditions would have to be shown to obtain as regards the employees in a generating plant belonging to any undertaker before the analogy would be completely made.  I am not sure that the analogy does completely apply.</P>
      <P>I do not think that this is going to add any very big burden to the consumers. That may be a point that would not be worth talking about, but I would like to have an opportunity of considering what is the likelihood of the burden being very heavy which would hereafter be thrown on the electricity consumers.  If it seems material I should require some further argument as to the reason for adding these years at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The analogy of the railwaymen has been put up, but I do not think that analogy is a sound one.  There has never been the same attitude with regard to the permanency of employees in a generating plant as there was, or was alleged to be, in regard to railwaymen. I do not think the analogy is complete.  In regard to this amendment <Col N="1004" /> and the next one, I am prepared definitely to have consideration given to this matter of special qualifications to see if some better definition can be got so that we would know what burden we were assuming.  Secondly, if we discover that, we can agree that if people to whom the schedule applies had on 1st March, 1927, better terms than those terms in the schedule, these better terms will be secured to them. Then, thirdly, I will hold over for consideration the whole point of the added years, but not basing my consideration on the incomplete analogy of the railwaymen. It will depend, to a great extent, on the likely burden to be thrown on consumers in future.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister whether it is intended to take from any employee any consideration he might get in the way of added years under existing Acts?  If, say, the Dublin Corporation has power to add years of service to the service of a faithful employee, a man who gave the best years of his life to that service, and that it is cut short through some action of the Dáil, that would be very unfair.  Surely it is not proposed to take from that man the right he would have under the public authority to have a number of years added to his service in order to make his gratuity or pension reasonable. I understood all along the line that no man would lose any rights he had when the question of compensation was about to be considered.  I consider that these men should get the advantage of added years in order to compensate them for having given the best years of their life to the electrical undertakings.</P>

I do not see why it should not cover it.  I want specially to emphasise the right which had accrued to him on the 1st March, 1927.  I do not want to have any tidying up of the situation so as to embarrass matters between the 1st March, 1927, and the setting up of the Board.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister explain what is the position of a landlord who sells his estate to the Land Commission on part of which there is timber?  He has, I take it, the right to sell the timber.  Under this section as amended, will the position be altered, or is there any intention on the part of the Minister to alter the section?  Is there any intention on the part of the Land Commission to take any action to prevent the further cutting of timber on the wholesale scale which has taken place over a number of years and which is taking place at present?  I understand they are not doing it on estates where there is timber standing.  The landlord is clearing out and he cuts and sells the timber, and that has a serious result from the point of view of the appearance of the landscape.  If that is allowed to continue the section will be of little value.  If the State is to act at all, there is more to be saved in that way than will be saved by attempting to deal with the tenant farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission have no control over land not vested in them and it was never suggested that they should.  The Land Commission exists for the acquisition and division of lands and there their functions begin and end.  They have not, and should not have, control over land, except so far as it is necessary to control it for the purposes of acquisition and division.  If a question of security arises there would be a reason for controlling the land vested in them.  The Deputy says that the serious question is not so much the cutting down of trees by the tenants and tenant purchasers but by the landowners. It is a question of land held in fee simple, free of rent, and without any tenants on the land.  The Land Commission have, and should have, no control over that land until it is vested. If they were to have control there would be no such thing as landed property <Col N="1008" /> in the country.  The Dáil might conceivably desire to take up the rest of the land in the country for certain purposes but, if they did, they would have to enshrine that idea in an Act of Parliament.</P>
      <P>They would give the Land Commission, or whatever body was dealing with it, rights over the land required.  It is an elementary principle of law that until an Act of Parliamnet is passed, and until the land is vested, the existing rights remain.  The Land Commission could not possibly control the owner of untenanted land in fee simple and prevent him from cutting trees and from doing what he likes with it.  The Deputy asks whether there is any intention to deal with it.  There is a problem there, but that is for a Forestry Bill and not for a Land Bill. A Forestry Bill could not be introduced this Session.  With regard to the point that the real problem is in connection with land that has not been, and will not be, vested in the Land Commission. I do not think the Deputy is accurate. 75 to 80 per cent. of the land is held subject to Land Commission annuities, subject to advances.  On 25 per cent. of the land that is left there is a large proportion of the timber of the country, but that, as I say, is a problem for a Forestry Bill and not for a Bill of this sort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It often happens that that portion of an estate which the Land Commission does not purchase is the portion most densely timbered, for this reason.  Take a case of a house with a demesne of, say, 1,000 acres. The landlord says that 500 acres are good enough for him, and he will sell the remainder.  The Land Commission will take that portion of the land if it is suitable for sub-division and will suggest to the landlord to keep the land on which the timber is, the land near the house, and a certain amount of grazing land, leaving the Land Commission the land which is suitable for division.  Another course would be to leave the grazing land and take the timber land.  The other course would be to take it all.  If they were to acquire land under this Land Bill it would be necessary to prove that it was required for the relief of congestion.  If they were able to prove that, the next step would be to cut the timber and divide the land.  If you once admit the idea that the landowner is to be allowed any land, it is impossible to attempt to acquire from him his timbered land. What the Deputy would require would be a section saying that the land shall be compulsorily acquired, not for the relief of congestion but because there is timber on it which the State wants to safeguard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Where either before or after the passing of this Act a holding or part of a holding, or part of demesne or other land the subject of an advance made to the owner for the purchase <Col N="1010" /> thereof, and another holding or part of a holding have been, or shall be, deemed to be one holding (in this section called the consolidated holding) the following provisions shall apply:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  if an advance has been or shall be made for the purchase of any part of the consolidated holding after the passing of the Land Act, 1923, the consolidated holding shall be subject to the provisions of Section 65 of that Act prohibiting sub-division and letting as if an advance had been made for its purchase after the passing of the said Act of 1923;</P>
    <P>(b)  if a part of the consolidated holding is part of demesne or other land subject to an advance made to the owner for the purchase thereof the consolidated holding shall be subject to the provisions of the Land Purchase Acts prohibiting sub-division and letting to which the other part or parts of the holding were subject prior to its consolidation, or became subject to on its consolidation pursuant to the foregoing provision of this section, as the case may be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This looks a formidable amendment, but it is really technical, and the idea is simple.  Assume that you have a small holding subject to an annuity adjoining a demesne, assume there is an annuity on that portion by reason of the fact that the demesne has been re-sold to the landlord under a previous Act, assume that the Land Commission under the 1923 Act acquired some part of the demesne which is subject to an annuity, and divide that portion and give four or five acres to the holding adjoining which has been previously purchased under another Act, you have the position that there are two holdings with two annuities consolidated, but by a peculiar combination of circumstances under the existing law the Land Commission have no power to prevent a sub-division of that portion of the holding which was formerly demesne land, and you had the anomaly that though a man had a piece of land, he could divide it regardless of the Land Commission. That is an anomaly, and the Registrar <Col N="1011" /> of Title has simply put the point of view that all prohibition which applies to a holding subject to Land Commission annuities should equally apply to a holding even in the case where that holding has been formerly subject to an annuity.  The next section deals with the annuity, and gives power to consolidate the two annuities.</P>

    <P>This is to meet the point raised by Deputy Good in Committee.  In order <Col N="1012" /> to make it clear it will have to be realised that this section applies to building grounds near a city or a town.  A considerable proportion of building ground is near Dublin, Cork, Waterford and other big towns.  We are providing that in the ordinary way building ground shall be purchased after six years unless building operations commence within that period.  Deputy Good raised the point that that was hardly fair, especially in a case where the owner of the building ground had expended moneys, and perhaps big sums, for developing sites for building purposes, and that in a case of that sort it is not very easy for owners living near, say, the City of Dublin with considerable commitments on hands to bring the site up to the particular stage where building could commence.  To meet that case the Deputy suggested that something should be done so as to give the owner a longer period than five years in order to comply with the provisions of the section.  The developing of a site, clearing, levelling, fencing, etc., may run into thousands of pounds, and that sort of work takes considerable time.  If you once admit that, then I do not think there is any case for refusing this amendment.  It does not apply to land which is potential building ground&mdash;land which could be used as building ground.  It only applies to land near cities in respect of which considerable sums have been expended in developing the ground for the purpose of building.  Deputies may argue that there is no such land.  If there is not, no harm is done, and the original provision stands.  The land must be acquired inside six years unless building operations have actually started.  If there is such land the section applies, and it is right that the owner should get a longer period than six years before he is compelled to hand over the fee simple at a small price to the occupier.  I do not know whether this will meet Deputy Good's point, but it is the only method I could devise to meet it.</P>

      <P>The proposed amendment would improve the section, but, as I pointed out on the last day, when you get into the question of building <Col N="1013" /> twenty years is a comparatively short period.  I have two estates in mind. On one of them a large sum of money was expended twenty-seven years ago, and there is more than 25 per cent. of that land to-day not built on.</P>
      <P>That was an estate where the building land was exceedingly popular and where it was taken up rapidly.  I have another estate in mind that was not equally fortunate.  In that case, not half of it has been built on.  With all respect to the Minister, I think the policy of the State at the present time should be to give every encouragement to people building because of the shortage of houses.  If this section is passed in its amended form it will, I believe, prevent the development of the larger estates.  The Minister may say that it will not, but he has not had the long experience of some of us in these matters. I should like, for instance, to hear the views of the President on this, because he could speak from a longer experience than that of the Minister. After all, 20 years is a comparatively short period in building matters.  I believe the effect of this amendment would be to limit development on the larger estates.  It would be impossible to expect that development on them could be completed within a period of 20 years.  In the case of the smaller estates, one naturally expects that the building would occupy the site within 20 years.  This amendment, to my mind, will be a deterrent on building, and that ought not to be the policy of the State.  I suggest that the Minister should take a larger view of this question. Let him put his limit to 20 years: that is, that the land cannot be acquired provided it can be shown that money is being expended on it for the purposes of building.  I think, in a case like that, provision should be made that the land could not be taken from a man within a period of 20 years.</P>

If, for any reason, such as a monetary crisis or other matters that affect building operations, the building development is kept back, then I think it might be <Col N="1014" /> left in the power of the Judicial Commissioner to extend the 20 years' period for any further term that he might think desirable.  After all, that is not a very material change to ask for.  The Minister, of course, will say: &ldquo;I have given you 20 years to develop this site, and if it is not done within that period, then we will take the land from you.&rdquo;</P>

It will then be for the owner of the building site to satisfy the Judicial Commissioner that he has made every effort to develop the site and get buildings erected on it, but that for reasons beyond his control he has been unable to do that.  In order to encourage building in the State I think the Minister should give further consideration to that aspect of the question.</P>

      <P>The estates to which the Deputy made reference were really estates part of which will come under the Land Act now but which had been excluded.  They are estates that might be miles away from a city.  When the Deputy raised this point on the Committee Stage, I recognised that there were two problems to be met, and urged that it should get consideration. I urged at the same time that the aspect of the question which we were advancing with regard to the five-year period and an extended period should be favourably considered.  I want to make the comment now that the Minister, in this amendment, has met Deputy Good, but not the Deputies on these Benches.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies should realise that the amendment brings, in future tenancies, tenancies which are not judicial, the occupiers of which have no real tenure in their holdings. There are many such tenancies all over the country, near towns, and especially cities.  I agree that the Land Act of 1923 caused a considerable amount of hardship.  I admit, too, that this will also cause a considerable amount of hardship.  The point, however, is that you have got to draw the line somewhere, and that you are bound to have cases of hardship on one side of the line or on the other, no matter where you draw it.  As I said, the Land Act of 1923 did cause a certain amount of hardship near cities because holdings which, in every sense of the word were to some extent agricultural, were cut out by the provisions of that Act.  I have altered that in the only way it could be altered&mdash;by saying that future tenancies shall come in and be purchased, and by setting out that in the case where land is potential building ground, unless building begins within six years, the tenant shall purchase it. Deputy Baxter asked me why I did not go back three or four or five years.  I do not think it matters twopence.  If I brought it back, say, three years or two years, then I would be doing a very grave injustice indeed.  As it is, there will be cases of extreme hardship under this Bill, at least in connection with land near certain towns in the country. The very least that could be done was to give the owners of lands, that have been excluded under the Land Act of 1923 as building ground, six years to prove their bona fides.  If we made the period any shorter we would be only making the hardship worse.  Coming to Deputy Good's point, I want to remind Deputies that this proviso only applies to land on which moneys have already been expended for development purposes.  If there is no such land the section is going to do no harm and no good.  It is going to be inoperative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There again the Deputy expects too much.  Life is not so simple as that.  You have one set of conditions in Clonmel and another in Rathmines, one set of conditions in <Col N="1016" /> the town of Loughrea and another in the City of Limerick.  Money is expended by a small owner near a small town of a thousand inhabitants.  It would be a very big sum to him but would be absolutely negligible if spent by the Earl of Pembroke on the Pembroke Estate.  All these circumstances must be left to the Judicial Commissioner who will have to take into account all the circumstances of the case.  I could not draw a line and say £5, £20, or £20,000.  I must leave it to the Judicial Commissioner because circumstances vary.  Surely, if I am bound to adopt the Deputy's point of view the activities of everyone in the country will have to be rigidly defined by an Act of Parliament passed specially for every circumstance and individual in the country.  That must be left to the judge.  If you draw your line too rigidly you do more hardship than good.</P>
      <P>Now, to come to Deputy Good's point, this proviso only applies to land on which money has been expended for the development of a building site.  He objects to twenty years, says that is not long enough and quotes an instance where money was expended twenty-seven years ago and where nothing has been done since.  I do not profess to know as much about the circumstances of such a case as the Deputy but I think it would he quite fair to expect them to expend sufficient money to bring the site to the point where they could commence building in twenty-five years and that is what I have done.  I do not see why the Deputy should ask me to go any further unless he wants me to make the Act a dead letter.  If he wishes and the Dáil agrees&mdash;I would not advise him to accept it&mdash;I will let the amendment read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided also that when the landlord proves to the satisfaction of the Judicial Commissioner that he has expended money in developing the land for building the said period of five years may be extended to such further period as the Judicial Commissioner may consider reasonable having regard to the amount of money so proved to have been expended.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In putting before the Dáil this amendment, it is necessary for me to review land legislation for very many years.  The British Government found it was necessary, owing to legislation passed by that Government, to bring in certain Bills to try and make good the harm that had been done and, in their own interests, to end, if possible. the feelings of hatred of those who were driven from their homes in Ireland. We find the policy of Lord John Russell was to clear the people out of this country.  In 1848, according to the statistics supplied by British authorities, in one year you had 70,000 occupiers and their families, numbering 300,000 in all, rooted out of the land.  Those farms extended from twenty-five acres at a maximum to five acres minimum.  Those holdings were consolidated and turned into existing ranches.  Those people were, in most of those ranches, evicted not for non-payment of rent, but evicted with their rack-rent paid up to date.  The developments and improvements in that land were seized.  The British Government <Col N="1018" /> saw the necessity for making good the harm caused to Irish farmers by following a policy that was injurious to their trade in this country, one of their best customers.  Millions of the Irish race had to fly owing to the policy which they found later on to be a false one.</P>
    <P>In Section 27 of the Act of 81 the British Parliament first introduced legislation to deal with the question of the division of the lands of the country amongst the people of the country.  You had the establishment of the Congested Districts Board in 1891.  Sections 34 and 35 deal with the same matter. They deal with the question of the ranch land of the country, with the increased powers of the Congested Districts Board to deal with those matters, and also with the question of evicted tenants.  In the Land Act of 1896, Part 4 deals further with the Congested Districts Board, and Section 46 deals also with the question of evicted tenants and the division of land. The Irish Land Act of 1903, known as the Wyndham Act, brought forward by Wyndham in the British House of Commons during the Balfour régime, forced on the British House of Commons almost entirely through the action of the Irish Party, has a special section dealing with the taking over of the ranch lands of the country and their division amongst the working farmers of Ireland.  The Irish Land Act of 1909, known as the Birrell Act, has the same compulsory power dealing with the division of the ranches of the country among the people.</P>
    <P>You have the Irish Land Bill of 1920 &mdash;a British Bill based on the recommendations of the Irish Convention of 1917-18.  That is supposed to be the basis of the 1923 Act, known as the Hogan Act.  That Act, which was introduced by the present Minister for Agriculture, has a section dealing specially with this question of the breaking up of the untenanted lands. It is now clearly the policy of the Minister to undo that which was made the law of the country dealing with this most important question.  I maintain that Section 8 is in direct contradiction of the section in that Act dealing with this matter.  The Minister makes it easy <Col N="1019" /> for the rancher to retain his land.  I will deal afterwards with the conditions that the Minister advances and the reasons which he proposes to us as sufficient reasons why this land should not be divided.  If the British Parliament in various Land Acts saw the necessity for division of land amongst the working farmers for various reasons, and if our native Parliament also saw that necessity, it seems an extraordinary attitude for the Minister now to stultify himself and ask the Dáil to stultify itself by undoing what it did in 1923.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question by Deputy Roddy on the 23rd April last year, as to the land vested in the Land Commission, the number of acres given by the Minister was 917,173, and of this only 48,197 were divided.  The Minister went on to state further that under the 1903 and 1909 Acts there had been an additional 80,000 acres divided, but that did not come under the land inspected by the Land Commission for this particular purpose.  We have heard it stated here, and we have seen in the Press reports of speeches made by the Minister for Agriculture, that with all the claims made for land by landless men, uneconomic holders and evicted tenants, there was not enough of land to go round, and it would be impossible to meet all those claims. Still we find this large proportion of land is not divided, and we find, further, that loop-holes are to be given to the rancher to evade the law even where estates have been inspected during the past four years, and where the Inspector saw the necessity for the division of this land amongst the uneconomic holders and pointed it out to the Land Commission.  Still those estates are not to be divided, not because they have been carrying thoroughbred stock, but because, as the Minister has pointed out in reply to a query here, it is essential to the economy of the country and it is intended to encourage people to get into the breeding of stock.  If we confined it to the few people breeding high-class stock it would be useless.  It was deliberately intended to encourage others.  He further states that it applies <Col N="1020" /> not only to the land used for that purpose now, but land which will be used in future for that purpose.  There are people in possession of ranches from which other people were unjustly evicted.</P>
    <P>The people evicted, or their descendants, are trying to live on five or ten acres of land.  They were evicted not for non-payment of rent, but because the land was required to be turned into ranches.  The owners of these ranches never ran anything on the lands but scrub cattle.  Ninety per cent. of their cattle are sent to Great Britain to be fattened.  The lands were never used to finish cattle.  Those people, who never bred thoroughbred stock of any kind, have only to say that they intend in future to breed thoroughbred cattle or pure-bred sheep or pigs in order to evade the Act, because the Minister says this not only applies to lands that are being used for the purpose of breeding thoroughbred stock, but lands which will be used in future for that purpose.  The fact that this rancher who has land that he never paid for, land that those who went before him got from the British Government, sometimes even at the price of their honour&mdash;if they had any&mdash;those who voted for the betrayal of their own Parliament&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The limits of the debate will be very much extended if, in fact, there is something contained in Section 8 to the effect that the Deputy desires to make out.

      <P>On a point of explanation. The Deputy unfortunately misquoted what I said.  I explained this was to apply not only to existing stud-farms, but to prospective stud-farms that would be founded in two, three or four years time.  But the point in the section is that the farm must be used as a stud-farm at the time the Land Commission proceeds to acquire it.  It is clear, in the section, that the owner of the land will not be in a position to make a case that he is going to use the farm as a stud-farm.  He must be in the position to show whether the stud-farm is founded this year or next year or the year after.  He must be in a position to show the Land Commission at the time they take proceedings that the farm is at that hour being <Col N="1022" /> used as a stud-farm in a bona fide manner.  Now, I hope that is clear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisJosephDalton" hpid="Mr. D'ALTON Mr. D'ALTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean that if the Land Commission had taken action with a view to taking ever a certain estate and if the owner of the estate had not notified the Land Commission that he was going to use it as a stud-farm, and if he still uses it simply for the grazing of half-bred stock but now notifies the Land Commission that he intends, at a future date, to use it as a stud-farm, even although the Land Commission had taken steps&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not like construing sections, but if the Deputy's contention is in the section the debate would have to be of an extraordinarily wide character.  The Deputy has taken us through a full review of land legislation.  On the face of the section, as a layman reads it, it does not appear to mean what the Deputy says at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisJosephDalton" hpid="Mr. D'ALTON Mr. D'ALTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>My interpretation of the section is that it is possible for any one of these people who hold untenanted land to avail of this section, even although the necessity for the division amongst the uneconomic holders is made quite clear.  To my mind, under the section it is quite possible for a man to evade the 1923 Act even when the necessity has been found by the Land Commission, and after their inspectors have agreed that it should be divided, on the condition put forward by the owner that he is going to use it for the purpose of rearing thoroughbred stock. If you, sir, wish to explain to me that I am not right&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister has made it clear that that is not possible under the section.  That is my point; that where the Land Commission has inspected and taken the matter to court to have it decided as regards the price, even still there is a further opportunity given to the owner <Col N="1023" /> to say that he is going to use the land, at a future date, for the breeding of thoroughbred stock, so that this section of the Act of 1923 can be avoided and broken away from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to one of his reasons for this particular section. Where you have a ranch of 1,000 acres and five men employed, if you have one aged thoroughbred which is no use whatever as regards results, and some half-breds, that is, I presume, the nucleus of a new thoroughbred stock farm which the owner says he intends to work.  It is going to be a question whether this farm of 1,000 acres, with five men on it, surrounded with farms of under £20 valuation, owned by people who are paying their annuities and rates, do not owe anything to anyone, is to continue in the possession of one man while the surrounding farmers are unable to get an acre additional. You may have a ranch of 1,200 acres with four herds and two other workers, and these people with their families may number in all 25, whereas you may have 1,000 acres of land with 100 occupiers, each with five in family, which means 500 individuals, yet the hundred families of 500 people have to be content with 1,000 acres of land between them, all while the six families of 25 people are living on 1,200 acres of land. These 100 occupiers are producing eggs, bread, and butter from their farms.  They are getting first prizes at bull shows for their animals.  They are getting first prize for dairy cattle at the shows, and even on their small holdings of 10 acres they are breeding the best type of cow to be found, yet, they are not to get an acre of additional land, even though it is land from which their fathers were evicted. Why?  Because it is supposed to be used in the future for the breeding of cattle by men who never, up to this, bred thoroughbred cattle on their ranches.  The small farmers I have mentioned are bringing in revenue and increasing the wealth of the country. I do not know what wealth is coming into the country from a man running a 1,200-acre ranch with five or six workers on it.  I do not know what value he is to the tradesmen of the <Col N="1024" /> country, and I do not know what value such a man is to town or country.</P>
    <P>You had 690,000 people put out of this country in one year.  We find in Belgium, Holland and Denmark populations such as you do not find in this country, with the result that Denmark, for example, is turning out four-and-a half times as much butter as we are in Ireland.  If you are to have production you must have the people.  The people I referred to a while ago have to travel three or four miles for a garden; they pay more in wages, especially if we calculate what is to be paid to their own families, than is paid by the rancher to the six hands that he employs. If this is the style of thing that is to build up this nation I am afraid it is going to be very slow work.  The Minister lacks method in dealing with this great question, and I hope it is not the intention of the Dáil to pass a section in this Bill which is in direct opposition to the section that was passed by this House in 1923.  We have heard certain complaints about those who claim to be evicted tenants and are not bona fide evicted tenants.  No man who was evicted because the landlord got tired of him, and who, when he found himself thrown over by the landlord, went and joined the Land League, should be regarded as an evicted tenant.  Bona fide evicted scoundrels I call a number of these people.</P>

      <P>There is no suggestion that these people can be brought in amongst uneconomic holders.  You have numbers of bona fide evicted tenants who have paid their rents in full, but who were evicted for no reason except that the land was required for ranches.  There is no getting over that fact.  The British Government found it necessary in all their Acts of Parliament to try to undo the wrongs done to these people.  It should not be for an Irish Parliament to go back from the position it has already taken up and from the position that the British Parliament found it necessary to take up.  I do not think that there is much use in my dealing further with this matter.  I have made my points fairly <Col N="1025" /> clearly.  I believe it is those who carry a clean bill of health, who owe no money, either to the ratepayers or to the Land Commission, who are not in debt and who have been industrious, should be put on land that is not giving a proper return to the country.  No ranch, with its four or five men, is giving a sufficient return to the country to help to meet the adverse trade balance.</P>

      <P>Of course if you make a ruling I have to bow to it, but I maintain I have been speaking very much to the point because I have been dealing with a section in the Act of 1923 and the section now brought forward by the Minister to defeat that section.  I have gone very closely into it because I have been dealing with everything that surrounds it, and the necessity for the division of these ranches.  There are a number of farms available at present to be taken up for the breeding of high-class stock and they could be taken for this purpose instead of preventing the division of the ranches because of this excuse. Under the Acts of 1903 and 1923 there were advances of £3,000.  Now under this section the Minister will make it possible for them to have advances of £5,000, or even £10,000, for the purpose of buying out ranches, which may be up to 700 acres in extent.  He can buy them at a loss to the State, with the State's security, and still they get the full benefit of the agricultural grant.  It is being made easy for those who now hold the land to continue in possession of this land if they use it as stud-farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter is one of very serious importance. It must have been important when legislation was necessary.  If it was important when legislation was introduced here and in the British House of Commons, I believe that it is equally important and necessary to-day <Col N="1026" /> that these lands should be divided.  I want to make one point clear.  Twelve months ago, when this matter came before the Dáil I stated that I did not in any way support the division of any land, no matter how much it was, when employment was given on that land.  I have objected on a public platform to the division of an estate where forty or fifty men were employed in charge of brood mares, a herd of dairy cattle and in doing tillage, Where employment is given and the land is used I do not advocate the division of that land, but where you have bona fide uneconomic holders getting no employment, bringing little revenue to the State, I say that legislation which was passed to deal with the distribution of this land should not be upset, no matter what excuse has been formulated by the Minister and no matter what influence has been brought to bear on him by Deputies to prevent the division of the land.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy D'Alton has raised one or two points that would require some attention from the Minister.  I do think that there is a certain amount of looseness about the section that may offer temptation to those who may want to avoid having their land taken for division purposes and who may take advantage of this section and start stud-farms. The point is made that at the time the Land Commission comes to take over the land it must actually be in use as a stud-farm.  But we know the delays that have taken place, and that are bound to take place, in the acquisition of land, and there will be many of these untenanted ranches the owners of which might see in the section an opportunity for holding on to the land. There is a certain amount of indefiniteness about the section.  The whole thing seems to be left to the Land Commission to see whether or not it is being used in a bona fide manner.</P>

      <P>That refers only to the kind of stock that is bred there, but the Land Commission decides whether it is being used in a bona fide manner as a stud-farm, and nothing is said of untenanted land which may be used for that purpose.  Nothing is said as to the proportion of the land used for that particular purpose, or whether or not the whole of it is to be so used. For instance, if the owner of such land were to engage to a certain extent in the breeding of thoroughbred stock and to a certain extent in the rearing of ordinary stock, it is not quite clear whether or not that would fulfil the conditions.  It would seem to be ridiculous if it could happen, as suggested by Deputy D'Alton, that if a few thoroughbred animals were kept on a farm the land could be regarded as a stud-farm for the purpose of defeating the intentions of the Bill.  I doubt the wisdom, in any case, of applying this section to untenanted land; I think that there is really no necessity for that.  I quite see the point the Minister made the last day in directing attention to the necessity for encouraging the production of thoroughbred stock, but I do certainly doubt whether the provisions of the Bill should apply in the case of untenanted land.  I believe the section requires to be tightened up considerably if we are to prevent it being used by those who will, naturally, be tempted to make use of it in order to defeat the purposes of the Land Act.  There are people&mdash;it is only natural to expect it, of course&mdash; who will take advantage of any loophole of this kind.  I know cases of lands that have been untenanted for generations.  The owners are now fixing up temporary residences on them and declaring that the land is no longer untenanted land.  In some cases that has been successful to a certain extent. But as I say, there are people who will always be anxious to take advantage of any loophole that an Act will offer to them.  I think there are loopholes in this, and I suggest that the Minister should have the section more carefully examined with a view to having the loopholes stopped.</P>

      <P>I think it would be most unfortunate if there should be any interference with genuine stud-farms, especially ones where thoroughbred horses are kept.  These farms are a great asset to the country.  They are not only remunerative to the owners, but they give a good deal of employment. There, are several of these farms in my constituency, and it would be a great blow, not only to the surrounding farmers who get a good market at these farms, but also to the workers who are employed there in considerable numbers if anything interfered with them.  There are other estates differently managed which would be available for division.  Very near where I live there is an extensive stud-farm at which a large number of men are employed.  That establishment turns out some of the very best horses that are bred in the Three Kingdoms or elsewhere. A few miles further on there is an estate of 1,800 Irish acres, on which two men are employed.  That is the sort of land that I say should be divided, and not estates where a paying industry is carried on.  I do not want to make a case for non-genuine stud-farms, or where a man keeps a few horses or a few head of pedigree cattle.  I do not think they would be genuine stud-farms. An extension of the breeding of pure-bred cattle would be most important. No one knows better than the Minister that large sums of money are sent across to Scotland and other places every year for pedigree bulls that might be bred in this country.  I hope the Minister will not agree to the abolition of what I regard as one of the most important provisions in the Bill.</P>

I do not think there is any desire on the part of anyone to interfere with these farms, but I will support Deputy D'Alton in his amendment, as I look upon this clause as the ranchers' protection clause.  That is what it is when the camouflage is taken away.  The meaning is that anyone who wants to evade the intentions of the Bill can <Col N="1029" /> frustrate them by turning a large untenanted farm into a sort of stud-farm and by putting a few thoroughbred animals on it.  I think that is objectionable from every point of view.  You will have sham stud farms set up all over the country in all the large ranches, if the clause is passed as it stands.  As a result, you will be setting up a new landlord class that will be infinitely worse than the class we are trying to get rid of.</P>

      <P>Deputy D'Alton tried to make us weep by drawing a picture of 500 acres of land with a bad pedigree Hereford bull in the middle and the Land Commission deciding that it was a stud-farm.  If the Deputy was going on that line he should have gone the whole way, and drawn a picture of 10,000 acres of land with a pedigree goat on it, and the Land Commission deciding it was a farm used for breeding high-class stock.  If the Land Commission would decide that the 10,000 acres of land with a pedigree goat is a stud-farm Deputy D'Alton and the other Deputies who took that line would be right.  Let us see what the section says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-sections (1) and (3) of Section 24 of the Land Act of 1923 there shall not be vested in the Land Commission by virtue of the said Act otherwise than in pursuance of a voluntary agreement any untenanted land so long as the Land Commission are satisfied that such land is being used in a bona fide manner as a farm for the purpose of breeding thoroughbred stock which in the opinion of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture is of a nature and character suitable to the requirements of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think every possible danger is covered there.  First of all, you must leave it to the Land Commission to decide whether a farm is being used for that purpose.  I will not waste the time of the House pointing out that Deputy D'Alton is wrong in his contention, that the mere intention to use it would be a sufficient cause.  The Act is quite clear about that: &ldquo;The Land Commission are satisfied that such <Col N="1030" /> land is being used in a bona fide manner.&rdquo;  Therefore the land must be actually used when the Land Commission proceeds to acquire it.  Does not that dispose of the term &ldquo;sham stud-farms&rdquo;? If it does not the draughtsman is not able to do it better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the Land Commission goes and acquires it.  There is nothing to stop them.  The Land Commission must see that the farm is being used as a stud-farm, and they must see that it is being used in a bona fide way; in other words, that the land is required for the purpose of raising high class stock.  Deputies may say that the Land Commission will not do its duty.  The same might be said of every section of the Land Act.  It is for the Land Commission to say whether the estate would be required at all for the relief of congestion.  It is for the Land Commission to decide every case and every point that comes up under any Land Act.  It is for the Land Commission to decide, most important of all, if this land, whether it is a stud-farm or not, is required for the relief of congestion.  The decision must be left to the Land Commission. Once you constitute a body to whom you must submit such very big issues as the issue I have mentioned, whether the land is to be taken at all or not, there is no other way of meeting the case.  The least that may be done is to let them decide that very much minor question, where the owner of the land may put up the defence that it is being used in a bona fide way as a farm for breeding high class stock animals.  I hope Deputies have got that point.  I think the whole debate is based on the idea that the Land Commission should not be trusted to decide this point.  If the Land Commission is not to be trusted to decide this point, abolish them and establish another Land Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the acquisition of those lands for the relief of congestion came up and the point arose as to whether there was other land in the district more suitable.  The Land Commission decided that in view of the fact that this land was fully equipped with all the requisites for a stud-farm and as there was more land in the district suitable for the relief of congestion, they would not touch this particular property.  You must leave all these big questions that I have indicated to the Land Commission.  Deputies are quite prepared to leave to the Land Commission the decision as to whether or not a man should get £10,000 or £20,000 for a farm; they are quite prepared to leave it to the Land Commission to decide whether a farm should or should not be taken; but they immediately object if we leave it to the Land Commission to decide whether a farm is a, stud-farm bona fide used for that purpose.  I think that attitude is illogical and is based on a false idea. It is based on the fallacy that the Land Commission may take responsibility for these extremely important decisions but are not to be trusted when it comes to a small matter like that.  That is unsound.  You must leave the decision to somebody, and obviously the proper body is the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to make assurance doubly sure there is inserted a provision that not only is the farm being bona fide <Col N="1032" /> used as a stud-farm for the purpose of breeding high-class animals, and not only must the whole farm be required for that purpose&mdash;that is the effect of the bona fide use&mdash;but it must be used for the purpose of breeding animals suitable to the country, and it is the Department of Agriculture that will have the say in that matter.  Consequently, the owner cannot begin to breed special types such as the Duroc-Jersey breed.  I do not want to go into the various breeds of cattle, because if I do the partisans are sure to intervene and people will be writing to the papers saying that this breed is better than that breed, and so on.  Owners cannot begin to develop some breed obviously unsuitable to the country.  There are some breeds of cattle, pigs and sheep that are quite unsuitable and we provide against that.  We provide against the case of a wealthy man who simply wants to differ from his neighbours, who starts a special breed and who destroys all the animals in the neighbourhood as a consequence.  The Land Commission must be satisfied that the farm is being used for the breeding of high-class animals, and the Department must be satisfied that the animals are suitable for the requirements of the country.  That gives you, so far as you can get it in a section of an Act of Parliament, ample security.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies refer to the existing stud-farms.  They would be in favour of retaining them as they give a lot of employment.  That is just another illustration of the saying that everybody's goose is a swan.  I am not so nearly concerned with farmers breeding horses as the farmers breeding high-class cattle and sheep.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand Deputies who contend that a stud farm where horses are bred and reared should remain absolutely untouched, whereas the farm of a man who undertakes an equally difficult task, but a much more important task so far as the country is concerned&mdash;breeding high-class cattle and sheep&mdash;should have no consideration. That is wrong.  This section was introduced with the object of meeting, as far as possible, the case of the small farmer.  Deputies should not be trying to magnify the difference between a <Col N="1033" /> small farmer and a big farmer.  A small farmer cannot afford to breed high-class stock.</P>

Deputies might as well talk about these matters as about ranches.  We are talking at the moment of farms used for the breeding of high-class stud animals.  Let us keep to that and not talk about ranches.  There is nothing so important to the small farmer as the opportunity of being able to get at a reasonable price high-class pedigree stock.  Every farmer who is not an ignoramus knows that.  There is nothing so important to the country as that we should put ourselves in the position of breeding most of our stud animals here.

      <P>I did not look in the Deputy's direction that time.  Anybody who does not need the knowledge &mdash;let me put it that way&mdash;is aware that a farmer does not wait for some fine morning to decide whether he will start a stud-farm.  There is nothing so expensive or that requires such outlay or such a complete change of farming. One thinks not once or twice, but three or four times, before suggesting a stud-farm. It requires big changes in the farm, and one must take considerable pains to get stock before one can build <Col N="1034" /> up a bona fide stud-farm.  That is what we are dealing with.  It would be all right if, in the middle of a thousand acres, there was a pedigree goat, and that farm was considered by the Land Commission to be a stud-farm.  We are now talking about bona fide stud-farms.</P>
      <P>A bona fide stud-farm requires a considerable amount of care, worry, attention and skill.  No farm gives so much employment as a well-run stud-farm; no farm is such a market for the produce of the small farmer, and no other farm can produce at such a cheap rate the sort of stock the small farmer needs.  The small farmer can always get in the neighbourhood of a stud-farm first-class stock at a reasonable price.  All this analogy between the stud-farm and the ranch is quite wrong. The intention of the section is to facilitate bona fide farms for stock animals. It does not necessarily mean horses.  I do not consider horses anything like the most important stock to be bred.  What is meant is any farm used for the breeding of high-class stock animals.</P>
      <P>It is to apply only to so much land as is required for that purpose, and it is to apply only if the Department of Agriculture certifies that the stock bred on the farm is suitable for the country. Finally, it can only apply in cases where the farm is actually being used for that purpose in a bona fide way when the Land Commission inspects it. I am told by lawyers that all that is in this section.  I am satisfied myself that it is.  No man is fool enough to incur the expense of erecting stabling, fencing and providing a stock of breeding animals, employing labour and all the rest of it in organising a stud-farm to throw up all that in five years, and then have the Land Commission coming in and robbing him by taking it from him with all the buildings and equipment. He will not have much money left by that time.</P>

I refer to quite legitimate cases.  I have some in mind myself in my own constituency, though my constituents would not be very much concerned with this particular type of holding.  But there are a few scattered here and there.  The attitude of mind on the part of the owner will be that he will be wondering if he is going to make an application, and whether or not, when the Land Commission takes the land, they may not retain the holding.  Undoubtedly, if there is the case that the Minister states, there is also the other case, and there should be some indication given in the Bill that the case of the legitimate owner, from the point of view of the type of individual that we want to have brought within the Bill, should be treated in such a manner as would satisfy him that the application to redeem will not, in fact, mean to him an application from the Land Commission to take over his lands.

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the whole thing over again.  For the sake of argument, let us take it that a very big proportion of the land which the Land Commission acquires for the relief of congestion is held under fee farm grants.  Once that is admitted the problem arises.  Deputies want to treat one class of person who owns such lands in one way, and another class of person in another way.  Then, the question arises how to do it?  Here take a specific case.  The intention of everybody, including the person who moved the amendment, is that any owner, if a fee farm grantee, might apply to the Land Commission under this section and avail himself of his rights.  That was the intention of everybody.  It was never suggested, for a moment, that there was any owner who should not apply.  In connection with the other sections it was suggested that the rights that are being claimed for fee farm grantees should only be available to fee farm grantees whose lands were within, say, 10/- and 30/- rent per acre. But that case was never made for this particular section.  But suppose it was, and if at this stage Deputies said: &ldquo;Well, let this section only apply to tenants whose land comes within the 10/- and 30/-, being agricultural rents&rdquo;; then that takes you back again, because these fee farm grantees whose lands are within the limits of the 15/- and 30/- per acre holding hold land which, in a considerable number of cases, we will be acquiring for the relief of congestion.  Even if you limit the number of fee farm grantees to a rent which you define as agricultural, nevertheless you will still be dealing with lands which, in the normal way, the Land Commission will acquire in a great many cases for the relief of congestion. You cannot, in an Act of the Oireachtas, discriminate between those cases where, in fact, you will acquire land and where, in fact, you will not acquire land.  How can we?  We do not know the cases yet.  The only possible way I can see to make such a discrimination would be by reference to the poor law valuation or the acreage, and if we started on that line what is the difference?  Is it to be fifty or one hundred, or two hundred or three <Col N="1037" /> hundred pounds?  We would never get anywhere on that.  We would not get agreement, and even if we did get agreement we would be doing an injustice. The Land Commission, in some cases, would want to acquire land because of its situation, even if it was under the valuation; and in many other cases they would not acquire land at all even if it was over the valuation. You cannot discriminate between persons. You must discriminate between tenures.  So long as it is a fact that a considerable proportion of these lands will be required for the relief of congestion, and so long as it is quite impossible to define them accurately at this stage otherwise than by their tenures, then we can do no more than we are doing there, no more than the Deputy is suggesting in his amendment, to take it out entirely, and if we did this we would stop land purchase.  That is all. I found myself in this dilemma one time here when we were dealing with fee farm grants and people used the same kind of language that used to be used in the past in another Parliament, about the insecurity, and about the dangers and the fears that people will have that their property is to be taken, They are using that about the same tenures and there is only this difference: that in the past the people who used that language had only one class in their minds.  At present the people using that language have in mind another and a different class.  We cannot discriminate between classes.  We must give the same treatment to all tenures. We cannot do otherwise.  If it is really a realisation of the fact that there are limits to land purchase then it is all to the good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies must realise that we simply cannot make a distinction between classes or between persons.  We can only make a distinction between tenures.  That does not mean, for instance, that you could not pick out certain sorts of fee farm rents and deal with them separately within particular limitations.  But you cannot discriminate between persons.  You can only discriminate by reference to other factors that go to the merits of the case. In this case, if we accepted the amendment, land purchase would, to a very <Col N="1038" /> considerable extent, have to stop.  On the other hand, there is no way I know, or that, I think, could be devised by anybody&mdash;without a commission of inquiry and a schedule of twenty or thirty pages to an Act of Parliament, as a result of the commission of inquiry&mdash;by which you could, discriminate between the cases the Deputy has in mind and the cases which he has not in mind but which are important to the Land Commission by reason of the fact that the lands in those cases are being acquired compulsorily.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) Where a parcel of untenanted <Col N="1040" /> land, so held as aforesaid, whether situated in a congested districts county or not, is vested in the Land Commission on the appointed day, the Judicial Commissioner, in fixing the redemption price of the superior interests payable out of the purchase money of the parcel, shall have regard to the price received by the vendor for the parcel and to the amount of the arrears of rent, if any, due by him up to the date of the passing of this Act.  In every such case, arrears of rent which shall have accrued due up to and including the first gale day in the year 1924 shall not be payable by the vendor.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The proposition put up first in connection with fee farm grantees was that they should be treated same as tenants.  That was a proposition I could not agree to, for reasons which I have often given.  Fee farm grantees vary in particular circumstances very much.  Their rents vary.  They vary from five shillings to two pounds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>These variations very often reflect certain peculiar circumstances connected with the original letting. For instance, you have often a case where a man would like to buy untenanted land and has not got the money or has only got a very small proportion of it.  He takes up, instead, a fee farm rent, paying considerable rent in lieu of part of the fine.  Further and more difficult is the fact that fee farm rents are established and changed and altered as a result of family circumstances, of mortgages and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Further, it has to be remembered that fee farm rents never came under the Land Acts.  They were never touched by previous Land Acts and they were always regarded in much the same way as the tenure of houses in towns.  It was never felt that there was any danger that they would be interfered with.  Hence, they came to be looked upon as a security and as an easy and safe way of giving annuities under marriage settlements, family settlements, and so on.  In that <Col N="1041" /> way, a number of mortgages and claims and charges grew up and were woven round fee farm rents all over the country where these rents exist.  All that was based on the firm belief that fee farm rents, which had never come within the Land Acts, would never come within these Acts.  That makes it extremely difficult to treat fee farm grantees at present as if they were tenants.  The question was raised before, and I dealt with the considerations put forward by Deputy Baxter.</P>
      <P>I realise that there are some cases where, at least on view, it does appear a hardship that a fee farm grantee should be treated in one way and a judicial tenant in another.  Everybody is immensely impressed by the circumstances which surround him.  People see fee-farm grantees farming their land in the ordinary way still at the old rent, having got no relief.  On the other side of the ditch, they see judicial tenants with rents reduced 35 per cent., arrears added to the purchase money, and so on.  You have, in those circumstances, an agitation for some sort of redress.  There is the dilemma.  Firstly, you have land tenures, always sacred, never touched by any Land Act, around which all sorts of family charges, mortgages, bank charges, grow up, and, secondly, you have tenures of rents which are very difficult to interfere with.  On the other hand, you have cases where five or six small men, popularly called tenants of an estate, who held under fee farm grants and, consequently, were unable to get the advantages of the Land Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, it is the old case where it is impossible, or almost impossible, to discriminate between persons.  You can only discriminate between the merits of the cases&mdash;the tenures and circumstances. To meet that I proposed what was also proposed in Senator Butler's Bill&mdash;to give the same terms to fee-farm grantees outside the congested districts as inside the congested districts. Within the congested districts, untenanted land and land held under fee-farm grant as untenanted land, vested automatically in the Land Commission and then could be resold to the fee farm grantee.  The fee farm grantee was the vendor&mdash;he was the owner of <Col N="1042" /> the fee farm grant.  In the case of ten&mdash; anted land, the vendor is the owner of the fee&mdash;the landlord.  The tenant is not the vendor.  Within the congested districts, the fee farm grantee's land was, in effect, sold to the Land Commission and the Land Commission resold.  Outside the congested districts, if the fee farm rent was to be redeemed or if a fee farm grantee was to get any relief, he had to apply to the Land Judge to have the rent redeemed.  He was not in as strong a position as the fee farm grantee within the congested districts for two reasons.  In practice the procedure in the congested districts enabled the fee farm grantee to have arrears, if any, added to the purchase money.  Let us say that there is a fee farm rent of £100 on 100 acres and that there are three years' arrears due.  The Land Commission buy it at £1,500 from the vendor, who, remember, is the fee farm grantee.  They pay his charges&mdash;the charges that are on that purchase money&mdash;first.  One charge is the fee farm rent and that fee farm rent is redeemed, say, at £800.</P>
    <P>That £800 is transferred to the grantor, the owner of the rent as well as three years' rent, £300&mdash;a total of £1,100, and the fee farm grantee is then really paying interest and sinking fund at 4½ per cent. on £1,100.  In other words, his arrears have been added to the purchase money.  That did not happen outside the congested districts. In that way the fee farm grantee outside the congested districts was at a disadvantage compared with the fee farm grantee within the congested districts. He was at a disadvantage, as he did not get a loan at 4½ per cent. repayable in 67 years to pay off his arrears.</P>
    <P>The second point is not so obvious, but it is equally important.  Within the congested districts the land was bought as untenanted land at a certain price.  Say, without going into the acreage, that land is bought at £2,000 by the Land Commission in the ordinary way as untenanted land.  They can only buy it in one way.  They have to buy it as if they were going to resell it.  They have to buy it at a price which would leave it an economic proposition to resell and which would make <Col N="1043" /> the annuity economic to the tenant purchaser. They have to buy it at such a price that, repayable at 4¾ per cent., it is an economic proposition for the tenants and the landless men in the event of their dividing it.  They have to buy at a smaller price than land can be bought in the open market.  They have to buy it at certainly an economic price.  It is bought, say, at £2,000 within the congested districts.  There is a rent on it.  There is one charge to be paid out of the £2,000 before the owner gets what is coming to him, the owner being the fee-farm grantee, and that is the redemption of the head rent. The Land Judge must redeem the head rent in such a way as to give a fair proportion of the money to the grantee for his occupation interest and a reasonable proportion to the grantor for his interest as being a rent holder.  He must, if the price is small, have some fair relation between the interests of the grantor and of the grantee who is in occupation, who had all the profits of the land, who had a fixed tenure in the land, and whose interest must be regarded in the average case as at least as important and as valuable as the interest of the grantor.</P>
    <P>He must redeem the rent in such a way as to leave a sufficient allowance for the interest of the grantee.  In other words, he must assume that he is not going to resell the land to the grantee; he must assume that he will require it for the relief of congestion. There is £2,000 there and it has to be divided between two persons, one who owned the rent, and the other who had the occupation interest.  That mere fact lowers the redemption value of the rent.  By putting the grantee outside the congested districts, in the same position as the grantee in the congested districts you certainly confer two big advantages.  If there is a very high rent on the land and if at the same time the land is being bought on Land Commission principles&mdash;at such a price as it might be resold to tenants and yet leave an economic annuity to be paid by these tenants&mdash;it is obvious that the Land Judge must take into consideration, not only the rent but the occupation interest and it is obvious <Col N="1044" /> he cannot redeem the rent at a very high price so you do ensure that the rent is redeemed at some sort of reasonable price when you provide that the arrears be added to the purchase money.</P>
    <P>What is happening in practice is this: that a man who held land under one of these tenures subject to a rent payable for ever gets that rent redeemed at a very reduced price.  He has the other choice which I need not go into now, paying a bigger rent and taking the money in hand to pay off other debts or refusing to take any money and putting it against the annuity, leaving himself with a very small rent as compared with the rent he paid previously.  Anyway he is in the position that this rent which he had to pay for ever as a fixed rent is redeemed now at a reasonable figure. The land judge has to take all the circumstances into account in each case that comes before him.  A certain number of years' arrears are added to the purchase money.  He gets a loan at 4½ per cent on that and he gets 67 years to repay that.  I think that meets all the equities of the case.  Again we have the same case that we debated five minutes ago.  You cannot do the ideal thing for every tenant.  You must simply try and do approximate justice to everybody in an Act of Parliament. An Act of Parliament must be based on general principles which must apply evenly all round.  This is the very best we could do and to make the position quite clear I am proposing to add this sub-section at the end of the section.  It is an amendment which I have given a considerable amount of thought and consideration to, because the last thing we want to do is to interfere with property that has been regarded as a security up to this.  We realise the grave danger of cutting too near the quick.  All I really desired to do was to make it certain that, first of all the purchase should take place in such a way as, in the nature of the case, to ensure that the rent would be redeemed at a fair price, and then to insert certain definite provisions in a section as a safeguard, so that the Judicial Commissioner would, at least, take certain things into account in fixing the redemption price.  I am suggesting, <Col N="1045" /> therefore, that the following sub-section should be added to Section 10. (Amendment quoted.)</P>
    <P>Remember, the vendor is a fee-farm grantee, and this is based on sections in other Acts which deal with the redemption, out of the purchase money, of interests which have been diminished by a particular Act.  For instance, take the case of tenanted land, where the rent is lower and where there are specified provisions in an Act of Parliament which insure that the price of the tenancy shall be small and less than it would be if the rent had not been lowered&mdash;less than it would be if the sale had taken place in the open market.  There follows in some of these cases a provision that when redeeming the charges which might have been deemed against the tenancy, and which now exist against the purchase money, the Land Judge shall take into account the price given for the tenancy.  I am adopting the words in the previous Acts of Parliament for this purpose. The meaning of these words is well settled.  There are decided cases on it, so that there is no danger of their being misinterpreted.  Three years' arrears shall be added, to the purchase money, but not more.  I suggest that that meets the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree that there are difficulties in the way, State difficulties. The first part of this amendment goes a long way to meet the case we have been making.  As a layman I must confess that I have not been able to follow the intricacies of the Minister's argument.  His argument is off the beaten track of land purchase and enters on a very intricate and technical aspect of matters with which we have been accustomed to deal in percentages, percentages on the reduction of the original rental.  This is a new departure which a layman cannot be expected to follow very far, still I accept it as a move in the right direction.  It goes a long way, so far as redemption price is concerned, to meet the case we make.  In regard however to the payment of arrears and the payment in lieu of rent, payments will have to be made up to the appointed day, and not alone will three years' arrears have to <Col N="1046" /> be paid up to the appointed day but the old rental will remain.</P>
      <P>Take, for instance, the case of a farm of 100 acres at £3 an acre.  That means £300 a year or, for three years, £900, which has to be added to the purchase money.  That is an extraordinary case and it is one which exists in fact.  It is a tenancy in the Hill of Down, County Meath, where £3 per Irish acre is paid.  That is only one of many cases that can be found all over the country.  I made several speeches previously in connection with these particular cases since 1923 and I do not want to repeat them.  I want to give you cases.  There is an estate of a near neighbour of mine at the steeple of Kilree of 30 acres with a rental of £84 odd on the De Vesci estate.  Some time ago the grantor saw the impossibility of recovering such a rent and reduced it to £62, and subsequently to £50.  If he stood on his rights he could continue to recover £84.  There is another case in South Kilkenny where property fell to two brothers.  They made lettings to tenants.</P>
      <P>One was an ordinary tenancy that has come under the Land Courts and the 1923 Act.  The other was made by his brother, a solicitor&mdash;I am not casting any reflection on the Minister&mdash;and he put at the head of his letting &ldquo;fee farm grant £2 an acre.&rdquo;  It remains there, with the result that one tenant has come under all the Purchase Acts at 17/6 an acre, while the other has to pay £2 an acre, and will have to continue to pay arrears and payments in lieu of rent up to the appointed day at the rate of £2.  There are other cases, and I think if I read out the names in those cases many citizens of Dublin would be conversant with the people mentioned.  There is a case on the Woodsgift estate, the late owner being Mrs. Marshall.  She owned the place outright and sold it to a speculator in Dublin named Thomas Joseph O'Neill for £4,500.  Thomas Joseph O'Neill broke up the farm into small lots and sold it, thereby realising a sum of £5,000, and bearing, at the same time, a rental of from £1 to £1 10s. an acre, putting at the head of the letting &ldquo;fee farm grant.&rdquo;  Thomas was cute, and he knew something.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>The present owner is a man named Horan, of Grand Canal Street.  Such transactions amount almost to a crime, considering that the State is nearly bankrupt.  You cannot get behind acts of that sort.  The Minister has mentioned State reasons and said that credit should not be interfered with, and also that this would involve a lot of mortgage readjustments and other charges.  He said that it would be impossible for the State to do justice to everybody concerned and maintain the credit of the State except by the methods which he has adopted. If there are State reasons&mdash;and I am prepared to admit that there are&mdash;I think it is the duty of the State, when it is done for State reasons, to come forward and do justice to that class of tenant who is paying two or three pounds rental all his life and who never got redress from any Acts, while all around him are people who have got the benefits of every Act passed since 1881.  For land of the same quality as his, people are paying as low as 10/- an acre, while those outside the fence have to pay from 30/- to £2 and even £3 an acre.  I am not referring to the landlords.  When the Minister says that it was for family reasons that people saddled themselves with these high rents, he has got the wrong end of the stick.  The reason is that landlords were able to make lettings to tenants who did not know the difference and who did not care.  They wanted land at any price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To my mind a point is readied at which a distinction should be made between these classes of leases, and the point at which they should be divided into two classes is at the judicial value.  I cannot see what crime this class of tenant has committed.  You may call him the grantee, the owner, or what you like, but to me he is the tenant and nothing else.  Neither he nor his father or grandfather did anything wrong, and he is always wondering what he has done that he should be treated practically as a criminal.  This reminds me of a homely parallel.  Two individuals <Col N="1048" /> were held up by a force they were unable to resist.  One was put hanging from a beech tree and another from an oak.  The man hanging from the oak was cut down and relieved, and nothing was done for the man hanging from the beech, because he had not the sense to hang himself from the oak. Similarly, all the Land Acts were passed for the benefit of one class of tenants and nothing was done for the other.  The Minister has gone a good way in regard to the purchase price towards remedying the grievance that exists, provided that the Land Judge will have some knowledge of land value.  The prices fixed two years ago were foolish and exorbitant.  Prices should not be fixed on the value of land at the moment.  Regard should be had for what land is likely to be worth in the future, or what it is worth in normal times and not in boom years. I do not think our judges have acted on that principle.  As I am fairly satisfied that in future the judge will not put a fictitious price on the land, but will give only its actual value, I am more or less satisfied, but I am not satisfied that the tenant should pay three years' arrears on an exorbitant charge of £3 per acre and continue to pay that rent until the appointed day. That is my case.  I have made it before and I hope I will not have to make it again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConlan" hpid="Mr. CONLAN Mr. CONLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is more than doubtful that the provision made by the Minister for dealing with fee farm grantees will bring their rents to anything like level with the figure at which annuities are paid in respect of lands adjoining where these fee farm grantees live.  The cases in which land is held under this form of tenure are fairly numerous in my constituency.  I can bear out what Deputy Gorey has said as to the extremely high rents these men pay, and I know of a case in which a rent of £3 per acre is paid. Everybody who knows anything about land and the prices at which agricultural produce is selling knows that that is an impossible rent.  Several cases have been mentioned to me where the rent is £2 per acre.  I know a man who is paying £240 a year rent under a fee farm grant, and he has let the land for <Col N="1049" /> eleven months at £241.  Of course that state of affairs could not continue, because that man's capital will be soon exhausted and he will be forced to relinquish his holding.  We must recognise that the Minister has gone a certain length in trying to meet these cases, but I think he should have gone much further and given these men proper relief by bringing down their rents to a figure at which they can live upon their holdings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has decided to deal with these cases in the matter of purchase, and he has recognised that an injustice was done to these tenants.  But if it is right to purchase the holdings and to recognise that the present rent is not fair or economic, and because of that the Judicial Commissioner will be asked to fix a fair rent, should not the Minister also recognise that where perhaps two or three years arrears were due no matter how these arrears are to be collected the holdings are being rendered uneconomic because of these very heavy arrears.  With the reduced rent and no arrears under ordinary circumstances it might be possible to live on these holdings, but with the huge arrears that have to be paid they are rendered uneconomic.  It has been the policy of the State to make holdings economic.  The Minister has gone a certain distance, but by leaving this burden of arrears to be paid under depressed agricultural conditions it would be undoubtedly true that no reduction given by the Judicial Commissioner in rental will make it possible for the people so affected to carry on. The reduction should not be from the time of the Judicial Commissioner's decision, but it should operate over the years during which the arrears accrued. If he does not do that he will be causing hardship to a number of tenants who are purely agricultural.</P>

      <P>There is no need to have a discussion on abstract justice or injustice, because it leads nowhere.  All legislation is a compromise, but the tendency to seize on every advance for the purpose of getting another advance in the same direction is a bad one.  If that is continued a time will be reached when we shall have enough of land purchase.  One of the main functions of the Land Commission is to buy untenanted land, and to resell it to landless men; to herds, workers on an estate, and others.  The most important function of the Land Commission, of course, is to buy tenanted land and re-sell it to the tenants, but one of its important functions is to buy untenanted land and to re-sell it to landless men. They are doing that every day.  They are able to sell land at a very small rent indeed to landless men.  In fact, where it is not necessary to build a house, they can always re-sell the land to landless men at a very small price. In cases where there is a high annuity to be paid&mdash;there are exceptions, of course&mdash;as a rule that is due to the fact that some considerable advance has been made for the building of a house, the making of fences, or some other purpose.  If I were to consider all the land that has been bought since 1923, and were to calculate what the interest at 41 per cent. would lead to in the way of an annuity, I would, I think, find, in practically all cases, the annuity to be a very reasonable one &mdash;round about £1 an Irish acre.  That is the case, notwithstanding the fact that the Land Commission are buying the land as untenanted land&mdash;buying it at the ordinary Land Commission price as untenanted land&mdash;and re-selling it to landless men.</P>

      <P>I can tell the Minister, from my own personal experience, that in the case of two estates in the County Kilkenny, the land being rather indifferent, there is a rent of 30/- an acre charged on portion of the land, while on a portion that is a bog a rent of 26/- an acre is charged.  The Land Commission is now trying to redeem the price that they paid for this land. on which there is no house.</P>

      <P>I repeat that in nine cases out of ten the Land Commission can buy untenanted land at a price which enables them to re-sell it to landless men at an economic rent.  There are exceptional cases, of course, where the annuity has to be increased by the fact that an advance had been made for the building of a house.  We are talking of averages, and I say that has been done in nine cases out of ten.  Now, let me take two cases.  In the first case the Land Commission buys 25 acres of untenanted land and re-sells to a landless man at an economic rent.  That is to say, they buy 25 acres of fee simple with no charge on it.  In the second case they buy 25 acres of land which are subject to a fee farm rent, but they buy it on exactly the same principle as in the first case.</P>
      <P>Whom are they selling to in thislatter case?  They are selling to the occupier who has to pay not 4¾ per cent on the total purchase money, but only 4¾ per cent on a portion of the purchase money, a portion which is approximately half and half.  Is not that what is happening under the section?</P>

There was a lot of speculation in land and other things at that particular time, but surely the Government is not to be asked to come to the assistance of the speculators?  These people entered into this with their eyes open. <Col N="1052" /> Surely they can pay the rent that they were paying before 1914.  Now we come along and we give them relief for all the arrears up to 1924.  That is going a long way to meet them.  We are lending them the balance at 41 per cent repayable over 67 years.</P>

      <P>Deputies of the House can remember that when the big slump came in prices of cattle and all other agricultural produce in 1920 there was an Unpurchased Tenants' Association formed, the members of which were paying much higher rents than their neighbours who had the benefit of purchase for years.  Part of the programme of their combination was to demand reductions in those high rents, which they could not afford to pay with the falling prices, from their landlords, and not to pay unless they got fair play.  The result was, some were granted satisfactory percentages off their rents; others, who did not get fair treatment, who held out, instead of getting their grievances remedied were victimised and served with the usual notice under the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1887, or, as it was known then, the &ldquo;eviction made easy clause,&rdquo; which created them caretakers.</P>
      <P>In some cases those hated proceedings, which finally constituted the occupiers evicted tenants, were ignored.  It is to remedy this unsatisfactory state of affairs that I have brought in.  my amendment, to which I hope the Minister will give sympathetic consideration by accepting it, and not deprive those of the benefits of this Bill who were manfully, on principle, standing by their fellow members.</P>

      <P>I will draw the Deputy's attention to his amendment.  It applies three years before the Act of 1923.  What an extraordinary thing to do! This section only applies to future tenancies.  It is only in the case of future tenancies that there have been ejectments.  There may be a few cases of present tenancies where there have been ejectments, but in the main it is future tenancies.  In future tenancies the owner could eject his tenant at six or twelve months' notice, and it was <Col N="1054" /> common to exercise that right.  They were different tenancies.  In future tenancies the landlord was different from. the landlord of present tenancies; these were availed of by all sorts of people to make temporary letting's, and they exercised their rights to resume the holding, and we are going very far indeed when we are purchasing future tenancies.  Now we are asked to go back three years previous to 1923 and re-open all the cases where holdings held under future tenancies were resumed by the owners, as they had a perfect, right to resume them, notwithstanding the fact that other tenants may have been in.  This would be the worst kind of retrospective legislation. We debated the question whether we should go back beyond the three years before the introduction of the present Land Act, namely, June, 1926, in Committee, and the House decided we should only go back to the gale day preceding the introduction of this Act. Deputy Dineen suggested we should go back three years before 1923.  I would be against this retrospective legislation. They were tenancies which the tenants entered into with their eyes open, knowing that no real fixity of tenure existed, that the landowner could eject the tenant when he wished, and knowing that the landowner was only making a temporary arrangement. Further, yon would eject people who have been put in since.</P>

This order is a very important document, and such an error should not be changed at all except by a very definite process which has been specified in public.

      <P>Where there is limestone on a holding purchased under the Land Purchase Acts the Land Commission shall haye power to make regulations providing limestone rights for tenant purchasers in the neighbourhood fur use on their holdings having duet-e-gard to the rights of the purchasing tenant on such holding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aim of the amendment is to safeguard the position with regard to limestone. Lime is essential to tillage farming.  The stone is only available in certain places, usually in one or two holdings in an agricultural area.  In the past it has been quarried at these places by the individual tenants and conveyed by them to their holdings, where it was crushed and burned in kilns that are on the majority of these small tillage holdings and which were erected many years ago.  The lime was then available for the holdings.  Its value to agriculture can scarcely be estimated in the improvement of the quality and quantity of the produce, and still more so in the improvement and enhanced value it gives to the grass in the intervals of rotation grazing on poorer lands.  These things are indisputable. Too little of it is being used, and a good deal more will be required if agriculture is to prosper in the way that we hope it will.  In the past, under the system of dual ownership, this particular commodity was regulated by the estates offices and it was made available at a purely nominal rate to the agricultural owners in the area.  Now that dual ownership has been abolished, and the ownership of such holdings is vested in the tenants, all stone, gravel, sand and clay on such holdings become the property of the tenants.  Under that new position the tenant who owns these things promises to be a greater autocrat than any landlord in the past and there will be no hope in the future of getting the lime necessary for tillage under any kind of reasonable conditions unless some regulating authority is put in charge of it.  This amendment comes in between <Col N="1059" /> Section 36, which regulates in a reasonable way the position with regard to turbary, and Section 37, that regulates the position with regard to fishing rights.  I am convinced that this is a question of equal, if not more, importance than either of these, and should be dealt with.  I am sure there are difficulties, but whatever they may be it is our duty in a Bill that proposes to put agriculture on a reasonable basis, not to overlook any of the really important questions that affect tillage farming.</P>
    <P>We have surely the right to prevent a monopoly, and this amendment is intended to give this power to the Land Commission.  The Land Commission can easily regulate the price at which the particular tenant who has got this limestone shall make it available to other agricultural tenants at reasonable terms.  These prices should be fixed the same as in the case of turbary.  The Land Commission has the right to fix the price that a man who has turbary on his land is to charge to the people who want the fuel.  They should have the same right to arrange the prices at which limestone should be made available.  This grievance exists and is quite common in many instances, and it will continue and become more aggravated unless some such provision as I have set down is inserted in this Bill. The Minister, no doubt, may say there are other difficulties in connection with this matter, such as the right of access to these places and individual questions of right of way.  I admit these questions will involve trouble, but whether they involve trouble or not it is our duty to try and get over the difficulties in some shape or other.  In the past, questions of right of way did not present much difficulty.  These places are approachable, and I have never heard of any dispute upon that particular point.  I know the contentions which exist amongst agriculturists engaged in tillage with regard to this matter are very serious indeed, and something should be done in the shape of an amendment like this, or whatever other form it may be possible to devise.</P>
    <P>I urge the necessity of doing this work in regard to this particular product, <Col N="1060" /> which is going to be of such real importance in the agriculture of this country.  In the past it was recognised that the tenants and the landlord had some sort of dual or combined interest in limestone on the property, because the Estate Office took authority to regulate it.  They would not have taken . that authority if they had not some control in the way of ownership apart from the tenant's interest.  I think it is the duty of the State, now when the landlord is abolished, and this particular product is in the hands of owners under the Purchase Acts, that some provision should be made in order that limestone should be made available for the tenants and protected in this particular Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, no doubt, some substance in the amendment moved by the Deputy.  The fact is, tenants are becoming the owners of their land and in all these cases limekilns, or granite quarries or other quarries, on the land, become the property of the tenant, and only in very few cases are they dealt with under the Land Acts.  It is a fact that before my time limekilns were dotted all over the country, and that scarcely one exists to-day.  Limekilns are not structures that remain long in disuse and retain their efficiency.  Very few limekilns exist in my county, which is, perhaps, one of the finest limestone counties in Ireland.  In days gone by nearly every farm had one of those limekilns.  Now they are nearly all in ruins.  The result is that people have to go 10, 15, 20 and 30 miles in some direction before they can get a barrel of lime, so that nobody thinks now of using lime as manure.  I do not know how it is proposed to bring about the necessary change, but where the Land Commission has acquired land for distribution, and where limestone is to be found, it would be easy.  Where the tenants are in possession and where limestone is one of the assets of the farm I do not see how the Land Commission is going to come in.  It is a problem that ought to be faced by the county councils with the authority of the Government, or by the Government themselves.  One must recognise clearly <Col N="1061" /> that limestone has practically ceased to be burned all over the country, and that it is almost impossible to got lime. If lime were available it would be much more extensively used than it is.  There is another thing, people have got into the habit of not facing hard work, and I think that is one of the reasons that we are not burning lime.  I remember lime being sold at something like a chilling a barrel; now we have to pay a half a crown or three shillings a barrel for it.</P>

      <P>I entirely agree with Deputy Gorey that the burning of lime at the moment in the richer parts of the country is a thing of the past. But I speak for the poorer parts of the country, where lime is burned and where it is used for manure and for whitewashing of houses.  There is no doubt that it will be a great grievance to the people if they are prevented from quarrying limestone as they used to quarry it in the past.  It is said that there are some queer chaps amongst the Irish farmers, and that when they get a privilege they want to push it too far.  I think if any one farmer was given a monopoly of limestone, he certainly would try to make all he could out of it.  That is, the reason why I want the poorer people, or those with small farms, who might depend on one farmer for their limestone, not to be dependent on the one farmer, and I say that there should be something in the law to compel him not to overcharge them.  I think the Minister should provide some way, as in the case of turf, and I would ask him to consider the amendment.</P>

      <P>There is no question of a monopoly.  The use of the word &ldquo;monopoly&rdquo; in this context is wrong, because, as I understand at, a monopoly <Col N="1062" /> is where one individual or one organisation controls the total, or almost the total, supply of any one commodity. In this case you have limestone on hundreds of holdings in every county, and if it were an economic proposition to quarry limestone and burn lime you would have a hundred people in any one county competing against one another, so that there is no question of a monopoly in this case.  The real difficulty at the root of this problem is that in a great many areas it does not pay to burn lime.  Lime is about £2 a ton.  That was the figure in my mind when I inquired what weight was in a barrel.  Assuming there would be about two cwt. in a barrel, that would work out at about 4/- a barrel.</P>

      <P>Lime is burnt solely for building purposes and for whitewashing houses.  As a fertiliser it is competing with other fertilisers, which are, taking their respective analyses. into account, cheaper at the money, and that is the real reason why much lime is not burnt.  That, of course. raises a very big problem.  You are trying to find some way of making the burning of lime an economical proposition again, but surely a Land Act is not an Act to deal with that?  It may be that it is essential, especially for-poorer districts where there is very sour, heathery laud to be reclaimed&mdash; and there are very large areas of that in the country&mdash;that it is a national problem to find some method of making lime available at an economic price to these areas.  But that is a very big problem.  It is, possibly a question of investigating the cheapest way of producing lime, investigating the cost of burning lime, investigating the relative <Col N="1063" /> merits of ground lime versus burnt lime, and investigating some possibility of getting alternatives to both of them.  In other words, it is a question of £.s.d., and you will not solve that problem by inserting in a Land Act a provision that limekilns be not vested in the tenant.</P>

If lime were a paying proposition, if there was a demand for lime at a price which would enable it to compete, say, with basic slag for certain purposes, lime would be burnt and sold. There is no question of a monopoly. There is limestone on a hundred farms in most counties, and there are old limekilns. If it were a paying proposition to quarry the stone, burn it and sell it, it would be done, but it is not done, because in nine cases out of ten it does not pay.

      <P>Possibly, but that is no good.  You want to make lime available for people who have no limestone on their holdings.  That is the problem. I am on the question of whether it pays to quarry limestone, burn it and make it available for that purpose.  I say that the real difficulty is that in a great many cases it does not pay.  It used to pay.  There were kilns all over the country, very few of which are working now.  Why?  Because of the competition of other fertilisers which are on the market at reasonable prices and which are just as useful for the purpose as lime would be, especially at the price.  You will not solve the problem merely by putting a ring fence around a limekiln and leaving it there in 'the hope that somebody will come along and exploit it.  Neither will you solve the problem, even if it were practicable, by saying that the Land Commission, or some other body, shall regulate the price for lime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>You will not solve that problem merely by enabling the Land <Col N="1065" /> Commission to take charge of limekilns and give anybody who wishes to quarry limestone for the purpose of making lime a chance to do so.  If that would solve the problem you would have practically every farmer in Ireland who had got a limestone quarry quarrying limestone and, making lime at present, but it is not done, simply because in a great many cases it would not pay, for the reasons I have given. There is real need for lime, especially in certain districts and for certain purposes. There is a good deal of loose talk on this question of the necessity for making lime available.  Except in very rare cases lime is not suitably for pastures.  The real need for lime is in very bad land, growing heather, that the farmer wishes to reclaim.  Lime is useful in the rotation, but no one that I know, except in very rare cases and for special purposes&mdash;it has been done in the case of some stud farms, to go back to the question we were discussing&mdash;puts lime on pasture land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People may do it on very peaty soils, but my own view is that there is no problem there, as fertilisers can be got more cheaply and of better value.  Lime is useful and is economic in certain areas where there is light heathery land reclaimed by tilling.  Limestone causes certain physical consequences in the soil, and is useful not so much for its chemical reactions as for the physical properties it brings to the soil.  There may be a need for limestone for that purpose in Donegal, but I suggest that the question should not be dealt with in a Land Bill.  It could not be dealt with in a Land Bill.  If it is to be dealt with it should be dealt with in a Bill that would be the result of close examination of the problem of where lime is to be found in such quantities that quarrying, transport and handling can be most economically done.  The section deals with land already purchased and vested.  The amendment suggests that the Land Commission should now reopen the vesting orders, examine and indicate certain limestone quarries in certain holdings, and give rights to other tenants to go in and quarry limestone there.  That would be a very serious thing to do.  Turbary is in an entirely different position. <Col N="1066" /> Turbary is useful for one purpose only. Until turbary is cut away, the land is quite useless for grazing or for any other purpose.  When the turbary is cut away the cut away bog is quite useful and can be reclaimed.  It can be made into good land.  Up to that the land, if you wish to call it land, is no use except for one purpose.  A hill may consist of limestone to the extent of one or one and a half acres. Are the neighbours to go in and quarry there where they like, do a certain amount of destruction and interfere with the holding, both by carting and quarrying on what may be a most valuable piece of land?  That hill may be real good land with limestone below the sub-soil.  That would be an impossible position.  The Deputy suggests that the Land Commission are to make regulations so that no undue damage is done.  That, would mean having a tremendous number of inspectors who would make constant inspections, and would lead to constant litigation and complaints by the owners that the land was being ruined.  It would mean new rights of way and constant litigation. What would it lead to?  What happens when an honest farmer goes and quarries limestone and brings it out?  What is he going to do with it?</P>

Let the question be fully considered and every aspect examined before it is done.  No one could agree that in 1927, after three-fourths of the land has been vested in the tenants, annuities fixed and large advances made on the security of the holdings, that these <Col N="1067" /> holdings should be inspected again, that the advances should be apportioned between one part of the holding, and the portion that contains limestone and that the latter portion be withdrawn, so to speak, from the tenant purchasers.  That would lead to a tremendous amount of insecurity and add another function to the Land Commission, entailing a very big staff as well as leading to a tremendous amount of trouble.  I could not accept the amendment. I appreciate the fact that there is need for lime in some districts. The real trouble is not to find the limestone but to make it economic to quarry, burn and sell lime.</P>

      <P>I quite agree with the Minister that it would not be possible to bring into a Land Bill regulations dealing with this matter.  What Deputy McGoldrick wants is to secure the right for a farmer to get lime from a quarry subject to the payment of a small royalty per ton to the owner of the land, similar to the right of a local authority to go in and get material for the roads.  At the present time if there is a quarry in the neighbourhood of a road the local authority can go in and take material required for the roads at threepence or fourpence a ton.  The Deputy is anxious that those who require lime for their own farms should be able to get it by their own labour and make lime in that way.  That is a problem that I agree will not be solved in this Bill.  In places like Donegal lime is badly needed for the land and it is a problem.</P>

      <P>I want to raise a couple of points on this Bill before it goes through the Report Stage.  One point refers to Section 7.  I want to be clear whether or not the holdings on which disused mills are situated are subject to the provisions of the 1923 Act.  Will they be subject to the terms of reduction just as in the case of holdings bought out under the 1923 Act? I have in mind a couple of cases where there are disused mills on farms.  The tenants have been withholding rents until the position is made clear.  The tenants were even prepared to go into court in order that the position might be clarified.  Now this section indicates that such a holding is to come within the provisions of the 1923 Act for the purpose of purchase.  Where the mill standing on a farm is a disused mill, that farm is held to be agricultural. The tenants of such holdings are anxious to know if their rents are to be subject to the same reduction as applied in the ease of their neighbours under the 1923 Act.  To me it seems it should be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that under the Land Act, 1923, that type of holding is in exactly the same position as any other holding.  Even if a holding is not returned as an ordinary agricultural holding until this date.  it gets all the benefits of the 1923 Act. In the same way, if a holding is brought in under this section it gets all the benefits of the 1923 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know the rights of the purchasing tenant under Section 36.  It is indicated in the section that the tenant is to have certain turbary rights and he shall not transfer any turbary rights he did not enjoy prior to the vesting.  There are many tenants in my constituency who <Col N="1069" /> have drawn my attention to the fact that their rentals were previously fixed by themselves and the landlord on the understanding that they were to have turbary.  In a people of cases landlords with very extensive estates put tenants in the position that they had to accept suggested rentals or their turbary rights would betaken away. These tenants saved their turf yearly for a nominal fee of 1/-.  Since the passing of the 1923 Act the landlord's agent set tenants their old plots and made them pay as high as 20/-, 25/- and 30/- for what they previously had at 1/- a year.</P>
      <P>The tenants contend that their rental was fixed at such a figure as compelled them to pay for bog as well as ordinary holding.  They agreed to pay a higher rent, because of the turbary rights, than otherwise they would have paid if the bog had not been included.  They bought out on the existing rents.  Since the passing of the Act their rent has been increased, and the reduction of 5/- in the £ on the rental did not cover the extra charge made by the landlord for bog.  Are we to understand that with the completion of the sale of the estate the tenant has a right to the turbary, that his payment of rent to the landlord for a number of years has given him a right, as the rent was fixed in such a manner as took into account the fact that turbary was included in the rental, which also covered the agricultural holding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no difficulty in a case where the turbary exists on the tenant's holding.  That is sold to him.  There is no misconception where the turbary is within the ambit of the tenant's holding.  You are left with the case where a tenant has a holding with turbary outside, but on another part of the estate.  Take the case of judicial tenants.  Their fair rent order sets out the whole position, and you cannot go behind it; it sets out that the land covers turbary or, alternatively, that the rent is confined to the holding. Where it covers turbary it sets out the area.  Where there is a fair rent order there is no dispute.  If on the face of the fair rent order it is indicated that <Col N="1070" /> the rent covers another division where there is turbary, there is no dispute. The tenant owns that turbary.  He gets his reduction in his rent, which covers the holding with turbary.  The rent includes not only the land where he lives but the turbary he has elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Take the case of the non-judicial and present tenant who has a holding of turbary elsewhere, and who pays' a rent of £20 a year simpliciter for his holding and turbary rights.  He goes on doing that for 20 years.  That is prima facie evidence that he has a tenancy in the turbary, that the rent covers it.  I could not imagine any agreement that disproves it.  The rent covers the turbary just as the fair rent order sets out that the rent covers such and such a piece of bog.  Take the case of a man who had a holding for £20 a year and turbary at 1/- a year up to 1916.  In that case be has no tenancy in regard to the turbary.  It is a, different take; it is not an agricultural holding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1916 the landlord raised the rent from l/- to 5/- a year for the turbary. If there was no further evidence than that, that is sufficient evidence, because the landlord raising the rent shows that it was not a tenancy.  In that state of affairs it would be quite clear that the rent of £20 a year that he was paying only covered the rent of the holding and not of the turbary.  He would get a reduction on that rent.  The standard annuity would be fixed by agreement. When he purchased his holding as a matter of course he would not purchase the turbary.  What would the position be then?  It would be the duty of the Land Commission to provide turbary for him.  They would have to charge him something small on his annuity for. that turbary.  But the fact that the rent was raised from 1/- a year to 5/- a year on the turbary would not make any difference.  The very moment the Land Commission took over the bog it became untenanted land and these terminable rights vanished.  There is no point whatever in the fact that the turbary rent, was raised from 1/- to 5/- a year.  The mere fact that there is turbary rent, separate from the holding shows that the turbary is not in with that holding but that it is a <Col N="1071" /> separate take.  It does not matter to the tenant that in 1915 or so his rent was raised from 1/- to 5/-.  It does matter very much that from 1915 to 1924 the tenant paid 4/- a year more for his turbary.  The Land Commission takes over the bog as untenanted land, divides it, gives this tenant a portion of the tunbary, puts a small price on it, and adds it to the annuity; but they did not increase or decrease the price by reason of the fact that the rent was first 1/- and afterwards 5/-.  They did not take into account good, bad or indifferent what rent he was paying the landlord.  They took into account that he bought this bog through the Land Commission, and they must consequently apportion some small portion of the purchase money for each division of the bog that they sell to the tenants.  It is really a question of fact, a question whether the turbary goes with the holding or not.  There is no difficulty in the case where the turbary is on the holding.  There is no difficulty in the case where the turbary is not in the holding, but where it is set out as turbary connected with the holding. There is no difficulty in the case of a non-judicial holding, but where there are two rents on a non-judicial holding, and where one of them is paid in respect of the bog, it is ample evidence that this is a different take and the right of turbary would not form a tenancy. The tenant will get turbary now for the first time with his holding, and I should say that the amount by which an acre, say, of bog will increase the annuity on his holding will be almost absolutely negligible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one aspect which the Minister has not made clear. He takes a man who has had turbary up to 1916.  I want him to take a man who, say, in 1909 or 1910, made an agreement with his landlord that the rent should be £10 a year, and that with that rent he was to have the use of an acre of bog to make his season's fuel.  He went there, and he paid 1/- a year, and that was continued from 1909 to 1924.  Now, the tenant's contention is that he would not agree to a rental of £10 a year but for the fact that there was an agreement between <Col N="1072" /> himself and his landlord that he was also to have the right to make turf. No one will contend that 1/- a year is the value or the rent for the right to make turf on an acre of bog.  In fact 1/- a year would not be the rent and there is no acceptance whatever on the part of the tenant that the £10 rental which he paid does not also include the rent for the bog as well as the rent of his holding.  In 1924 the landlord or his agent came in on the bog.  The passing of the 1923 Land Act reduced the tenant's rent by 5/- in the £, which would bring the annuity down to £7 10s.  Then you have the fact that but foy this bog the tenant's rent would be less than £10. or perhaps it would be £9 or £8 10s.  You would then have the position that he might have been paying at that time a rent of only £8 10s. or so but for the fact that he was to get the bog, and he would not have agreed to pay the £10 rent but on that understanding.  The Act of 1923 reduced his rent to £7 10s.  The landlord comes in then, and instead of taking his customary 1/- he puts on a rent of £1 or £1 10s., and this is paid by the tenant.  This happened in probably a couple of hundred cases in my county.  The tenant's contention is that he had a right in that bog, that he paid for that right in his rental for a number of years, and my own belief about it is also that he has a right.  I want to know whether in this case the Minister recognises this right or not.  If not the real rental on which the tenant should purchase should have been less than £10, and that is the position that the tenant takes up, and I believe legitimately.</P>

It is not like a judicial holding where he first gets a reduction of 25 per cent. and afterwards a reduction of 20 per cent.  This is a non-judicial tenancy; there is no fair rent fixed.  The standard annuity is fixed not with regard to the present rental all but is fixed as a fair annuity on the holding. If the rent of the holding has been too high in the past, then the annuity would be lowered, and that is the only way.</P>
      <P>It is very hard to see 5/- a year in a £10 rented holding.  In theory, unless the landlord and the tenant agree, the Land Commission come along, inspect the holding, not the turbary, and say: &ldquo;What is a fair standard annuity for that?&rdquo;  Then they place a figure on it.  That meets the net point.  So far as the turbary is concerned, he will get turbary.  The first duty of the Land Commission is to give him turbary, and the amount that he will pay for the turbary is not affected at all by reason of the fact that the landlord in 1924 charged him £1 instead of 1/- a year. The real grievance is&mdash;this is a fictitious rent on the holding because of the turbary.  If it is a non-judicial holding the Land Commission can deal with that.</P>

On the face of it, this would be set out as the rent for the holding, and it has to be accepted as such.  After all, in most cases, there would not be a difference of ten shillings a year on a holding of £10.  If it is judicial, you could not possibly re-open it.  If you re-opened one judicial rent you would have to re-open all of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of.  the section to add the following proviso:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Provided that nothing in this Act shall empower a railway company to provide, own, maintain, or run motor services in the City of Dublin and the Counties of Dublin, Wicklow and Kildare, which would directly or indirectly compete with the existing or future services of the tramways or omnibuses of the Dublin .  United Tramways Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is rather a wide amendment, but it is the principle which I really desire to submit for consideration.  The attitude of the Minister is, of course, all important.  The Tramways Company exercise powers which they derive from Acts of Parliament and Acts of the Oireachtas.  A Bill was quite recently before the House to enable the Company to run omnibuses.  The Tramways Company was exactly in the same position as the railway companies were in prior to the War.  During, the War, there were special enactments passed dealing with the railways.  Since the amalgamation, the number of railways in the Free State has been reduced to two.  The present Bill proposes to give power to the railway companies to run buses, which, up to a certain point, was previously considered tn be outside the scope of their operations. Under the ordinary conditions, railway companies desiring to run omnibuses would, in the usual course, have had to do what the Tramways Company did.  They would have had to promote Private Bill legislation and to go before a Joint Committee.  It would have been open to all and sundry to appear before the Committee and make their case.  If that were the condition of affairs, other statutory bodies <Col N="1075" /> like the Tramways Company would have had an opportunity to go before the Committee and put forward safe-guarding propositions for consideration.  This proteetion might take the form of embodying a clause in the Bill.  I raise this matter in a more general way.  I do not anticipate that the relationship between the railways and the tramways will reach such a point that they will cut one another's throats in respect of motor omnibus traffic.</P>
    <P>In this Bill, the Minister is taking powers to himself as well as conferring powers on the railway companies.  I tbok the liberty to say, in the first instance, that the conditions under which the Minister is seeking power for the railway companies to run omnibuses are distinctly onerous.  I also said that the running of buses by the railways should have some relation to the traffic on the railways.  I submit to the Minister that the services to be mapped out by the railway companies should be the subject of inquiry at which the people affected would have an opportunity of raising objection.</P>
    <P>The Minister could consider those objections before granting certain routes to the companies under this Bill. I should be glad if the Minister would consider the necessity for this amendment and regarding the Bill in the light of exceptional legislation, indicate his acceptance of the amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hewat must be under the impression that other Deputies in this House have very short memories.  He must think that they have forgotten many speeches he has made here protesting against the introduction and passage of certain measures calculated to create monopolies and destroy competition.  Here we have in cold language a clear and definite claim, without apology, for the creation of a monopoly in the interests of the Dublin United Tramways Company.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no getting away from that.  To me, Deputy Hewat's attitude is not quite intelligible in view of his recent speeches with regard to the Electricity (Supply) Bill. <Col N="1076" /> Deputy Hewat referred to the powers obtained by the Dublin United Tramways Company as the result of the passage of a certain measure through this House.  I do not think he would go so far as to claim that any powers given were calculated to hand over complete control of omnibus services to the Dublin United Tramways Company. The Dublin United Tramways Company as a result of these powers, instituted a bus service in and around Dublin. A number of buses were run from O'Connell Bridge to various parts of the city and county, on the north side. When they commenced to run these buses they fixed fares which I presume, in their opinion, were calculated to bring in a decent return and which, at the same time, would not be regarded as excessive.  What has happened recently? As the result of growing competition on the north side of the city by the institution of privately-owned bus services, the Tramways Company have reduced their fares by twenty-five per cent. in some cases and even by fifty per cent. in others.  Where they have not agreed to an actual reduction in fare, they have extended the mileage for the old fare.  Does Deputy Hewat deny this?  If not, for what purpose have the fares been reduced?  Were the original fares excessive?  Is that the inference that is to be drawn from the recent reductions of twenty-five per cent. and fifty per cent.?  I think I can fairly reasonably assume that the real reason for the reduction of these fares is to cut out the cut-throat competition with which the Dublin United Tramways Company's bus services is faced on the north side of the city. While they have agreed to these reductions on the north side, there has been no reduction whatever in the bus fares on the south side.  There was, of course, no necessity for a reduction, because there are no competitive services on that side of the city.  I do not think that a monopoly in the hands of the Dublin United Tramways Company is any worse, from the point of view of the passenger or the travelling public, than it would be if given to a railway company.  But there is here a definite. claim by Deputy Hewat, who has protested against the creation of monopolies, for a monopoly on behalf of a certain <Col N="1077" /> company.  I was anxious to hear some better case made for this amendment than was put forward by Deputy Hewat.  I should like to hear from the Deputy the reasons for the recent reduction in bus fares on the north side of the city.</P>
      <P>It would be very interesting to hear why the Company have gone out of their way to reduce fares which, in the first instance, had been put into operation after fair and careful consideration. The Dublin United Tramways Company will still retain far greater powers and privileges in regard to running bus services than the railway company will have under the section of the Bill as drafted here.  If the railway company get powers and if the routes are approved in areas where the Dublin United Tramways Company is already operating the railway company will be subject to maximum fares, whereas the Tramways Company will not be under any restriction whatever in regard to bus services.  Therefore, the Tramways Company will have privileges not enjoyed by the railway company if and when the railway company take advantage of the powers conferred on them by the Bill.</P>

      <P>I think the remarks made by Deputy Davin should really be taken in conjunction with the amendment in Deputy Baxter's name. I think Deputy Davin should have carried his arguments a little further, and if he had done so he would have seen that his point of view is not very far away from the point of view lying behind Deputy Hewat's remarks, because <Col N="1078" /> the public interest is involved in this matter in other ways besides the fare charged.  Many things have to be, or should be, considered before leave is given for the running of a motor bus service along any particular route. There is the question as to what extent motor-services are already running there and as to whether that particular route can really carry further motor services without real detriment to the public interest.  There is this question as to whether there is a demand for the motor service, as to whether the public need it or not, and as to whether it is likely to do good or not.  I think there is some point in Deputy Hewat's suggestion that the railway company should be subject to restrictions similar to those imposed on other public bodies who have got this leave, that is to say, that leave should be given only after an inquiry is held by the Minister and the Minister has satisfied himself on these questions.</P>

Whatever Deputy Thrift said as properly applicable to the demand made by the railway companies now for the running of a motor bus service, should have applied also to the running of the Dublin United Tramways Company's bus service&mdash;that before the Dublin United Tramways got leave to run buses at all there should have been a public inquiry as to whether the road could stand up to the extra buses they would put on them.</P>

      <P>I do not know what was the intention of the Act, but I know that I had the Act interpreted recently when I wanted to enforce it against the Dublin United Tramways Company on a particular occasion, and I was told that the interpretation really meant this: that the Tramways <Col N="1079" /> Company had been given leave to run buses in certain counties&mdash;the city and county of Dublin and the counties of Wicklow and Kildare&mdash;and all the Minister for Local Government can do if the company wants to run buses between two points, A and B, is to say &ldquo;I prefer you should not go that way but that you should go some other way.&rdquo;  That is the beginning and the end of the Minister's powers in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  When I first looked at this amendment I regarded it as a jocose amendment, coming as it does from Deputy Hewat, who is an apostle of competition, and who recently, on the Second Reading of this Bill, said he was against the Railways Act because it took away competition, which everybody knows was not there.  He was so anxious for competition that he was prepared to reject a measure because it took away competition that did not exist.  He now comes along with a proviso not exactly giving a monopoly to the Dublin United Tramways Company with regard to buses, but certainly saying that if there is going to be any running of such services it is to be confined to bus owners of the individual type and the Dublin United Tramways Company &mdash;that is, that the Company and these bus owners are to share the monopoly. The one thing to be provided is that the railway company shall not go in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you take the terms of the Preamble under which the Dublin United Tramways Company were granted leave to run bus services yon will find that there are three &ldquo;whereas&rdquo; clauses.  The <Col N="1080" /> third clause is as follows: &ldquo;Whereas, owing to the increased demand for passenger transport in the city and county of Dublin and the counties of Wicklow and Kildare, it is in the public interest that such company be empowered to provide, maintain and run omnibuses.&rdquo;  I wonder is Deputy Hewat insisting now, that there will be no further demand for passenger transport in these counties, but that if there is any further demand the railway company shall not have power to come in and look for it?  The Deputy has also spoken of Private Bill legislation, and the trouble and expense which the Tramways Company had to go to in order to achieve the powers they got under their Private Bill.  Of course they had to proceed by Private Bill legislation, because they were going for the benefit of a particular company. If they had gone for all tramway services. that could have been done by way of Government legislation, or if we had been moving in the Dáil to grant individual powers to one railway company this would have been a Private Bill or a Bill to which Private Bill procedure would have been applicable.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is now seeking by this wide amendment to give the Dublin Tramways Company powers which they did not look for in their own Bill, powers to prevent other people entering upon road services, powers which they did not ask for, presumably, because they believed that they Would not get them.  Now, by a public Bill they want to get these powers which they did not look for, powers to be given to an individual company and not to all tramway companies that might hereafter get power to run buses. It seems to me that this is an amendment that no one could tolerate.  The Tramways Company got leave to run buses because bus competition was doing the tramways harm.  Now the railway company are looking for the same powers which the Tramways Company sought on the same ground, namely, that bus competition is doing the railways harm.</P>
    <P>How a Deputy who stood for the principle that the Tramways Company should be given power to run buses <Col N="1081" /> because buses were causing the Tramways Company to lose, can stand for opposing a similar application on behalf of the railway companies I cannot understand, particularly when it is realised that the Tramways Company are first, by virtue of their tramway powers, and secondly and more considerably, by their increased powers in regard to buses, entering into competition with railways.  I take the case of Howth, Dalkey, and Malahide, where the buses enter into serious competition with the railway companies, and no one can argue that the railway companies had not in these areas a very good service.</P>
    <P>In regard to Deputy Baxter's proposal, if it had been previously in operation in regard to the tram services, or if the Minister for Local Govemment had been able to take into consideration, not only: ordinary road matters, but the services already there, the tramway bus service would never have been allowed to run to Malahide. Deputy Davin spoke of the lowering of bus fares on the north side of Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any power in the Tramways Company's Bill that would prevent the Company, from again raising the fares which are now reduced to the original rate, or must they get the sanction of the Minister?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I certainly saw on the south side of the city recently particulars of services instituted by the Tramways Company.  It was not so much a matter of fares, but in every particular it was undoubtedly the sort of service which, if Deputy Baxter had his way, and if his amendment were carried, would never have been allowed to be put on.  These are things that may have to be considered later on in a general transport measure.  Deputy Hewat stated that restrictions were being put on the railways in this Bill which he believed would be unworkable.  His proposal, however, is to make these restrictions <Col N="1082" /> more onerous and, possibly, more unworkable.  The Bill is distinctly workable, and the effect of the amendment would mean a tremendous restriction on the railway companies, one that would take away a great deal from the value of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I must recognise, and I hope the Dáil will recognise, that when I put down this amendment I exhibited a great deal of moral courage in putting myself up as a cockshot for both the Minister and Deputy Davin.  I would like to say that so far as I am concerned, and so far as the Tramways Company are concerned, we are always open to receive the criticism of Deputy Davin or anybody else.  I would like to explore a little the real principle that underlies this matter.  It was my object in putting down the amendment to consider the effect of Private Bill legislation in this House, as we have had it. Up to the present, I think, Private Bill legislation, not through any fault of machinery and, certainly, not through any fault of the working of the Committees, has been a little bit unfortunate. Relatively few Bills have come before the Private Bill Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first of them was, I think, the Liffey Bill, a very contentious measure. After its inception, and after a lot of money was spent on the three Private Bills that were put forward, the State came in and introduced a Bill which was really a continuation of the Liffey exploration.  The whole procedure finally proved abortive.  I am not wishing to criticise that in any way.  The Tramways Company promoted two Bills, one a Motor Bus Bill and the other a Bill which is still before the House, namely, that in connection with the Lucan extension.  My only feeling about this is that the statutory authorities under Private Bill legislation should have a defined and distinct qualification.  I contend that the railway companies and the Tramways Company are on the same footing so far as their constitution is concerned, and when we talk about public legislation we must recognise that there are more railways than one.  Prior to the introduction of this class of Government measure the ordinary procedure would have been by Private Bill legislation. <Col N="1083" /> That is to say, individual companies, where they required the necessary authority to enable them to perform certain services, would have had to come and proceed by way of Private Bill legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister explained, and rightly explained, that this is a general Act, but it is a general Act which avoids the necessity for an individual company getting a private statutory Act and having it examined before a committee. I think I should apologise for bringing this amendment before the Dáil, not necessarily as regards the substance of it, but it might very easily be said that it is not within the purview of a Deputy of this House to raise a matter in which he is personally interested.  There is no disguise as far as this is concerned, but I do say that it is not in connection with my position as a director of the Tramways Company, but in my position as a Deputy, that I have tried to clear up this point.  It is in the best interests that general public legislation should supplement what was ordinarily Private Bill legislation?  Of course, one must recognise that State legislation overrides everything else.  I would not like it to be generally thought that public Acts, unless it was absolutely necessary to do so, would override private Acts.  The Minister has taken the opportunity of saying certain things about the Tramways Company. As far as I am concerned, I rake what the Minister has said, and Deputy Davin's criticism, without any comment, unless they want me to comment on what they have said, because it is not for me to stand up here as a representative of the Tramways Company to justify their acts or otherwise. I am quite open, if it is the wish of the House, to answer any criticism.  As far as any action of the Tramways Company is concerned I am quite willing to do so, but I do not think I would be justified in entering into a discussion on that matter, and taking up the position of a defendant and other Deputies taking up the position of accusers.</P>

      <P>This amendment has given me considerable food for thought.  It is an endeavour to amend here, in a public Bill which deals with the railways of the country generally, and as a measure of public policy the Act of a private company, viz., the Dublin United Tramways Company Act which enables the Tramways Company to run omnibuses.  In other words, it is Deputy Hewat himself, by way of his amendment, who is seeking to do the thing to which he takes exception. I was in doubt as to whether the amendment should be put from the Chair at all.  If the Deputy bad asked me for a suggestion I would have suggested that he should delete the words &ldquo;The Dublin United Tramways Company.&rdquo; and insert words such as &ldquo;Any company enjoying statutory powers,&rdquo; which would have made it general and put the amendment in line with the Bill. There is nothing in this Bill which in any way appears to interfere with the private rights guaranteed by statute to the Dublin United Tramways Company and had there been any such interference, a variation in the procedure adopted in connection with this Bill would have been rendered necessary. Under their private Act the Company enjoy no rights and are not protected in any way against competition.</P>

      <P>Before approving of any route whatsoever on which a motor service exists at the date of the passing of this Act the Minister shall take into consideration the efficiency of and facilities afforded by the existing service, the amount of traffic conveyed and the area to be served by the proposed route.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hewat would like to prevent any service that would directly or indirectly compete with existing services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that, in passing the Second Stage of this Bill, we took up the attitude that there was to be any such thing as competition over a route where there was an existing service. What we have to aim at is to cultivate healthy competition.  If the Minister has taken what may be called rather extraordinary powers under this Bill in the matter of restricting railway companies as to what they may or may not do, I suppose that is due to the fact that individuals and companies adopt methods and pursue policies which, while they may be in their own interests, are in conflict with the interests of the State.  When I raised this matter on the Second Reading I considered that as regards the motor services we have at present in a few areas of the country that we must have an extension of them all over the-country in a short time, and not that we should exclude the railway companies or anybody else prepared to engage in this service.  It is right that we should recognise that a service should be put on a route when necessary <Col N="1087" /> in the interests of the citizens. The Minister is being given power to decide whether or not the railway companies shall open up new routes or go on given routes and the reason for that is that we have a feeling that it is necessary to decide whether or not it is good that the railway companies in the interests of the State should put on buses and go on a particular route.</P>
    <P>If we are going to create under this Bill extra services on existing routes then we ought to be satisfied that there is a necessity for them, that they are essential in the interests of the people living in these areas and that there is sufficient traffic to justify these services. When I say in this amendment that the Minister, before approving of a route, shall take into consideration the efficiency and facilities afforded by the existing services, I feel that he must examine the services given at present.</P>
    <P>That examination will undoubtedly take the form of discovering whether or not the people in a particular area are being well served, whether or not there are complaints or causes for complaint, and if the traffic conveyed is of such a volume as to justify another service being put on that route.  If that provision be not made it is possible the railway companies would go into competition with the few individuals who have put buses on certain routes and who are giving a satisfactory service, at a reasonable figure, to the community. Because of the fact that these bus services, to some extent at least, come into competition with the railway companies, there must be the very natural desire that the railway companies would do what they can to remove them as competitors.  They will undoubtedly do all they can to get back to the position that existed before bus services were brought into existence; a position to enable them to monopolise all the traffic that is going.  From the point of view of the development of bus services throughout the country, that undoubtedly would be a very serious matter.  From the point of view of the work that the citizen has to do in the State it would be uneconomic, because some of those routes could <Col N="1088" /> not support two bus services.  In fact, they can only maintain one economically. We would be simply putting men who have put their capital into these bus services, and who have shown considerable enterprise by so doing, into a very difficult position.  We would be reducing the value of and, in some cases destroying, their capital, became we know that the owners, of some of the bus services in existence at the moment could not go into competition with a railway company or a big combine, particularly if the railway companies were prepared to go out and spend money to put their competitors out of existence.  Of course, a point against that is that if the railway companies fix a fare they must adhere to it.  I feel that what I aim at will be achieved by the acceptance of this amendment.  I hope that the amendment will have the support of Deputy Good and Deputy Hewat, because the putting of it into operation would serve their purpose even in Dublin city and county.  If the conditions that prevail do not demand it there is no reason whatever why an additional motor service should be put on.  Both men and money would be better employed in the development of some other line of business, a line of business that would be economical from the point of view of the investment of capital and the service that men would give. If this traffic is to develop, as it will, then above all things we should be careful to see that money is not going to, be spent foolishly and that we are not going to open up services not likely to be useful.  The matter must be handled in such a way as to justify individuals or even companies in spending money to open up these services.</P>
    <P>Above all, we must keep in view that the services given will be good and satisfactory from the point of view of the citizens of the State.  Where any service is doing good to the citizens at the present time I think the Minister could make careful inquiries before he decides that over such routes another service be put on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not seek and I have no ambition to glorify the actions of the railway company in regard to the matters complained of by Deputy <Col N="1089" /> Baxter.  I think, however, that the acceptance of the amendment would not achieve the object which the Deputy seeks to attain.  The amendment, in my opinion, is more like a clause that might be inserted in a general transport Bill regulating the whole system of road, rail and canal transport rather than one that should be inserted in a Bill of this type.  If passed, and if, the necessary discretion be given to the Minister and used by him, the only thing that it can attain&mdash;this, of course, would be meeting the intentions of Deputy Baxter&mdash; would be to prevent the railway companies from instituting bus services on roads or routes where there are already sufficient transport facilities.  But is Deputy Baxter not aware that under existing conditions there is nothing to prevent, in the case of routes at present served with a sufficient supply of transport facilities, other private bus services from coming along and, so to speak, cutting the throat of the service already in existence?  How does Deputy Baxter propose to stop that kind of thing? His speech is only another indication of the necessity for the Government giving careful consideration to the regulation of transport as a whole, and preparing legislation which will aim at a service being given by all the different forms of transport in their own proper way to the community as a whole. They will have to define the relation of the railway to the roads and canals without in any way giving the railway powers that would injure the community. I am sure Deputy Baxter is aware that in certain areas even in the City and County of Dublin there are already transport facilities of a cut-throat nature, and there is nothing whatsoever in any Act of this House or any power the Minister has to prevent transport facilities being doubled or trebled in that area.  I would like him to refer me to the clause of any particular Act which prevents any private bus company being formed and putting services on roads already supplied with transport facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His amendment will only prevent the railway company from doing what anybody else can do.  Deputy Baxter refers to the amount of capital invested in bus services throughout the country.  I <Col N="1090" /> wonder does he put a greater value on capital invested by Irishmen in Irish concerns than on capital invested in bus services which eventually finds its way out of the country.  All the motor buses in this country, including the parts which keep them in motion, are imported.  In many cases a certain amount of the money subscribed for those bus services is foreign capital.  I am not sure to what extent that exists but we must balance one against the other.  Whatever preference has got to be given it should be given to Irishmen who invest in an Irish concern.  I believe, unless some carefully considered legislation is introduced in the near future, this cut-throat competition will go on in such a way that in the end drastic action will have to be taken, which will have a greater destructive effect on the capital invested than if that action were taken at present.  Some stop will have to be put to that cut-throat; competition, and some authority will have to be set up under legislation to be introduced in future which will give powers to that body to make regulations.</P>
    <P>On the general question of transport facilities, rates and everything else, I do not want to glorify the position of the railway company, and I would not stand for many of the things they have done.  I know there are many things which, if the Company had done them, would have saved them from the position in which they are to-day, but I do not want to see railway companies driven out of action in this country, and thousands of men thrown out of work in order that preference might be given to people who establish private bus services, and place on the roads here buses made in other countries under conditions not as good as workmen have in the railways in this country.  Railways here give employment to about 28,000 men.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the remarks Deputy Davin used about this is a remark I shall have to use about pretty nearly every amendment in the paper, that is, that they are amendments more appropriate to a general transport measure than one which is simply aiming at removing, from a particular <Col N="1091" /> type of company, a disability which is on it at the moment, and which it is thought should not be on it. There are quite a number of these amendments which seek to impose restrictions upon the railway companies entering on the road that are not on any of their competitors.  If sought to be imposed on everybody together they would have to be considered on their merits, but I submit they are out of place in a measure of this sort.  Deputy Davin's other remark, the soundest remark in opposition to Deputy Baxter's amendment, is that Deputy Baxter can only preclude the railway company from opening upon a road which Deputy Baxter says cannot bear a service in addition to those already there, but the Deputy's. amendment will not prevent, as Deputy Davin pointed out, some three or more bus companies starting three or four more additional services.  If the Deputy's amendment was to have some sort of regulation on all and sundry routes, even that amendment could not be moved, because the Bill is not before us, and it would be out of order in this Bill.  I submit it is unfair to put restrictions on a railway company.  I myself seek to put restrictions on a railway company seeking to run bus services and some people consider those restrictions will make the whole Bill unworkable, and that they will be so onerous that, as one Deputy phrased it, the gift given to the railway companies will prove dangerous to them and not an advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter Deputy Baxter spoke of would arise for consideration and it would have to be considered, but not with his conclusion, because at least the final decision cannot be on the point raised by the Deputy&mdash;Can an area or route bear another service? One may see three services going on at a particular time, but competition will drive out some.  If there are two operating at the moment and there is an additional one put on, unless there is some extension of traffic over that route the three will not last. Some one or other must go, and it is a matter of which can give the best public service.  The railway has imposed on it the restrictions which this Bill <Col N="1092" /> seeks to impose on it&mdash;the maximum rate, the rate once fixed not to be raised without the approval of the Minister, and a service put on not to be withdrawn or discontinued or even minimised without approval.  If the railway company under these restrictions can give the best service, I think it should be allowed to give it, no matter who was there before it.  I do think, however, that the points the Deputy has put down in his amendment are points that will have to betaken into consideration.  If, for instance, in considering them it appeared that the railway company was not likely to give a better service, and in fact could not stand the competition under the restrictions imposed on it, then approval would not be granted, because it is part of my duty to see that railway revenue is not prejudiced by the railway seeking to enter into competition which is injudicious and which it could not stand.</P>
    <P>I have another objection to the amendment.  I have been often warned by the parliamentary draftsman in regard to measures to be very careful about setting out a list of things that have to be considered, because there is a legal rule that the inclusion of certain things of a general nature is to be interpreted as the exclusion of everything else, and this might suffer that fate.  I say that the things referred to by the Deputy are ones that would ordinarily tall for consideration with a variety of other things, and if the Deputy is only concerned to get these matters brought forward, I think this will meet him to a certain extent.  I had an opportunity since the Second Reading of meeting the Motor Bus and Coach Owners' Association.  We had a discussion in which a number of matters were thrashed out, and it seemed at one time as if we could have come to an agreement that would be satisfactory to all the interests.  It simply has been found impossible to draft the rather larger type of amendment that at one time I desired, but they desired one thing, on which I was prepared to meet them, and it would meet Deputy Baxter to a certain extent.  I am not now pretending to quote the section as it would finally appear, but I am prepared to insert something of this type: <Col N="1093" /> That where a route on which a railway company proposes to run a road motor service for the conveyance of passengers is, in the opinion of the Minister, substantially the same, in whole or in part, as a route on which a road motor service for the conveyance of passengers has been run by some other person, the Minister shall not approve of such route until he has given notice thereof to such other person and has considered the representations, if any, made by such other person.</P>
    <P>That does not get the Deputy the full length.  It gets him really the full length of his amendment as phrased, but it does not get him the full length of his intentions.  It only gives security to this extent&mdash;that these would be the further points obviously that somebody else occupying the route would raise: the area to be served, traffic that is likely to be had for passengers and other services, and the existing service. It will get consideration for those items, because they will be raised by the interested parties&mdash;the opposition parties, the parties already there.  As I say, it goes the full length of the amendment, as phrased, because the amendment as phrased does not preclude me, after taking into consideration these things, from approving the route.  It only says that the Minister shall take into consideration various things.  That other amendment which was prepared to bring in after meeting the Motor Bus and Coach Owners' Association would, I think, meet that particular point, that it will give security to this extent, that the other people previously occupying the route would naturally raise those points which the Deputy has in mind: service the sufficiency of it the area to be served, and whether there is likely to be extra traffic which another service would be necessary for.</P>
    <P>I have one difficulty about that proposed amendment, which, of course, will appear in a regular form on the next stage, and that is that it is difficult to give notice to every other person that may be on the route.  There with have to be some limitation on that &mdash;that one could not bind oneself to give notice to every hackney driver <Col N="1094" /> who ran over that particular area. There will have to be some limitation with regard to a company or a particular reasonable type of service.  Of course I can see to that later.  That will meet the Deputy to a certain extent. I do not know that it goes the whole length of his amendment, but it meets it, I think, to the only extent which is reasonable, because it gives the other people the right to make representations and be heard, and thereafter there is still leave to approve the route if it seems that the railway company could offer the public the best service, despite all the restrictions which the railway company are being put under.</P>

      <P>The Minister has practically met what I wanted.  I had no intention that it would be mandatory on the Minister to refuse the railway company, because I recognise that that would perhaps be giving a monopoly to an existing service.  I say that because I believe that it would be possible for a railway company to come in on a route in competition with an existing service, and they would do it where the ordinary bus owner or even a limited company would not take the chance of going in.  We have not very many of those services, taking the country as a whole.  I know most about a service that has had pretty serious reactions on the traffic of the railway arid which has brought the first-class fares down from almost £2 to 15s.</P>

      <P>I can point out in reply to Deputy Davin that I have not proposed to restrict other individuals coming in on that route, but, as Deputy Davin knows well, individuals will not be prepared to come in and invest capital and lose money.  I have no doubt whatever that it would pay the railway company to put some of the existing services out of existence.  It would not pay the public.  That is what I am trying to safeguard, and I am satisfied that no individual or half-dozen individuals, will invest capital in a bus service and lose money on the service in the hope of putting others down, because it would take a very considerable amount of capital, and they are not going to take the chance.  They must make it pay.  If they put one company out of existence, after some time somebody else may come on.  It is a difficult thing tackling a railway company.</P>

If they failed to develop certain routes that they had a reasonable expectation of developing they should be allowed to withdraw the services.</P>

It is an amendment of which notice should be given in the ordinary way, so that Deputies would have an opportunity of considering it after it had been drafted.  Of course, the House can decide what it likes; it is not a point that I can give any assistance on one way or another, but it breaks across the framework of the Bill as it stands, giving the railways certain powers and by certain restrictions imposed preventing them having a monopoly detrimental to the public.

It is not a jurisdiction that I should care to exercise. I think there will have to be some body rather more judicial in nature. It might be a matter for the Railway Tribunal to decide, only that I would prefer to keep the Railway Tribunal <Col N="1097" /> out of the matter.

      <P>It is proposed in sub-section (2) of Sections that the Minister should consult with the Minister for Local Government before approving of a route.  On the Second Reading I raised the question that the local authorities should be consulted, and I suggested that to the Minister.  It is not obligatory on the Minister to accept the view of the local authorities.  I suggest that he might, as an act of courtesy, consult the local authorities, who will be generally responsible for the maintenance of the roads.  It may be that the mention of consultation with the Minister for Local Government and Public Health may mean, in reality, consultation with the local authorities, and if that is so it would be all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Behind all this there is the division of functions with regard to road matters as they will be hereafter if this Bill goes through; that is to say, where it is a matter of upkeep of roads, dangerous corners, safety of life long particular roads, that always has been, and will be, a matter for the Minister for Local Government. He has at his service the Roads Advisory Committee, and also the local authorities.  I understand that, with the Dublin Tramways service, the practice has been to consult the Roads Advisory Committee or, more frequently, the local authority.  Of course, it is laid down in the Tramways Company's Private Bill that there should be such consultation with the local interests, and a public inquiry, if deemed necessary.  It is always thought that the Minister for Local Government would exercise his own discretion, but <Col N="1098" /> he would, presumably, if it seemed to him that there were a tremendous number of services loaded on to particular roads, consult the local authority.  That in no way interferes with the present functions discharged by the Minister for Local Government.  The only thing is that the Minister, for Local Government will not be consulted on the purely railway side.  That will be for me.  This is the way to get the combined view.  In the end it will be for the Minister for Local Government to call the attention of the local authorities to the fact that additional services may come in, and that the roads may be torn up to such an extent that extra expenditure will be involved on the local authority.  In that case it is for the local authorities to take the initiative and ask the Minister to close the roads to traffic of that particular type. That is the reason the Minister for Local Government was put in, so that he can get into consultation with the local authorities, and the local authorities may take the initiative and ask that a road or a series of roads be closed to traffic of a particular kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not the only point that has been raised.  There were two points on Second Reading.  Deputy Thrift raised the question of the reduction of a service which did not amount to a withdrawal of the service, or to a reduction in the frequency of the running. In reply I said I thought the Bill allowed, at least, for attention being paid to that.  I am advised that is the case.  Under sub-section (2) there will be submitted the service and the particulars of the nature of the service, and that can be approved with or without modifications.  I am advised it would be possible to advert to and stop such an alteration in the frequency of the service as would amount to a breach of the conditions on which the service was first instituted.  But, naturally, one would not take the same view of such a thing as, say, an alteration of the time of running to suit the railway time table, and so on.  But a reduction bringing it to a point that would really amount to withdrawal of the service can be attended to as the Bill stands. There was a second point put by Deputy Magennis about bringing in the <Col N="1099" /> Roads Advisory Committee: I am not moving to insert anything at the moment because it is left here to the discretion of the Minister for Local Government as to whether he will consult. the Roads Advisory Committee or the local authority in the case of a service proposed to be allowed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill lays it down that railway companies should get the power to run buses.  It strikes me that as far as the routes are concerned the ordinary development of a route generally arises from a request of the locality to have a service.  If the railway company is to do useful work in that direction it is a difficult thing to ask them to put on a route and so far restrict them that they cannot exercise their judgment as to its continuance. If this is going to be of practical use to the railway companies they must have reasonable latitude.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the amendment to be brought in, on Report Stage, if it deals with that question, will probably be satisfactory. I only press that the new motor service must have a reasonable amount of discretion, and if a route is a failure it would be a very onerous thing to compel the railway company to continue a service which does not justify its existence. The other side of the question, so far as the railways are concerned, is the defensive side.  If the railway company is to use its powers by using motors in defence of the railway traffic the question is, whether the House would not recognise that situation and give them a great deal more liberty than is contemplated in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Under certain circumstances I think the point raised by Deputy Gorey is of some importance.  I am not quite sure if he was thinking of what I had in mind.  I imagine that it would be good policy on the part of the railway company, when this Bill becomes law to establish bus services in areas of the country where there is likely to be an influx of tourists, and where there is not at present a good <Col N="1100" /> service, for the accommodation of visitors. A good case could be made to the Minister, that it might be unjust to compel a railway company to run bus services all the year round, when there would be a necessity for such services only for six out of the twelve months. I think the wording that Deputy Gorey suggested would meet a case of that kind.  If that were not accepted it would be a serious bar to the railway company using bus services.</P>
      <P>I would like the railway company to establish bus services in parts where there are now no good transport services, to act as feeders to the railways. I put that point before the Minister, so that he may see the injustice that would be imposed on the railway company if it were compelled to carry on a bus service all the year when there would be only traffic for about six months.</P>

      <P>This will arise later on the amendment that Deputy Gorey is bringing forward.  I am not bringing it forward.  On Deputy Davin's point I think it would be possible under this Bill for the railway company to propose a service for July, August and September every year, and the withdrawal of that service at the end of September would not be a withdrawal prevented by the withdrawal section.  In other words, if there was a demand for a particular route which is shown, obviously, to be a summer months' route all that would be necessary, I think, would be for the railway company not to go in for a particular year and then stop.  That would have to be prevented.  If they said &ldquo;We want to open that route for particular months&rdquo; and made a case that it was obviously an almost entirely summer traffic route, I am not sure that that could not be considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it could be considered but I wanted to get the view of the Minister as to whether he would insist on the continuance of the service when there would not be sufficient traffic to warrant it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There would have to be an insistence to continue it for July, August and September every <Col N="1101" /> year but not beyond September.  Let me point out that as that gives an opportunity for using the plea of summer traffic only in order to do out bus services that would be running the whole year round, it would have to be rather critically considered.  That will arise again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 4, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  There shall be established for the purposes of this Act a committee (hereinafter called &ldquo;the Committee&rdquo;) styled the Road Motor Services Advisory Committee consisting of nine members, all of whom shall be appointed by the Minister with a view, as regards three such members, to their being representatives of industrial and commercial interests, and as regards three other such members, to their being representatives of the interests of proprietors of road motor services other than railway companies, and as regards three other such members, to their being representatives of the interests of labour.</P>
      <P>(2)  Each member of the Committee shall be appointed for such term not exceeding three years from the date of his appointment as the Minister at the time of his appointment shall determine and shall then retire but shall be eligible for re-appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Second Reading discussion I expressed the view, but I do not know if it was accepted by the Minister from the reply he gave, that application for the approval of services over certain routes could only get a casual consideration by the Minister, and that it would be in the interests of all concerned if the Minister had at his disposal some advisory body such as that referred to in the amendment.  I am not standing hard and fast by the wording of the amendment, but I suggest it pending the setting up of some statutory authority under the Bill which, I hope, will be done by the present or some future Government.  Under the terms of the Bill&mdash;at any rate for a <Col N="1102" /> temporary period&mdash;some such body would be useful.  If the amendment docs not meet with the Minister's approval I hope he will say whether the setting up of some body of the type referred to will be considered, giving representation to industrial and commercial interests, representatives of the proprietors of road motor services and any application coming from the railway company, and from those interested in other services, so that they would be carefully considered and criticised before being forwarded to the Minister.</P>

      <P>However desirable the amendment might be, does the Minister's remark on a previous occasion apply to this, that it really does not apply to the Bill?  I think a discussion on this matter might be very enlightening and might help to show what could be done to assist in solving the traffic problem.  I do not see how a committee such as is suggested could be set up under the scope of the Bill.  I think Deputy Davin recognises that all sorts of traffic has to be dealt with, and that this Bill only deals with a particular service.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's view, I believe, is that there should be some body in controlling authority over the transport services in the State.  I think that is something like that the Deputy had in mind.  My feeling is that even if this Bill were the place for the amendment, which is a debateable question, it would be a hindrance to the setting up of a body that would operate to direct <Col N="1103" /> the transport services of the State and manage them in a more economical fashion than they are managed at present. I believe if the intention is to have a Board of Transport in existence it is better to leave things as they are, without any directing authority, until such conditions arise that it is obvious to everyone the problem has to be tackled and solved.  I question very much the utility of the proposed Committee. While practically every interest is mentioned, there is no mention of the ratepayers, who will have to find a very big, proportion of the money that will have to be raised for the maintenance of the roads for these services.</P>

      <P>Yes, but I cannot understand the Deputy's remark that a general Transport Bill will have to repeal this.  It will not.  It will simply impose general regulations with which the railway traffic will have to fit in, whether on road or on rail, just the same as any other traffic on road. But the Deputy has taken away a certain amount of the argument that I was going to use by telling me that ha was not confining himself to the wording of the amendment, and Deputy Hewat has also done the same; that is to say, that this railway jsection ought to be brought in on a general Transport Bill and not on this.  Why should we have a committee to deal with a particular road service to be instituted by the railway company and not to deal with every other road service?  If I reversed the position and talked about the setting up of a committee to deal with road services other than <Col N="1104" /> those run under the auspices of the railway company, and proposed a committee to consist of three representatives of the railway company, three representatives of railway labour, and three representatives of industrial and commercial interests, I wonder if the bus owners would think it a fair committee? Look at this proposed committee. It is to be a committee to consider road transport under the auspices of the railway company.</P>

I do think that the main objection to his is that it is really not an amendment for this Bill at all; it is an amendment to deal with whatever general Transport Act there may afterwards be.  Incidentally, too, it has to be remarked, relating it back to Section 3, that it would only have to do with the routes; it would have nothing to do with the charges, nothing to do with the withdrawal of a service, and nothing to do with the raising from the actual fare at which it started to some other, so that it would have very limited activities.  I suggest that this is not a body you could set up at this time at all.  If any body were to be set up I would have to proceed to argue as to the different parties to be represented.

I think there is something to be said for the idea of a permanent body to sanction discontinuance. I am not quite sure that this is very consistent, because an earlier section says that the Minister has to give leave, and I do not know if you could have one person giving leave for the service and a separate body sanctioning discontinuance.</P>

      <P>That was really the point to which I was going to take exception, but I presume if Deputy Cooper were here he would answer me: &ldquo;Put the Railway Tribunal in the approval section.&rdquo;  Personally, I would be very glad were this burden shifted to somebody else, and I think any Minister would have the same feeling, but I would much prefer to get some committee such as Deputy Davin spoke of rather than the Railway Tribunal, because, at any rate in setting out to appoint that committee you could appoint it with a view to the work that lay before it, whereas the Railway Tribunal has already been instituted, and none of the members was picked with even the most indirect idea that he would be ever called upon to enter upon such a consideration as this.  I do not think I will be regarded as being offensive to them if I say that I do not believe, considering the personnel, that they are the people who would want this particular jurisdiction thrust upon them.  I do not think they would, and I do not think that they could carry it out competently with all their other duties.  I am quite in favour of having, if one could get it, an authority that would be somewhat more permanent than the Minister is likely to be.  It may be the best thing to hang on to at the moment, in default of anything better emerging.  Of course if the Railway Tribunal is to be put in Section 5 it must necessarily be put in Section 3. I think there is no doubt that it would be consequential.  I would like to urge strongly against the amendment, but of <Col N="1107" /> course I would not go so far by any means as to make this a matter of confidence. I would ask the Dáil to give the greatest possible consideration to the change suggested by this before it would make it, and to consider, if they do so whether the Railways Tribunal is, in the first place, the body likely to deal with this matter in the best way, and secondly, as the question of partiality and impartiality must come in, is it thought that the Tribunal will be less partial than the Minister is likely to be?</P>

I presume that what was at the back of Deputy Cooper's mind was that we seemed to be concentrating, in connection with all industrial arrangements, a veto and an overriding authority in the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>Now I think it is difficult to say or difficult to suggest who better could do it.  On the other hand, there is a feeling that if there was a more independent source&mdash;not more independent in the sense that we consider that the Minister would not carry out his duties impartially&mdash;but a more detached authority, it would be better.  I could not suggest anyone, but I think that is the underlying feeling in the amendment, and it has been the underlying feeling in amendments before the House on other Bills.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is bound to give an impetus to many of the skilled trades that are at the moment in need of a fillip, provided it is made obligatory on the railway companies to manufacture their buses in their own workshops.  I might instance the case of the Dublin United Tramways Company, who have given special consideration and shown much practical patriotism in this respect by having all their requirements manufactured here in their own workshops. Attention has already been directed to the large number of unemployed in the coachbuilding trade throughout the country, and notwithstanding the fact that the Dublin United Tramways Company alone have in their employment some 60 coachmakers, there is a considerable amount of unemployment still existing in that trade and in the allied trades.  I consider that this is a very serious matter for the people who are earning money by this particular trade.  I believe that what has been done by the Dublin Tramways Company <Col N="1109" /> can be done to better advantage by the railway company, who have better accommodation in the way of machinery, and who have an unlimited supply of skilled labour.  The railway employees at present are working a four-day week, and that has been going on for the last two years.  I think if something were done in this direction iii the sense of forcing the railways and such carrying companies to use home-manufactured buses it would provide employment for many now unemployed. These companies have certain obligations to the public for the money collected here.  They have obligations to the public to spend the money here. There is no doubt they can get a good return for their money.  It is not at all surprising to see that the coach-building staff employed by the railways reduced as they have been for the last twelve months, in view of the fact that unnecessary importations of this class of work is going on.  I consider that the inclusion of this section in the Bill is of vital importance to labour, and I ask the Minister to consider its inclusion favourably.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the amendment moved by Deputy Doyle. Questions have been asked in this House and the attention of the Minister has been drawn to the huge amount of money that is exported out of this country by the railway companies for railway rolling stock.  The railway company has satisfied the Minister that it would involve a considerable loss on their part to make their rolling stock in Inchicore, because, they allege, of the increased wages demanded by Irish employees and paid to Irish employees compared with the wages paid to the men who make rolling stock at the other side.  Now this cannot be suggested in the case of the omnibuses.  If the tramways company have made their -omnibuses as cheaply in the tramway works at Inchicore as they could import them, I think the same should apply to the railway company, who have been given protection under this measure.  The wording of the amendment leaves the matter to the discretion of the Minister and leaves it a question of an understanding <Col N="1110" /> being arrived at between himself and the company in connection with matters of this kind.  I read in the paper the other day a statement to the effect that the railway companies had arranged for the importation of a certain number of omnibuses from some station in Staffordshire.  I do not see why that should be arranged in advance, at least before the passage of this particular measure.  I think a good case can be made for this, and by nobody better than Deputy Doyle, who knows more about the workshops in the railway works at Inchicore than anybody else.  I hope the Minister will give the amendment sympathetic consideration in view of the fact that for a long time past the men have been on short time, and are at present working a four-day week.</P>

How the Minister is going to make it operative I do not know.  To my mind it is an item of no value.  If Deputy P.S. Doyle wanted to make it of value, if he wanted to make it possible that the railway company would have to make an effort to have the bodies of their vehicles manufactured in this country, he could have inserted in the amendment something to the effect that before the vehicles could be used on an approved road evidence would have to be given to the Minister that, as far as it was practicable, the bodies were manufactured in the Saorstát. The Deputy wants to do something more than he has written down here, which in itself has no value whatever. I do not know how far it is possible for the railway company to do this.  One would have thought that a tariff on the bodies coming in would be the best safeguard.  That would insure what Deputy Doyle wants.  If Deputy Doyle has not sufficient means in the tariff to achieve what he wants, he would want to do something more than has been done here.</P>

      <P>I am taking the amendment more from the point of view of its intention rather than its actual wording.  As it is worded it could simply be treated so as to make it quite ineffective.  Taking the amendment from the point of view of its intention, I have an objection to it if it is made absolutely compulsory or even if there is anything approaching compulsion on the railway company.  My own objection is that you are putting it on to the railway company and not enforcing it on the private bus or lorry owners.  Some consideration should be given if only to show what is meant and what is the desire.  Although in a Bill of this sort one cannot impose a condition of this type on anybody other than the railway company, one can achieve the object in this way, and I suggest it as a method that at least can be considered.  One can insert in Section 3, for instance, that one of the matters to be considered when giving approval as between a railway bus and another bus is whether there is going <Col N="1112" /> to be a guarantee that the railway bus is partly or wholly made in this country, and it then can be questioned where the other bus comes from.  There can be some effect brought about, not merely on the railway buses, but on rival buses by inserting such a provision in some way in Section 3.  If this suggestion is considered, I will see before the Report Stage what can be done in that regard.  It could be made effective and it could be inserted in the Bill as a matter to be considered.  It would have an effect, not merely on the railway buses but on the rival buses that compete with them and I suggest that would achieve what the Deputy wants, and a little more.  The whole point is that one of the matters to be looked into is the question of where the railway bus or the other bus is manufactured.</P>

      <P>I desire to move amendment 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 11 to insert a new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The running of a road motor service under this Act by a railway company shall not be deemed to be a change of administration of such a character as to debar an existing officer or servant of the railway company from being entitled to compensation under the Railways Acts, 1924-1926.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I expressed the fear on Second Reading that there was a possibility, under the powers given in this Bill, that the railway company would close down a branch of its line, a non-paying section, for the purpose of substituting a bus service in the same area.  I took the view at the time that in that event railwaymen who would be disemployed or rendered redundant would not have any pension rights such as they now retain and such as would be given them if the railway line were closed down as the result of amalgamation. The Minister takes a different view, If he contends they retain their existing rights, and that people affected in <Col N="1113" /> that way would not have their rights interfered with, I do not see what objection he can have to the insertion of the amendment now.</P>

      <P>I put two points to the Deputy on Second Reading.  I said that I could not see how the Railways Act of 1924, and the addition to that Act made in 1926, were to be affected by this.  Under the 1924 Act, as amended by the 1926 Act, provision was made for employees rendered redundant by reason of amalgamation. The Dáil decided that was a substantial point and that compensation should be given to people who were rendered redundant by reason of amalgamation.  This Bill can have no effect on the matter of rendering redundant by reason of amalgamation. If people are going to be rendered redundant by the railways running road services, those same people could have been rendered redundant by reason of somebody else running a service that would compel the company to close the branch line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle decided on in the Dáil in the 1924 Act was compensation for redundancy caused by amalgamation.  That is not affected by this Bill.  There are no rights taken away.  There is going to be no extra unemployment arising from amalgamation and, consequently, no reason for extra compensation arising from amalgamation.  In so far as this is a different thing altogether from amalgamation, it has no reaction good, had or indifferent on the compensation question under the 1924 and 1926 Acts. There is the special point that the railway company may have to close a branch line.  That is not a question of redundancy.  The employees cannot have a case pleaded on the question of redundancy arising from amalgamation: all they can plead is unemployment, which might be caused by an ordinary private bus or lorry owner operating in an area in such a way that the railway company had to shut down a branch line.</P>

      <P>The railway company might itself put on a service.  If that is to be the case, then the Deputy should move for compensation for railway employees thrown out of work by reason of a branch line being closed down on account of the railway company opening a bus service.  That is a new principle from the principle in the 1924 Act regarding compensation. The Deputy is really trying to amend the 1924 Act by reason of this Bill, and to that extent I was wondering how far this amendment was in order.  As it is drafted, the amendment would be ineffective.  The only rights to compensation under the 1924 Act are rights of compensation owing to redundancy arising from amalgamation. This could not debar any right arising from amalgamation; neither can it add anything to the compensation under the 1924 Act.</P>

      <P>I should like to state that, on Section 7, we were trying to reach accommodation with the Motor Bus and Coach Owners' Association with regard to the railway company's contracting to have certain of these services carried on for them. So far, it has not been found possible to get an amendment drafted along lines that would have met the various ideas that were put forward, but I am not entirely despairing of such an amendment. I have failed to get it drafted up to the present.  An enormous number of considerations have to be brought in to it but there is a possibility that on Report Stage there will be an amendment to Section 7 on the lines of imposing on the railway company the necessity of giving those who are already occupying a route the right to contract at approved rates.</P>

      <P>I had a meeting with a certain association and we discussed the Bill fully in a very friendly way.  It was felt that certain competition of a type that was not to be desired might be prevented if accommodation could be given, along these lines I had that matter under review and I was trying to get an agreement on it It has not been found possible to get that done yet, mainly because of the difficulty in getting the matter into the precise language a statute requires.</P>
