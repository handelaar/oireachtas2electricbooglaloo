      <P>asked the President if his attention has been drawn to a booklet published by Major H. Lefroy, P.C., entitled &ldquo;History of Sailors and Soldiers Irish Land Trust, 1915-1925&rdquo;; if he is aware that it is stated by Major Lefroy that £1,500,000 was promised by the British Government to complete the building of houses in Ireland, and that the Trust accepted the sum of £1,250,000, which was later increased by £50,000; that Major Lefroy further states that when the Treaty came into force the British Government curtailed the number of houses to be provided to an arbitrary number of 3,600 odd for all Ireland, and, if having regard to this, he will make representations to the British Government with a view to having the balance stated to be due made available.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention has been drawn to the publication referred to.  I understand that the sum of £200,000, which is the difference between the sums mentioned in the question, represented liabilities which had been incurred on 1st January, 1924, when the Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust commenced to function.  The number of houses to be provided under the Irish Land (Provision for Sailors and Soldiers) Act, 1919, had been fixed at 3,672 before the Treaty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the statement made by Major Lefroy that there are £200,000 still owing, and in view <Col N="790" /> of the fact that a number of foundations of soldiers' houses have been laid in very many parts of the country and no effort made to continue them in the past few years, will the President see that something is done to have the houses built that foundations were laid for?</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not part of my responsibility.  The Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust is the body responsible.  They are not under my jurisdiction and I have no authority or power over them.</P>

      <P>asked the President if it is intended to fill the vacancy on the General Prisons Board created by the retirement of the medical member of that Board by the appointment thereto of a medical inspector of the Department of Local Government and Public Health, and, if so, whether this new appointee will be possessed of equal authority with other members of the Board and will be in a position to exercise the same influence on prison administration as heretofore; and, further, if the Minister has received an expression of opinion from the Irish Medical Association that a humane and modern prison system can only be secured by giving full influence <Col N="791" /> to the medical point of view in regard to the treatment of prisoners and the control of prisons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been decided not to fill the vacancy on the General Prisons Board which was caused by the retirement of the Medical Member of that Board.  The duties formerly carried out by that member will in future be performed by a Medical Inspector of the Department of Local Government and Public Health, who will act merely in an advisory capacity to the Board.  I have received from the Irish Medical Association an expression of opinion that a humane and modern prison system can only be secured by giving full influence to the medical point of view in regard to the treatment of prisoners and the control of prisons.  I am satisfied that this object will be fully achieved by the arrangements which have now been made.</P>

      <P>The imports of bacon for the first six months of the present year are considerably less than in the corresponding period last year, the figures being 214,000 and 175,000 cwt. respectively and the values £1,111,000 and £856,000.  Imported bacon is generally inferior in quality to the home-produced article and sold at lower prices. If the Deputy considers that the home-produced article should be protected <Col N="795" /> from this competition it is open to him to recommend those engaged in the bacon industry to apply to the Tariff Commission.</P>
      <P>As stated by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture in reply to Deputy Baxter on the 23rd February last, investigation shows that as a rule, trade descriptions within the meaning of the Merchandise Marks Acts are not applied to imported bacon.  There is at present no power to compel retailers or others in the Saorstát to give any indication of the country of origin of imported bacon.  The matter has been receiving attention for some time past, and I am considering the inclusion of provisions dealing with the question in a Bill to amend the Merchandise Marks Acts which is under discussion with other Departments that would be concerned.</P>

      <P>Marriage allowance has not been paid to Mrs. Harrison because, until the 19th May last, her husband was ineligible for inclusion on the Marriage Allowance Register for his Unit, for the reason that he had not completed the two years' continuous military service prescribed by the Regulations before the allowance may be issued.</P>
      <P>The Regulations also prescribe that the allowance will be paid only in respect of a fixed percentage of the privates in an infantry battalion.  The number of men in Private Harrison's unit in respect of whom the allowance has already been issued, since and prior to the 19th May, completed the quota allowed for that unit.  When the number on the register will have fallen below the percentage prescribed, Mrs. Harrison's claim will receive due consideration. She was so informed on the 10th ultimo.</P>

      <P>The appeal of Miss Kate Halpin against the decision of her approved society to discontinue payment of benefit to her as from the 16th April, 1922, was heard on the 16th May, 1923, and the referees appointed by the Insurance Commissioners to hear the appeal, having considered all the evidence, found and awarded that the appellant was not incapable of work and was therefore not entitled to benefit during the period from 16th April, 1922, to 16th May, 1923.  Under Section 67 (4), read with Section 81 (15) of the National Insurance Act, 1911, the decision given by the referees is final and conclusive and in the circumstances the matter cannot be reopened.</P>

      <P>Before moving for leave to introduce the Constitution (Amendment No. 6) Bill, 1927, I would say that I am to a large extent consulting the convenience of the House in asking for permission to introduce this Bill without notice.  It would be open to me to move, at the conclusion of the business to-day, that the House adjourn until three o'clock to-morrow, having given notice to-day of my intention to move for permission to-morrow to introduce this Bill.

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether he is aware that on numerous occasions telegrams addressed to Mr. D. G. Adams, Kharbin, Dun Laoghaire, have been returned to the senders as insufficiently addressed, and whether it is the case that letters similarly addressed to Mr. Adams are considered to be sufficiently addressed, and whether other residents of the same district have their telegrams delivered, although the address is no fuller, and whether he can state if any cost is entailed to the public in the returning of these telegrams, and, if so, the amount.</P>

      <P>The matter referred to in the first portion of the question was dealt with at length in letters&mdash; copies attached&mdash;sent to the Deputy on the 5th and 18th March, 1926.</P>
      <P>With regard to the latter part of the question, my Department is not at present aware of any recent instance in which a telegram for a resident at Dun Laoghaire, bearing the name of a house simply without the name of a road or street, has been delivered as a matter of course.  When this matter came under notice in the early part of last year, instructions were issued to the effect that telegrams arriving at Dun Laoghaire, bearing only the addressee's name and the name of a house, should be treated as insufficiently addressed after due warning had been given to the addressee of the inadequacy of the address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="802" /> When a telegram is treated as undeliverable, the office which accepted the message notifies the sender accordingly in the event of his address appearing on the original form, or, failing that, if he is known at the accepting office.  In such cases no cost is involved to the senders in connection with the advice of non-delivery.</P>

    <P>A Chara,</P>
    <P>With reference to your letter of the 27th ultimo relative to telegrams for Mr. D. G. Adams, of Kharbin, 34a York Road, Dún Laoghaire, I find that it recently came under notice that telegrams intended for him were being addressed simply &ldquo;Adams, Kharbin, Kingstown,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Adams, Kharbin, Dún Laoghaire.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The regulations as indicated at page 205 (pages 197-198 in current issue) of &ldquo;Eoluidhe an Phuist&rdquo; (&ldquo;Post Office Guide&rdquo;) require that the address of a telegram should be sufficiently full to enable it to be delivered without difficulty and without reference to directories or other sources of information or without depending on the personal knowledge of the officer who deals with it.  (An address which might be sufficient for a letter is not necessarily sufficient for a telegram by reason of the fact that letters and telegrams are dealt with under different conditions.)</P>
    <P>Mr. Adams was accordingly informed on the 29th December last that the addresses mentioned were insufficient and he was requested to advise his correspondents of his full address for telegrams.  In a further letter of the 22nd January last he was notified that from the 1st February any telegrams received with the irregular abbreviated addresses referred to would be treated as insufficiently addressed.  Mr. <Col N="803" /> Adams was, therefore, afforded a reasonable time to communicate in the matter with his correspondents, but in the circumstances I have now given instructions that telegrams bearing the abbreviated addresses in question should be delivered up to the 31st instant.</P>
    <P>If, as stated, other residents in York Road receive telegrams addressed only to the name of the house, the practice is irregular and steps will be taken to put an end to it.</P>
    <P>Mr. Adams has been informed that if he wishes to use an abbreviated telegraphic address he can do so by paying the usual registration fee of £2 a year.</P>
    <P>I may add that I have read the official file on the subject and I do not consider Mr. Adams' attack on the Service justifiable.  To enable his own demand for prompt delivery of telegrams to be complied with, it is essential that the messages bear a full address, or an abbreviated address that has been registered. Mr. Adams, indeed, has had the benefit of using an abbreviated address for a long number of years without paying a fee.  His own complaints to Headquarters brought the irregularity to light.</P>

    <P>A Chára,</P>
    <P>With reference to your letter of the 12th instant, arising out of earlier correspondence respecting telegrams for Mr. D. G. Adams of Dun Laoghaire, I have to explain, by way of illustration of the fact that letters and telegrams are dealt with under different conditions, that postmen have a wider knowledge of local streets, roads and houses than either <Col N="804" /> telegraph messengers or the indoor staff in the Telegraph Instrument Room.  Moreover, postmen in sorting and preparing mails for local delivery are on duty simultaneously and work in the same room, so that if an address which is inadequate or which is unfamiliar comes under the notice of one postman he is in a position to call it out, and thus get assistance in the matter from the others.</P>
    <P>Telegrams are prepared and enveloped in the Telegraph Instrument Room for delivery, and if the address of a telegram is inadequate it is not always practicable to seek assistance in that connection in the Letter Sorting Room.  The postmen are frequently away from the Post Office for long periods during the day, being out either in the delivery or collection of letters or off duty, and it might therefore happen that a postman would not be available to give the necessary direction when required.</P>
    <P>It will thus be understood that while letters and telegrams should as a matter of course bear a proper address, it is much more important that the regulations on the subject should be complied with in the case of telegrams.</P>
    <P>I have to add that in treating telegrams with an unregistered abbreviated address as undeliverable, the Post Office does not act in an arbitrary manner, and that such a course is taken only after the addressee has had a due warning in advance of the insufficiency of the address and has failed to heed the warning.</P>
