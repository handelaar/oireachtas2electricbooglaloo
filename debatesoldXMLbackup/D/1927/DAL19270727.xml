      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that the Amalgamated Engineering Union, the headquarters of which are in London, has a Superannuation Reserve Fund for the purpose of facilitating its members in the purchase of houses; that this Fund from which loans are advanced for the purchase of houses is acknowledged by the English Inland Revenue Authorities as a Benevolent Fund and is therefore not chargeable for income tax; whether in the interests of citizens of the Saorstát who are members of this Union and who have contributed to the said Reserve Fund through its Irish branches, and who are deprived of securing loans for house purchasing owing to income tax difficulties with the Saorstát Revenue Commissioners he will introduce proposals for legislation to exempt borrowers in the Saorstát, in repaying loans, from being charged income tax on the interest paid each year.</P>

      <P>The income tax difficulties are not specified; but I take it that the question arises out of the deduction of income tax authorised to be made by a person paying interest on a loan.  In paying such interest the borrower deducts the income tax appropriate to the interest, and thereby recoups himself for the amount for which he is accountable to the Revenue.  The lender receives the interest less income tax; and if, as is presumed to be the case in regard to the Amalgamated Engineering Union, he can prove that he is a person who is resident in Great Britain and not resident in the Saorstát, he will be entitled <Col N="928" /> to repayment of any Saorstát Eireann income tax deducted for 1926/27 and subsequent years, so long as the Double Taxation agreement confirmed by the Finance Act, 1926, has statutory effect.</P>

      <P>I move&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Courts of Justice Bill, 1927, be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, it is provided by the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, that the Circuit Court constituted pursuant to that Act shall consist of not more than eight judges.  It was, however, recognised by the Oireachtas that eight judges might not be able to dispose of the volume of business in the Circuit Court, which obviously could not be very accurately estimated until some experience had been gained of the working of the new court system in practice, and provision was accordingly made by Section 46 of the Act that whenever within three years after the commencement of Part II thereof the accumulation of business required it, there might be appointed such number of temporary Assistant Circuit Judges as the Minister for Justice, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, might determine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="929" /> Part II. of the Act was brought into operation in Dublin City and County on the 11th June, 1924, and generally throughout the country on the 6th August of that year.  The time limited by Section 46 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, for the appointment of temporary Assistant Circuit Judges has, therefore, expired in the case of Dublin City and County, and will expire generally in the course of a few days.  In asking the House to agree to an extension of the time limit for the appointment of temporary Assistant Circuit Judges, I should say that the volume of business in the Circuit Court has proved to be much greater than was anticipated. It is now clear, I think, that eight Judges are unable to cope with the business which falls to be disposed of from day to day, and that this number will have to be permanently increased.</P>
    <P>The Government is, however, reluctant to ask the House to agree to any permanent increase in the number of Circuit Judges until the position has been very fully examined.  It is clear that eight Circuit Judges will not be adequate for our permanent needs, but whether this number will have to be augmented by the appointment of one or of more than one additional Judge is a matter which calls for further consideration. For this reason a certain interval must elapse before I am in a position to submit permanent proposals in this matter to the House, and I will, therefore, ask the House to give a Second Reading to this Bill, the object of which is to ensure that in the meantime the business of the Circuit Court will not fall into arrear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the circumstances of the moment I do not intend to oppose this Bill, but I am altogether against the principle underlying it, namely, the power to appoint temporary Assistant Judges.  I do not think it is necessary for me to remind the House that on the occasion of the passage of the Courts of Justice Act I ventured to say that in my judgment eight Circuit Judges would not be sufficient for the task which they were called upon to undertake.  I think that it should be now apparent to the Executive <Col N="930" /> Council that eight Judges cannot perform this work.  However, as the President has said that it is the intention of the Executive Council to appoint some extra Judges on a permanent basis, I will not oppose the passage of this measure, to-day; but I do want to protest against the principle of not providing adequate permanent Judges, because there is a great difference between a Judge appointed temporarily and one appointed to the position of a member of the independent Judiciary.  The Judge who is merely a temporary Judge, no matter whether he be actuated by the highest moral motives, must necessarily find himself, and be in a different position from a person who is appointed as a permanent Judge independent of the Executive. I sincerely trust that shortly after the Dáil resumes the Executive Council will be able to tell the House that they have considered this question, and that they have come to a decision as to the number of permanent Judges that will be necessary in future to carry on the work of the Courts of Justice in the Saorstát.</P>

      <P>I hope that by passing this Bill we shall give a breathing space to the Government in which they will examine the Courts of Justice Act as a whole, not merely in regard to this one provision.  In conjunction with Deputy Redmond four years ago I warned the Government that they were not appointing enough Circuit Judges.  I also warned the Government that the system of appeal from the Circuit Courts through the medium of a shorthand-writer's notes would not work satisfactorily.  It is now the general opinion of the Incorporated Law Society that it has not worked satisfactorily.  It has cost far more than it was estimated to cost, and one does not get the same justice in reading over a shorthand-writer's notes as one would get from seeing a witness in the box.  Like Deputy Redmond, I am not going to oppose the Bill because it gives the Government a breathing space in which to examine this question. I hope they will examine it not merely from the point of view of appointing two or three Assistant Circuit Court <Col N="931" /> Judges, but from the point of view of how the whole system is working.</P>

      <P>When the adjournment was moved last night I was endeavouring to elicit from some member of the Government what is there inherent in this measure that makes it more easy to detect crime or to apprehend criminals: what is there in this measure that they have not in other measures?  Up to the time when I started speaking last night no member of the Government had given any information upon that point.  In the absence of any such information I can only assume that it is an attempt to strike terror, and if it is an attempt to strike terror at criminals it might be a very good idea, if we were not conscious of the fact that attempts to strike terror on all other occasions have had the opposite effect.  If this attempt to strike terror is going to have the desired effect, well and good; but our experience is that in cases of this kind, dealing with people whom we are told we have to deal with under this measure, the effect would be the very opposite.  Of course, some Deputies told us we must give power to the Executive Council to deal with this menace.  First of all, I am not convinced that there is a menace consonant with the powers that the Executive are seeking.  There may be a menace but the powers they are seeking are entirely greater than required and these powers are not necessary in order to deal with the menace that we are told confronts us.  I am not conscious of <Col N="932" /> any very serious menace in the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask those Deputies who say they are willing to give unlimited power to the Executive Council are they prepared to give that power seeing that the Executive Council is handing over that power to two or three military men, to a military court?  We all know what the atmosphere of a military court is, and I was surprised to hear Deputy Redmond ask yesterday whether that court would be public.  Who wants to have a military court public?  Who will go to a military court with armed sentries outside, barbed wire, steel shutters, and machine-gun practice that has to be stopped so that the witnesses may be heard?  Is that an atmosphere that is congenial with justice, or is it an atmosphere in which justice is likely to be dealt out fairly?  Has it the same advantages <Col N="933" /> for the public that a civil court has?  Further, there is no appeal from a military court.  The order is: arrest, trial and probable execution.</P>
      <P>We were in the habit of pointing out to other people when they were in this country that they were the embodiment of everything that was tyrannical.  Yet, did they take upon themselves to give to a military court that power?  Was there any appeal from a military court under the English régime?  One instance will prove that there was an appeal from a military court when set up by the English Government in this country.  That is in the case of Egan, who was sentenced to death.  An order for <i>Habeas Corpus</i> was got from the courts, and when General Macready failed to produce the body an order was issued for the arrest of General Macready.  And yet this Government, which is supposed to speak nationally and for the people's liberties, proposes not to allow that appeal, proposes to supplant Runnymede by Leinster Lawn, and have the barons sitting on the front bench of the Executive Council.</P>
      <P>Then we come to the statement of the Vice-President.  There is a good deal of cynicism in what the Vice-President said about giving a passport to men who were ordered to get off the earth, because that is what it amounts to. He said he saw no reason why they should not get passports on payment of a fee.  And yet, in the case of citizens who are suspected of being a danger and a menace to this country, it is seriously suggested by a responsible Minister of this Government that they are to get passports to enter another country.  What are the terms of these passports?  These are the terms of the passports that the Vice-President suggests might be given to any citizen who is suspected of being a danger to the State:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We, Timothy Healy, Esquire, one of His Majesty's Counsel and Governor-General of the Irish Free State, request and require in the name of his Britannic Majesty all those whom it may concern, to allow the bearer to pass freely without let or hindrance, and to afford him every <Col N="934" /> assistance and protection of which he may stand in need.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Yes, to afford him every protection. He is a national of this country, and we presume he is a danger to this country.  We send him out of this country, and we ask other countries to afford him protection.  Could absurdity go any further?  This order to get off the earth is, surely, something that wants revision.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture told us yesterday that we have gone through a revolution and a civil war.  He did not tell us that we had also gone through a general election, and that the main fault that the Press of this country had with the general election was that it was so quite and calm.  There was not even a drunken row to introduce any hilarity or anything that might make &ldquo;copy&rdquo; for them.  The main statement was that the general election was conducted in a calm, quiet, and peaceful atmosphere.  And yet, all this thing was underground at the time, and we are told, after five years with no manifestation of it, that there is a menace to the State, and we must suspend the ordinary law.</P>
    <P>There is, we are told, a standing criminal population in London of 50,000.  Yet, I do not see that the English Government are bringing in any drastic legislation to deal with that 50,000.  We are not facing this issue fairly, and we are not facing it in a fashion that shows that we are not driven by panic.  The brutal truth of the whole matter is that we want to drive the people to adopt measures which they are not anxious to adopt, and we want to create an atmosphere for that.  The truth is that there is in the body politic of this country foreign matter, and that foreign matter is creating a fermentation and a fever.  The people will always essay to get rid of that, but we are endeavouring to keep up that festering sore.  The Executive Council might adopt a much better Public Safety Bill, and take another direction than the direction they have thought fit to take now.</P>

      <P>I listened, yesterday evening, to a number of attacks from different parts of the House upon this measure.  There is <Col N="935" /> a statement made repeatedly that it was necessary that some measure of this nature should be introduced. There seemed to be a general agreement that something was required at the present crisis in our national history. But those Deputies who made these statements that something of this nature was required, but thought this Bill went too far, pointed out the things they objected to in this Bill.  I did not hear any constructive speeches from them at all.  I did not hear from the Benches from which this measure was criticised a single statement of a clause in this Bill of which they were in favour and which they were willing to support.  I found, on the other hand, a sort of general wild criticism as it appears to me.  I heard people speculate as to how these powers which are to be conferred by this Bill upon the Executive Council, might be abused.  I hear people straining their imaginations as to the fashion in which Ministers anxious to hurt the country might, under the terms of this Bill, and under the powers conferred upon them by this Bill, hurt the country.  I heard Deputy Johnson, for example, state that under the terms of this Bill any public man could be deported. Does Deputy Johnson think that under the terms of this Bill, administered by the Executive Council, any public man is likely to be deported solely because he is a public man and obnoxious to the Government?</P>

      <P>I heard Deputy O'Connell state yesterday that not only had the Executive Council not used with too great extremeness and force the powers that they they already possessed but he complained that these powers had not been used with sufficient force.  Are the Executive Council now supposed to have changed their entire characteristics, so that they will live and act in a fashion different from the fashion in which they have lived and acted up to the present?  I heard suggestions, indeed, that the powers would be all right in the hands of the present Executive Council, but that other people might succeed them, and in the hands of other people these powers might not be carefully or safely used.  But who is to succeed them? Whom in this Dáil are you afraid to give these powers to?  Supposing the present Executive Council goes out of office, who is to succeed them?  I look around this Chamber and see the leaders of Parties in it.  I would not be the slightest bit afraid of giving the powers contained in this Bill to any Executive Council formed from the Opposition Parties in the House.  I believe that in their hands these powers would be fairly, honestly and correctly used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But it may be said that other Parties may come into the House who might misuse these powers.  It is the Parties in this House who choose the President, and he chooses the Executive Council. I am not afraid of the Irish people at any time electing to the Dáil a body of Deputies who will not select a fair and honourable Executive Council.  I am not afraid in the least bit of entrusting to any Government which this Dáil may select the powers which will be conferred upon it by this Bill, and I am not going to speculate as to what wild things might be done; I am not going to speculate, as Deputy Rice speculated <Col N="937" /> yesterday, on the possibility that Deputy Hewson might himself become an unlawful association, and might be attacked by the Government because he quashed the Limerick rates.  Does anybody visualise that as a possibility? Does anybody think that the present Executive Council, or any Executive Council likely to be selected by this Chamber, will use their powers in such a fashion?</P>
    <P>But I pass from these general criticisms and come down to the specific criticisms that have been brought against this measure.  I will not deal with all, but with a few.  The first section that Deputy Johnson attacked, and the one which gave a certain amount of misgiving also to Deputy Baxter, is Section 15, which enables a member of the Civic Guard to stop a person upon the road and search him for documents. Is that a terrible power to entrust to the Civic Guard?  Put yourself in the position of a man stopped on the road by a Civic Guard.</P>

      <P>A person would not like to be stopped on the road by a Civic Guard.  If I were stopped, I should dislike it, and dislike it very much.  But we live in a particular period of the history of this country.  We may have to put up with some small inconvenience, but I know this, that I would prefer to be stopped and be searched at every street corner by every Civic Guard I met than to see a crime occur such as that which was committed a few weeks ago. Granted it would be an unpleasant thing to be stopped, but can no one rise to a height of patriotism sufficient to endure the small indignity of being searched and having his papers looked at by a Civic Guard?  Is that too much?</P>

I confess that I did not like to hear suggestions coming from any quarter of the House which could by any possibility be construed as an attack upon the Civic Guard.</P>

      <P>What are the other powers given by this Bill that are attacked?  There is this question of deportation.  One would think that deportation had been heard of now for the first time in the world's history. I do not suppose there is a country in the world which at some time or other has not had to use deportation as a weapon of defence.  There are times, and there must be times, when there are persons in a country likely or almost certain&mdash;I might even put it stronger, certain&mdash;to do mischief. There may be people who, you know, though you cannot prove it, are inciting to crime.  Is it not to the benefit of the country, to the benefit of the persons they might incite to crime, and to the benefit of these men themselves, that they should be sent out of the country?  In my judgment it most certainly is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main attack brought against this Bill was directed to Part IV., which sets up the special courts.  I wonder if the Deputies who attacked this part of the Bill had read the Bill before they attacked it?  Are they aware that these special courts cannot be set up without a proclamation being issued by the Executive Council?  The proclamation comes into force at once, but are they not aware that the Oireachtas must be summoned to consider it, and that it remains in force then for three months. If there is no need shown for it, if another terrible crime does not take place, and if it is found that juries are not being intimidated, then Part IV. of the Bill will never come into force. <Col N="940" /> If, on the other hand, it is found in the opinion of the Executive Council that there is danger of the administration of the law being interfered with by terrorists, then the Executive Council can issue their proclamation and call the House together.  They will have to make their case here and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It may be said, and it was said yesterday, that this House might be led away, and might slavishly follow&mdash;I am not quoting the exact words that were used, but this was the argument&mdash;the Executive Council.  Did the Deputies who put forward an argument such as that read this Bill at all?  Do they know what sub-section (4) of Section 20 of the Bill says?  This sub-section reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every proclamation made under this section shall be forthwith published in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, and shall also be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and if either such House shall, within the next subsequent twenty-one days on which that House has sat, pass a resolution revoking such proclamation, such proclamation shall forthwith expire, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under such proclamation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That means to say that it is not only in the power of this Chamber, but it is also in the power of the Seanad by its vote, to revoke such a proclamation. Do the Deputies who mistrust this Dáil also mistrust the Seanad?  Do they think that if the Executive Council makes its proclamation, and that the Oireachtas assembles, that the situation will not be weighed, and weighed most carefully by both Houses?</P>

      <P>But it may be said why not leave Part IV. of the Bill alone until such an occasion arises.  My answer to that is this: Legislation of this kind takes a considerable amount of time to get through. The need which may arise may be very urgent, and moreover the existence of Part IV. of the Bill is, in my humble opinion at any rate, one of the great safeguards that that part of the Bill <Col N="941" /> will never be called upon.  I believe that Part IV. will so affect the minds of persons meditating crime, knowing that if they do commit a crime that they will not have any safeguards by terrorising juries, that in itself it will be a very strong deterrent to prevent them from committing crime. These are the main sections which have been attacked.  I personally shall vote for this Bill, because I know that it has not been conceived in a moment of panic.  I feel no panic, and I do not think that any member of this House feels panic.  I do not think that any member of the House who votes for this measure will vote for it out of hatred to any of his fellow-countrymen.  I personally know that I can look within myself and see no trace of hatred towards any fellow-countryman, and I believe the same is true of every other Deputy in the House.  That is not the motive which has instigated it.  It is not haste or panic or hatred that has led to the bringing in of this Bill.  It is a deliberately conceived Bill, and it has been conceived and thought out to meet the present situation.  I believe that the Bill, far from shaking or disturbing the public confidence, as it has been suggested the Bill would do, will restore public confidence now shaken.  I believe that the law-abiding people of this country, who consider the measure, will know that their Executive is fully armed to deal with any crime that may happen, and moreover is fully armed to prevent, as far as humanly it is preventable, the commission of political murder in the future.  I believe that the Bill will re-establish public confidence in this House, public confidence in the administration of the law of this country, and public confidence in the future of this country.</P>

      <P>If I had not been already an opponent of the Bill nothing would have convinced me more of the justification for opposition to the Bill than the exhibition we had from the Government Benches yesterday. We have had a little of the veneer and the polish scratched from the Ministers.  We saw them in passion and in hatred, and these same <Col N="942" /> Ministers ask us to-day to abrogate the constitutional law and to hand over to them, to their tender mercies, their political opponents.  After that exhibition yesterday I would think twice before I would hand a dog over to their tender mercies, let alone political opponents.  Let us take the bitter attack made on Deputy Johnson.  It is not my intention to defend the attitude of Deputy Johnson.  We all know and appreciate his capabilities of looking after himself.  Again, we have had the statement made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in his references to the postponement of this Bill for two weeks.  If he had been a new member of this Dáil, one would have made certain allowances for that interpretation, but we give him credit for being sufficiently intelligent and conversant with Parliamentary procedure to understand the meaning of this amendment.  This amendment has a two-fold purpose.  It gave an opportunity to Deputies of voicing their disapproval of this measure.  It at the same time gave the Government an opportunity of sizing up that opposition, of withdrawing with grace, and introducing a milder Bill, but it seems that they are not prepared to recognise the courtesies of Parliamentary usage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, we have references made to us, to Deputy Johnson and to other Deputies, that we were not prepared to shoulder our responsibilities as Deputies and as citizens of the State.  We were told we had not learned the difference between sitting in the stand and taking a stance in the arena.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce referred to the opening Session of this Dáil and it might be well in the short time at our disposal again to review what happened on that day.  We saw then, reading the Press of this country, that we had an atmosphere prepared in order that the Executive would get a gesture of unanimous approval from this House.  We opposed the nomination of the President of the Executive Council on that day, and if a majority of the members of the Dáil had supported our motion, we would not have shirked accepting the results and the responsibility that would have ensued. If we had the executive power and <Col N="943" /> had the confidence of the majority of the House, we would have shouldered the responsibilities of piloting the State and maintaining order in the State.  I want to assure the members of this House that at any time we are not afraid and we are not inclined to shirk our responsibilities either as Deputies or as citizens of the State.</P>
    <P>The President in his opening speech yesterday made some attempt to create an atmosphere that would have secured the passage of this measure.  He read out to us a list of what he informed us were captured documents&mdash;documents giving details of organisations.  He told us also that this was only a remnant of the organisation that was responsible for the Civil War.  Well with that knowledge he had the audacity to come to this House and tell us that the fact that these documents came into his possession was a justification for bringing a measure of this kind into being.  He gave us some instances of breaches of the law which we on those Benches deprecate but if he takes into consideration that we are a nation that has not only survived a war against an outside Power but has even come out of a fratricidal strife of brother against brother and son against father, or if he had even compared the crimes that have occurred in this country for the past four years with those which have occurred in other countries in Europe and America, he would have found from that comparison that we are unquestionably a peaceful country.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the assassination of the Vice-President would give a little justification for the anxiety of the rest of the Ministers but again we have had through this debate the inference that we do not appreciate in full that awful crime which was enacted on that Sunday a couple of weeks ago.  I can assure the House that there are no Deputies in the House or no citizens outside the House who deprecate more than we do the cruel murder that lost this House one of its most brilliant members.  We regret that loss not only because the late Minister was a member of the Executive Council, not only because he was a member of this House, <Col N="944" /> but because he was a fellow-Irishman and he was slain by his fellow-Irishmen. We deprecate it the more because this House not only lost a brilliant member but it lost a steadying force inside the Executive Council.  The Executive has lost its rudder and his colleagues now instead of being inspired by the last few moments of Kevin O'Higgins's life, in which he forgave his enemies, are like mariners who have lost their rudder and who are sailing out on a sea of passion seeking for blood and revenge.  I am afraid from their examples yesterday they are even prepared to endanger the destinies of this State in order to satisfy that revenge.</P>
    <P>The Deputy who has just spoken has told us that it would be impossible to bring these courts into operation without a meeting of the Oireachtas but there is one important factor that the Deputy has lost sight of, that before any meeting of the Oireachtas can be held the first two sections of this Bill will be in force.  We cannot isolate this Bill from the other two Bills on the Order Paper and in view of those facts we have to take their effects into consideration and to consider them jointly.  In fact, it was made very clear here by several of the Ministers yesterday that the other Bills were directed against their political opponents outside this House. We on those Benches do not agree with the attitude of members outside this House.  We believe that they should be here but the measures that the Government have placed before us to-day are not going to bring them here.  We must take into consideration the fact that these Deputies represent a very vital and huge force in the life of this nation and we ought to think twice before we do anything that will further alienate that national force from its service to the nation.</P>
    <P>Ministers talk about the State, but I am afraid that some of them are beginning to think that they are the State.  They are not the State. They are only a section of the State. The State comprises every man, woman and child in the State and the potentialities of the State, even children that are not yet born.  In viewing this measure, we have to view it as to whether its ultimate end and its ultimate <Col N="945" /> use would be for the good or the benefit of the State.  We have got to face facts.  There is no doubt that in this State to-day there are men and women and children who are badly housed, badly clad and badly fed.  Some of them do not know where their meals are to come from.  We must realise that this State is not in a good way, and instead of further alienating national forces the Government ought to do something in order to induce those people outside the House to realise the responsibilities that they owe to their constitutents and to the rest of the people.  I submit that if we are going to bring this country out of the economic morass it is in to-day, we will require the service of every citizen who loves Ireland.  All who have confidence in the future of the country should pull their weight in her service. We cannot afford to carry any passengers, let alone obstructionists in this effort.  It is up to the Government, then, to accept responsibility for directing this State, and to see that no further obstacles are placed in the way of human and social progress.  There is no doubt that there is an alternative to the measure before us, and that it is possible even yet at this late hour to induce all the Deputies elected to this Dáil to take their proper and rightful place here.  We want the members of the Executive Council to be imbued with the spirit of Kevin O'Higgins. When he was going to the judgment seat of his Creator he said: &ldquo;I forgive them.&rdquo;  Let us make up our minds to let the dead past bury its dead.  Even yet it is not too late to begin over again. As Deputy Belton said yesterday, we had our differences and bitter fights with the British, and yet we came to an arrangement with them.  Surely it is not more difficult to come to an arrangement with our own people.  We in this House seem to be going out of our way further to antagonise and ostracise them.  We are closing the two avenues open to them to use constitutional means in order to establish the elementary right of elected Deputies to take their seats in the Dáil, and the only alternative left to the Party is that they have to quit or fight.  That is the position in which one-third of the electorate <Col N="946" /> are to be placed.  What we ought to do is to tell those people to shoulder their responsibilities, and even go a little out of our way to assist them in shouldering those responsibilities.  If we have a feeling of love of country, of love of those things that really count, if we are imbued with those ideals instead of hatred, there will be much more hope for the future.  Even yet it is not too late for a gesture on the part of the Government; in fact, Deputy Johnson's motion provides them with that opportunity if only they have the courage and the humanity to accept it. Let us examine some of the provisions of the Bill.  We talk about expulsions. Some of the Deputies asked, &ldquo;Do not other countries expel people from their shores?&rdquo;  I ask members on the Government Benches what country or Government or State expels its nationals from outside its own jurisdiction?  I do not believe there is any such, but we are never too old to learn, and I will learn something in international law and international usage if such a thing does happen.  This Bill is going to bring turmoil undoubtedly. We have had too much turmoil, too much blood-letting, too much depredation and destruction, and instead of having any more of such things we ought to try and make the country for which we have accepted responsibility a little better than it was when we found it.</P>

      <P>It is talk like that that is largely responsible for the event that has led to the proposals now before us&mdash;talk like that, and talk like I heard from Deputy Hogan yesterday, when he accused one Minister, unpopular with the Labour Party, with being guilty of blood-lust. What did that mean?  Safety perhaps for Deputy Hogan, but what did it mean for the Deputy he accused? Another follower to the grave of Kevin O'Higgins?  It meant that and nothing else, and I waited for a repudiation from the leader of the Labour Party.  Blood-lust and rage! These are the epithets flung at Ministers who are trying to save the country.  This is the atmosphere of calm we are asked to talk things in. Apparently there is only one person or thing there can be treason against to-day, and that is Deputy Johnson.  No one can criticise him.  That is high treason.  The Ministers cannot answer criticism against them.  That is allowable to others but not to Ministers. Anything Ministers do to protect the State is wrong.  Their only office is to stand criticism, gibes and taunts such as we have heard from the Deputy from Galway and from Deputy Hogan yesterday.  Then we are asked to consider forgiveness, to consider this in a calm atmosphere.  Splendid, high-sounding phrases have come from the Benches opposite, but I cannot help feeling they are trying to make the biggest political capital they can out of the event that occurred on last Sunday fortnight.</P>

      <P>My position is quite clear.  The criticism that has been levelled against the Government is unfair, and it is unfair that the Government should not be allowed to answer that criticism.  It is being said that the measure we are discussing is only appropriate to a state of civil war.  That is the difficulty of the situation, if I may say so, that we are not technically in a state of civil war, and, therefore, the measure we now <Col N="951" /> propose is necessary.  Measures that, in the ordinary sense, might have been sufficient to cope with civil war will not meet the present situation.  We have not a state of civil war.  If we had a state of civil war the measures already on the Statute Book would enable the Government to deal with it. We are not in that position.  We have not a state of civil war or a normal state of affairs, and, therefore, neither legislation fit for dealing with the state of civil war nor legislation on the Statute Book to deal with normal times fits the situation that presents itself to us to-day.  That is the necessity and the excuse for the legislation now before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation has been described as vindictive.  In what sense is it vindictive, and against whom?  That question was asked, and was not answered. We waited in vain for an answer to that as to several other questions.  As far as this Bill is concerned, we are not looking to the past but to the future safety of this country, and that is the reason we make our proposals.  There is a grave responsibility in the present crisis on the Government and also on the Dáil as to how we face up to this particular crisis.  Let us look at the situation.  Every Bill of this kind that has been brought forward in a state of public emergency has been opposed. It has been said that it is not necessary; it has been said it is likely to do more harm than good, and that it will aggravate the condition of affairs that it hopes to alleviate.  That has been said practically of every public safety measure that the Government has introduced from 1922 down to the present time.  The Government has, always in this Dáil, had to do the unpleasant thing.  Others give sympathy.  Others can be merciful.  They can plead and ask the Government to be lenient about every phase of administration of the law.  On the Government alone has always lain the very unpleasant task of having to administer the law, and to court unpopularity in seeing that the will of the people of this country is made effective.  What we have to deal with is not the safety of individual Ministers; what we have to deal with <Col N="952" /> is the safety of the State and the State alone.  It is not protection for Ministers we demand, and we do not look on the crime committed some Sundays ago as a crime against an individual.  It was murder in that sense of the word, but it was more than that.  It was an attempt to assassinate the State.  That was the purpose of it, and it is because we feel that was the purpose of that particular crime that we have this particular act of legislation.  If one looked upon that as a private murder, this particular Bill would not be necessary.</P>
    <P>What is the good of speaking of ordinary criminals and making comparisons between the number of criminals in this country and those in other countries?  This is a criminal consipracy, not against an individual, not against private property, but a conspiracy against the State as a whole. It is because such a conspiracy has arisen we have to deal with it in these particular measures.  It is no good asking us to remember the quiet times we had at the elections.  I have listened to the speeches and I could not help wondering whether the event of a few weeks ago took place.  Some speeches were delivered as if that event did not occur.  It is the duty of the Government to take measures which it thinks necessary to protect the State.  If it does not ask for these measures from the Dáil, the Government is not performing its duties.  The Dáil, on the other hand, has also its duty, which is to say whether it thinks the Government is making a reasonable claim in asking for these powers.  If it thinks it is and if it thinks that the Executive should be entrusted with the future Government of the country, I suggest that there is nothing for the Dáil to do, if it faces the situation, but to follow the attitude taken up in some of the speeches yesterday, like that of the leader of the Farmers' Party in which it was stated that they could not take the responsibility of refusing these powers to the Government.  If that responsibility is taken there is only one logical attitude and that is to get rid of the Government.</P>
    <P>If the Government asks for measures and it is found that these measures are <Col N="953" /> not satisfactory, then the Government are not fit to be entrusted with the affairs of the country.  In that event, put out the Government and ask somebody else to carry on.  The Dáil has been given every opportunity.  When it met after the general election to elect the President and Vice-President it had its opportunity of electing another Government.  In the last speech which he made in this House, the late Vice-President definitely put it before Deputies in all sincerity&mdash; he was not capable of doing anything that was not sincere&mdash;that it was for them to elect another Government if they were not satisfied with the present one.  Was there any suggestion made that others were ready to take office? It is true that the Government was opposed.  From the speech of Deputy Lynch I now gather for the first time that there was another party ready to take over the Government.  They were challenged from these and other Benches to say whether they had an alternative Government and to say what their plan was.  On the motion to elect Deputy Cosgrave as head of the Government, they were asked, if that proposition was defeated, what their alternative was.  Did they give a single hint or say what their alternative was?  No.  I say that the matter is clear so far as this House is concerned. It can either trust this Government with the government of the country or get another to take its place.  That was put before the House yesterday by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I can assure Deputy Belton that he had no intention of establishing a military dictatorship. His meaning was that if the House had not confidence in the Government it should replace it.</P>

      <P>We were told in the speeches which we listened to that the assassination was not going to bring down the State, that it was a complete misunderstanding of the mentality of the people to think that the assassination of the Vice-President would bring down the State, that in fact the only real effect of his <Col N="954" /> murder, or the murder of other Ministers, would be to rally the people, all right-minded people, to the support of the Government.  It seems to me that there is only one conclusion to be drawn from that and that is, that if you want to make the Government stable and strong you have only to assassinate Ministers.  We were asked to ignore these murders, to treat them as not having occurred, and it was said that all right-minded people would rally to the Government.  That is merely a pious hope.  When I was doing very juvenile theology, I remember, when learning the Catechism, that that would be called presumption. We were looking for a certain thing but we were not taking the means to obtain it.  That is the most extraordinary statement I ever listened to, that the best way to face this menace to the State is to ignore what occurred, to pass it by.  I saw several efforts made to pass by that particular event, to treat it as if it had not occurred, to forget it more or less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The speeches of many Deputies who spoke against this Bill could have been delivered in normal times in a country that had for a long time enjoyed a settled state of government. Is it not, however, absurd, even though a great deal has been done in the way of restoring law and order, to suggest that we are in that position? The Government is twitted because it boasted that it had restored law and order.  Is it denied that it had done a tremendous amount in that direction? Is that a fact or is it not?  On the other hand, is there not evidence, as is evident by the event of the 10th July, that we are still in the presence of what Deputy Belton described as a crisis?  The two things are compatible. The Government has done great work in restoring law and order, but more work has to be done, and the work that has been done has to be preserved.  We are a country which is just emerging from revolution. It is no good ignoring that. The remnants of that, and I may say of several revolutions, are still there and the menace that comes from them will be faced by Ministers and the country.  It was said that our Constitution gives no excuse for political <Col N="955" /> assassins.  What is the good of that when it does not do away with political assassination?  In the same way it may be said&mdash;I am now using a phrase which has almost become consecrated in Irish history&mdash;that there is a constitutional means of settling our differences.  Of course there is.  There was such means in 1922, but that did not prevent the civil war.  The mere fact that these things are so, that we have constitutional means of settling our differences, does not prevent outbreaks of disorder which the Dáil, as supporting the Government, has to deal with.  Loss of confidence!  Where is the loss of confidence?</P>
    <P>I remember the speeches made here on the lamentable occasion of the death of the Vice-President.  I am absolutely sincere when I say that I fully believe that everybody who spoke in the Dáil and the people who spoke outside were perfectly sincere when they repudiated with horror that particular crime.  But are we not even ourselves already forgetting that particular crime and what it meant?  Then the situation was that that crime had shaken the confidence of the country. Who is shaking the confidence of the country now?  Is it any longer the people who shot Kevin O'Higgins?  No, it is the iniquitous Government who are now shaking the confidence of the country!  It is not the murder that is shaking the confidence of the people of the country, it is apparently the adoption of measures that are necessary for the safety of the country.  That is the new doctrine preached a very short time after the sad event that has occurred.</P>
    <P>Deputies have asked: how will this Bill make easier the detection of crime, how will this Bill make easier the apprehension of criminals?  That is not the purpose of the Bill.  The purpose of the Bill is not so much to seek the criminal after the crime, but to see that the crime does not take place.  The Bill is preventive.  That is why the Bill is there.  It could not satisfy, because it was never meant to satisfy, some of the requirements which have been demanded of this particular Bill.  It was not intended to find a better means of <Col N="956" /> detecting crime and apprehending the criminals&mdash;that is a matter for the Criminal Investigation Department.  It was meant if possible to limit crimes of the type I mentioned, and to prevent them.  The President made that quite clear in introducing the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is absurd to say that the purpose of the Bill was not made quite clear. It was.  The President said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To deal with the remnant of the organisation which was responsible for the civil war, and, in particular, that portion thereof which has now made up its mind to resort to assassination as a political weapon, we require something more than a direct attack on those immediately concerned. We must deal with the insidious and poisonous propaganda which their camp-followers delight to indulge in.  There are persons in the country who, perhaps, would not adopt assassination as a political weapon to attain their ends, but when that end happens to be the same as that of the assassins, it will happen that the assassins will not be altogether denied moral support, if not directly, at least by innuendo. To preserve, in particular, the youth of the country, the hysterical, the morbid, the neurotic and the impressionable elements of the country from inoculation with poisonous doctrines and ideas, it is, in our judgment, absolutely essential that the Executive should have power to suppress all associations of persons who set out to achieve a particular object, whether lawful or not in itself, by violent or criminal means.  If such associations are allowed to flourish they will inevitably breed assassins and criminals.  The Bill, therefore, proposes that the Executive should have power to declare associations which advocate or suggest violence to be unlawful, and membership of such associations will then become criminal, to be punished as such.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the purpose of the Bill.  The Bill is preventive in its purpose.  It is not a Bill for the better detection of crime.  I am quite aware that the murder of the late Vice-President called forth an almost unparalleled expression <Col N="957" /> of sympathy in this country.  It was a sympathy that was widespread, and that undoubtedly gave great solace &mdash;if such a thing could at all be given &mdash;to his colleagues in the Government. But, though that sympathy was widespread, was it universal?  I ask Deputies from different parts of the country was the sympathy universal?  Were there not people through the country, in different places, who actually did not conceal, I might almost say, their joy at that particular event?</P>

      <P>Is there any place in the country in which that did not take place?  I do not say they were the majority&mdash;far from it&mdash;in any place.  I do not say they represented all the people opposed to our Constitution&mdash;far from it.  But there are people, large numbers of people, of that particular type and mentality.  What is the good of telling us that the healthy-minded people will rally to the support of the Government.  What about the unhealthy-minded people? If they band themselves together in order to bring about the destruction of the State, and if measures are not taken against them, what is to prevent even a minority of that kind from bringing about the destruction of the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You must put the assassination of the Vice-President in its setting.  You must take not merely the event itself, but the various things that, in one way or another, be it moral support or otherwise, contributed to and led up to it. It has been said that the elections were quiet.  They were.  But what was the language used at some of the election meetings.  Was the Government of this country&mdash;which is, after all, the legitimate Government, the lawful Government of the country&mdash;treated with respect? Not with the respect that I was always taught was due to legitimate rulers; no, but with contumely&mdash;denounced as robbers, murderers, assassins, traitors, a revolutionary junta. Can language of that kind be used in front of the impressionable youth of the country, and deplorable consequences not follow?  Is there no moral guilt so far as the use of language of that kind is concerned?  That was the <Col N="958" /> language used from one platform after another.</P>
    <P>Remember we are being told that a certain Party has now adopted constitutional measures.  Very good.  Let us remember that the head of that same Party told us in 1921 that there was a constitutional method of settling our differences.  The leader of that party, a couple of years later at Cavan, said that if the men who signed the Treaty had been treated as traitors, a lot might have been saved to this country.  What does that mean?  In the late election campaign the following speech was made by another speaker:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If these men were in Germany, and were Germans, they would be treated as traitors and shot.  If they were Frenchmen and in France, they would be treated as traitors, and shot, and now that they are in Ireland, and Irishmen, why should they not be treated in the same way?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the most extreme example of the language if you like, but every type of abuse down to incitement of that kind took place during the elections. It is absurd, therefore, to separate the crime itself from the whole atmosphere that was favourable to the crime, and that created it.  I do not say that the people who used language of that kind knew precisely the meaning of their words, but I do suggest that it is criminal in a public man not to follow the meaning of his words.</P>
    <P>Apparently we cannot attack the Fianna Fáil Party in this assembly because it is said that they have adopted constitutional methods.  I do not pretend to follow the differences between the various branches of the people who refuse to accept our Constitution.  I know in my own native county there were two of those parties up and, after the election was over, the agent returning thanks on behalf of one group referred to the return of the whole four as if they belonged to one party.  That is just a matter of detail.</P>
    <P>I refuse, so far as this Bill is concerned, to sacrifice the State to the shibboleths of late Victorian Radicalism. I think the State is above shibboleths of that particular kind.  Any rights <Col N="959" /> of the kind, such as the freedom of the Press, referred to yesterday, here, and any right such as trial by jury referred to, if they are rights of individuals and citizens of the State, come from the Constitution and in no other way.  I say these rights given by the Constitution are there only for the better government and progress of the State. If the safety of the State, which is prior to the Constitution itself, demands it, then these rights in our Constitution must, for the time being, and so long as necessary, be abrogated. That is nothing revolutionary; it is simply plain commonsense.  These rights can come only from the Constitution; there is no other right apart from the Constitution that the people have, so far as these matters are concerned. Trial by jury is a right given by the Constitution, and only by the Constitution; similarly with the freedom of the Press; and both can be limited if the safety of the State demands it.</P>
    <P>Let us bear in mind that we intend, and, probably, the House will agree, to bring in a Bill dealing with evil literature.  We have a report from a Committee which embraced representatives of different parties upon a certain type of literature.  A Bill will be introduced to deal with that particular type of literature.  We expect that Bill will get the approval of the House.  It is an interference with the liberty of the Press, but it is necessary for the moral welfare of the nation. In this particular Bill we demand that very right of interference, where it is necessary, not merely to the general welfare of the country, necessary not merely to prevent the gradual undermining of the State, but to prevent, so to speak, the sudden death of the State.  The Government would certainly be remiss in its duty if it refused to ask for the right of interference of that kind.</P>
    <P>The freedom of the Press is undoubtedly a thing we are all keen on. And the Press, remember, may often do things that the Government feel are hostile and bad for the State, but that will not be sufficient reason for interference by the Government.  Because it is only the gravest reason that will <Col N="960" /> allow us to interfere with the general maxim that there must be as little interference as possible with freedom of the expression of opinion.  It is when a certain crisis comes about, when certain facts and matters demand it, that the Press will be interfered with.  Even if we think that certain articles, and certain lines pursued by different newspapers, may be hurtful to the State, that would be no excuse for interfering with, or abrogating the good sound maxim of the liberty of the Press.  It will only be when the life of the State is threatened that we must be allowed to interfere with that particular liberty.  There is, so far as that is concerned, the safety of the Judges of the High Court.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal of the rights of the individual.  The individual has his rights; so also has the State, and remember, if it means inconvenience for the individual and possible suffering for the individual, that may be necessary, he must bear it if it is essential for the safety of the State.  Apparently when the Government elected by this Dáil does anything, they are always wrong.  If they asked something else they would get it. The difficulty is that when they begin to ask something else they find they would not get that either.  Everything done should be done in a different way. Apparently the mere fact that the Government does it is a sufficient reason for its being wrong.  We are told they are traitors to the nation. People who attack the nation attack the Government, and attack the assembly set up by the nation.  These particular people have been applauded; they are more or less looked upon as heroes and men of high principle.</P>
    <P>Amongst those who laid the foundations of the State was one of the biggest Irishmen of our time.  Because he believed in his country and because he believed the country was free and was capable of carving out its own destiny, was he applauded?  What was his reward?  We all know what his reward was.  We all know the kind of abuse hurled at him in his lifetime. It is the other side that gets all the sympathy and the flowers and the <Col N="961" /> bouquets.  The Government who are trying to save the country, as a rule, get nothing but abuse in return.</P>
    <P>We are told that further evidence is necessary for this Bill.  What kind of evidence is necessary?  What further evidence is necessary beyond what the President gave in his opening statement, and the very lamentable event of the 10th July added to that, and all it portends for the future of this country?  Let people be quite clear about that.  Surely the further evidence is not a repetition of the kind we had an example of some Sundays ago.  Let us remember, so far as the other thing is concerned, that we are dealing with secret societies.  Are we to wait until they strike, then hurriedly summon the Dáil and put the position before it and try to get through the necessary legislation?  I think the President and the Government have given sufficient reason for the powers they are asking for and which are the minimum they consider necessary for the salvation of the State.  With these powers diminished they feel that they ought not any longer to be entrusted with the Government of the State.  That is the position that the Dáil has to face. Remember that if the Government has a duty so also have the various parties that sit in this House.  We have to deal with a very definite menace and in order the better to deal with that we ask for these particular powers. It is in the option of every man and it is in his power to deny us these facilities that we are asking for.  However, the responsibility is as much his as it is ours.  Our responsibility is to ask for the powers that we consider necessary and the Dáil's responsibility will be shown in the answer given.</P>

      <P>The fact that a Party has left this House has left me without much to say.  I did intend to make a long speech, but I shall content myself now with making a few observations. One thing I rose specially to refer to was the fact that whisperings and reports had been circulated round the country by individuals and statements made from platforms which I think needs attention.  Perhaps to a certain <Col N="962" /> extent some of the items I am going to quote will be the explanation of the absence of the Labour Party from the House.  I have here a report of a meeting held at Arklow at which Deputy Everett said: &ldquo;They offered their sympathy to Mr. O'Higgins's relatives and condemned the party responsible, but there was no justification for the murder of other innocent people.&rdquo;  He said this after saying they were opposing the Bill.  &ldquo;There was no justification for the murder of other innocent people.&rdquo;  That meant, of course, that the Bill was introduced for the purpose of murdering other people.  And further down he said &ldquo;there was no justification for the Government bringing in a Bill and depriving political opponents of any rights they had under the Constitution and then not the slightest excuse having courts-martial, further executions and further sorrow.&rdquo;  Another gentleman on the same platform said later:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Two wrongs never made a right. The new Bills would hit the working classes and the working classes only. If the Government wanted the murderers of Kevin O'Higgins, they could get them in 24 hours.</P>

      <P>Of yesterday's date.  I have heard what I consider to be deliberately circulated rumours of the description I have quoted.  Men have come to me and have asked me in whispers: &ldquo;Is so and so a fact; I heard it was so.&rdquo;  I think there is a deliberate campaign for the circulation of rumours of that description.  Whether individuals or Parties are responsible for this campaign, it shows a very unhealthy <Col N="963" /> public attitude.  No decent man would engage in such a campaign and no decent country would tolerate it.  I think that the fact that the Labour Party left their benches under the circumstances which they did to-day has justified to the hilt the statement of the Minister for Education, that political capital was being made out of the introduction of this Bill.  I think there was a deliberate misunderstanding of the words of the Minister when his reference was attributed to the death of the Vice-President.  What the Minister for Education stated was that political capital was being made out of the introduction of this Bill, arising out of the death of the Vice-President.</P>
      <P>I see no attack on Constitutionalism in this Bill.  I want to deal specially with this Bill and with no other.  So long as an organisation is constitutional, there is no attack upon it.  But when people are constitutionalists to-day and talk about resorting to physical force to-morrow, it is quite a different matter. A man cannot be one thing to-day and another to-morrow.  We had the statement made some time ago that a certain Party in this country had adopted the constitutional platform.  We had, then, Mr. Lemass and others from public platforms stating recently that, if constitutional means failed, they would adopt other methods.  When are we to believe them?  We have had declarations from Mr. de Valera, time and again, one flatly contradicting the other.  In what frame of mind are we to regard them?  If Mr. de Valera and his Party or anybody else adopt constitutional methods, they have nothing to fear.  But if they launch out into other directions, then the law will apply to them as it will apply to any other man who defies the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comparison has been made between the position now and the position which obtained in 1922.  It has been said that excesses were committed in 1922, presumably by the Gárda Síochána and the soldiers.  Will comparison be made between the Gárda Síochána of that date and the Gárda Síochána of to-day and will comparison be made between the soldier of 1922 and the soldier of to-day?  If some indiscretions <Col N="964" /> were committed, if some hardships were inflicted on the individual in 1922, will it be alleged that those irregularities or discourtesies, which are alleged, could take place in 1927?  Will any Party or any sensible man make that assertion?  Tribute has been paid to our soldiers and to our Guards.  The people who paid those tributes must feel that they are well grounded.  How can people, in face of those tributes, feel apprehensive of abuses in 1927?</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;panic&rdquo; has been mentioned here.  I notice that it has been mentioned principally by new Deputies. I do not know that the word has been used by any old Deputy.  I do not think it would be used by an old Deputy.  Any Deputy who was here in the years 1922 and 1923 had an opportunity of judging the mettle of the men who composed the Dáil then.  Not for a moment was there the least panic. There was no panic then in a very much graver situation and there is no panic now.  I know that the Party who sit on these benches are as calm in their discussion of this Bill as if they were reading in their own drawing-rooms. If there is panic, the panic is not on these Benches.</P>
    <P>There is no use in shutting one's eyes to the fact that a certain section of the people&mdash;let us assume a small section&mdash;are of a certain frame of mind.  No matter how small they are in numbers, laws must be enacted and methods devised of dealing with them. While a living can be got out of revolution, while money can be paid to individuals to carry on those practices, we will have attempts at revolution and we will have attempts at assassination and murder.  While money can be got in America or elsewhere, and while men can be paid by organisations for the doing of these things, they will be done here as in any other country.  We must realise that we are no better and no worse than other peoples.  We have our degradations like other people.  But we have just as good elements here as there are in other countries.  We have, however, too much make-believe here.  We have too much amateur theatricals.  We have young people acting as soldiers and ladies acting as Red Cross nurses.  We <Col N="965" /> have people indulging in these hectic methods of diversion in this country when, in any other country, they would be a laughing stock.  The sooner we have a state of mind which will make impossible that aping of soldiers and aping of Red Cross nurses the better. The seed was sown, and sown deliberately within the last three or four years.  The public platforms furnish evidence of that, as was pointed out by the Minister for Education.  That seed was sown by a certain type in this country, and sown broadcast.  If it was not intended to raise a crop from that seed, why was it sown?  We cannot assume that the people who engaged in this work did so because they were merely foolish or that they did it for amusement.  It was done with a deliberate purpose.  The seed was sown to bring forth a certain crop, and that crop, if it were not to be revolution, could only be murder and assassination. I say, &ldquo;sterilise that seed,&rdquo; or, rather, prevent its being sown.  It is the duty of the Government to do that.  We do not want the youth of the country poisoned.  We do not want our impressionable boys of from 13 to 15 years of age to have their minds poisoned by this foul stuff which they are given to read, free in many cases.</P>
    <P>A lot of play has been made here about the abuses which might follow the passage of this Bill.  There are a considerable number of people in this country who want to be assured and to be protected, and who cry out that the State must be protected.  Those people are a majority&mdash;a vast majority.  A Government, while it must be mindful of the rights of a minority, must likewise be mindful of the rights of a majority.  While being mindful of the rights of the citizen who is wrong or semi-wrong, a Government must be mindful as well of the citizen with a healthy civic spirit.  A Government which is unmindful of that duty does not deserve the responsibility of Government. It would be better for a Government which neglected that duty to relinquish office.</P>
    <P>We have been told that there is a growing sense of civic responsibility. That is so amongst a section of the people, but, as the Minister for Education said, it is not universal.  I regret <Col N="966" /> to have to say that on the night of the 10th July scandalous scenes took place in many places throughout the country.  I read where they were referred to by public men. One cannot shut one's eyes to the fact that scenes did take place.  That proves that a certain class exists in the country, whether in small or large numbers, that needs the attention of the law.  It is all very well to say that there will be a disavowal of the crime that occurred recently.  That is all very well, but it is only a pious hope.  Will nothing else happen, will no other pillar of the State be struck down? When it is stated that this Bill is not to protect the individual but to protect the State, that is the truth.  I say that the proper way to deal with such methods is prevention.  We do not want to have another tragedy; we simply want methods of prevention.  This Bill aims at prevention, and, to my mind, it is a simple and a moderate method of dealing with the situation.  The Minister for Education stated that political advantage was being taken of the situation that exists.  I fear that is so, and in more directions than in one, but I will not refer to them now.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMenamin described the Bill as being too drastic.  He stated that he was prepared to give the Executive Council any powers they required. The Executive Council have now stated the powers they require, but Deputy McMenamin has opposed the granting of them.  What powers would Deputy McMenamin give the Government?  Evidently they would not be the powers they require, but the powers he thinks they should require. Who are the best judges of the powers that are required?  Who is to take the responsibility?  Is it Deputy McMenamin or the Executive Council?  If the Executive Council are to take responsibility for the life of the State, then they are the best judges of the powers they need.  There should be no quibbling about giving them such powers. Deputy McMenamin stated that some measures were necessary.  We all agree about that, and the measures necessary are nothing more nor nothing less than those asked for in this Bill.  The <Col N="967" /> Deputy stated that no distinction was made in the Bill between the various sections in the country.  Deputy McMenamin is a lawyer, and if he thinks that a distinction could be made in any Bill between the different sections of people who are out against the Government, I question his outlook on legal matters.  A distinction could not be made in the Bill.  This is a Bill to deal with persons who are out against the State and who are not going to adopt constitutional methods.  On public platforms many speakers have pointed the finger at the Executive Council.  They pointed at the Minister who was struck down.  That was done in Monaghan.  We know that.  The public Press was ringing with it.</P>
    <P>What I have to say with regard to Deputy Johnson's attitude was stated by previous speakers.  In 1922 Deputy Johnson made practically the same speech as he did yesterday.  I think that he even went further then.  He has improved since 1922.  My sympathy goes out to Deputy Johnson, as I think he has been made to say things that he would not say, were it not for the frame of mind of those on the benches behind him.  We had strong terms from Deputy Johnson on a former occasion, &ldquo;out-Heroding Herod,&rdquo; and others that are still fresh in our minds.  Under this Bill the Dáil is asked to do nothing but recognise that a certain state of affairs exists and to act accordingly. Whether this organisation has a backing that is influential or not, large or small, all the Dáil is asked to do is to recognise that it exists and that it must be dealt with.  Because it is a small organisation and because its methods are out of sight, the methods to deal with it will need to be drastic. If the organisation was on the surface so that it could be seen the methods need not be so drastic.  It is not the numbers that we have to deal with but the quality.  On Sunday July 10th we had a sample of the quality of this organisation, a sample of vindictiveness and hatred, a sample of brutality unequalled in the history of any country.  The quality showed itself there.  We had better recognise that <Col N="968" /> the organisation is none the less dangerous because it is small.  Because the organisation is small these measures are not the less necessary.  We know that the organisation exists.</P>
    <P>Advice was given in 1922 and 1923 but it was not taken.  Other methods were adopted.  Which did the country most good?  Did the country appreciate that advice?  What was the result of the elections in 1923?  If the Government resigned to-morrow what would be the result of an election? Circumstances might be very easily brought about in which the Government would have to resign within the next week and let the people responsible for bringing about such circumstances abide by the result.  Sections 14 and 15 of the Bill have been referred to.  I have read them carefully and I see nothing to object to in them.  The only objection that could be made would be one based on the assumption that this Government had abused its powers in the past and is likely to do so in the future.  Is there any ground for that assumption? There is no ground for it whatever; there is no ground for assuming that this Government, having come through the ordeal of 1922 and 1923, having had these men in their custody and not having harmed a hair of their heads, are going to do it now when the civil war is over and when men's heads are cooler.  What could happen in 1923 cannot happen to-day.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made on other benches as to what happened in 1922 to meet certain circumstances.  The circumstances then surrounded the slaying of another member of the Dáil&mdash;Seán Hales.  Methods had to be adopted to stop that terrorism, that well-thought-out programme that was just starting, and that was to slay every man opposed to them.  Circumstances demanded that these people should be spoken to in a certain language. They were spoken to.  We backed the Government; I backed them and I do not regret having done it, and if the necessity arose to-day I would do it again.  I did so then because the necessity demanded it; every other man who supported it did so because the necessity demanded it.  It <Col N="969" /> was not a case of hatred.  The terms &ldquo;hate&rdquo; and &ldquo;revenge&rdquo; have been used across the floor here.  During my time in the Dáil, I have never seen any evidence of revenge or hatred; it was the other way about.  When charges are made across the floor relating to revenge and hatred, I say that a deliberate attempt is being made to take political advantage of the present circumstances.</P>
    <P>It has been stated we ought to continue ignoring those people.  I agree we ought to continue ignoring them as politicians.  As politicians I think the country recognises them as a joke. But when it comes down to murder, I think we ought to take notice.  They deserve our attention and I think that attention will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of criticism in the public Press and outside it, some coming from the editors and some from the people who write letters.  We had a more difficult time in 1922 and 1923, and we had very little help from the editors and, indeed, very little assistance from the writers of letters.  They were almost afraid to think at the time, let alone to act, and certainly they were afraid to speak.  I think the Executive Council are better judges of what is required than the editors of the newspapers or the writers of the letters.  This measure is all the more necessary because of the hidden and underground nature of the conspiracy that exists.  I hope there will be no faltering of any member of this Dáil who has any respect for his constituents and for the trust that the electors repose in him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LAW</NameTxt>
      <P>One very important feature has seemed to me to be greatly overlooked, one that it is well the House should bear in mind, not only on the Second Reading but also on the Committee Stage.  It was referred to by the Minister for Education.  This Bill, as I understand it, is aimed not at any political party, not at ordinary crime, but it is aimed at that hateful vice which has been too prevalent among our people, the vice of secret conspiracy, having for its instrument the weapon of murder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of my most vivid recollections is being awakened as a child with the news of the assassination of the Chief <Col N="970" /> Secretary and the Under Secretary in the Phoenix Park.  I can better understand the feelings of the President and of his colleagues on the Executive Council over the dreadful event of over a fortnight ago since I have before me the vision of my father's face that morning when the news had been brought in of the murder of a dear friend and the ruin of many hopes that they had cherished together for the appeasement of the country.  In 1882, as now, the country seemed to be returning to the normal course; then, as now, a little band of assassins, breaking loose even from the leaders whom they professed to follow, ruined and killed the reviving hope of the country. That being so, one has got to look at this thing very broadly and very deeply.</P>
    <P>People ask why the assassins have not been brought to justice.  Little more than a fortnight has elapsed since the murder of the late Vice-President. I have a clear recollection of that other murder of which I spoke, which occurred in the May of 1882, and unless my memory entirely misleads me, it was not until the autumn of the following year that the Government of that day, with its well-trained police force, its detective force, its unlimited funds for secret service, finally tracked down the Invincible conspiracy.</P>
    <P>There are really only two questions, as it seems to me, which we need trouble to answer in our minds when we come to vote on the Second Reading. The first is, does there exist a conspiracy having for its object the destruction of the State and operating through murder gangs?  Secondly, can we trust the Government with the powers which they ask for?  I sweep aside the pretence, for it is nothing more, of course, than a pretence, that all that is asked for is delay.  Deputy Johnson&mdash;if he were here I would, of course, address my remarks more particularly to him&mdash;knows, of course, what everybody knows, that a motion to defer the Second Reading either for a fortnight or three months is really a motion for rejection, and nothing else, and must be treated as such.  I ask myself those two questions: Does sufficient evidence exist, and can we trust the Government?  It follows in the nature <Col N="971" /> of the case that what is really being struck at are dangerous secret societies. It follows from the nature of the case that evidence in the ordinary legal sense cannot be forthcoming, and no prudent and reasonable man would ask of the Government that it should publish even such evidence as it may have, for to do that might obviously help criminals to escape and make more difficult the prevention of similar crimes.</P>
    <P>The only other question is: can the Government be trusted?  I do not think we can have any doubt in our own minds that they can be trusted.  They have already, as the last speaker reminded us, dealt in previous years with a more dangerous and certainly more widespread conspiracy than anything we have any reason to suppose is in existence to-day.  I know it is suggested that the fact that they come here to ask for exceptional powers is itself a disproof of their claim to have restored order and to have established civilised life in this country.  That is surely a mere quibbling with words.  Is it nothing that treason and sedition should at least have been driven underground? Is it nothing that rebellion no longer stalks openly through the length and breadth of the land?  If they were able by their courage, their moral and physical courage, which has gained the respect and admiration of many men like myself who, at the start, perhaps, had no very great love for them; if they were able to do that, and if they were able to carry out a greater task, can we not trust them to fulfil loyally, carefully and prudently the lesser task that the House is now about to throw upon them?</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared negatived.</P>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a second time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speaker, to a very large extent, has expressed what was in my mind regarding what should be said on the concluding stages of the Second Reading of this Bill.  I think it would be just as well to refer briefly to some statements which were made here yesterday and to-day concerning <Col N="972" /> this measure.  Deputy Johnson stated that those who were acting with him were quite ready and prepared to give to the Executive Council whatever powers are necessary for the prevention of crime, for the suppression of criminal activities, and for the arrest and punishment of criminals.  As regards the latter two, we have already pretty considerable powers.  As regards the previous two, he saved himself the trouble of developing the point, and of explaining to the House what he considered would be the reasonable powers necessary for the prevention of crime, and for the suppression of criminal activities.  We have stated in this measure what, in our view, are the measures which are essential for the purpose of removing from this State the last vestige of criminal conspiracies which have been and which are a menace to it at the moment.</P>
      <P>Later on in his statement Deputy Johnson went on to say that all the damage that I professed to have a desire to prevent in the way of loss of confidence and public disquiet has been effected by the introduction of these Bills and emphasised by the speech I made yesterday.  If there is one thing more than another which I am particularly anxious about during the course of my administration it is that the public should know exactly what the situation that confronts them is, and when I told the people during the recent General Election that we had established peace, real peace, through the country, and that we had secured the maximum of liberty and the maximum of privileges which any citizenship derives from its Government in any country, I told the truth and the whole truth.</P>
      <P>The fact that there is this conspiracy left. a remnant of the conspiracy which we had to meet and defeat in 1922 and 1923, is perhaps the best evidence that I was telling them the truth at the time. I have no qualms of conscience now in exposing to the public the fact that there is a conspiracy here which has still to be met and still to be crushed, and which we, if we live long enough, will crush.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>For a long time it was more than likely that this conspiracy was little more than bluff. And amongst those who discounted to some extent the evil tendencies of a conspiracy such as this was the late Vice-President.  In his efforts to promote that peace and goodwill, and to promote prosperity and confidence in this country, every effort was made to bring home to the citizens the great advantages which they derived under the Constitution of this State.  The Constitution which we have here is not the only instrument which guarantees citizens their liberties, privileges and rights.  The institutions of the State, the arms of the State, the Gárda Síochána, the Army and the various other institutions ensure the liberties, the rights and the privileges; and those are the institutions which we have had to man from our party here.  Those who say that we are endeavouring to make political capital out of this measure here and out of the other two Bills know very little about politics.  For what do we want to fill up this Dáil?  For what do we want 152 Deputies other than the Ceann Comhairle here?  To place upon the shoulders of every elected representative in this country the responsibility of his office; to bring home to the people of the country the fact that when they are voting it is not that a vote should be cast merely, but that we must select representatives of this nation prepared to accept responsibilities, to bear the onerous duties of office that the people elect them to, and to see that they will come here and elect or nominate from this Dáil a Government which must be respected throughout the land and which will have the support and the confidence of the Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This play-acting which is going on outside the people abstaining from accepting the responsibilities of their office here is going to stop.  I am not going to carry Mr. de Valera's political baby for him.  If it is going to be carried he must carry it himself.  If the time comes when somebody has got to negotiate on behalf of this country with Great Britain for an alteration in the Treaty of accommodation which we <Col N="974" /> have made with them, then the person who is going to do that is the person who occupies my office, not endeavouring to escape the responsibilities of that office, as Mr. de Valera did in 1921, but going over and delivering the goods back to those people, having negotiated for them.</P>
    <P>If I were interested in keeping alive my Party and in keeping alive the Ministry that is in office in this State, I would welcome occasional victories of Mr. de Valera outside, knowing that there are people who would look to us here to see that the State was on sure foundations, and to see that there would be people here in this Ministry not afraid to attack conspiracies.  They would want men who are not afraid to bring down the strong arm of the State upon every person who threatens its security and stability, not afraid to stand before the people and to answer for every act of administration that has taken place during their time.  I am not going to do that any longer.  I am going to ensure for the future that the people who stand for election in the State will come in here and take their seats here and accept responsibility for whatever acts are done here in this State.  We are going to see that Pontius Pilate will not be rehearsed in this country any longer.  The policy of the Government, Deputy Johnson states, seems to have been that having had a blow by the assassin, it is the rightful, necessary action of the State to respond by one hundred times a severer blow at nothing&mdash;to make a shot at something, at the air.  What is all the pother about?  What were all the denunciatory speeches for, that this is a hundred times a severer blow for the one that was given at the State, if this is at nothing?  What is all this posturing stuff?  What is the meaning of all the denunciatory speeches that we have heard?  What was the necessity to expose to our people the slave mind, as we heard it this evening from Deputy Hogan, when he rehearsed for us the attitude of the people of this country, during his lifetime and before, against the British Government when they were responsible for legislation and for administration here?  There is no parallel, and if the Deputy considered <Col N="975" /> for a moment he would know full well that there is no parallel.  At that time an alien Government was passing and administering laws for this country.  Here and now the people's representatives have complete responsibility for all laws, for every act of the administration, and they act for the people.  We are not people who want to appear before the public and say that the Constitution which we passed five years ago would not ever, in any circumstances, be altered; that, no matter what blows were struck against the State, we were going to continue to act under that Constitution.  That is not my interpretation of it.  My interpretation of the Constitution is that its main purpose is to secure the foundations of the State, that if they are secured, the maximum liberty will be afforded to the citizens of the State.</P>
    <P>We are not interfering in this measure with the liberty of a single peace-loving citizen.  We are not interfering with any reasonable political activity conducted by any citizen of this State, but we are going to throttle, by means of this measure, every person who conspires to bring down the State, who conspires to injure the State by violent means.  &ldquo;To cast aside obedience and by popular violence to incite to revolt is treason, not against man only but against God.&rdquo;  That is my answer to the conspirators, and they are going to be treated with all the severity, all the determination, and all the sternness that we can command. &ldquo;The Ministers, &ldquo;Deputy Johnson said, &ldquo;ask us to trust them, and that they will only use these powers for the suppression of physical force organisations.&rdquo; I have no recollection whatever of having stated that.  It was implied in my speech and it is inherent in the Executive Council of the State that they should get the trust and confidence of the Oireachtas.  How can we expect confidence from the people if it is denied to us in the Dáil?</P>
    <P>I make the statement without a desire to be in any way offensive, that there was brought home to me very clearly during the last two days the fact that most of the speeches against this measure came from people who <Col N="976" /> were unaccustomed to the exercise of authority.  I believe it would have been a good thing for this country if, during the last four or five years, an alternative to the present Government could have been possible, that people other than us had an opportunity of realising something about the exercise of authority, and consequently feeling a little more confidence in their successors and a little more charity towards their predecessors on occasions such as this.  Occasions such as this demand of every citizen the maximum support he can give the Executive. Give them the fullest possible support that can be given, or put them out, but rally round to whoever you have got in a time of crisis and give them whatever they want.  Do not expect them to bring order out of chaos unless that maximum support is given.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson said: &ldquo;I wonder if there has been any compact with Sir W. Joynson Hicks in regard to this deportation.&rdquo; There has not been.  I am a very charitably-minded individual, as a rule, but I am not concerned with what happens to anybody upon whom a deportation order is served after this Bill has become law.  That is not our business; the man upon whom the deportation order is served has got to look out for himself; I am not concerned with him.  Deputy Johnson went on to say: &ldquo;Let me point out that the special courts are not being set up when a state of emergency has been declared.  They may be set up, and presumably will be set up, immediately this Bill is passed.&rdquo;  That point has been sufficiently dealt with by other Deputies, and it is so clear on the face of the Bill as not to warrant any observations from me.</P>
    <P>Under Section 20 a proclamation bringing Part 4 of the Act into force must be made.  Sub-section (4) of Section 20 states that every proclamation made under this section &ldquo;shall be forthwith published in the `Iris Oifigiúil' and shall also be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and if either such House shall, within the next subsequent twenty-one days on which the House has sat, pass a resolution revoking such proclamation, such proclamation <Col N="977" /> shall forthwith expire.&rdquo;  Under sub-section (3) of the same section the Dáil is to be called together when a proclamation is made, and it is open to members of the Dáil, open to members of the Seanad where the Government has not got a majority, to pass a resolution annulling that proclamation. Deputy Johnson said in another part of his speech: &ldquo;Now we have Guards in large numbers throughout the country, many of whom have not had a great deal of experience,&rdquo; and so on, and that &ldquo;there was a danger of abuse by the Guards in detaining a person and searching him for seditious documents,&rdquo; and so forth.  That statement has been made by a Deputy, who knows as well as any other person in this State that the peace which we enjoy at the present moment is largely attributable to the Gárda Síochána. Their success throughout the country is admitted by all sections of the community. If they are young, they have remedied whatever is lacking in the matter of youth by remarkable assiduity and the great efforts they have made&mdash;efforts which have succeeded in bringing from other people commendation and tributes towards their efficiency.  I dismiss entirely from consideration the statement that was made that any inconvenient public man is to be deported.  That is the statement of a person who never had the exercise of authority and who does not realise what a shocking thing it would be to prostitute such powers as are given here for such a purpose.  I ask the Deputies, in considering this Bill, not to confound the immunity of the conspirator with the liberty of the citizen.  The Constitution, as it stands, provides extraordinary liberties for dangerous persons.  No man who engages to overthrow the State by violence, or who promotes assassination, is entitled to the full rights of the ordinary peaceful citizen.</P>
    <P>Criticism has been levelled at that section of the Bill which, when it comes into operation, takes from a prisoner the right of trial by jury.  I have before me a copy of an extract from the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; of the 10th December, 1926.  Three women were sentenced. What was the charge?  &ldquo;Three women <Col N="978" /> were put forward for trial.  They made no reply to the charge against them of endeavouring to induce jurors summoned to the Central Criminal Court to disregard their oaths and of publishing and circulating documents calculated to intimidate and influence jurors.&rdquo;  Now, have not things come to a nice pass in this country when three women&mdash;as far as I know one of them, at any rate, is an educated woman&mdash; attempt to prostitute justice and to pollute the fountains of justice.  &ldquo;The women were sentenced to three months imprisonment in the Second Division, and to an additional two months in default of finding bail to keep the peace for a period of two years.&rdquo;  Is that how the freedom of Ireland is going to be achieved?  The first step, women to intimidate jurors; the second step, the gunman, and the third step to close all the courts.  We are not going to allow the courts to be closed.  This measure is designed to keep the courts open.  It is the last step and the last stand to preserve for this country the right of trial by judge and jury.  Deny that right to people who are going to attempt to bring down this State, and they will not succeed.  Only those engaged in criminal conspiracies, engaged in attempting to bring about chaos and disorder and anarchy are going to be denied the right of trial by jury.  Why? Because they may attempt to interfere with it.  But they are not going to do it while we have any responsibility for the administration of the country.</P>

    <Title>PUBLIC BUSINESS. - CONSTITUTION (AMENDMENT No. 6) BILL, 1927&mdash;SECOND READING.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving the Second Reading of the Constitution (Amendment No. 6) Bill, 1927, it will be unnecessary for me to enter into any lengthy explanation.  Its main objects are clear.  It seeks, in the first place, to set at rest any doubts which may exist as to the meaning of the word &ldquo;member&rdquo; in Article 47 of the Constitution, wherein is conferred upon two-fifths of the members of Dáil Eireann or a majority of the members of Seanad Eireann the power to initiate steps for the submission of a Bill passed by the Oireachtas to a referendum.</P>
      <P>I think it is abundantly clear that this power was intended to belong to and could properly be held only by members who have undertaken the responsibility of membership.  It would be absurd to suggest that after a measure had been carefully considered in this House and in, the Senate it should be open to persons, who take such a light view of their responsibilities as public representatives that they absent themselves from discussions in this House, to enjoy the privilege of obstructing the business of the nation by lightheartedly signing their names to a petition, and thus initiating machinery which would hold up important measures for nine months, and put the country to the expense of a referendum. It is only necessary to point out that if this were the accepted view it would be possible for any party of sixty-two abstentionists to remain outside the House and prevent it from carrying on its work by the systematic presentation of petition after petition.</P>
      <P>The second aim of the Bill is to delete the provisions for the initiative contained in the Constitution.  The first sentence of Article 48 reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Oireachtas may provide for the initiation by the people of proposals for laws or constitutional amendments....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Even if this sentence were not in the Constitution the Oireachtas could, of course, provide for the initiation by the people of proposals for laws, since the Oireachtas can do anything which is not forbidden by the Constitution. It, therefore, follows, as was pointed out by the Constitution Committee in its report, that notwithstanding the deletion of Article 48 it would still be open to the legislature to provide for the initiation of proposals for laws or amendments of the Constitution by the people.  Article 48 may be further considered under two heads, (1) whether there is any machinery in the State, Courts or otherwise, which can compel the Oireachtas to take a particular action, and (2) whether the Article itself is not on its face and on examination completely unworkable. The second sentence of the Article reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Should the Oireachtas fail to make such provision within two years, it shall on the petition of not less than seventy-five thousand voters on the register, of whom not more than fifteen thousand shall be voters in any one constituency, either make such provisions or submit the question to the people for decision in accordance with the ordinary regulations governing the Referendum....&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Something is, apparently, mandatory upon the Oireachtas.  How can the Oireachtas be compelled to take action? In the first place, is there any legal process by which the Courts could be made acquainted with the fact that, following a petition of seventy-five thousand voters, the Oireachtas had failed to make provisions for the <Col N="983" /> initiative?  And have the courts, in default of specific provision to that effect, any power to make an order that the Parliament should do certain things?  And if the Courts did make such an order, is there any machinery in the State for compelling the action to be taken?  A declaration by the Courts would, presumably, be in the same wording as Article 48 and would carry matters no further.</P>
    <P>Considering the Article from the practical point of view as to how it would work, a great many points will arise.  More than two years having elapsed since the Constitution came into force, there appears to be a provision by which seventy-five thousand voters on the register can present a petition to the Oireachtas asking for legislative provisions to be made for the initiative.  To whom would the petition be directed and delivered?  Presumably to the Clerk of the two Houses for the two Chairmen, and, assuming good-will on the part of the two Chairmen, how could it be established that the seventy-five thousand signatures are genuine, that the people who have signed their names are, in fact, on the register, and so on?  If proof of all this were undertaken it would take a considerable amount of time, and would have to be done by some machinery not directly under the control of the Chairman of either House, and might take two or three years to carry out.  After the lapse of that period, if it were established to the satisfaction of some competent authority that the seventy-five thousand signatures, or some of them, were not genuine, presumably the whole thing would fall through, and no legal remedy would appear to be available.  If it were agreed by somebody that the signatures were genuine&mdash; the situation from the point of view of the petitioners would not be improved, because it would be quite simple for the Oireachtas to carry on until a General Election, without having made any provision for the initiative.</P>
    <P>At what point after the petition does it become apparent that the Oireachtas has not made provision for the initiative? There is no time limit mentioned in Article 48.  The Oireachtas might take two or three years considering a <Col N="984" /> Bill or Bills providing for the initiative. During all that time no referendum could possibly take place on the question of whether there should or should not be provision for the initiative. Assuming that it is established that no provisions have been made by the Oireachtas, and that a question must be submitted to the people in accordance with the ordinary regulations governing the referendum, a new difficulty arises.  There are no regulations. There is no machinery for compelling anybody to make regulations.</P>
    <P>Now, assuming that as a result of a petition the Oireachtas did provide for initiation by the people of legislation under the condition set out in the third sentence of Article 48, it appears that fifty thousand voters on the register could send forward a proposal.  What does &ldquo;proposal&rdquo; mean?  Does it mean a Bill, and must it be simply accepted or rejected?  Article 48 contains a provision that if the proposal is rejected it shall be submitted to the people for decision.  Does that mean that a Bill drafted by somebody, some person or persons unknown, supported by fifty thousand voters, must either be passed in the form in which it reaches the Oireachtas or rejected, and, if rejected, must it, in the form in which it was presented originally, be submitted to referendum?  Such a scheme is plainly ridiculous.  We have abundant experience to prove that the drafting of proposals for legislation, commonly called Bills, is a matter of extreme difficulty.  Yet, if this Article has any meaning at all, the Oireachtas has to accept or reject a proposal, no matter how it is drafted, provided that fifty thousand voters on the register say they are in favour of it, and if the Oireachtas rejects it, it must be submitted to a referendum.</P>
    <P>The urgency of the present measure arises from an attempt to delude the public that the initiative provides a means of removing the Oath from the Constitution.  That is clearly not the case.  The Article contains specific provision that any proposal enacted in this manner shall be subject to the provisions respecting ordinary legislation, or amendments of the Constitution, as the case may be.  Hence, if all the cumbrous machinery of the Article <Col N="985" /> could be gone through, with its double reference to the people, and with the enormous expense which this would entail, and if there emerged a Bill deleting Article 17, this Bill being repugnant to Article 4 of the Treaty, would be absolutely void and inoperative.</P>
    <P>While the value of the initiation machinery foreshadowed in Article 48 is in any circumstances very doubtful, it is clearly wrong to allow a condition of affairs to remain where the presence of this Article is being used to fool the populace, to delude them into the belief that it can be used for a purpose for which it cannot be used, as the gentlemen who are exploiting it know full well.  I move the Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>Our Party propose to vote against the Second Reading of this Bill.  At the outset I wish to say that I personally and my Party are in agreement with very much of what the President has said.  We agree as to the infirmity of the Article as it stands. We agree, too, that the action that is being taken at present for the purpose of the abolition of the oath cannot achieve that end by the means employed. We accept that completely and absolutely, and I think we might say with the President we even believe that the people who are pursuing this policy outside the Dáil do not themselves believe it would be an effective means of disposing of the problem of the oath.  Now we differ with the President when he says that urgency arises because of the effort outside to delude the public in the matter of the abolition of the oath.  Our view is quite the contrary.  To begin with, before we can get as far as the referendum, this initiative requires a certain number of votes which, as far as one can see, for practical purposes to-day will not be available from the Party who are adopting the means which the President proposes to take from them.  My view in the matter is that this Article of the Constitution requires consideration and amendment.  So do other Articles in the Constitution.  Mr. de Valera outside has seen fit to tell his people that the people of this country <Col N="986" /> can, of their own volition, amend an Article of the Constitution which is in conflict with the Treaty.  That, in our view, is not sufficient for the introduction of this Bill now.  We are satisfied that the better course for this Dáil to adopt, even the better course for the Government Party to adopt in this matter, is to permit those who are prepared to run riot, those who are organising the people up and down the country for the signing of this referendum, to go their way.  Let them spend their energy, talk and money, if needs be, in pursuance of that policy and let their people and supporters judge them later on the effectiveness of that policy when it is put to the test.</P>
      <P>This House is satisfied that the efforts made outside it to amend the Constitution, which would also mean an amendment of the Treaty, cannot be successful.  I believe, too, that those who are advocating the referendum for this purpose must have doubts in their own minds.  We know they make a case that the Treaty has already been amended, and we know it has been. But we know as well that it has been amended by agreement between the two parties who were signatories to it, or by their representatives, and we must recognise that it is possible to amend that Treaty by agreement between those signatories again.  If there are people who want the Treaty altered in certain respects, there is, in my view, a constitutional way by which that can be achieved.  They can come here and if they are sufficiently strongly represented they can, as the President said earlier, get this House to agree that the representatives of this country should take up the work of altering or amending the Treaty in the particular way and manner in which the country, or the majority of the representatives of the country, want it changed or altered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the only method which can constitutionally be employed to bring about the change these people want. We see no other way.  We do not see any way through the employment of the referendum, and we do not think there is any urgency whatever for the introduction of this Bill.  If the President feels it is inadvisable that many people <Col N="987" /> in the country should be worked up to fever heat with regard to this question of the referendum, I suggest to him there is not the slightest possibility of that.  The people of this country have been told a great many things.  They have been told some things in the last election which have not fallen out exactly as they were told to the people then.  The people are becoming more sceptical of promises.  It is true that even if the requisite two-fifths of the representatives were prepared to take action on this, there might be a number of people who would append their signatures, but even then they would be very sceptical of the result of the labours of their leaders on the matter. The President himself has fairly represented the legal and constitutional position. It seems to us here on these benches that sufficient would be done by this House in indicating to Fianna Fáil and the country generally that the policy they are pursuing at the moment is not wise.  It is a wild goose chase, and leads nowhere.  It brings the men who are leading them and their followers into a cul-de-sac.  They have to face up to the position in another way. I think it would be much better if the President and Government Party did not press this measure at present.  It would be better, in our view, that the Constitution should be examined, not in this Article alone, but from the beginning right through, with a view to amendment and alteration where amendments are necessary.</P>
    <P>This Bill takes an Article away and puts nothing in its place.  The wiser course in our view would be that the House should agree to set up a Committee to examine the Constitution as it is, to find the weaknesses there are existent in other Articles as well as this, and that at a later stage the House should agree to amendments of the Constitution not only with regard to this Article, which the President says is urgent, and with which I do not agree, but with regard to every other Article which requires amendment.  There is no urgency in this matter whatever. The fact that a campaign is about to be started to get a number of signatures to a petition to this Dáil to <Col N="988" /> ask us to legislate on is no indication whatever that a situation of urgency has arisen.  I feel myself that the interpretation put on this measure now will be, in a sense, unfair to the constitutional position.  It will not be accepted, and can hardly be accepted, under the circumstances, that this is merely an amendment to the Constitution but rather that, in the peculiar circumstances under which we have been discussing other measures for the last couple of days, the Executive, because in their minds there is some connection as regards the events of the past between one party who, outside, propose to operate under a certain Article of the Constitution and another party &mdash;a group of people who committed a terrible crime against the State&mdash;proposed this Bill.  In our view it will not be considered, on its merits, merely as a Bill necessary to amend the Constitution, but will be taken in conjunction with all the circumstances which we cannot dismiss from our minds as being in existence at the moment.  No harm whatever is going to come to the State, no instability is going to come to the State, by permitting Fianna Fáil to carry this campaign as far as they can take it.  In our view, it will mean failure for them and our attitude is that we would prefer to see them go on, and that this Dáil should not be asked to stop them in a campaign that is going to mean failure for them.</P>
    <P>By this action of ours we would be relieving them of obligations of which some of them, at least, would probably be mighty glad to be relieved.  They would be able to say that the Dáil prevented them doing something by bringing about changes which would not enable them to come into the House and take our place, and that we did that because we did not want them to come in.  I say let them run their course, do nothing to save them from themselves. If they fail they will be judged by their failure, just as we will be judged by our failure if we fail.  They will have to answer to their followers.  In my view, some of them got support in the last election because people thought that they were coming in.  I heard some of their candidates say that they were coming in.  They did not exactly <Col N="989" /> explain whether &ldquo;coming in&rdquo; meant that they were coming in as the biggest party or that they were coming in to to take the oath.  They left the people to guess, and I think some of the people are wiser now.</P>
    <P>If this Dáil continues to do the country's work for three or four years, a good many of their followers will be wiser.  Time will solve this problem more effectively than the way in which the President proposes to do so, namely, by passing this Bill.  Our view is to allow things remain as they are.  Let these people go their way and do their best.  Let a Committee of the Dáil be set up to examine the Constitution, and let that Committee recommend any amendments that may be essential to make the Constitution more workable than it is.  Then, perhaps, we would be able to deal with this Article, not in the light of the events of the last few weeks, but in a new atmosphere altogether, and I think the country will have lost nothing by waiting three or four months.  Let things go on, and let us not take any action that would give these people the excuse of saying that we stopped them from taking a course which it is legitimate to take under the Constitution.</P>

      <P>Deputy Baxter is concerned with what certain parties outside would say.  He may be sure that whatever we do, or do not do, they will say that we have been wrong. Whether we follow Deputy Baxter or the President, they will have ample blame for us.  They are as fertile in words as they are sterile in action, at least, in any effective action for the good of the country.  Let us examine this Bill and see what it does.  I have been told by people outside that this Bill abolishes the referendum.  It does nothing of the kind.  The only effect it has on the referendum is to say that the two-fifths of those Deputies who demand the referendum should be Deputies who have taken their seats.  It even allows that privilege to those who have taken their seats in the Dáil and who have shaken its dust off their feet.</P>

      <P>Yes, for a while. It is possible, as the President has said, <Col N="990" /> for certain Deputies, not taking part in debate, practically to nullify the whole of our proceedings.  I do not think it is an unreasonable proposition to suggest that that state of affairs should not continue.  The Bill will abolish what is known as the initiative&mdash;the power of a substantial section of the people to initiate legislation.  I do not want to detain the Dáil, but I want briefly to glance at the history of the initiative.  I think it was first put into the Constitution in the spirit in which a man wishes his wife to be dressed in the latest fashion.  The initiative was then the latest fashion in Constitutional proposals and those who framed the Constitution&mdash;I am afraid we have not many of them here at the moment&mdash; inserted it to show that Saorstát Eireann was thoroughly up to date. That was 1922, but since then the fashions have changed.  Skirts are worn shorter and ladies have shed their frills.  The object of this Bill is to shed the Constitution of some of its frills.</P>
      <P>The initiative came into being in Switzerland.  It is part of the Constitution of the Swiss Federation and of certain cantons.  I am not going to consider those cantons or those States of the United States of America which also incorporated it in their Constitutions&mdash;not all the United States, not all the Federal Unions, but certain individual States, notably Oregon.  The Swiss cantons and the State of Oregon are not on a parallel with Saorstát Eireann, because, important as they are and valuable as are their powers, they are not sovereign States.  They are not represented in the League of Nations.  They have&mdash;and this is the crux of the matter&mdash;no external relations.  The only sovereign State which adopted the initiative that has external relations is the Swiss Republic. It was judged there by a very great authority, an Irishman, a learned professor who had written learned books, and who spent nearly thirty years in Parliament, holding office, and having that knowledge and responsibility to which the President referred about half an hour ago.  I refer to the late Lord Bryce.  This is his opinion of the initiative as worked in the Swiss Republic:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="991" />&ldquo;A Bill proposed by the initiative may be crude in conception, unskilful in form, marred by omissions and mistakes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And this is the kernel of it:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It might be dangerous if applied to agreements made with foreign States.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was written about five years ago &mdash;not written with a view to this discussion at all, and that is the judgment of a man who is accepted as an authority not only in the British Dominions, but also in the United States.</P>
    <P>In Switzerland I do not believe the initiative is good in itself.  Switzerland in the last fifteen years, I think, has had eight initiatives put up and six of them were rejected by the people. Even if it was a good thing, Article 48 of the Constitution is absolutely unworkable, because whoever framed the Constitution read the Article that put the initiative into the Swiss Constitution, and then they either ignored or overlooked the following Article. Article 122 of the Swiss Constitution says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Federal legislation shall determine the formalities to be observed in regard to popular initiative demands and to voting concerning the revision of the Federal Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have no such legislation, and that Article cannot be made to work without creating machinery to work it. You have got to have 75,000 signatures &mdash;that is all it says.  Who is to count those signatures?  It takes a certain amount of time to count 75,000 signatures, as Deputies know who are fresh from the experience of the last election. Somebody has got to satisfy himself that they are genuine signatures.  A petition of this kind lets the humourists loose.  The great Charter was introduced in Great Britain nearly 100 years ago and was found to have page after page signed with names that were attempts at humour, like &ldquo;Bucknose&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bowknees.&rdquo;  Somebody has to look at the signatures and see that they are real signatures and that page after page is not sent in in the same handwriting. They have also got to be the signatures of 75,000 voters, which <Col N="992" /> means that every signature has got to be looked up on the register.  That is no small task.  There is a road in my constituency which comes into five different registers.  A person giving an address in the Rathmines Road will have to be sought for through these. There is no set form for this petition, no particular indication of how they are to sign their names, as there is in a nomination paper for elections.  I should imagine that in a rural constituency it would be worse, as some would sign by the townland and some by the nearest postal town, and you will have to try and identify them.  Some person will sign &ldquo;J. Kelly&rdquo; and you will have to try to identify whether it is &ldquo;John&rdquo; or &ldquo;James&rdquo; or &ldquo;John James Kelly.&rdquo;  There is no machinery already in existence to do it.  Until it is done the petition is not valid.  In the British House of Commons they have petitions and they created officers called &ldquo;Examiners of Petitions&rdquo;.  It will, no doubt, come as a surprise to the Farmers' Party that the Government have not created a post that they might have created.  We have no such &ldquo;Examiners of Petitions.&rdquo;  The first thing, if this is to be operative, is that we shall have to create some machinery to examine petitions.  That machinery and that examination will take time.</P>
    <P>I have come to the conclusion that this Article is, in the circumstances, completely inoperative, and we might as well get rid of it, and put something better in its place.  It is dry wood; it can never bear fruit, and if it has any value at all, the value is only to deceive the public and keep the public in a state of suspense.  I do not agree with Deputy Baxter, although I respect his argument, that we should hesitate about cutting away the dry wood.  I do agree with him that there is no particular urgency in the matter.  But once it is made clear, as I think it will be made clear in this debate, that this Article is virtually null and void already, we need not hurry, and we might give an opportunity to any element that think they can put forward a better form of initiative.  We might even make constitutional history.  At present we are merely imitating the methods of other Houses, both in Government and in <Col N="993" /> Opposition.  I would suggest to the Government that, while the principle of the Bill is right, and I am prepared to affirm it by voting for the Second Reading, they should not press the Committee Stage&mdash;that they should give us a fairly substantial recess in which to allow any persons who think they can bring forward a better way of allowing the public mind to be brought to bear on the initiation of legislation to put forward schemes.  It need not necessarily be part of the Constitution. You can get the initiative by ordinary legislation, and not by constitutional legislation at all.  I think the Government would be wise to leave that door open, to affirm the principle by passing the Second Reading, and then to give us a reasonable latitude to consider and to put forward alternative schemes.</P>

      <P>I intend opposing the Bill, not on the grounds of the merits of the Bill itself, but because I object both to the time and to the method of its introduction.  There was ample opportunity for the consideration and the introduction of a measure like this, if it had been considered necessary, for some time past. But it was not until a certain Party in the State seemed to think that they could get a political advantage out of exercising what seemed to be their constitutional rights that there was an examination by the Executive Council and an announcement that this portion of the Constitution was to be deleted. As to the method of dealing with the Constitution, I think that, instead of the House dealing piecemeal with portion of the Constitution, it would be far wiser, now that the time is drawing rapidly to a close during which it will be possible to amend the Constitution directly from this House, to have a Select Committee of the House appointed to go into the whole Constitution and consider whether, in the light of the experience that we have had of the working of that Constitution, it would not be well that in many respects it should be revised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the urgency of this measure? It may be said that it will prevent a certain action on the part of certain political parties.  I think that is the very reason why it should not be introduced <Col N="994" /> at this juncture.  I quite agree with Deputy Baxter when he suggested that eventually the object which a certain party seem to have in view could not be attained by the method of employing the initiative as outlined in Article 48.  If that is so, why not let them pursue that fruitless and futile task?  I do not believe that in that pursuit they will in any way upset the general public.  I think when it is shown to the public, as they will see if they take the trouble to read this debate to-morrow, that Mr. de Valera can never hope to achieve his object by the utilisation of this form of constitutional means they will understand the course he is pursuing is not only futile but possibly a dishonest one.  But bringing in a Bill like this, in conjunction with a Bill like the one we have just been discussing, seems to link up the constitutional actions of a certain party with the terrible tragedy and its consequences which took place the other day.  Will the passage of this Bill make it any easier to track the assassins of the late Mr. Kevin O'Higgins?  If not, if this Bill will serve no such purpose, as I believe it will not, why bring it in at this moment?</P>
    <P>I think it is playing with the Constitution and with our position in regard to the Constitution to endeavour to rush this Bill now at the end of this portion of the Session when we are engaged upon other far more serious matters.  The effect of the passage of this Bill, in the public mind, undoubtedly, will be that the Government seems to seek every available opportunity of preventing another political party from exercising its constitutional rights.  I have nothing whatever to say in defence of this Article of the Constitution.  I had nothing to say in the drawing up of the Constitution and, to my mind, the merits or demerits of this Article are questions which should properly be discussed by a Select Committee of this House or of both the Houses of the Oireachtas in a calmer, quieter and more peaceful atmosphere.  I think both this Bill, and the one the President has already given notice of, might be sent to a Committee such as I have <Col N="995" /> outlined.  There is no occasion, as far as I can see, for an immediate attempt to jerrymander the Constitution.  It will serve no useful purpose in the prevention or the detection of crime, or in the bringing to justice of criminals. The only thing it will do as far as I can judge will be to exasperate further a certain section of our people who have been showing some indication at any rate, latterly, of advancing in the direction of constitutionalism.  This will not encourage them, but it will discourage any advance towards constitutional action.</P>
    <P>Is there any reason why we in this House should proceed to discourage that advance?  I can see no harm that could be done by letting things stand as they are in the Constitution, at the moment, and, then, having a Select Committee set up after the Recess to go into the whole question of the Constitution and its possible revision.  It is possible to legislate directly through the Oireachtas to change the Constitution within, I think, the next couple of years&mdash;at any rate within eight years from the date of its coming into being&mdash; and the time is getting so short that, apart altogether from the merits of this particular Article, I think it would be a wise and proper step for the Government to set up a Committee of the kind I have indicated.</P>
    <P>Nothing would happen, I think, in the meantime to upset the country. Nothing would happen to render things worse than they are, and with the knowledge that such a Committee was to be set up to investigate this, among other Articles of the Constitution, it might be possible that Mr. de Valera and his friends might see the futility of pursuing this course any further.  I do not, in any way, blame them for taking the opportunity which seems to present itself of the initiative.  As citizens of the State, under the Constitution they are entitled to take that step, and because they may have some unconstitutional end in view, that, to my mind, does not prevent them from utilising all the constitutional means at their disposal.</P>
    <P>I think, in fact, that this particular Bill rather magnifies the possibilities or <Col N="996" /> eventualities that might accrue from the course that is now being taken by the Fianna Fáil Party.  I would suggest that it would be far more expedient and, if I might respectfully say so, far more dignified on the part of the Government and this House, if we allowed Mr. de Valera and his friends to pursue the course they are taking in this constitutional manner, and if we announced that we intend to set up a Committee to investigate the working of the whole Constitution, including this Article, the merits of which, as I said before, I have no brief for.  There is only one thing, perhaps, that might be said on behalf of the initiative as coming from a certain section of the people.  It has been suggested, particularly during the general election, that there may be proposals to amend the electoral law and for the abolition of Proportional Representation.  Some people might consider that while there is a chance of such proposals being made this right of initiative should not be taken away from the people.  Personally I am not wedded to this Article, or even to the principle that it embodies.  But that is not the point that I consider should be the cardinal point at issue in this debate to-day.</P>
    <P>To my mind the question is: why should we alter the Constitution now at all?  Why should we introduce this Bill at this time?  Why should we not alter the Constitution after due consideration by a committee which would go into the whole question of its working? Candidly, I can find no answer to that question.  I do not think there is necessity for the Bill, and I do not think its immediate passage will be of any service in the interests of the State.  I think that possibly, if it has any effect at all, it will have an injurious effect in letting a certain section of the people understand that they should not exercise certain rights within the Constitution because they seem to be obnoxious to the Government of the day.</P>

      <P>Deputy Redmond and Deputy Baxter are under a misconception.  Both say that this is not the time to introduce this Bill.  The position of the Executive Council is the direct opposite.  They say that this is <Col N="997" /> exactly the time to introduce it.  The Deputies say that there is no connection between this Bill and the Public Safety Bill.  Our contention is that there is every connection between this Bill and the Public Safety Bill and between this Bill and the Electoral Amendment Bill. That is the position of the Executive Council, and it should be understood. We were read lectures yesterday to the effect that the assassination of the Minister for Justice was not the assassination of an individual; that it was a blow at the State.  Deputy Baxter and Deputy Redmond told us that.  Deputies on the Labour benches said the same thing.  When will they come to realise that these three Bills are not for the protection of Ministers but for the protection of the State?  If they come to realise that they will at once see the connection.</P>

Is it not also being attacked by a political party, the Fianna Fáil Party?  Which is the more insidious attack?  Which is the more dangerous attack?  I would ask Deputies in all seriousness to consider that. I heard talk of constitutional methods. I heard it said that there was a perfect right to use this Article of the Constitution, that that particular Party was acting constitutionally in the use they were intending to make of this Article, whom no one will defend on its merits and whom everyone agrees is useless. Surely the Deputy is abusing words when he says that they are attempting to use this Article of the Constitution. Surely he knows they are attempting to abuse it.  Why does he not say so?  Why all this cant?  Does not every Deputy who has spoken realise that that Party are attempting to abuse that Article of the Constitution?

      <P>And by the Sinn Fein Party that preceded them.  What has happened?  Has not that Party been endeavouring to wreck the Constitution for the last three years, either as Sinn Feiners or under the present name? Have they not been spreading all over the country, for the last three years, the statement that the Government elected by this Dáil is an illegal Government?  In their own Press and off their platforms have they not called us traitors?  Are they enemies of the State?  Had that campaign nothing to do with the assassination of the Minister for Justice?  No Deputy in the House who thinks but must admit it had.  This talk of there being no connection between them is all cant.  I am not saying for a moment that they knew of this or that they would have approved of it at this stage, but to say that there is no connection is absolutely wrong.  We have been tried publicly during the last three years by these people.  We have been found guilty of treason; we have been called an illegal junta, and then gunmen, over whom, perhaps, they have no control now, shoot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told there is no connection. Is there a connection in their objects? What is the object of that Party?  What is the object of the gunmen?  Is it not the overthrow of the State by anti-constitutional means?  As Deputy Baxter rightly said, there is only one way of changing the Constitution.  But there is one way and that is coming in here and doing it and taking the responsibility for the doing of it.  The object both of that party and of the assassins is to change the Constitution in another way by other methods.  Their object is the same, even though they may not be allies now.  If the State is attacked by two forces&mdash;from two different angles, if you like&mdash;why should we not take steps to protect the State and why should we not take them now? Why should there be all this nonsensical talk when we propose to alter an Article in the Constitution that not a single Deputy in the Dáil will defend <Col N="1001" /> and that every Deputy in the Dáil, with the possible exception of Deputy Belton, will admit is being abused, and grossly abused, at the present time, for the purpose of deceiving the people?  There is no answer to that proposition.</P>
    <P>In this situation there is one phrase I dislike and which I react against. That phrase is that this should be done but should not be done now.  That is a phrase used by a man who has no convictions in the matter at all&mdash;who is unable to make up his mind about it. We are told to put it off.  Deputy Redmond's position is that this Bill does not go far enough.  That is an excuse also which I dislike.  I never yet encountered a man who desired to escape doing what he should do but he had the decent excuse &ldquo;I should like to do a lot more but this is not the time to do it.&rdquo;  That is the excuse of the man who does not want to do the day's work.  That is the excuse we are listening to now.</P>
    <P>We are asked &ldquo;What interpretation will the country put on this?&rdquo;  After the debates that have gone on here for the last two days, I do not know. There is a way of giving the country a lead.  I should have expected from Deputies, in times like these, a little responsibility.  I should have expected in times when the public mind is likely to be confused that Deputies, instead of adding to the confusion, would endeavour to clear up the situation for the country.  What have they done?  If there is any confusion in the country, have not Deputies added to it?  If our position is difficult, have not they made it more difficult? If we are likely to be misunderstood, who is to blame?  Who has helped us or who has tried to clear up the position?  We asked Deputies to do no more than tell the simple truth or put the position plainly to the people.  Have they done it?  They have not.</P>
    <P>There is another phrase used&mdash;that we are driving certain people back to unconstitutionalism, meaning, I presume, violence.  How?  What are we doing?  We are showing everybody whom it may concern that there is only one way to change the Constitution of <Col N="1002" /> this country, and that is by constitutional methods.  We are taking away no constitutional right.  In taking away this Article from that Party, we are not taking away any right which they have.  They are not attempting to use the Article.  They are not attempting to exercise a right under the Constitution; they are attempting to abuse it. Their leaders know that it cannot be used in that way, and it is a quibble to say we are taking away any constitutional right.  If people want to act constitutionally in this country, they have ample opportunities for doing so.  We have one of the most democratic Constitutions of any country in the world. We have adult suffrage, secret voting and an election every five years.  Are we attempting to debar any political party from making full use of those rights?  Of course we are not, and I would expect that leaders of the Opposition would not confuse the public mind by pretending we are.  We are merely doing this&mdash;we are barring every other way except the constitutional way.  That is what we are prepared to do, and that is what the people sent us here to do.  We want it to go out to the country that, as long as we have the responsibility, there will be no other way of changing the Constitution tolerated except the constitutional way.  We want the simple people in the country, who are being &ldquo;codded,&rdquo; deluded or deceived&mdash;whichever word you prefer&mdash;by all this pettifogging and trickery, to know it will not &ldquo;wash.&rdquo;  We do not want them to realise it in three years' time.  We want them to realise it now.  We want to show that there is no hope along unconstitutional or anti-constitutional lines, that that hope must die in their hearts, and that the Constitution which is good enough for the majority of the people must be good enough for any minority in the country.  This is the best way to show that.  Deputy Redmond suggested at one time that he was anxious to bring these people back to show the country that this Article was being abused.  He ought certainly to agree with me that the sooner that is done the better.  In fact, he said as much in his speech.  Is there a more effective way for showing that than the <Col N="1003" /> way which we suggest?</P>
    <P>I can appreciate certain points made by Deputy Baxter in his speech.  He is the leader of the Farmers' Party.  I should have expected that the Farmers' Party would have taken a sane, practical view of this matter.  I think Deputy Cooper's description of Article 48 was quite correct.  There were a lot of frills in that Constitution.  We were all younger four or five years ago.  We have learned since.  There were a lot of needless things put into the Constitution. There were a lot of things put into the Constitution which lead to confusion and the instability that confusion always brings about.  I should have expected that if there was any class of the community which had a solid interest in stability, in security, and in a clear-cut Constitution under which the people of the country would know exactly where they were, it would be the Farmers' Party.  But, no. You might as well be listening to a lot of English Radicals who have an exaggerated idea of every little trumpery modern addition to every little trumpery modern constitution.  They are all &ldquo;dead-nuts&rdquo;&mdash;as I am accused of using slang, I might as well use it liberally&mdash; on the initiative and on every little point in the Constitution which leads to confusion.  I should have thought that the sane attitude on the part of farmers would have been to clear up this point in the Constitution, to round off any corners there are in the Constitution, and to fill in any gaps, so as to leave us a Constitution that all could understand, a Constitution under which the people of the country would know their rights, their duties, and their liabilities&mdash;and to do that as quickly as possible.</P>

Personally, I intended to oppose very strongly the deletion of this Article, but, as the President and the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="1004" /> have pointed out, it is farcical to maintain an unworkable embellishment for no reason in the world.  It seems to be neither understandable nor workable. I do not agree that there is any connection whatever between the people proposing to use this instrument and the murderers of the Vice-President. I want to make that clear.  At the same time I think that the people who are being fooled by this proposition, this silly proposition, are entitled to protection, and that the sooner they get it the better.  Consequently, I am prepared to support the deletion of the Article because it is nonsensical and absurd.</P>

      <P>I think the sooner we begin to look at things from the point of view of real practical value, the better.  The Bill that is now before the House places in the hands of the Government the exercise of the initiative. Let us ask ourselves this question: Is that procedure right or is it wrong?  We on these benches maintain that it is perfectly clear that if Parliamentary institutions are to be maintained and are to be worked they cannot function if this power of initiative passes over to the hands of the enemies of the State.  We also suggest that in the case of the initiative it is perfectly clear that the people who sent us to this House do not wish the responsibilities of government thrown upon their shoulders, but wish them to be exercised by us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a quotation here by Deputy Cooper from that great Constitutionalist, Lord Bryce.  The quotation, to my mind, is of the very greatest value.  In quoting Lord Bryce, Deputy Cooper said the initiative may lead to a Bill, crude, unskilful and even dangerous, especially in making agreements with foreign States.  We go further than that, and we ask: Is there any Government in the whole of Western Europe, is there any State, large or small, that would entrust the framing of its policy, whether in intern or extern affairs, to the hands of the enemies of the State?  That is the actual position at the moment.  We suggest that we must have a Government; we must have leaders of that Government.  We must either do one <Col N="1005" /> thing or the other&mdash;we must either govern or get out.</P>
    <P>Let us for a moment look facts plainly in the face, and let us make it clear to the people that they will be deluded no longer, and that we mean to exercise the Parliamentary prerogative which is undoubtedly our right. We say to the enemies of the people: &ldquo;You have refused to recognise the de facto and de jure Government of the country that has been lawfully created, and we on our part refuse to allow you to exercise certain provisions of the Constitution with the sole, simple and deliberate object of wrecking that Constitution.&rdquo;  We say: &ldquo;You have no right or title to come in and take one Article of the Constitution for the purpose of wrecking the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There has been one thing the curse of Irish politics for many years, and that is the forming of conclusions on unproved assumptions.  We say that if we are to make progress in this country the whole method of procedure has to go.  There is one very old saying, &ldquo;experientia docet,&rdquo; experience teaches, and we suggest we must act in this instance upon the experiences that are to be gathered, not alone at home, but abroad.  We are entrusted with the framing of our own native institutions. We have those institutions in our own hands to make or mar in the future, and if we are to develop the country in the way in which it must be developed, we must apply the most up-to-date methods of political science at our disposal.  We must undoubtedly profit by the lessons of experience.</P>
    <P>Within the last few days Deputies listened to a very grave statement made by the President of this Chamber.  He pointed out that for many years there was a continual undercurrent of unrest going on, a continual stream of organised political agitation.  He pointed out that in 1924 there was a revival of the strengthening of the forces of rebellion, that courts-martial had been established and that documents had been discovered at Roebuck House clearly displaying the intention of purchasing artillery, and that quantities of ammunition had been captured at home. The late Vice-President, before the election, performed one of the most signal <Col N="1006" /> services to the State that any man could possibly perform, by the publication of those secret documents.  Speaking to the electors in the North City constituency I told them that these documents plainly and deliberately meant exactly what has happened within the course of the last week or two.  These secret documents disclosed to us that the armed forces were to be moved from the capital and were to be sent into the country, where they would be disarmed and demobilised.  In the face of circumstances like these we are told that there is no meaning whatever in the introduction of a Bill, not to disrupt the Constitution, but to maintain it.  The Constitutionalists arguing in this House say to us: &ldquo;You must not alter the Constitution.&rdquo;  I say that if the needs of the State demand the alteration of the Constitution, that alteration should be made.</P>

      <P>If the needs of the State require the passing of the legislation before the House&mdash;and there is no fair-minded individual who will deny that that legislation is not only needed but is long overdue&mdash;it is the duty of Deputies to stand behind the Executive and give them the powers they require. We are very mealy-mouthed here about what we do offending the Fianna Fáil Party.  It was perfectly clear to anybody who considered those secret documents to which I have referred that if Fianna Fáil had come back with a majority there would not be much left of the Constitutional to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first and most requisite element in any country must be to teach a respect for the Constitution.  The opponents of the Government Party in the country have shown a complete disregard and no respect, good, bad or indifferent, for the Constitution as it now stands.  One of our leaders, the Minister for Agriculture, clearly elucidated the whole question, and pointed out that there was an insidious, deliberate, premediated menace to the State. We on these benches resent the light and airy fashion in which the leader of the Labour Party and Deputy Redmond endeavoured to treat so critical a question.  I could not but recall a great historical instance when listening to <Col N="1007" /> these dialectical subtleties without one ounce of argument or one ounce of reason.  We on these benches are not to alter the Constitution in face of one of the gravest and most deliberate menaces with which the State, since its inception, has ever been confronted; that is what we are told.</P>
    <P>Might I ask the Deputies on this side of the House to tell us how do they deal with these matters in other countries? Any man who knows anything whatever about constitutional history can recall a hundred instances of how matters of a similar kind have been dealt with in other countries.  In listening to the arguments of Deputies against this Bill the thought came into my mind of what happened to the great German Empire when Bismarck was called by William I. of Prussia to come in and save Germany.  What was the position of affairs at the time?  The Austrians predominated the German Confederation, and the first task that Bismarck was faced with was to drive them out. How did he accomplish it?  Was it by declining to make the necessary constitutional alterations that he required? Was it by a nice subservience to constitutional law?  Any man who has read anything about German history knows that Bismarck's plan was to strengthen the German army.  That plan was carried out.  I may state to this assembly, without a penny being granted of the necessary appropriations by the German House of Assembly.  It was carried out in the face of and in defiance of a hostile Press, and four years later, at Sadowa, the Austrians were hopelessly defeated and the menace of a stranglehold upon the German Confederation was removed.  The warring States of Hanover and Saxony and all the other confederated German nations with their internal jealousies were welded into a great, strong, vigorous and active Confederation that in a few short years wrote that glorious page in German history which is known as the Franco-German war.  There is no use in discussing facts without considering the issues before the House.  These issues confront us to-day in just as deliberate and in just as determined a manner although under different characteristics. <Col N="1008" /> The question is, how are we to deal with them?  I suggest that our Government are dealing with them in the right way and in the right spirit. For any man who studies the pages of history there is always one lesson to be learned and that is <i>salus populi suprema lex</i>, the safety of the people is the supreme law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. BELTON Mr. BELTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BELTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I followed throughout with deep interest and with very close attention the statement read by the President.  I must compliment him on that statement and, if I might have the temerity to offer him a little advice when he makes a good statement from those benches, it would be that he should not allow it to be spoiled by speakers who get up and endeavour to support him.  I have listened to those who followed him from his own benches.  I have watched the cynical sneers on the faces of his colleagues, and only that I have considered this myself my mind would have changed very much.  We get Deputies and Ministers standing up here to tell us that we are playing with murder, to tell us that a couple of weeks ago we had the Vice-President murdered.  He was murdered, we are told, or it is suggested, by some secret organisation. Can we think that those Deputies are serious, or that they have much feeling in their regrets when the moment they sit down the same cynical sneer crosses over their faces?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are dealing with serious matters let us be serious about them. To me this is a very serious matter.  It is serious not because an individual was killed, much as I regret that; it is serious not because a blow was struck at the State, but because a greater blow has been struck at this State to-day by the passage of, not a Public Safety Bill, but a Public Danger Bill.  I fall back on that Bill only because previous speakers have fallen back on it. I suppose I have been included amongst the enemies of the country.  I never was an enemy of the country.  I stood up for this country when those people who were talking about the enemies of this country to-day did not stand up for it, and I will stand up in the future for this country at every critical moment as I did in the past, when Deputies on <Col N="1009" /> those other benches stood up against it. I was not afraid to take a certain action when I was convinced that I was taking right action.  I am not afraid to take a certain action here to-day.  I am not afraid to compliment the President on the statement he made on behalf of the Bill, or part, at least, of the Bill now before the House.  I agree with every word of what he said.  I am not going to vote for the Second Reading of the Bill for obvious reasons.  I am not going to vote against the Bill, because I am not going to vote against my own conscience.  I think that is a fair and clear statement of the position as far as I am concerned.  I am not afraid to say that in other places I have made a statement practically word for word in agreement with the speech made by the President here now.  I am no lawyer, and I had no legal advice.  I took an ordinary commonsense view of it.  I drafted my statement sitting on the beam of a plough.  I had not any lawyer at my elbow, but I took a commonsense view of it and, substantially, that was the view taken by the President in the statement he has read out to this House.</P>
    <P>I cannot follow the reasoning of Deputy Baxter.  That is his own business. I cannot follow him in opposing this Bill and supporting the Public Danger Bill.  There is a good deal in the case Deputy Redmond made for it, and I welcome the Bill in one way to show the country that I take it that the President has got first class legal opinion.  Lawyers have spoken before me and not one of them has challenged the legality of the legal view put forward by the President in the statement he read.  I take it that they are not in a position to challenge it.  I do not know.  I hope if I am followed by lawyers they will, for my information and for the information of the House, give the legal view as to whether the subject matter of this referendum would be covered by the Article under review.  Personally I thought it would not.  With much of the proposal before the House I am in agreement.  A lot has been said about changing the Constitution.  A lot of bitterness has been imported into this debate by Deputies talking about enemies of the <Col N="1010" /> people.  Not a few of the speakers talked about our freedom.  Let us go back a few years.  Let us go back to the founders of this Constitution&mdash;the men who signed the Treaty and brought the Treaty here and fought for the Treaty.  Probably this House is aware that I supported the Treaty, and though I stood with Fianna Fáil at the general election, I did not get on a platform on which I did not say that I supported the Treaty.  Had the thing to be done over again I still would support the Treaty.</P>
    <P>Mr. Collins said: &ldquo;This is not freedom, but it is freedom to achieve freedom.&rdquo; I see a cynical sneer passing over the faces of Ministers, who declare that this is freedom.  The Irish people never gave them a mandate to accept this as freedom.  President Griffith said: &ldquo;This is no more freedom than that this is the last generation of Irishmen.&rdquo; You have no mandate from the country for the measures you are now putting through, for our Party was returned by the country with as many members as yours.  Our Party was returned with a vote of confidence; your Party was returned with a vote of no confidence.</P>

      <P>Very well.  I hope you will be as strict in your ruling with other Deputies, if there are any others who want to assist in making political capital out of shaking more dead bones. Instead of seizing on the present opportunity to make amendments that are said to be made because the Article of the Constitution concerned is of no use, why bother about it if it is of no use? I agree that it is of no use, and I disagreed, as I said in the public Press, with the leader of my Party that it is of any use.  I have not denied that, and I go further; I disagreed at a Party meeting and said what has been said here to-day, that it was only deceiving the people.  That was my view.  Neither I nor my Party want lectures from Ministers.  We knew our job and did it; we are doing our job and will do it right.  They are afraid that we will do it right, and they want to put us in the wrong, but they are reckoning on something they cannot control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the time is inopportune, and instead of parading Article 17 of the Constitution still more, I say that if that Article were done away with it would save a great deal of trouble, and we would have written public safety and stability on every dead wall in the country.  If Ministers can alter the Constitution, as they claim they can, why do they not set about it?  I do not think I am out of order when I ask that; I think I am speaking to the Bill, because that point has been made by other speakers.  The one bone of contention, and the one thing that is destroying the stability, the peace and the prosperity of this country is Article 17 of the Constitution.  Why do you not look facts in the face?  You have got forty-three Deputies outside, and you have got one hundred inside. Cannot you say fairly and squarely to England: &ldquo;This is what is stopping <Col N="1012" /> the prosperity of the country; this is what is keeping us in turmoil&rdquo;&mdash;that, and the ranches that we are taxed to the hilt to keep up, because we are cursed with a regime of land and of ranching&mdash;giving the country over to a man and a dog, and I suppose the man will get his gun.  Article 17 is the trouble, not the shooting of Mr. O'Higgins.  It is not the underworld of Irish politics, because most people in this House know that those who are in this underworld of politics are not criminals.  Some here may think that they are deluded; some may think they are going wrong.  They may be neurotic, they may be impressionable, and all the things in the phrases that have been pitched at them, but nobody will deny that they are imbued with the loftiest motives.  A halo would be put around their heads a few years ago by the very men who are now trying to track them down, and, if I am not greatly mistaken, some of those who drafted these Bills are the men who brought them into this secret Republican movement. A terrible responsibility is on the heads of those who swore people in to defend a certain institution, put guns into their hands, and then put them against a wall and shot them for having carried out the oath that they administered to them.  They are told by colleagues of the people on the opposite benches that they must not take what is described as an oath of allegiance.  I would not have taken it if I thought it an oath of allegiance. I do not think it is.  I will not refer to it as an oath of allegiance, but there are people who do.  The taking of that oath is provided for in Article 17 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>You have been talking here for the last couple of days about providing machinery for the safety of the State, the stability of the State, the tranquillity of the State, and other things. Deputies have referred to the enemies of the State, and others have referred to them as criminals.  Aye, men who referred to the late Mick Collins as the head of the gunmen in this country have been talking here about criminals. Let us get down to facts.  What is the one thing that is destroying tranquillity, destroying peace, retarding the prosperity <Col N="1013" /> of the country and driving the youth out of it, as economic depression always will?  It is Article 17 of the Constitution.  If you face that problem you are facing facts.  If you do not, you are turning a blind eye to the canker that is causing decay and misery in this country.  You saw a statement made last night, an overture from a gentleman, who may or may not be my leader, but who represents a large body of opinion in this country, and who has got to be reckoned with. That overture has been made, and no chance ought to be lost to make a similar overture to try to bring about the peace that the country desires.  I will not bore the House much longer.</P>

      <P>Though &ldquo;hear, hears&rdquo; have been given by people who recruited for the British Army I will stand on my feet and defend the National Flag in the National Assembly of this country.  I will sit down when I think the time has come to sit down, but I will not sit down at the dictation of John Bull's recruiting sergeants. The appeal which goes forth from Nationalist Ireland, from the working farmers and labourers, from the business men and manufacturers of this country to-day is this&mdash;peace&mdash;and if your Bill that you call a Safety Bill made for peace I would support it, but it does not.  This Bill that we are talking about now does not make for peace or war.  It is nothing.  I am theoretically in agreement with the statement made by the President, but the Minister for Agriculture has deliberately stated that this Bill cannot be discussed apart from the previous Bill or apart from the murder of the late Vice-President. Let us consider all those events very seriously.  I do not want to make any unworthy suggestion, but this thing has struck me very peculiarly: there was a reward offered for those who shot a British private soldier in Cork.  There has been no reward offered for the discovery of those who shot the Vice-President.  There was the murder of the Sirdar in Egypt and terrible consequences followed for the Egyptian people.  We should not be <Col N="1014" /> precipitate in our actions.  We should not try to widen the divisions that are between a section of Nationalists in here and a section of Nationalists outside. There may be bigger influences behind all this than any section of Nationalist opinion in this country can command.  The direction should be towards unity and solidarity of the national ranks rather than division and separation and the widening of the divisions that are now in the national ranks.</P>
      <P>I hope those who will follow me will debate this matter with less bitterness towards nationalists than those who have preceded me, and that they will not try to brand any political party with a murder that has been equally condemned by all political parties in this country.  If you have information that they are secret societies, what have you been doing?  Why did you not look after them?  Why did you not pick them out?  You have had information for three or four years, but you only bring it forward and tell us about it now when a murder has taken place. When you had that information why did you not prevent the crime or take preventive measures?  I am afraid that all this campaign cannot very well be dissociated from an attempt to knock down the other political party that is running neck and neck with the Ministerial Party.  I will add no more in the way of criticism of the Bill, but I will certainly pay the President this compliment, that I welcome the Bill for this reason: to stop the fooling of working up a referendum that could not be worked up and that could not be carried through.  I state that here fearlessly.  I have stated that in another place, and for that I welcome the Bill. Because of that I think nobody can accuse the President of trying to make political capital out of this Bill anyway. I am not going to vote for or against the measure.  It is immaterial to me.</P>

If this matter comes on again at some future time, and in a much calmer atmosphere, probably we will all agree to this change, but in the circumstances I think the Ministry are making a bad mistake in pressing it now.  We were told from time to time that it was not a good thing to run down the credit of the country.  Surely no person and no candidate who was opposing the Government candidates did as much to <Col N="1016" /> run down the credit of the country as the Ministers themselves yesterday and to-day.

      <P>I accept the Minister's statement that the Government is proposing it for a double reason.  Anyhow the Minister emphasised the second reason and directed most of his argument to proving that the second reason was the reason why it is most advisable that the Article should be deleted.  Now, I have not given very much study to the question of the initiative in other countries, but I do know this, that the Constitution that we have was prepared and written by what was called at the time a Constitution Committee which was set up by the Government of which the Minister was at the time one of the leading people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not in this Dáil deal lightly with a constitutional question. The Minister is at all times a realist, but in dealing with political questions it is sometimes unwise to be too real and too material.  There is a pyschological reaction from any action we take in the Dáil, and I think it would be unwise and foolish to ignore the reaction which may follow the deletion of this Article from the Constitution. According to the Minister, this is the right time, and in fact the only time, <Col N="1017" /> in which this Article ought to be dealt with.  I believe it is the wrong time to deal with this matter, for I believe you cannot remove from the minds of many of the general public the belief that the Government is taking advantage of the political situation which has been created by the unfortunate assassination of the late Vice-President for the purpose, in plain words, of dishing the position of political opponents.  I am not a judge of motives, and I do not know what the motives are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not profess to be a prophet of political effects, but so far as I can judge, I think the political effects of the action proposed to be taken will be contrary to those anticipated by the President and by those who are pressing for the deletion of this Article of the Constitution.  The proposal put forward by the leader of my Party, Deputy Baxter, that the whole Constitution needs revision, is one that should receive careful consideration. When the Constitution is under examination with a view to revision, this Article could come up for examination, and the Dáil might be inclined to accept the recommendation of any Committee set up for the purpose of making this examination. But the juxtaposition of this Bill with the Public Safety Bill will, to my mind, have the effect of conveying to the outside public the idea that political advantage is being taken of the situation which has arisen.  My view of Article 48 is that it may be advisable to amend it.  It certainly is unwise and wrong to have an Article in the Constitution which in its present form is unworkable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there are some advantages in the initiative.  I believe that the initiative will act as safety valve.  I quite recognise that the objections put forward by the President in regard to the working of the initiative are cogent and difficult to get over, and I quite recognise it is possible that a Bill might be drafted so as to meet the requirement of the outside public and put through the course which is laid down <Col N="1018" /> for it by the initiative and the referendum but which would probably be quite unfit and unworkable if passed into law.  Still, the fact remains that if any particular Bill were passed bringing about any change in the laws of the country, undoubtedly any Parliament sitting would have to take cognisance of the fact that such a Bill was initiated by the Dáil and sanctioned by the people as a result of the referendum. The argument has been used that the leader of an outside Party and that Party are using this Article of the Constitution for the purpose of fooling the people.  That may be so. They may be trying to fool or &ldquo;cod&rdquo; the people, but does anybody think after the debate which took place to-day that the people can be further &ldquo;codded&rdquo; in regard to the usefulness of this Article? Does anybody believe that if a statement had been made by the President, or a responsible Minister, that the Article could not be worked that the people would still continue to follow the guidance of that leader in regard to this Article?  I do not believe it certainly, but if you will proceed with this Bill and delete the Article, then you will give those men the ammunition which they want.  They will be placed in the position where they have either to get out or to come into the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooper in his statement has shown that there are many difficulties in regard to the machinery which would be necessary to carry out the Article, but I think those difficulties should not be regarded as a reason why the Article should not be maintained in our Constitution.  I think the question as to whether or not the initiative is advisable ought to receive further and more ample discussion and consideration than it has received here to-day.  I believe that discussion can only take place before a Committee where due consideration will be given to all sides of the question and examination will be made as to the effect of the working of the initiative in other countries.  I believe that the removal of the initiative for the purpose of gaining what will appear to the public at any rate as a political advantage over an opposition party is most inadvisable at the present juncture.  I suggest that instead of postponing the <Col N="1019" /> further stages of this Bill, which I understand is the intention of the Government, that it should be withdrawn, and I believe that by doing so they will not weaken their position but rather strengthen it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. RICE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with the proposition put forward by Deputy Redmond and Deputy Baxter that this Bill ought not to be proceeded with at present, because it is inopportune and inexpedient to do so.  I do not think that any Deputy in the House has said a word in favour of this Article in the Constitution.  I agree entirely with the statement of the President that the Article is impracticable from the point of view of putting it into operation, and that it is useless if we could put it into operation. I do not want to speak with irreverence of any Article in the Constitution. I am by nature reverent, and my criticism is confined to this Article.  Deputy Cooper suggested it originated in Oregon.</P>
      <P>I read somewhere that it originated in Oklahoma.  One would imagine that it originated in the place mentioned in Gulliver's Travels, where the professors were engaged in wonderful inventions, such as making sunbeams out of cucumbers. I do not think this Article ought to be put into operation.  I submit there is no necessity to put this Bill forward at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, referring yesterday to this Bill, said the attempt being made by Mr. de Valera and his Party to use this Article of the Constitution was unconstitutional.  That is a view I entirely accept.  It is unconstitutional, and if it is unconstitutional, how can it be put into operation by this petition proposed to be raised by Mr. de Valera and his Party?  I hope the Government have taken advice as to the legal position in this matter.  I suggest that they should take such advice before they proceed further, because it appears to me that that is a consideration that should be taken into account before they proceed to legislate on this matter.  The Treaty contained a provision as to the oath to be taken by Deputies, and Mr. de Valera and <Col N="1020" /> his Party, by a legal quibble, suggest that there is no necessity under the actual wording of the Treaty to take the oath.  I describe that as a legal quibble, because, certainly, the condition that that oath should be taken is implicit in the Treaty.  It is part of the bargain made between the two countries, and you cannot get rid of the bargain without the consent of the other party, unless you are going to break your word of honour.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this matter upon which I would like to touch for a moment.  This question as to the oath was before the country, and it is perfectly idle now for the people who were defeated at that last election to deny that it was an issue in the election, because each Deputy who sits in this House, with one exception, perhaps, in express terms, or, at all events, implicitly agreed that this was a term of the Constitution he was willing to honour and observe.  It is idle, I say, for Mr. de Valera and his Party to say that the people of this State did not vote on this question, and that they did not defeat his view by at least two to one.  That happened on the 9th June last.  We were told yesterday by the Minister for Finance, in answer to a question, that the cost of having a referendum under this Article of the Constitution would be £85,000. I leave out of account for the moment the further financial loss to the State by the unrest and disturbance to the public mind that would be caused by this further appeal to the people.</P>
    <P>A sum of £85,000 is too much money for this poor State to spend in satisfying Mr. de Valera once again within a couple of months that the people do not accept his propaganda.  I think the men who would spend this money on a question of this kind are not serving the country and that this House would be failing in its duty to the country if it allowed that money to be spent that way.  We have a great many social problems to deal with in this State. We have still an enormous proportion of the people in the State living in houses that are not fit for habitation. That is a problem handed down to us from the past, but it is one which we ought to deal with as soon as possible. <Col N="1021" /> To my mind the man who builds one house for the people is doing more for the state than the man who tries to upset the oath in the Treaty.  Therefore I say if there was any danger of a referendum in this matter, I would certainly support the Government in bringing forward this measure at once, but I do suggest to them that there is no danger of a referendum.  There is machinery available if such a thing were attempted for stopping an unconstitutional movement by legal action, and I ask the Government not to press this measure forward at the present moment.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that the Government intend only to take the Second Reading of the Bill now and to proceed with the later stages in the next session. What is the advantage of proceeding with the Second Reading now instead of letting the Bill stand until the next session, because if they satisfy the House in the next session that this Bill is necessary for the purpose of stopping a referendum on this question, tried out at the general election, they will get a vote of the House in favour of the legislation.  I do not like the idea of proceeding with the Bill at the present time, because I am afraid it will create an unfortunate impression in the public mind that advantage is being taken of the present situation for the purpose of passing these second and third Bills. I agree entirely with the view that was expressed by Deputy Baxter in one form of language and by the Minister for Agriculture in another, that this proposal for taking a referendum on this question now is merely deceiving the people.  The people will learn something at all events from this discussion here to-night on that question without the Government pressing this Bill any further at the present time.</P>
    <P>There is undoubtedly an impression amongst a large section of the public &mdash;and when I speak of them I speak particularly of the constitutionally-minded people of the State&mdash;and there is an uneasy feeling amongst them that this Bill is inopportunely introduced at the present time.  I would appeal to the Government to take that into account, and if they find any necessity for passing this Bill in the next session, <Col N="1022" /> let them introduce it then and put it through all its stages in as short a time as they can, but I do ask them to let it stand over until that time, and get rid of this uneasiness and anxiety as to the introduction of the Bill at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan) Patrick McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of small points I would like to refer to.  It has been stated by one Party in this House that the allegation is bound to be made that opportunity is being taken of a certain situation to dish&mdash;I think that was the phrase used&mdash;political opponents, to &ldquo;do&rdquo; political opponents, out of something. We have had the description from the House this evening that what we are attempting to &ldquo;do&rdquo; political opponents out of is something that is worthless.  If that is the only charge that can be brought against people supporting the Bill, it is a charge which they can incur with easy consciences.  A Deputy asks why was not the statement, made by the President here this evening, made before.  That statement followed by the statements of other Parties would mean that de Valera would no longer be able to continue to fool his section of the people.  If we go further, and pass a Bill showing clearly that he is not going to be allowed to do that, then we are going to put political ammunition into our opponents' hands!  In other words, the people who would be so affected by the presidential statement that they would not allow any further fooling of themselves by this method will hold that they had been done out of something because a Bill has been passed stating&mdash;not merely a statement from the people of this House, but an effective vote of this House&mdash;that what has been pretended as a course of political action is no longer going to be allowed. Deputy Redmond, with the same conclusion of thought, as it seemed to me, says if you let de Valera know that a Committee of this House is going to sit to consider constitutional amendments he will surely realise the futility of his action regarding the initiative. De Valera is going to be convinced of the futility of his present course of <Col N="1023" /> action by the solemn announcement that a Committee of this House is going to be set up to discuss constitutional amendments, and Mr. de Valera is not going to be convinced of anything by this House voting that what he has attempted is not constitutional and is not going to be permitted!  I do not know where the logic of those thoughts may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rice has drawn attention to one other matter.  He asked a question yesterday with regard to the cost of the referendum, and was told it would cost £87,000.  It would cost that if it ever came off, but it is never going to come off.  No one in this House has any belief that this particular type of referendum is ever going to come off.  The State is not going to be put to that expense, but the State may be put to cost by opposing this Bill, not only at this stage to-day, but on succeeding stages. The Government are quite prepared to leave over the Third Stage of this Bill until some day in December, and to bring forward proposals, in the interval, with regard to this constitutional amendment and any other which may be necessary.  But it is for the House to remember what that may bring in the way of expenditure to the country if the Minister for Finance has to refrain from going for his national loan by reason of the fact that he thinks that there is sufficient public disquiet over this initiative and if he sees that the loan is not going to be a success before that question is decided. If short-term Bills have to be got for accommodation, and if the interest rises on them, let no Deputy who would object to this Bill hereafter object to that cost which has fallen on the country.  If certain people in this House who are anxious to see the Agricultural Corporation going as soon as possible find it is not got going at the earliest possible date, owing to the same reason, that money cannot be raised as long as there is disquiet in the public mind as to what is going to happen owing to this proposal, let those who are going to object to the wiping out of this worthless Article bear the blame for the consequences hereafter.  There <Col N="1024" /> can be no objection to holding over the matter.</P>
    <P>There have been fairly clear declarations here to-night which may be taken to mean two things.  First of all, everyone is agreed that the Article will not be used as the attempt is made to use it, and secondly, no amendment to that Article will be permitted which will give people, determined on unconstitutional action, power to do what they are now seeking to do through this Article.  As long as these two things are clear, it does not matter whether the Bill is proceeded with now or hereafter. There may be other accidental consequences, and let those who are going to object to this being passed now or on further stages reflect on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. COBURN Mr. COBURN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COBURN</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose the Bill for the simple reason that I think it is the avowed object of the Government to prevent Mr. de Valera from using Article 48 of the Constitution possibly to obtain a mandate from the people for the removal of the oath.  It is rather a bold and courageous step on the part of the Government, but, at the same time, I believe that it is an unwise one.  No one can deny that Mr. de Valera's declared intention to use the forms provided by the Constitution, in order to secure his object, is an avowed recognition of the Constitution. I am not enamoured of the involved and cumbrous machinery of the Constitution, but it is there, and it was put there by those who propose to remove it.  I think it is a rather dangerous expedient for any Government to put a limit to the prerogatives of the people, or to deny the right of any leader to use or take advantage of a right to which the Constitution, which that leader may tardily recognise, entitles him.  I cannot get away from the fact that the introduction of this Bill at this particular moment is inopportune, and I am convinced in that opinion by the speeches I have listened to from the Government benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture seems to be able to read the minds of Mr. de Valera and his followers and to anticipate what they are going to do.  I am not so suspicious.  I am one of those who, in season and out of season, have <Col N="1025" /> opposed Republicanism in all shapes and forms when, perhaps, the Minister for Agriculture and some other members of the Government were supporting it.  I believe that anything that would tend to prevent a considerable section of our countrymen&mdash;and, mind you, they are numerous, more numerous, perhaps, than Deputies in this House have any idea&mdash;from taking part in the Government of our country is one to be deprecated.  I sincerely hope that the Government will hearken to the <Col N="1026" /> advice tendered to them in all good faith by Deputy Baxter, Deputy Redmond, and other Deputies opposed to this Bill, and that they will postpone its further reading until the autumn session.  When that time arrives, if the Government are in a position to convince the Deputies of this House that it is absolutely essential to the safety of the State and the material welfare of the people in general to have this Bill in operation, I believe it will receive unanimous and generous support from all Deputies.</P>
