      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether the actuarial investigation of the Teachers' Pension Fund promised during the debates on the Primary Education Estimates on the 7th June, 1926, has yet been completed; and if he is in a position to say when the report of the actuary will be available.</P>

      <P>There has not been any avoidable delay.  There is nobody in this country who could be employed on the work, and arrangements were made with the British Government to assign an actuary to do this particular work.  He has been in this country in connection with other matters, and has been engaged on this work since November last.  While it will be quite impossible to say when exactly he will have the work finished, as each of the two previous investigations into the fund which took place occupied twelve months, it may be anticipated that his report will be available some time about November.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether any agreement was made with Messrs.  Lippens prior to 16th June, 1925, in respect to the erection of a Beet Sugar Factory, and the amount to be given by way of subsidy; if so, will he state the general import of the agreement and lay on the Table of the Dáil a copy of same; whether any agreement was made with Messrs.  Lippens or the Irish Sugar Manufacturing Company subsequent to the 16th June, 1925 (the date of the Second Reading of the Beet Sugar (Subsidy) Bill, 1925); if so, will he state the general import of the agreement and lay on the Table of the Dáil a copy of same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No formal agreement was entered into with Sir M. Lippens prior to the 16th June, 1925, in respect of the erection of a Beet Sugar Factory or of the amount to be given by way of subsidy, but after a considerable amount of correspondence and informal discussion Sir M. Lippens had been notified on 30th March, 1925, that the Government was prepared to agree in general terms to certain proposals which he had made.  A formal agreement was made between the Minister for Finance and Sir M. Lippens on the 1st October, 1925, which agreement was adopted by the Irish Sugar Manufacturing Company on the 26th February, 1926.  A summary of the proposals and copies of the Agreement referred to will be laid on the Table of the Dáil. The only difference of importance between the proposals and the formal agreement relates to the sugar production <Col N="405" /> on which subsidy would be payable in the first three years of the ten-year period.  At first it was proposed that the Company should be authorised to produce 10,000 tons annually in the ten-year period, with the right to increase the annual production to 15,000 tons in the last five years of that period. The formal agreement, however, provided for the payment of subsidy on the total amount of sugar produced in the factory in the first three years of the ten-year period, and fixed the maximum production on which subsidy should be payable at 10,000 tons per annum in the next two years and 15,000 tons per annum in the last five years of the period, subject to an over-riding maximum of 125,000 tons in the whole period.  The concession with regard to the first three years of the period was made because there were at the time of the agreement no reliable data with reference to the production of sugar beet in the Saorstát on a commercial scale, and no one could state with any certainty how many acres of sugar beet would require to be under cultivation in order to produce 10,000 tons of sugar.  The Company consequently did not know with certainty at that time what acreage to aim at in making their contracts with beet growers.  In order to secure the best terms for the farmer it was necessary that three-year contracts should be entered into, and the Government considered it reasonable to make some concession as regards sugar production in the first three seasons, when a high price to growers was insisted upon under the Beet Sugar (Subsidy) Act.  It was recognised that a good beginning was essential to the success of the enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be seen that at no period was the amount of sugar on which subsidy was payable limited to 86,000 tons over the whole ten-year period.  When I was making my annual Financial Statement on the 22nd April, 1925, I used the following words:&mdash;&ldquo;The amount of sugar which will be manufactured in the factory here is, of course, problematical, but it has been roughly estimated that the amounts will be 5,000 tons of sugar the first year, 6,000 tons of sugar the second year, 7,000 tons of sugar the third year, 8,000 tons of sugar the <Col N="406" /> fourth year and 10,000 tons of sugar each of the next six years.&rdquo;  After giving an estimate of the amount of subsidy based on these figures I went on to say:&mdash;&ldquo;In view of these figures and the fact that they might actually be exceeded, it is obvious that prudence dictates that we should not commit ourselves to more than one factory till our knowledge of all the factors governing the situation is considerably wider than it is at present.&rdquo;  Again on the Third Stage of the Beet Sugar (Subsidy) Bill I stated on the 24th June, 1925, that it would be in the interests of the factory to get not merely 5,000 acres, but 15,000 acres grown if it could.  The estimate of 86,000 tons in the ten-year period was based on the expectations of Sir M. Lippens and his associates, and was accepted by the Department of Agriculture. It must be admitted frankly that everyone concerned under-estimated the enterprise and adaptability of the Irish farmer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister recognise that he also said that the proposed cost of £2,000,000 is not greatly in excess of the experiment at Cantley, and the whole discussion centred round the idea of £2,000,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the best estimate that could be given, but it is quite clear that it was only an estimate. It is also quite clear that it was desirable to have more if it could be got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister suggest that there was any suggestion during the discussion that the State might be involved in the payment of £3,000,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It was certainly suggested that the State might be involved for more than a subsidy on 86,000 tons.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he received an application for a pension under the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923, from Edward Coughlan, Bridge Street, Kilcormac, Offaly, and if he can now authorise payment of the amount due or state the reasons why he cannot do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is in the affirmative.  This application was received too late for the investigation by the Committee set up by the Government to inquire into resignations and dismissals of Royal Irish Constabulary.  I have, however, considered the case carefully and am not satisfied that Mr. Coughlan's resignation from the Constabulary was caused by his national sympathies, and I am, therefore, unable to issue a certificate under Section 5 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923, which would render Mr. Coughlan eligible for a pension.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works, after consideration of their Engineer's preliminary report on the Erkina River proposed drainage district, decided to obtain a detailed report from a land valuer on the lands concerned, and this valuation is at present being made.  The existing Rathdowney drainage district and the Eglish and Johnstown proposed district are being considered in conjunction with the Erkina proposal.</P>
      <P>Considerable time must, however, elapse before any actual work can be begun, because even if the result of the valuer's inspection is to show that the scheme is a promising one, it will then be necessary for a more minute engineering inspection and survey to be carried out in order to determine exactly the works to be executed, and to estimate their cost before a scheme can be prepared and submitted to the occupiers of land to vote upon.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that Patrick Quinn, Francis Street, Newbridge, County Kildare (Serial Book No. 5011, Newbridge Branch Office) has been refused payment of unemployment insurance benefit, although he claims to have about 100 stamps to his credit for the period July, 1912, to August, 1914, whilst employed in the Curragh area, and 156 stamps to his credit in respect of his service, 1914 to 1926, in the Royal Dublin Fusiliers and Irish Guards; further, whether he will have inquiries made with a view to immediate payment of the amount payable by the Saorstát, and also have representations made to the British Ministry of Labour for payment in respect of his army service.</P>

      <P>Patrick Quinn, Francis Street, Droichead Nua, U.I. Book No. Droichead Nua 5011, claimed benefit at the branch Employment Office, Droichead Nua, on the 20th December, 1926.  His claim was disallowed by the Insurance officer under Section 7 (1) (i) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, as he had no contributions to his credit with the unemployment fund of An Saorstát. He appealed against the disallowance to the Court of Referees who <Col N="411" /> recommended that the claim be disallowed. The Insurance Officer accepted the Court's recommendation, and accordingly benefit is not payable on the claim in question.</P>
      <P>It is understood that 156 contributions were paid by the British Army authorities into the Unemployment Insurance Fund of Great Britain in respect of Mr. Quinn's service in the British Army.  These contributions having, as stated, been paid into the Unemployment Fund of Great Britain, are not available for benefit in An Saorstát.  They will, presumably, be available for benefit purposes if and when Mr. Quinn lodges a claim in Great Britain, subject, of course, to the conditions for the receipt of unemployment insurance benefit obtaining in Great Britain.</P>
      <P>Contributions paid in respect of Mr. Quinn between 1912 and 1914 would not in the circumstances of his case entitle him to benefit now in the Saorstát, a period of five insurance years having subsequently elapsed during which no contributions were paid for him.  Section 8, sub-section (4) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, provides as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A person in respect of whom no contributions have been paid during a period comprising five insurance years shall, if contributions are subsequently paid in respect of him, be treated as if he had not previously been an insured contributor.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>A claim to unemployment insurance benefit made by Mrs. Sarah Coffey, Clonmellon, in February, 1926, was referred to the Court of Referees under Section 11 (4) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, for a recommendation as to whether the claimant was unemployed within the meaning of the Unemployment Insurance Act.  Having considered the case the Court of Referees recommended that the claim should be disallowed under Section 7 (1) (ii) of the Act on the ground that the claimant was not unemployed.  The Insurance Officer accepted the recommendation of the Court and accordingly benefit cannot be paid on that claim.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he has been able to make any arrangement with the British and Northern Ireland Governments regarding reciprocal agreement under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, and if he is aware that many citizens of the <Col N="414" /> Saorstát holding insurance cards stamped with British stamps are deprived of benefits which they claim they are entitled to under these Acts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my answer to the question of Deputy Mac Eoin on this subject on the 19th December, 1924.  Both question and answer are reported in the Official Report of that date.  A reciprocal arrangement with Great Britain would involve a substantial financial adjustment in favour of Saorstát Eireann, migration of labour being mainly one way.  This the British Ministry of Labour declined to make, and it has not since indicated any change in its position. A reciprocal arrangement with Northern Ireland would, however, be quite simple, having regard to the more or less equal interchange of labour. Since I gave my reply on 19th December, 1924, the question of a reciprocal arrangement with the Government of Northern Ireland has been re-opened by the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress, and on the 18th March, 1926, I sent officers of my Department to Belfast to discuss the matter with the Ministry of Labour of the Northern Government.  These officers put forward for the consideration of the Northern Government a choice of six alternative proposals which exhausted all the forms that reciprocal arrangements on the subject could take, including a proposal in regard to which the Minister of Labour for Northern Ireland had previously expressed himself to the representatives of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress as favourably disposed.  The feasibility of these proposals was demonstrated by the officers of my Department.  At the time, the Ministry of Labour in Belfast neither accepted nor rejected the proposals, but in the following October, after a lapse of seven months which allowed ample time for full consideration of the matter, the Minister of Labour definitely announced that those proposals were not acceptable to him. I should add that the Northern Government has at no time made any concrete proposal for reciprocal arrangements. It has merely rejected all the proposals which my Department made, without <Col N="415" /> suggesting any modification or amendment, or indicating any alternative.</P>
      <P>The efforts I have made and the lengths I have gone to bring about a reciprocal arrangement for unemployment insurance indicate that I realise the hardship resulting from the present position to insured contributors who are not able to obtain unemployment benefit in respect of contributions paid in Northern Ireland, but so long as the Northern Government chooses to withhold its co-operation in this matter I am unable to do any more than I have done to solve the problem.</P>
      <P>In regard to unemployment books stamped with British stamps, I am unable to accept liability for the payment of all the benefit when all the contributions have been received by Great Britain. As that country is unwilling to credit me with the contributions on which I would pay benefit no further progress can be made in the matter.</P>

He was examined by the Pensions Medical Board on two occasions and <Col N="419" /> was found to be demented, but to have no abnormality in the head.  I suppose that is, no physical abnormality.  In order to avoid any possibility of hardship, a temporary pension was granted. The case was kept under observation for twenty-one months, and arrangements were made for an examination to be conducted by an eminent mental specialist.  The latter certified that the claimant's condition could not be connected with an injury, and that a mental breakdown was inevitable apart altogether from the question of injury.  The case is, therefore, clearly outside the scope of the Army Pensions legislation.  I regret that I am, therefore, unable to reconsider it.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(1)  In this section the expressions &lsquo;The Commissioner&rsquo; and &lsquo;new building&rsquo; and the word &lsquo;valuation&rsquo; have the same meaning as in the preceding section; the word &lsquo;tenement&rsquo; means any rateable tenement or hereditament; <Col N="433" /> and the expression &lsquo;the exemption period&rsquo; when used in relation to a tenement the valuation of which has been increased means either a period of five years from the date of such increase or the period from such date to the next date on which a general revision of valuation in an area in which such tenement is situate becomes effective, whichever of such periods is the shorter.</P>
    <P>(2)  This section shall apply to every building except the following, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>)  houses erected under the Labourers (Ireland) Acts, 1883 to 1919,</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>)  houses in respect of which grants are made under the Housing Acts, 1925 and 1926,</P>
    <P>(<i>c</i>)  buildings which are new buildings.</P>
    <P>(3)  This section shall apply to any increase in the valuation of a tenement, not forming part of a general revision of valuation in an area including such tenement, on an application for the revision of such valuation by reason of the erection, enlargement or improvement of a building to which this section applies which is included in such tenement, which erection, enlargement, or improvement has been begun and completed during the period from the passing of this Act to the 1st day of October, 1930.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where an increase to which this section applies is made in the valuation of any tenement, the valuation of such tenement shall, for the purposes of the assessment and levying of any rate raised by a local authority for the service of any local financial year commencing during the exemption period, be deemed to be reduced by two-thirds of such increase; and any reduction in the valuation of such tenement which under Section 69 of the Principal Act or this section has, previous to the making of such increase, been deemed to be made for the purposes <Col N="434" /> of the assessment and levying of rates for the service of any local financial year, shall be made for the same purposes in the valuation reduced under this sub-section after the making of such increase.</P>
    <P>(5)  The Commissioner shall determine whether any increase in the valuation of a tenement made after the passing of this Act and not forming part of a general revision of valuation in an area including such tenement was so made on an application for the revision of such valuation by reason of the erection, enlargement or improvement of a building to which this section applies which is included in such tenement, and such decision shall be indicated by the Commissioner on the appropriate revised valuation list, and as so indicated shall be final and conclusive and not subject to any appeal.</P>
    <P>(6)  Where an increase to which this section applies is made in the valuation of any tenement and at the time of or after the making of such increase a separate valuation is assigned by the Commissioner to a portion of such tenement not previously valued separately, the valuation of such portion immediately before the making of such increase shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to have been an amount bearing to the total valuation of such tenement then in force such proportion as shall be determined by the Commissioner, who shall indicate such determination on the appropriate revised valuation list, and such determination as so indicated shall be final and conclusive and not subject to any appeal.</P>
    <P>(7)  Subject to the provisions of sub-section (5) of this section any doubt, dispute or question which shall arise as to whether an increase in the valuation of any tenement is an increase to which this section applies, or as to the duration of the exemption period for any tenement shall be decided by the Circuit Court on an application by any person interested, and such decision shall be final and conclusive and not subject to any appeal and any amendments <Col N="435" /> which may be necessary to give effect to such a decision shall be made in the rate books and demand notes for rates.</P>
    <P>(8)  Section 15 of the Finance Act, 1925, shall have effect in relation to any tenement the valuation of which is deemed to be reduced under this section for the purposes of the assessment and levying of rates as it has effect in respect of a new building under Section 69 of the Principal Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it would be well to give a fairly long explanation of this amendment, as it is very important. Section 69 of the Principal Act adopted for the first time in Saorstát Eireann the idea of encouraging the erection, enlargement and improvement of buildings by exempting their occupiers from the full amount of rates.  The section was limited to buildings which will be completed by the 1st of April next.  The exemption from two-thirds of the rates which was conferred by the section only applied where the building was completely erected during the period, or where the enlargements or improvements made were substantial.  This last expression has been found in practice to give rise to uncertainty and to some apparent injustice. No one could be quite sure that any enlargement or improvement of a building would be considered to be substantial.  The result was a plentiful crop of disputes to be determined by me.  339 such disputes have been determined in a period of eight months. Of course, this uncertainty tended to prevent the section from fulfilling its purpose of encouraging building improvements. Inevitably also there was produced a sense of injustice in the persons whose improvements came very near being sufficiently extensive to be treated as substantial, but who received no remission of rates under the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-clause (6) of Section 11 of this Bill as introduced and passed by the Dáil extended to buildings and improvements completed before the 1st April, 1930, the remission of rates given by Section 69 of the Principal Act to buildings and improvements, completed by the 1st April next.  The clause proposed <Col N="436" /> no change in the nature of the improvements required before the rates could be remitted and only substantial improvements were affected.  The clause included a rather complicated machinery for dealing with the disputed questions which would arise under that extension as they have arisen under the original Section 69.</P>
    <P>During the debate on Section 11 in the Seanad the defects in the system adopted in 1925 were emphasised, and finally it was decided to delete sub-clause (6) (under which the period for completing the building was extended) and to substitute a different method of remission of rates on buildings erected or improved before the 1st of April, 1930.</P>
    <P>The new proposal, stated shortly, is that for five years after the valuation of a holding is increased by reason of building, only one-third of the increase is to come into effect for rating purposes. This covers all improvements causing increase in valuation and is not limited to substantial ones.  To take examples.  First, suppose a shopkeeper makes some structural alteration in his premises and the valuation is increased from £40 to £100.  The result of this clause would be that for five years he would pay rates on a valuation of £60, that is to say, only £20 of the £60 increase would come into effect.  Again, if a new house is erected on a plot valued at £10, and after its erection the holding is valued at £40, the rates for five years would be paid on a valuation of £20, only £10 of the increase of £30 coming into effect.  The advantage is that all improvements would be covered and encouraged and there would be no uncertainty.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that where all the premises in a rating area are undervalued each occupier pays a proper proportion of the rate, and that in such a case the increase of one occupier's valuation to an amount which is theoretically correct produces an actual injustice.  This injustice would be mitigated by the proposals in Section 12.  A general re-valuation of the rating area, however, at once cures the injustice I have just referred to.  Moreover, where a general revaluation of the area is impending the fear of re-valuation <Col N="437" /> is not a deterrent to persons wishing to build.  For these reasons the clause excludes from its provisions all increases in valuations made as part of a general revision of valuation, and provides that after such a revision all increases previously made shall become effective at once.</P>
    <P>One great advantage of the new clause is that it confines itself entirely to future building, and no building or improvement which has been begun before the Bill passes will be able to receive the benefits of the remission. There are certain complications in the clause which have been necessarily introduced to meet rare and peculiar cases which may arise, though in practice the new system will not be complicated but easy to understand and administer.</P>
    <P>The latter part of sub-clause (4) deals with the case where there are during the prescribed period successive improvements of a holding and successive increases in its valuation.  In that case each of the successive increases takes full effect until the five-year period has expired.  Sub-clause (6) deals with cases whose holdings are divided up into parts.  Sub-clauses (5) and (7) deal with determination of disputes.  The Commissioner is to decide the origin of any increase in the valuation.  Every other matter is left to the court.</P>
    <P>It is certain that a provision relieving persons who expend moneys on improving their premises from the full burden of rates for a short period is a useful and equitable provision, at any rate in the immediate future.  Section 69 of the Principal Act and Clause 11 of this Bill were framed with that object in mind.  I consider this amendment introduces a system which is an improvement on that embodied in the Principal Act, and I would ask the Dáil to accept it.  If this amendment is accepted, amendments Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 to Clause 11, which are consequential, should follow as a matter of course.  I move: &ldquo;That the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment 9.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="438" /> The following Seanad amendments were also agreed to:&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;That the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment 8:</P>
      <P>In Section 11 a new sub-section inserted at the end of the section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(9)  Sub-section (3) of Section 69 of the Principal Act shall be amended by the deletion of the words &lsquo;the Housing of the Working Classes (Ireland) Acts, 1883-1919&rsquo; and the sub-section as so amended shall apply as from the passing of this Act to any house erected under the aforesaid Acts.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment raises certain issues of some importance, and it will be necessary for me to deal with it at length.  To see this in its proper light it is necessary to realise that I introduced this Bill, so far as I could judge, as a non-controversial measure.  I only put things in the Bill that I thought would meet with general agreement, and I was quite prepared to delete anything in the Bill that was likely to provoke keen opposition or lengthy discussion.  My reason for taking up this line on this Bill was that the two principal sections in it&mdash;Section 6 and Section 7&mdash;when they come into operation, will effect a considerable saving in time, labour and money for local authorities.  But, in order to have the benefit of these sections for local authorities this year, it is necessary that the Bill should be in force before the 21st of this month.  As a matter of fact, as a result of this Bill not yet having passed the Oireachtas there is a great deal of doubt, confusion and <Col N="439" /> anxiety in my Department, and in local authorities generally through the country, because we do not know for certain whether the new system of applotment, which will come into operation under these sections, can come into operation or not this year. As I say, if we have not got the Bill before that date, we will have to do without the benefit of it this year.</P>
    <P>When Amendment 8 was carried in the Seanad I was placed in the position of having to choose between two evils&mdash; of accepting what I realised to be a thoroughly unsound amendment on the one hand and, on the other hand, of disagreeing with it, which would mean either that the Bill would be held up by the Seanad&mdash;held up, as a matter of fact, until after the dissolution, which would mean that the Bill would never become law&mdash;or, in any case, that the Bill would be so long delayed that it would be useless, as no saving would be effected under it this year.</P>
    <P>I shall quote from my statement in the Seanad:&mdash;</P>
    <P>As the Senator has explained, the motive of his amendment is to give to the occupiers of local authorities' houses a rates remission similar to that provided for private persons and public utility societies under the Housing (Building Facilities) Acts, 1924, and the Housing Acts, 1925-1926. This would give to the occupiers of the Marino houses who, as already explained, have had the advantage of what is the equivalent of £280 the added advantage of the remission of rates.  The capitalised advantage of such further benefit would, when calculated on present Dublin rates, amount to £63 10s. From this it follows that the tenant purchaser of a Marino house would get £80 more than the total assistance provided for under the Housing Acts for private persons and public utility societies.  At present the Marino tenant gets £17 10s. more, namely, £280, as against £200 plus £63 10s.  Furthermore, the majority of houses being built in Dublin under the Housing Acts by parties other than the Corporation are being built by speculative <Col N="440" /> builders, and in the sale of the house the State subsidy is divided between the builder and the purchasing occupier.</P>
    <P>In that statement I tried to make clear to the Seanad that houses constructed by the Corporation and by other local authorities were being let on more favourable terms than other houses. My figures on that occasion were challenged and, as a result of that challenge, I have had the figures very carefully inquired into, and I accordingly give a further statement to elucidate the general figures I gave on that occasion.</P>
    <P>Following the consideration of this question in An Seanad the figures relating to the houses provided in Dublin under the Housing of the Working Classes (Ireland) Acts have been examined in detail, and the average in relation to a single house has been calculated in respect of all the houses concerned. It will be understood that figures varied in relation to each individual scheme, owing to different conditions as to site and the continued fall in building costs, etc., but the average figures will, of course, apply relatively to all schemes.</P>
    <P>Five-roomed houses have been built and sold by the Dublin Corporation (and Borough Commissioners) at Fairbrother's Fields (357), Donnelly's Orchard (84), Marino (431), and Croydon Park (880).  The average all-in cost of the houses, including expenditure, was £756 per house.  The average all-in cost, excluding acquisition of land, was £733, and excluding acquisition of land and development £648.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the Minister made it clear that that includes the Fairbrother's Fields houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes&mdash;the average for all the houses.  The houses have been sold on lease at an average price of £428 per house, subject to an average annual ground rent of £2 16s. per house.  From these figures it will be seen that the average price of land per house was £23, while development costs averaged £85 per house, making in all £108 per house between land and development.  It was contended in An <Col N="441" /> Seanad that as a ground rent was being charged no expenditure in respect of the acquisition of land should be included in the cost of the houses for sale purposes, and that, partly for the same reason and partly because the roads were public roads, development cost should also be excluded.  So far as the ground rent is concerned this contention would be sound if the ground rent covered the cost of these services, but an examination of the facts will show that this is not so.  The ground rent is merely a charge to secure reversion of the land to the Corporation when the leases have expired.</P>
      <P>This is essential to ensure that the new housing areas will not become slummed when the houses have decayed. In regard to the roads being public roads, it should be mentioned that the roads included in the costs quoted are not roads which would be required had not the houses been built. The expenditure on roads, sewers and water-mains, etc., was, without doubt, consequent on the provision of the houses and must be charged to the cost of the houses.  True, some recognition should be given to the nominal ground rent.  As stated, this rent is £2 16s. per house or £4,900 (approximately) on the 1,752 houses referred herein.  A generous estimation of the market value of this ground rent would be, say, 18 years' purchase, equalling £88,200.  The expenditure on acquisition and development of land in respect of these 1,752 houses at £108 per house is £189,216, which is £101,016 in excess of the value of the ground rents.  This excess represents £57 per house, and when added to the net cost of the house, which, excluding land and development, is £648, brings the latter figure up to £705.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sole effect of Sections 12 and 69 and the sole effect aimed at in our housing legislation is to encourage building and reconstruction.  The amendment as it was intended will not do this.  In fact, it will have the very opposite effect.  It will have the effect of placing individuals already in an extremely fortunate position in the still more fortunate position of having houses provided for them by the local authorities without any effort of their own under conditions more favourable <Col N="442" /> than apply in the cases of houses acquired under other circumstances at the expense of the ratepayers.  The intended amendment would put an additional burden of 3d. in the pound on the ratepayers of the city of Dublin. That burden would have to be borne, directly or indirectly, not merely by wealthy ratepayers but by those unfortunate slum dwellers, many of whom would give the two eyes out of their head to be able to get into those Corporation houses about which complaints are being made.  As well as asking the ratepayers, including the inhabitants of the poorer areas, to shoulder this additional burden of rates for the purpose of giving additional subsidies to these houses you are lessening the chances of the slum dwellers and people living in the poorer areas of ever being able to get similar houses for themselves, as you are not only diminishing the possible Building Fund of the Corporation and the other local authorities by decreasing their rate returns, but also as a result of a kind of post factum legislation you are imposing unforeseen and unlimited liabilities on local authorities, so that they will be very slow to commit themselves to further building schemes which may completely upset their finances.</P>
    <P>I believe if this amendment, as it was intended in the Seanad, were carried it would have a very serious effect on building by local authorities throughout the country.  If this amendment did what it was obviously intended to do in the Seanad I would unhesitatingly recommend the Dáil not to accept it.  However, I have gone into the amendment carefully and I find as a matter of fact that it will practically have no effect on the section, as, owing to a fault in drafting, it will not achieve the result which was intended. Therefore, I am going to ask the Dáil to agree with the Seanad and accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the effect of the amendment would be so far as technicalities go, and, therefore, I am not going to try to argue the point with the Minister.  He has made it clear, at any rate, that so far <Col N="443" /> as he is concerned he is going to do all he can to prevent the benefit of the remission of rates which has already been given, at his instance or at the instance of the President, to the wealthy people of the city who have built new premises being given to the people enjoying the benefits of the Corporation housing schemes.  There is a good deal of mystification about these figures.  I am afraid the statement of the Minister was not easily understandable in the way he presented it.  Perhaps if this matter were to be postponed for a day or two we might have the figures before us in such a way as that we could read them.  I take it he is standing on the statement he made elsewhere.  I really think there is some need for clarification of the figures which have been presented officially by the Corporation and the Minister.</P>
      <P>The figures presented by the Commissioner for the Corporation do not bear out the figures the Minister has put forward.  I think that it might be as well to draw attention to a certain rather important fact regarding this question of the remission of rates on these houses and the remission of rates generally.  I hope the House will not forget that the initiation of this scheme came from the President or the Minister for Local Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us remember that this proposal referring to the remission of rates was taken on the initiative of the Ministry, and when we are reminded by the Commissioner of the cost of these remissions, as we are in the morning paper, it is well to remember that the greater part of that cost is in relation to houses which were built and premises which were erected before the date of the passing of the Act in question.  That is, it was retrospective. We are told, of course, that it is a very heavy charge.  The Minister says that this proposal, if it had effected what it was intended to have effected, would have incurred an additional burden of 3d. in the £.  I calculate it at something less than 3d., but the additional burden that is at present being borne, according to the Commissioner's statement, is 4d. in the £.  That is to say, out of a total of £36,000 valuation, which is affected by these remissions, £31,033 is valuation in respect of ratings of £100 or over. The rich companies are enjoying a sum in the remission of rates which involves a charge on the City of 4d. in the £. Then they come and throw into our faces this sum of 3d. in the £ on the rates.  I think the House should be informed of some of the facts in regard to this Dublin housing scheme and the way it affects the case that is put before us by the Minister and his Commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told by the Minister that since 1920, 1,750 houses have been sold under the purchase scheme, and the cost of these houses, excluding the cost of acquisition, was £1,287,000 odd, and that they have been disposed of for £750,000.  He did not tell us that the Corporation had received, in respect of these houses, a sum of £804,750; so that taking into account the amount of money received from the Government <Col N="445" /> and the amount of money to be received from the tenants, the Corporation is making a profit out of these schemes of £267,000.  The suggestion, of course, is that the Corporation is going to lose too much if this amendment becomes effective.  But I am going to take the case that the Minister himself has made.  The Minister has told us that certain of the houses built by the Corporation are not sold. They are rented.  The houses cost £700 each, approximately, and they are rented at rents averaging 8/6 per week.  I do not know where these houses are, but taking his figures, he says that it leaves an annuity of £11 12s. 6d. towards funding the capital expenditure of £700.  But the tenants of these Marino-Croydon Park houses, who are in the same position in life and who are not able to pay any more than the tenants of these rented houses, are obliged to pay 16/- and 17/- per week. Some of us, I, for one, remember my earliest lesson in Political Economy. I remember reading, when I was about ten years of age, in a school-book, that no man should pay more than one-tenth of his income as rent.  I wish we could apply that in Marino, Fairbrothers Field, the Boyne Street area, or any other part of the City.</P>

They would sell them very cheaply if you buy them now and take delivery after 40 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking of the quality and the difference in the <Col N="446" /> value of houses being purchased and houses being rented.  From the point of view of the occupier, taking into account his weekly income, it matters not much to him whether his dwelling is rented or whether it is being purchased. It is so much out of his weekly income before he can begin to live.  The Minister gave us a lot of figures which I am not able to follow in the reading.</P>
      <P>I have also some figures provided by the Corporation, and I find they do not work out quite as the Minister's statement would have the House believe.  In the course of his statement he has been referring to the Marino-Croydon Park houses, costing approximately £700 per house on an average.  He said also that they were being sold at an average price of £420 a house.  I have not been able to find any house sold at less than £420.  I wonder will the Minister tell me how many houses in that area have been sold at less than £420 and how many have been sold at more than £420, or is it not a fact that £420 is the lowest price at which any of these houses have been sold?  I have before me one purchase agreement which speaks of £460, and I have two at £420.  I know it is round about those figures that the houses in the main have been sold.  I might not have been able to reach a fair sample of the thousand houses in the locality, but perhaps the Minister could tell us whether the £420 which he spoke of was, in fact, an average?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The average cost of the houses in the Croydon Park-Marino area, including acquisition, development, cables and public lighting, none of which should be charged to the occupier, was £663.  That is the average for 1,283 houses.  The cost of the acquisition and development, etc., is round about £80 per house in respect of three contracts and £66 in respect of another of the contracts.  That is a long way from the £700 that the Minister quoted in respect of Croydon Park-Marino, and it nullifies his argument completely when he says that the benefit derived by the occupying purchasers of these houses is so much greater than the benefit accruing to those who are receiving the benefit of the public utilities scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="448" /> A question has been raised on which I would like to have some explanation. The Minister said that the charge for ground rent is merely intended to secure a reversion to the Corporation at the end of the period.  I would suggest to the Minister that he could do that at much less than £3 per year.  If that is the whole object, he might be able to do it at 1/- per year.  Three pounds a year for 99 years for land, the acquisition cost of which was fourteen guineas, leaves a fairly handsome profit.  You expend fourteen guineas and by the end of 99 years you have had an income of £300.  That is all merely for the sake of getting the reversion at the end of the lease!  The Minister claims that the cost of development should, in fact, be taken into account in making up the value of these houses when you are comparing them with the value of the houses of the public utility societies and other private ventures.  The comparison, if it is to be a fair one, will have to include in respect of the public utility houses on Malahide Road about £75 per house for development, and the alleged benefit that is being given to the Corporation houses has to be reduced by this sum for development, public lighting, public cables&mdash;£75, £80, or £85 per year per house.</P>
    <P>The President has told us, and the Minister has confirmed it, that the sums of £700 on one hand and £280 on the other have reference to the Fairbrothers Fields site as well as the Croydon Park-Marino site, and that they include the cost of development and the cost of acquisition.  The Fairbrothers Fields cost of acquisition and development amounts to £163 per house.  This charge against the cost of these houses in the Fairbrothers Field area has to be taken into account before you can arrive at this £700 cost per house.  There is £128 per house for development, £35 for acquisition.  Certainly there is no justice in making the tenant purchasers of those houses pay a sum of £128 per house for development, and in taking that cost into account when making a comparison between the public utility houses which have no charge against them for development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="449" /> This Fairbrothers Field house includes that sum of £163 for the acquisition of site and development, and we have a total all in cost of £893.  The Government paid a subsidy in respect of £488&mdash;at least the Government subsidy was charged in that fashion against those houses&mdash;leaving a sum of £404 or thereabouts to be charged to the tenant.  Now, one is not complaining of the action of the Corporation in dividing the Government grant of that time in the way it did, but if there is going to be a remission of rates to Clarke's factory, Player's factory, to new banks, cinemas and printing-houses costing the city 4d. in the £, it is certainly a fair thing that such remission of rates should be given to the occupiers, the purchasing tenants of these houses, for the period of six years which is proposed in the motion.  When a man who is earning, when he is working, £4 a week or £3 10s. or £3 a week is asked to pay 17s. a week for the rent of his house, it is an unreasonable burden and an impossible burden when he is out of work, as he unfortunately too often is, and it simply forces him to endeavour to take in subtenants. I regret to hear from the Minister that this amendment which he proposes should be accepted is not going to have any effect.  If that is the position it is a regrettable one, and I hope the time will come when it will be possible to remit rates on houses of this kind, as it is possible and has been decided to remit rates on the houses of wealthier citizens and of the big companies.</P>

      <P>The President says that I have not proved that it is not done.

That is a fairly good item for the cost of collection and book-keeping. However, this tenant had to <Col N="450" /> pay as soon as he went into the house the same rates as any other tenant in the city.  If that is not a proof that the remission of rates has not yet had effect&mdash;&mdash;</P>

All that we are asking in this matter is that the people who have been relieving the pressure upon these tenants, should be allowed something like the same privilege in respect to rates remission as the wealthier people whom the President has fathered and backed in this matter.</P>

      <P>Before any other Deputy speaks I would like to know whether we are quite clear as to what we are doing.  An amendment has been passed in the Seanad to this Bill.  The Minister thinks that the amendment is of no effect, but he has moved that the Dáil agree with it.  I think that that procedure should get very careful consideration before we adopt it.  I say that without any regard to the merits of the question.  If this amendment is of no legal effect, then it has no meaning and the question is whether we ought to adopt it at all.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I am going to move that we disagree with the Seanad in this amendment.  I think it will not require very much study on anyone's part to realise the close proximity of an <Col N="451" /> election in this amendment.  Now, what is intended?  It is this: to let in those houses, to which Deputy Johnson has devoted a good deal of time in his speech, which have been built out of the million grant or by reason of the assistance given by the Government grant of one million under the Housing Facilities Acts of 1925 and 1926.  But that is not on the face of this amendment. This is a fool amendment, and it certainly reflects no credit on the Seanad to send down an amendment of this sort.  The amendment reads: &ldquo;(9) Sub-section (3) of Section 69 of the Principal Act shall be amended by the deletion of the words &lsquo;the Housing of the Working Classes (Ireland) Acts, 1883-1919.&rsquo;&rdquo;  Now, there are no such Acts.  There are the Housing of the Working Classes Acts from 1890-1919. The amendment goes on to say: &ldquo;and the sub-section as so amended shall apply as from the passing of this Act to any house erected under the aforesaid Acts.&rdquo;  The sub-section as so amended seeks to prevent all houses from getting this remission.  That is what it amounts to, and that is what it means.  As I have said, it is the close proximity of the elections&mdash;the fervid haste with which members of the Seanad sought to buy votes, because this is little short of that&mdash;that has resulted in the amendment being put down in that form.  A certain well-known man rubbed his hands and said: &ldquo;That is 2,000 votes as soon as this is passed.&rdquo;  That is not the way to do public business, and I hope, at any rate, that we will agree on one thing, and that is that issues should be put straight and fair before the people of the city and country on all these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson, when addressing himself to this matter, brought in the parallel of a big firm such as Player's and said that this ought to apply to houses built under the Housing Facilities Acts.  What is the difference between the two? Player's constructed huge industrial institutions without any subsidy from the Government.  They built their big institutions at a time when building <Col N="452" /> costs were high, and they got no assistance from the Government.  They gave employment in the city at a time when employment was much needed, and when their institutions were built they were valued at a fairly high figure.  In the case of houses erected under the million grant or under the Housing Facilities Acts these got substantial subsidies.</P>
      <P>He has been at some pains to show that in the sales which were effected by the Corporation in respect of houses built under the Housing Facilities Act they pooled whatever advantages were to be derived from the incidence of the rate charge and gave them a cash value, which really amounts to about £170.  A house cost approximately £750, less the £100 Government grant, less the £100 Corporation grant, less the pooling of this rating advantage amounting to about £70.  Eleven houses were sold on the Fairbrothers Field site for £327 each; 10 for £361; 191 for 378; 4 for £429, and 134 for £394.  The all-in cost of these houses was £950.  It is all moonshine to be talking about excluding the cost of development and the cost of the acquisition of the site from the cost of the house.  If I am going to build a terrace of 10, 15 or 20 houses in any part of the city, I will have to acquire a site and put down roads and pathways in order to attract people to increase the valuation of the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Corporation gives the same advantage in this connection, which I believe they did in recent years.  The fact is that somebody has to pay some contribution. Most of it has been coming from the municipality as well as the Government in order to assist in providing houses.  There is no comparison between the big factories, banks and institutions for which no subsidy has been granted, and those houses built in respect of which a subsidy is given by the Government and the Corporation, and also from the pooling of rates&mdash;from whatever advantages there are in that gradual increase from one-twentieth in the first year to nineteen-twentieths in the nineteenth year.  This is a fool amendment.  It is no credit to the Seanad to send down that amendment. I for one object to our Statute Book <Col N="453" /> having such a discreditable sub-section in an Act of Parliament, and I hope the Dáil will reject it.</P>

      <P>I have no knowledge of the legal effect of the amendment.  I have not investigated that.  If I did investigate it my view would not be valuable on that particular aspect.  If, in fact, the House accepts the view that this amendment does not mean anything, then the House should give most careful consideration as to whether it should accept the amendment.  If the Minister's dilemma is that he must get this Bill passed in some form by a certain date, I think it would neither be consonant with the dignity of this House to pass the amendment, nor a proper procedure in our relation with the other House to do so.  Putting it from both angles, from our own point of view and the point of view of our relations with the other House, the procedure which is involved in agreeing to the amendment seems to me under the circumstances to be wrong.  The only remedy that seems to be open to the Minister, since the practical effect of the argument he has made to the House is that the amendment ought not to be accepted, is to induce the Dáil to disagree with the amendment, and so place upon the other House, if that House insists on its amendment, the onus of holding up the <Col N="454" /> Bill, notwithstanding his plea of urgency.  In my opinion the Minister should not ask the Dáil to agree to an amendment which, according to himself, effects nothing.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Local Government stated that the adoption of this proposal of the Seanad would delay the provision of houses for the workers and the slum dwellers.  I ask the Minister whether anybody within his Department is dealing at present with the slum dwellers.  How can he expect slum dwellers to pay 17/6 per week, when he knows that for the past few months in the Dublin Police Courts notices to quit have been issued against slum dwellers, and people even have to give up Corporation-owned premises.  The slum dwellers are not able to pay anything more than from 2/6 to 4/- a week.  I ask the Minister for Local Government and the President if the day has not arrived when some authority ought to deal with the housing in areas such as those in North Cumberland Street and around Gloucester Street, where the people, <Col N="455" /> a couple of months ago, were left on the roadside in the early hours of the morning.  There is nobody dealing with these slum dwellers.  The slums were never worse than they are to-day, and congestion was never so bad.  The President is aware that the Corporation, a few years ago, had before them a report that there were 22,000 families herded in single-room tenements.  The same thing exists to-day, but, if anything, it is worse than it was at that time, because of the number of tenements which fell into decay during the war period.  The number of houses that were being built was not sufficient to replace those that were going into decay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. BYRNE Mr. A. BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>We hear so much of that, and it is going on for the last twenty years to my knowledge, while the class of whom I am speaking are in a worse condition than they were ten years ago.  These people cannot pay 17/6 a week, as proposed, for municipal dwellings.  Somebody ought to get busy immediately and try to provide for them.  I am sure if the Commissioners were to get a report from their Chief Medical Officer it would give them a deplorable account of what is going on in the slums of Dublin.  I take this opportunity of saying that I support the proposal to give the benefit of the remission of rates to all dwellers in houses erected under municipal dwelling schemes.  As was mentioned by previous speakers, in the same areas as these, houses are being built by various public utility societies, the average rent of these houses being 15/- a week, and there is a remission of rates.  A few years ago in the Phibsboro' district a private speculator started building houses, grants were given in respect to them, and I am glad that even in the case of these houses remissions of rates were also given.  This inequality of people resident in houses built under municipal housing schemes, who do not get the remission of rates, while those in the same area, living in houses built by public utility societies, get the remission <Col N="456" /> of rates, is rather unfair.  The house purchase scheme is an exceptionally good one, but I am inclined to agree with Deputy Johnson that at the end of forty years the houses will not be of any great value to the owners.</P>
      <P>I look forward anxiously to the day when the Government will take up the question of housing for those people who are living in tenements.  I know one instance where seventeen families, each of four or five persons, are living in a tenement house with panes of glass out of the windows, which are stuffed with paper instead, with one lavatory in the yard, and having to come from the top of the house practically to the cellar to get to the lavatory and to obtain water.  That is going on in Dublin and it is time for it to cease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion to reject the Seanad amendment. The President has emphasised very clearly the difference between the assistance given under the 1925 Act by means of the remission of rates to people who set up buildings in a city and in the case of the housing schemes that are dealt with here.  The principal reason why I am against giving the remission of rates to houses under the building schemes we are now discussing is that, while rents in these cases are really terribly high, nevertheless the main building problem in the city requires to be dealt with, and while those rents are high, it must be remembered that the people living in the houses have good homes.  If the Dublin Corporation is to be further prejudiced in the matter of its income I do not see how the main housing problem in the city is to be dealt with.  Deputy Byrne has drawn attention to the position of the tenements.  Under the recent building schemes the number of houses built is 1,782.  They do not cater for the non-tenement population in the city, the demand for houses by people outside the tenement population, and a considerable amount of work still requires to be done for that population.  Coming to the tenement population, it has been suggested here that people have been taken out of the tenements.  People have not really been taken out of the tenements.  The population of Dublin in 1911 was 304,802.  At that time one-seventh <Col N="457" /> of the population of the County Borough were living, four to a room, in one-room tenements.  You had 43,985 people living under those conditions at that time&mdash;one-seventh of the County Borough population.  Since the census of 1911 there has been an increase in the County Borough population of 11,669, and when the examination of the recent census has been completed, or that portion of it that deals with the tenement population, it will be shown that the increase in population in Dublin County Borough has been an increase in the population in the most congested districts, and we have, in the capital of Ireland, to face this position, that the number living four to a room in one-room tenements and comprising at present perhaps one in six of the population of the County Borough, is increasing, and that nothing that we have contemplated up to the present in the line of a housing scheme, good, bad, or indifferent, is dealing with or facing that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite clear that you have a housing problem in the country, outside the housing problem that presents itself in the Dublin tenements, but the problem in the tenements transcends any other housing problem in the country.  That does not mean that you can turn aside from your other housing problem and leave it untouched, but you have to face the appalling position, from the point of view of the housing problem, that exists in the tenements. The President has raised the question, on the point of rents, as to whether <Col N="458" /> houses can be provided at a lower rent than 17/6.  It is a hardship for non-tenement dwellers to have to pay 17/6 a week for a home, but if you examine the conditions of employment and the other conditions under which our tenement population dwell it will be quite clear that the solution of the tenement problem in Dublin cannot be by the provision of houses at 17/6 a week for them, and that the city is likely, when this question has been fully gone into&mdash; as it must be gone into soon&mdash;to have very serious financial drains on it.  We ought not further to put a drain on the purse of the city that we need not necessarily do until this problem has been thoroughly examined.</P>

They are willing to do that for the rich element in the community, but they are unwilling to do it for the poorer element in the community.  They say: &ldquo;We must not do that&mdash;the rates, the rates.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what the Dáil has been asked to do, and I submit it is not conducive to a proper respect for the Legislature, for the law, for order or for the maintenance of agreements.  The proposal was a fair one.  The proposal was one to make it possible for these poorer people in the community, not the very poor, but the poorer people in the community, to get something like the same <Col N="462" /> benefits in regard to the remission of rates as was given to the rich.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The House has done nothing of the sort.  The Dáil in this matter has simply followed up the policy which it has adopted and laid out for itself during the past four years.  Under the Housing Facilities Acts of 1924, 1925 and 1926, provision was made for the remission of nineteen twentieths of the rates in the first year, eighteen-twentieths in the second year, and so on down for twenty years until, at the end of twenty years, the occupier of one of those houses, built under the Housing Facilities Acts, would pay the normal rate.</P>
      <P>In the year 1922, the Government provided £1,000,000 for housing in urban areas, and, as Deputy Johnson himself knows, the Fairbrothers Fields and the Boyne Street area houses were built in Dublin mainly through that grant.  The average price per house in Fairbrothers Fields was £950.  Allowing £500 contribution from the State, there was left £450 to be paid by somebody.  The Dublin Corporation paid £450, and I read out here this evening the various prices at which these houses were sold.  Now mark this, that in the first place these people got £950 worth of property for less than half of that sum, and to Deputy Johnson and to everybody else of his class I say, deliberately, that when the Dublin Corporation paid over £700 for the construction of these houses, they paid it to workpeople in this City, and they did not ask for repayment from these workpeople of that amount. They asked for something less than two-thirds of that amount.  In other words, if I paid a man £6 a week to build a house for me and then I said to him, when he had the house built, &ldquo;You can take that house and I will only charge you two-thirds of what I paid you for building it,&rdquo; the man would be getting a good bargain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sooner we make up our minds that the housing problem is not to be dealt with by platitudes or by bribes, or by making unfair statements regarding the incidence of this economy, the better for everybody.  Let the people know that every brick and every piece of mortar and every slate <Col N="463" /> and every piece of wood put into a house has got to be paid for, and that the men earning their money in building that house have to be paid, too. That is the money that is affecting the rent.  When we claim that rents are too high and that the cost of living is too high, and all the rest of it, examine what it is that is making the cost of living so high.  We have done everything that we reasonably could to allow people to get healthy houses and to allow them to take possession of those houses, and to allow them to buy them.  We cannot sell them at less than they cost, allowing for the subsidies we give.</P>
    <P>In this case we have taken an average. The Minister for Local Government and Public Health has examined the average cost of five or six of the schemes operating since the million grant was given, and the average works out at £756.  The houses were sold for an average price of £428, and £328 had to be put up.  It was found by somebody. Under the Housing Facilities Acts the Government gave £100; it was larger under the million grant.  The Corporation estimate of costs included a £100 subsidy under the Housing Facilities Acts and £70 in respect of the rating incidence I spoke of. For instance, if the rating of a house were £6 a year, in the first year the man would be charged only 6/-.  Instead of that they levied the whole amount and gave him an advantage of £70 in respect of an item valued at £63 10s.  Deputy Johnson has no right to say that people have not that advantage. They have that advantage.  Deputy Johnson wants to give it to them again.  I say that we would give them twice as much if we could afford it, but somebody has to make it up.  All the time the people that Deputy Byrne has spoken of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I say we can, although Deputy Johnson and the Vice-President disagree with me in that. They say I am a bad judge.  I am prepared to accept that I am a bad judge <Col N="464" /> in that respect.  I am further prepared to say that those people who built in Dublin since 1920 have built at an uneconomic price.  They certainly have shown some courage, much more courage than the people on the benches opposite.  They have shown great courage by sinking their money in schemes when the highest prices ruled.  They put their money into something which now would not give them anything like the price they paid; they put their money into houses which, if sold now, would not pay them.  I say of those people that for their courage and industry some advantage should be given to them and they should not be salted all the time.</P>
      <P>In the case of persons who have rebuilt or reconstructed, every possible facility should be given.  It is unfair in the case of a man living in one area surrounded, as he may be, by four people who do not build, that because he has built his house it should now be valued at the modern rate, whereas the houses of his four neighbours are valued at the rate existing 40 or 50 years ago.  The houses have exactly the same accommodation, yet his house is valued at a higher rate by reason of the fact that it was recently built.</P>
      <P>Deputies can easily rail about these things because they have not had the experience; they have not had to pay a high cost.  They can only be interested in one thing, and that is finding fault with the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The major portion of this long and somewhat technical Bill is, in fact, merely a codification of the existing law with the necessary adaptations consequential on the recent changes in our judicial system.  If Deputies will turn to the Second Schedule of the Bill they will see there are no less than seventeen statutes, beginning with one passed in 1800 and ending with one passed last year, repealed by this Bill.  In so far as the Bill consists merely of a codification of the statutes hitherto existing, the only question that arises is whether the draftsman has succeeded in incorporating in this present Bill, with the necessary verbal alterations, the substance of these existing statutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are satisfied after careful examination that that, in fact, has been attained, and, of course, administratively it is a considerable advantage to have simplicity attained by codification of that kind.  I would not propose to delay the Dáil with any elaborate statement on this Bill in so far as it achieves merely codification of the existing law, but I would propose to direct the attention of Deputies to any changes in the substance of the existing law which this Bill purports to affect. These substantial changes in the existing law are not numerous.  I will deal <Col N="467" /> with them as we go along.  The first change, and one to which some publicity has been given in the Press, is the proposal to exempt women altogether from jury service as they were exempted until 1919 when the British Parliament made them liable equally with men.  Deputies will, perhaps, remember the position created by our own Act of 1924, which was a departure from the position under the Act of 1919.  Under the Act passed in 1924 the Oireachtas decided that women, who for any reason were unwilling and reluctant to serve as jurors, could be dispensed on application, in fact should be dispensed automatically on application, from jury service, and we have found in practice that very few women wish to serve on juries.  We have found also that the few who do are very frequently challenged by one party or the other in litigation.  I find that, taking the period of twelve months, out of thousands of jurors who served in the State less than fifty, in fact about forty, are women.  Taking the year 1925, I think that the number of women who served as jurors was exactly about forty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister know how many were challenged?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not any figures with regard to challenges.  One could put it roughly by saying that probably not one woman served for every five hundred men.  That is the result under the 1924 Act and, taking that as the result, my point of view is simply this, that for that result it is not reasonable, it is not good business to go to all the administrative expense that is necessary to arrive at even that result, that you have to go as your first step, through the process of putting all women on the jury list, sending them circulars, asking them whether they wish to serve or not, and then attempting to provide separate accommodation in the courts for women jurors.  I do not think that there is standing ground between the position of the 1919 Act and the position that we are proposing to take up in this Bill of ours of 1927. Certainly it would be absurd, for a result of fifty women jurors in a year, <Col N="468" /> to continue to go to the trouble and expense necessary to arrive at that result.  The proposal in the Bill is to restrict liability for jury service to men.  On that point I would like to make it understood that the proposal is not put forward in the point of view that women are incapable of rendering reasonably good service on juries. Women who have served on juries have rendered reasonably good service, probably as good service as men who have served in that capacity.  But the proposal is put forward in recognition of the fact that the great bulk of the women of the country are unwilling, most reluctant, to serve on juries, and that it is not necessary to compel them. The machine will work without compelling the woman juror to come forward. We can, without undue hardship on the eligible male population, keep the courts served with juries.  I know that self-appointed spokeswomen have taken the stand that this is a slight on their sex and they purport to speak for, presumably, the adult feminine population of the State.  They claim that under the proposal of this Bill the women of the State are wronged by being ruled out from some of the services of citizenship.  It seems to me that that is almost as if a vegetarian, speaking on behalf of the human race, or the human race within the area of jurisdiction of his particular State, were to demand that legislation should be passed prohibiting the use of meat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People are entitled to their individual views, and I am not quarrelling at all with the point of view of individual women who yearn for jury service, but I am denying her right to speak or write as if she were appointed to express the views of her sex in the State when we have the best of reason for knowing that those are not the views of the vast majority of the women in the State.  Under the Act of 1924 less than 10 per cent. of the total number of women eligible for jury service remained on the register under the optional provision, and of that 10 per cent., 40 or 50 served in a year.  They were challenged from time to time as they appeared by one side or the other in litigation.  Certainly I would not suggest to the Dáil, or to the Minister <Col N="469" /> for Finance, that the 1924 provision should be continued, and I am faced therefore with putting forward either a reversion to the 1919 Act or the proposal that is embodied in this Bill.  As between those I do not hesitate.  It is not necessary to compel women to perform this service which is an unpleasant service even for men.</P>
    <P>There is an aspect of the matter which must be touched upon.  I had to consider lately the question of the services of stenographers in the courts, and the question arose would we have women stenographers in the Central Criminal Court and in the Circuit Courts throughout the country.  On that point I took the decision that women stenographers would be unsuitable, for a reason that many Deputies will appreciate at once.  Extremely unpleasant cases come before the courts, cases of indecent assault, of rape, and, occasionally, of sodomy, and so on, and I would not take the administrative decision of subjecting women officials to a task of taking down verbatim evidence given in cases of that kind.  That consideration applies equally in the matter of juries.  I do not want to overstress it, but it is a fact that cases come before the courts not infrequently which one would not like to discuss with the feminine members of one's own family.  If you stand for the 1919 provision, compulsory jury service for all women, you have got to contemplate women members of your own family, or women members of a friend's family, being compelled to serve on juries when cases of that kind arise.  The statute which was passed in 1919 by the British Parliament was passed because of things that were said and written and urged in Great Britain.  Whatever pressure there was for that statute was not shared to any degree at all by the electorate of this country at the time, but an Act was passed, and because we were at that time part and parcel of the political system of Great Britain it applied here.</P>
    <P>In 1924 we retreated from it to the position of optional jury service for women.  Now I am suggesting to the Dáil that we should cut clear there from the rather anomalous position we are in under the Act of 1924.  That is <Col N="470" /> the first step in changing the existing law which I wish to draw the attention of Deputies to.</P>
    <P>The second change of any importance is a proposal to abolish special juries.  As long as special juries remain it would be necessary to keep in each county a separate book of special jurors, and the rate collectors, county registrars, and all the other officials concerned in the preparation of lists of jurors will be at the trouble of distinguishing in the lists of registrars and jurors book between special jurors and common jurors.  It would be further necessary for the Minister for Justice to consider as regards each particular jury district what would be the proper rating qualification for special jurors.  Even in some counties, and I think fairly many, common jurors have the grievance that the special jurors have very little to do, and, as such, are exempt from service as common jurors, with the result that the burden on the common jurors is made more severe than it ought to be.  There is the general question whether the system of keeping a separate list of special jurors is not open to the objection that it is a survival of class legislation.  Underlying it there seems to be a suggestion that only gentlemen, or, at any rate, persons living in houses with a high valuation, are competent to try certain classes of cases, and that a man who is good enough to decide whether or not a prisoner is to be hanged by the neck until he is dead is not good enough to decide the merits of a slander action between, let us say, two strong farmers. That, I think, is the technical expression.</P>
    <P>There is also the point that a person with a high valuation is not necessarily the better juror.  It is not quite an established rule that a man's intelligence and honesty is directly proportionate to the poor law valuation of his house.  That seems to me to be the suggestion underlying this system of special jurors.  I do not think any strong feeling exists in favour of the retention of special jurors.  So far as we have been able to gather, there is a fair degree of unanimity in well-informed circles that, in Dublin at least, the common juror is as intelligent <Col N="471" /> and as impartial as any special juror could possibly be.</P>
    <P>The third point deals with the question of challenges.  There is a proposal to reduce the number of challenges without cause.  The present position is that the defendant is entitled to challenge 20 jurors without showing cause in cases of felony.  In cases of misdemeanour he is entitled to challenge six. Further in felony cases, if two or more persons are indicted for the same felony by one indictment, each is entitled to the full 20 challenges without showing cause, unless they expressly consent to join in their challenges. That is to say, that where three persons are being tried together for armed robbery, they can order 60 jurors to stand aside without showing cause.  In cases of misdemeanour, however, where prisoners are being tried together, their right of peremptory challenge is limited under Section 10 of the Act of 1876 &mdash; the Procedure Act &mdash; to six jurors in all.  They are not entitled to sever their challenges.</P>
    <P>In civil cases the present law as regards peremptory challenge is stated in Section 10 of the Act of 1876: &ldquo;In all civil trials in the superior courts the plaintiff or plaintiffs on the one hand, and the defendant or defendants on the other hand, respectively, shall be entitled to challenge, without cause assigned, in all six jurors, and, in the inferior courts, in all three jurors.&rdquo; Jurors may be challenged for cause shown without limit of number in criminal and civil trials.  That is, no man need have his case tried by any juror to whom he can show any reasonable objection, and it cannot be doubted that the court will not put any difficulty in the way of such challenge. If there is reasonable objection, the court will allow the challenge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so.  It is not proposed to alter the law in any way in so far as it bears on the question of challenges for cause shown. The reduction is only a reduction in the number of peremptory challenges without cause shown.  When we are discussing the proposed reduction in the number of peremptory challenges, it must be borne in mind that what is limited is the right of parties to challenge jurors against whom they can show no reasonable objection whatever.</P>
      <P>In point of fact, the exercise of this present right of peremptory challenge in criminal cases has resulted in something approaching a scandal.  The prisoner first objects to any juror to whom he can show any reasonable objection. That he is entitled to, and will remain entitled to it.  It is right that he should do that.  But he then proceeds to challenge persons against whom he has no valid objection, except that he suspects them, from appearance or reputation, to be persons who will respect their oaths as jurors by convicting the prisoner if the evidence satisfies them that the prisoner is guilty.  If several persons are being tried together, the jury which is finally sworn is composed of those members of the panel whose appearance or reputation is considered by the prisoners to be least promising from the point of view of the impartial administration of justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a practical administrative consideration that perhaps should be mentioned, and that is that in selecting a panel for any sitting of a court, the officer making the selection has to bear in mind the probability that a great number of jurors will be challenged without cause shown and, consequently, a panel is selected which is frequently anything from five to six times greater than is really necessary, or than ought to be necessary.  It is considered that this is unfair to the jurors, and increases the expenses of the courts to the State.  The proposals as regards the right to challenge without cause shown are set out in the Bill.  We believe those provisions to be ample to cover what should be the rare case where a prisoner has any real cause to <Col N="473" /> object to a juror, and yet cannot express his objection in a sufficiently definite form under his right to object for cause shown.</P>
    <P>There is a change proposed in the matter of the honorarium to jurors in civil cases.  It is proposed to depart from the time-honoured one and ninepence, which was fixed a long time ago, to five shillings.  I may admit that the change is not in any ratio to the alteration in the value of money since one and ninepence was fixed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The challenge to the array was a challenge of the entire panel on the ground of some technical mistake in its preparation.  It was a thing that never operated in practice. A challenge to the polls, of course, is a simple challenge, either a peremptory challenge without cause shown, or a challenge for a cause shown.  But the challenge to the array was to have the entire panel set aside.  It is proposed that the rateable qualifications for jurors shall be fixed not by Statute but by Order, and that is a matter which perhaps requires some explanation necessary for a juror is fixed by Act of Parliament, namely, by a schedule to the Jurors Qualification (Ireland) Act of 1876.  The qualification there is between county and county and between towns and country, the idea being to fix in the district a qualification which would provide sufficient jurors while maintaining a certain standard of responsibility.  The Act in question is 50 years old, and it is suggested that circumstances have changed considerably since 1876.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This appears to us to be eminently a matter which ought not to be dealt with by Statute, but should be capable of being varied to suit the varied circumstances in each county.  The distribution of land, for instance, in a <Col N="474" /> particular county would affect the matter.  If the land in any particular county is being divided in such a manner that large holdings are disappearing and being replaced by more numerous small holdings, it is clear that where a qualification of £40 might previously have secured a sufficiently large panel of jurors, under the changed circumstances it would produce hardly any panel at all.  There is also the consideration that there is no security that the standard of rating will remain the same for a long period. As regards houses, the present position is that the rateable valuation does not even approximate to the actual annual value.  In short, our view is that the Minister for Justice should be in a position to revise at frequent intervals, if necessary, the rateable qualifications for a juror in any county or part of a county, having regard to the actual circumstances of the moment.  In some counties at present under the statutory rule there are far too many jurors and the standard is too low.  In other places, not so frequent, the exact opposite is the case.</P>
    <P>Under the law as it stands, there is, in general, one book for the common jurors of each county.  So far as the criminal work goes there is no objection to this arrangement, as criminal juries have always been drawn and will continue to be drawn from the entire county.  Juries for civil cases are drawn only from the civil bill division with which the court is dealing at the moment.  If we take, for the sake of clearness, a county of moderate size with only two large towns at which the County Court Judge formerly sat: To each town a definite area was assigned called the civil bill division, so that the county was divided for civil business into Civil Bill Division A and Civil Bill Division B.  It is assumed that the Circuit Court will continue to sit at these two towns in this particular county, though in general the Circuit Court will not sit at as many places as the County Court sat.  Assume also that it will be found convenient in the Circuit Court, as in the County Court to have a system that, except for urgent matters, any court that sits in a given town will deal only with the civil business <Col N="475" /> arising in a definite area around that town.  In small counties the whole county will probably be the area &mdash; for instance, a county like Longford.  In large counties there will perhaps be two or three areas for as many towns. Coming to the question of the jury book in this county with its two divisions &mdash; Civil Bill Divisions A and B &mdash; at present there is only one jury book for the entire county.  But the law prescribes and the actual practice is that when the court sits at A in one of the Civil Bill Divisions, the jurors for civil business shall be drawn only from that area &mdash; only from that Civil Bill Division. The jurors are arranged in the county book in alphabetical order without regard to their particular place of residence.  In the ordinary way the officer selecting the panel would merely read through the names in alphabetical order until he had a sufficient number of jurors.  This plan must be modified if he is to exclude all the jurors except those from Civil Bill Division A &mdash; the particular civil bill division in which the court is sitting.</P>
    <P>The statute therefore provides that in this particular case the officer selecting the panel shall, whenever he comes to the name of a juror who does not reside in the division, pass over that name.  In that way a panel is obtained composed entirely of jurors residing in that particular Civil Bill Division.  The objection to this system is that the names in the jury book are not marked off in regular order.  The sequence is gapped or broken.  The twenty-third name in letter A may be struck off before the twenty-second, and the last name before several names that occur higher up.  That difficulty, taken in conjunction with the difficulty in construing the meaning of Section 18 of the Jurors (Ireland) Act, 1871, has resulted in all sorts of difficulties and irregularities, not perhaps serious in themselves and certainly not such as are likely to cause a miscarriage of justice, but such as it is thought desirable to remove now when we are revising the law upon the subject.  What is proposed is to have a separate jurors book for each division.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="476" /> In this county that we are taking as an example with two Civil Bill Divisions there will be a jurors book for each division.  When a civil panel is required for Division A it will be drawn in strict sequence from the jurors book for that division.  Similarly for the other divisions.  When a criminal panel is required, whichever division the Court is sitting in it will be drawn from the entire county.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the only other matter to which I should draw the attention of Deputies is the exemption set out in the first schedule from jury service. These points exhaust the substantial changes in the law as it hitherto existed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point the Minister has not dealt with.  I do not know whether it is changed or not, but it occurs to me that the position, as stated in the Bill, seems to require alteration.  It is the question regarding the administration of oaths.  I find, for instance, that a juror who states, with regard to his religious belief, that he is neither a Christian nor a Jew, may, if the judge will so permit, be sworn in any manner which he states to be binding on him.  &ldquo;If the judge so permits.&rdquo;  But if the judge does not permit?  Then we have sub-section 5 of Section 50, which says: &ldquo;If any juror refuses to be sworn or insists on being sworn in a manner not authorised by or by virtue of this Act he shall not be included in the jury then being sworn, but the judge shall impose on him a fine not exceeding £10 and not less than £5.&rdquo;  So that we are asked to pass an enactment which leaves a religious man who is neither a Christion nor a Jew at the mercy of the judge's predilections in that matter &mdash; that he will necessarily be fined £5 if the judge does not permit him to be sworn in a manner which his religion makes binding.  That is a difficulty that I think might be looked into.  It seems to me it is likely to cause injustice if we had Chinamen, Mohammedans, Confucians, or any other particular religious people coming to this country who are not Christians or Jews.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other point I want to <Col N="477" /> touch upon is the portion of the Minister's statement regarding the reaction from the position of the previous Act in respect to women jurors.  I could imagine the Minister making exactly the same case if he was proposing a new franchise Bill which stated that voters shall be only male persons.  It would be a very great convenience in the running of elections if there were no women voters.  It would save an immense sum of money to the Department of Finance if all the women voters were eliminated.  All the inconveniences and administrative difficulties that are due to the appearing of women on the jury list might well be said to be applicable to the case of women voters.</P>

      <P>I only mentioned finance in reference to the middle position &mdash; the position in the 1924 Act. The expense is out of all proportion to the result.  But if you are prepared to consider the 1919 position, then I do not urge expense there if you are prepared to advocate the whole hog &mdash; compulsory jury service for women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>My position, frankly, is that, as the Constitution expresses it, privileges and obligations must go together for all citizens, and it always seems to me that jury service is one of the corollaries of voting power.  It is one of the necessary obligations that go with the privilege.  I agree at once that there may be many exemptions, but I think we are wrong, quite apart from the practical working out of this thing, in enacting, in this bald way, that only male persons shall be jurors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should imagine that if this object were to be really sought it would have been better had it been put in Section 4 and had we stated: &ldquo;Any person of the female sex or any person who has been or shall be convicted of treason or treason felony or of any felony or of perjury shall, unless she or he shall have obtained a free pardon therefor, be absolutely disqualified from serving as a juror.&rdquo;  It seems to me that we are, in effect, cancelling the position embodied in Article 3 of the Constitution, which required that obligations and privileges should go together.  This <Col N="478" /> is an obligation of citizenship, and we ought not to make the bald and blunt distinction that only males should serve on juries.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with some difficult questions.  It is quite apparent that there are many cases in which one would not like to have women serving as jurors.  But in most of those cases there is either a woman in the dock or a woman in the witness box.  If the woman in the dock or in the witness box has to suffer all the indignities, indelicacies and indecencies that come out in court, I think it is not too much to expect a woman in the jury box to undergo the same ordeal.  If that is not a sufficient reason, you can secure your end in that particular class of case by using the power of challenge. You might even make it one of the grounds of challenge.  The judge always knows beforehand the character of a case.  If it is thought necessary to save women the ordeal of serving in this particular class of case, then service could be obviated by way of challenge.</P>
    <P>I think the present proposal is undesirable and is creating another sense of grievance amongst one sex in the community &mdash; one half of the citizenship of the country.  It may be quite true to say&mdash;I think it is true&mdash;that 99 per cent. of women would be glad to be relieved of this duty.  But 99 per cent. of men might be glad to be relieved likewise, so far as they themselves are concerned, though they would not agree that it would be a desirable thing to abolish the jury system altogether. There are a considerable number of people who go so far as to say that because they have occasionally to bear the burden and submit to the obligation of jury service that the jury system ought to be abolished altogether. I think we are taking a wrong step in this Bill and that we are giving another occasion for an agitation of a kind which is not healthy and which is undesirable and should be avoided.  Ninety-nine per cent. of the women of the State might be glad to be relieved of this duty, but nobody knows better than the Minister that the other one per cent. can create as much friction as will cause inflammation of the whole <Col N="479" /> body.  It is the other one per cent. that does the damage to the whole body, and I think we ought not to give them deliberate occasion for creating that local friction.</P>

      <P>If a man could say that he had the charge of ten children, he would be exempted by the judge in the same way as a woman.  I think we are making a mistake in the manner and form of achieving an end which the Minister thinks represents the wish of 99 per cent. of women.  I think the Bill in that respect has a defect, and it is only a question of years when it will be remedied by going back to the position of equality of the sexes in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill which contains a mass of details which, in the main, can be more suitably discussed in Committee.  I only want to suggest to the Minister that when he is concluding this debate he should deal with this question of the exemption of women from jury service on a rather broader basis, because, as far as I have been able to follow his argument, he dealt with a matter of principle very largely on the grounds of expediency &mdash;financial convenience, administrative convenience, and so on.  I, personally, think that except from the financial <Col N="480" /> point of view &mdash; to which, of course, we must all give due weight &mdash; the existing position is a fairly satisfactory one.  It does not compel any woman who wishes to avoid jury service to serve.  She can claim exemption.  It does give an opportunity to those women who realise their responsibilities as citizens to serve, and it further gives them an opportunity of educating their own sex, so that there may be in years to come not 5 per cent. but 15 per cent. or 20 per cent. of qualified women asking to be allowed to serve on juries.  What, after all, is the basis underlying the whole theory of trial by jury?  It is that the prisoner in the dock &mdash; I am speaking now particularly of criminal cases&mdash;is tried by his peers.  Deputy Mrs. Collins-O'Driscoll is not here, and I venture to say that there is no Deputy sitting in the Dáil now who will claim to be woman's equal.  Some of them may claim to be woman's superior, but they would hardly pretend to equality. And there are some cases &mdash; even criminal cases, and even the unpleasant cases to which the Minister referred&mdash;in which I believe it would be advantageous to have a woman on the jury, however painful it might be to her. Take the case to which the Minister referred &mdash; rape.  As a rule, there is only one witness in a case of rape, and that witness is the person on whom the rape was committed.  It is very much easier for a woman to tell whether or not another woman is telling the truth than it is for a man.  I would go so far as to say that it is almost impossible for a man to tell whether a woman is telling the truth or not.  After all, the object of this Bill is not to shelter women or to remove them from a sphere in which they are unsuitable.  It is to secure the better administration of justice, and I still have considerable doubt as to whether this exemption of women from jury service is going to secure a better administration of justice.  I am not absolutely decided on the subject. I am open to be convinced by the Minister. But those doubts do exist in my mind, and I hope the Minister will deal with the question on broader lines than he dealt with it when he opened the debate on the Bill.  It seems anomalous that a woman barrister may sit in <Col N="481" /> court, and even plead to a jury of men, while a woman may not serve on a jury. It is even more anomalous that under one sub-section of this Bill a woman who is not allowed to sit on a jury is, nevertheless, obliged to send her husband to represent her if she has rateable property of a certain value.  Her husband becomes liable for jury service. That seems hardly a fair proposition, and I think the Minister should give us fuller grounds than he has given us for this proposal.  The exemption of women is only portion of this Bill, and it is a portion which we can consider and vote on in Committee. The rest of the Bill represents a desirable reform, but I would like broader reasons and stronger arguments in regard to the position of women in respect to jury service.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice gave an excellent democratic reason for doing away with the special jury.  He declared that special juries represented class legislation, which gave a peculiar advantage and privilege to men because of their higher rating.  Is it not peculiar that the Minister who is so alive to democratic principles in regard to special juries should not realise that his own proposed legislation, by which he would exclude one whole class of citizens from service on an ordinary jury, is also class legislation, and is undemocratic?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>If I play on the word &ldquo;class&rdquo; would the Minister prefer that I should use &ldquo;species&rdquo;? Does the Minister ask us to believe that woman is less than man&mdash;a distinct and separate species?  If he does not ask us to believe that, will he refuse to accept ordinary language and describe women citizens as a class of citizens?  Surely, a Government that has been so meticulous in its Civil Service Regulation Act as to introduce sex, sex, sex repeatedly in its various clauses is alive to its own operations, as separating men from women within the law, and while assigning certain duties to one, removes them from the other?  Would the Minister <Col N="482" /> suggest any other term that would describe the thing better than the term &ldquo;class legislation&rdquo;?  The principle upon which he does away with the special jury class is a sound principle.  It is thoroughly democratic. But when we come to equality of citizenship a woman, because she is a woman and for no other reason, is to be barred.  The Minister is quite alive to the fact that representative women have spoken in denunciation of this proposal.  He gets rid of the authoritative character of their statement by describing them with the customary jibe, as self-appointed.  After all, they may retort, has the Minister any special mandate for this legislative proposal that would save him from the retort that in this matter he is a self-appointed exponent of the views of women citizens?</P>
      <P>We all know, very well, that service on a jury is not a popular thing.  No one, man or woman, is eager to serve on a jury.  I remember on one occasion passing near a house where a man had committed suicide.  I was on the point of being imprest on the coroner's jury and I was very glad to plead the privilege of being a barrister, to exempt myself from service.  That, no doubt, was bad citizenship.  I plead guilty, but in that I represented the vast majority of human beings who, though they recognise the doctrine of citizenship and are willing to accept the responsibilities it imposes, would be very glad to be exempt from service when on occasion it is unpleasant or irksome, or where it involves, as it did in my case, interference with the discharge of the work that they are paid for doing.  The Minister's case for himself as not self-appointed is that under the provision of the Act of 1924, which allowed exemption from service to be applied for by women on the panel, not ten per cent. of women were willing to serve.  That is a very fine example of special pleading.  Let me put this consideration to the Minister.  Supposing there was a similar Act allowing men to ask for exemption, that they had merely to apply in court for exemption and exemption was accorded, what percentage of men does he calculate would be willing to serve on a jury?</P>

      <P>I am not as adept as the Minister at the ready manufacture of statistics.  He can very well understand what human nature is. As a matter of fact, there is a long list of exemptions from jury service on the British statute book, as a result of continuous petition.  There was a time when to sell stamps exempted a man, and many people paid the duty for the licence to sell stamps in order to get the exemption that went with it.  What is the case that the Minister has made for interfering with the law as it at present stands?  That women do not like service.  But he does not propose to exclude men because men do not like service.  What he is trying to hide from the public is that it is not because women do not like service he is exempting them but because it is women who are in question.  We have seen this all along with regard to the treatment of women under the Civil Service Regulation Act.</P>
      <P>There are unpleasant cases.  Does the Minister think that men like these? There are people with tainted minds that love the tainted matter, but I think the vast majority of decent men would shrink from the ordeal of sitting on a jury and hearing details of certain types of cases.  It applies equally to the clean-minded man as it does to any woman.  The Minister introduces a lot of sentimentality that did duty in the Victorian age, by which men and women are discriminated between. Chastity is demanded from women with such insistence by writers and public speakers that we would be almost led to believe that the insistence on it was meant to suggest that the same law did not exist for men.  Why is a man to be considered as a proper victim for listening to these cases and pronouncing a verdict?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not assent to the principle, if it can be called a principle, that underlies this discrimination, this supposed superior delicacy of soul or spirit.  A woman well on in years, a married woman who has seen a great deal of life, knows and understands many of the details of the under-world quite as well and has as keen an appreciation of <Col N="484" /> what it involves, more so perhaps in some cases, than an ordinary man much younger and of less experience, but the younger man is to be selected for the jury and the capable woman excluded because she is a woman.  It always comes back to that last resort, that when we analyse and look for a reason it is because it is a woman is in question. The Minister, in the course of his argument, allowed us to know that stenographers, the official shorthand notetakers in the courts, are to be exclusively male for a similar reason. Women of certain Victorian ideas ought to be precluded from this occupation.</P>
    <P>Where is it to stop?  The next provision will be to exclude women from membership of the Dáil.  Deputy Cooper has drawn attention to the fact that women are eligible for membership of the legal professions, and surely it is an absurd anomaly that the same class who may be briefed to take part in an inquiry into one of those unpleasant cases will be excluded from service on a jury in a similar case.  The Minister on another matter, the matter of challenges, spoke in language that showed a similar prejudice animating him.  He spoke as if the prisoner in the dock was always guilty.  The prisoner in making his challenge without cause was to scan the countenance and the appearance of the proposed juror, and if he felt that a juror showed indications that he would comply with his oath and find a verdict according to the evidence, then the prisoner would have that juror challenged without cause.  It is part of the mentality of the Minister that is exemplified in that jibe.  He began with jibes.  I do not care to mention individual names, but I have before my mind, without mentioning the name, one woman writer who protested in the daily newspapers against this proposal, and I think if the personality of the writer and of the Minister were subjected to a public verdict, the verdict would unquestionably be with the writer in question, as authoritative an exponent of educated women's opinions and desires in public life at least as any member of the Executive Council.  You do not get rid of cases by jibes.  The Executive <Col N="485" /> Council of the present day hugs the pleasant delusion to its soul that if it is merely scornful enough and derisive enough it has got rid of an excellent argument and well-founded principles.</P>
    <P>The exclusion of women from service on juries serves no good cause.  In addition to putting a badge of inferiority on women as women, it discourages women as a class, or would tend to discourage them, from taking a practical interest in public affairs, more particularly with regard to the application of laws.  Surely if the Oireachtas, in framing the Constitution, gave equal citizenship to women as to men, and thus recognised that their votes, the votes of women, were as good as the votes of men in the selection of legislators, administrators and controllers of administration, it follows as a rational corollary that the same class of mind, exercised out of the same type of experience, would be serviceable also for the advantage of the State in taking part in the administration in the courts of law of the legislation made by the legislators that they had voted into office.  If it could be shown that women were hysterical in the jury box or that they had given good grounds in consultation in the jury room for the belief that they were incompetent or prejudiced, a case might be made, but that case was not made here.  The Minister did not attempt to say that the experience of women on juries was one which showed them to be disqualified by sex.  Statistics might have been forthcoming surely if a real case were to be made.  The whole thing is based on sentiment and on a priori considerations: these are women, they do not like it, it would please them to be excluded, it would save them from the necessity of petitioning for exemption, therefore we will exclude them.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave an extraordinary illustration of the protest of leading women, women whose names are identified with all the movements in favour of the acquisition and assertion of equality of citizenship for women.  The vegetarian, he said, wants to do away with the use of meat by everyone. Those women, on the contrary, are not vegetarians declaiming against the use of meat.  The normal general practice <Col N="486" /> in regard to dictaries is the use of meat, and they claim that they are the real advocates of the use of meat and not vegetarians.  It is the Minister who is the vegetarian; it is the Minister who wants to reserve for one class and for one section, if he likes, of the community a certain civic right by the exclusion of another section.  Now the great consideration in this matter is: is it a privilege, service on a jury, or is it a duty?  I regard it as a duty while at the same time I sympathise with those who would prefer to escape its burdens.  Those who wish to escape the burden and are women can do so under the 1924 Act.  If there are others of public spirit, actuated by high motives in the interests of the community and of other women, who are willing to undergo the inconvenience and all the attendant annoyances of serving upon juries, why should a law be passed here to say &ldquo;you shall not&rdquo;?  Above all, what is the meaning that is given as a reason for that imperative, &ldquo;You shall not&rdquo;?  It is: &ldquo;You are women.&rdquo;  Do women pay rates and taxes?  Are they not concerned in the operations of the law? Is not a woman as much concerned as any ordinary citizen in the right finding of correct verdicts by juries?  This is class legislation and of the very worst type.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion, as I rather expected, has centred mainly around the proposal to exempt women citizens from jury service.  Deputy Cooper invites me to discuss that on a broader basis than that on which I based the proposal when speaking on the Bill.  I do not know that I ought. I think the basis I put forward is broad enough to carry the proposal.  Under the 1924 Act we made the exemption of women citizens automatic on application, and what did we find?  That not more than 10 per cent. remained on the register and who, judging by the protests when they turned up in Court, remained on the register only because of inadvertence or failure to take a positive step that would have secured exemption for them.  They were very dismayed and very concerned when the summons to serve on a jury came <Col N="487" /> along, and in a great many cases their first act in court was to protest vehemently to the judge against being summoned at all.  There are difficulties of accommodation, financial difficulties, and so on, that if they are to be faced must have some result in proportion to the expense and trouble of facing them. There is the question that courthouses in accommodation, and particularly in accommodation for juries, was provided in the past for men only, and certain obvious embarrassments arise when the accommodation has to be shared by both men and women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be said that is a small matter. Any money consideration is generally said to be a small matter.  To expend a certain sum of money would remove that difficulty.  The same remedy, of course, removes a great many difficulties, if not all, but it is not a remedy which we are anxious to apply if it can be avoided.  In view of the question of numbers, which I dealt with, we do not think there is a strong enough case for its application in this matter.  Many women, as I have said, did not put in a claim for exemption at the right time. They did not take the positive step that would secure exemption, but they did not hesitate to ask for exemption at a later stage from the judge in court.  In the year 1925 in all the juries, numbering thousands of jurors, which sat throughout the State, including the very numerous juries in the Central Criminal Court, Dublin, there were between 30 and 40 women, and that is the net result of what may be described as permissive service, optional service under the 1924 Act.  To achieve that result every rate collector in the country had to return every year to the county registrar the name of every woman who had the necessary rateable qualification, and the county registrar had to inquire of each woman whether she wished to be exempt, and if she did so wish he had to strike her name off the list.  If she did not express the wish to have her name omitted off the list, her name appeared on the jury book and she was duly summoned on the jury panel.  If she got on the panel she frequently asked to get off, and if she remained willing to serve she was <Col N="488" /> frequently challenged or ordered to stand by.</P>
    <P>All that is not done without expense. My submission is that expense is not justified, and that we are entitled to assume there is no such strong feeling in the country as to make it necessary for us to continue this system.  There is a somewhat parallel case &mdash; there is the case of a man who is in every way fit for jury service but has not the necessary rateable valuation.  He, as you know, may be ten times richer and more thoroughly educated than many men who have that qualification.  Why is not that man called for jury service? The answer is simply that we can get enough of jurors without, and it would cost a good deal in additional inquiries to get a list of such men.  That is one aspect of the case.  With regard to women jurors, we can get enough of jurors without them, and it costs us more in machinery to get them to the very limited number of 30 per annum than we think justifiable.  That is my case, for if you measure the cost, beginning with the rate collector and the county registrar down to the sub-officials that it took to deal with the women's section of the jurors list and apportion that between the 30 women who served in 1925 you would have got them dear.</P>

If you are to add to that substantial sum in the provision of accommodation in the court for women jurors, and set against that the result of 30, 40 or 50 women jurors per annum, as under the 1924 Act, then I say it is not a business proposition.  There is some case for exemption, as there is for exempting the wealthy man who lives in a hotel. He is too dear to get at.  The administrative expenses make it not worth while.  The machine will work without him, and that is partly my point of <Col N="489" /> view with regard to this question of women jurors.  We can fill the jury box.  Men are not called on oftener, I suppose, than about once every three years.  It is unnecessary to impose on the women citizens this service which such a high proportion of them find extremely irksome and unpleasant.  It is not just good enough to make the debating point that we would all find it unpleasant, that men would find it unpleasant, that men would be glad to be released.  Men qua men, if I might put it that way, would not be glad to be released.  The individual with his own concerns, and so on, would, no doubt, be glad to escape jury service that would make an encroachment on his time and on his occupations.  But men have not that shrinking from the duty, that reluctance to go into the box and face the ordeal of sitting for perhaps four, five or six days trying a man for his life that the normal woman has. A few words in a Constitution do not wipe out the difference between the sexes, either physical or mental or temperamental or emotional, and the Deputy knows it, but it suits him to pretend that it does.  It does not.  The case is this: The vast majority of the women citizens of this country, as of most countries, dislike this work, dislike it intensely, and would be grateful to the Government that would relieve them from it.  We can afford to relieve them from it.  There is not the necessity of putting this unpleasant duty on the women section of the country's citizenship.  There is no standing ground between compulsory feminine jury service and the proposal in the Bill.  The attempted standing ground of the 1924 Act is simply ludicrous in its results, and in expenditure and administrative trouble out of proportion to these results.</P>

Therefore I, at least, am satisfied that there is no standing ground between the 1919 Act and the 1927 Bill.  It has got to be one <Col N="490" /> thing or the other.  It has got to be compulsory jury service for women citizens on a position of complete parity with men, or it has got to be exemption.  They have got to be classed with the Governor-General, the Attorney-General and members of the Oireachtas as people who are exempt from jury service.  Deputy Johnson asked why did I not say that felons and women are disqualified.  That is a quibble.  Instead of saying that, I say that the Governor-General, Deputy Magennis and women are exempt from jury service.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  Under the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, appeals from the Circuit Court in civil cases are triable by two judges of the High Court, sitting in Dublin.  Owing to abnormal circumstances, as I hope, the High Court, as at present constituted, has been unable to cope with its ordinary first instance business and at the same time to hear Circuit Court appeals promptly and with sufficient expedition to keep arrears from accumulating. There are at present 520 appeals pending, the oldest of which dates back to October, 1925.  I am satisfied that these arrears cannot be disposed of in any reasonable time without special assistance.  It is proposed, therefore, to appoint commissioners who will have jurisdiction to hear these pending appeals.  The commissioners will sit in pairs.  I anticipate that four commissioners will have disposed of all the outstanding appeals well before the Long Vacation, and I believe that when the High Court is relieved of these arrears it will henceforward be able to cope with current work.  Perhaps I ought to give my reasons for that opinion.  The Central Criminal Court, which is presided over by a High Court judge, disposed of a very large volume of business since its institution, and the <Col N="491" /> arrears of criminal business have now been disposed of.  It is to be presumed that this Court will not make such demands on the time of High Court judges in future.  Fifteen days have been taken off the Long Vacation since last year, that is, giving fifteen additional court days, and the High Court is now assisted by a Master.  The work performed by the Master used to be done by the judges, and the fact that there is now a Master must mean a saving of practically one judge's time. For these reasons I am reluctant to take the step of recommending the appointment of an additional High Court Judge at this stage.  It would be premature to assume that such an addition is necessary.  The important thing is to make a speedy clearance of pending Circuit Court appeals, in the interest of litigants, give the High Court a clear start in that way and then watch the situation as it develops as from that date.  If six High Court Judges prove to be inadequate to cope with the first instance work and the appellate work the position must be reviewed in the light of our experience, and the necessary remedial measures taken, but I want to emphasise that I am not satisfied at this stage that six High Court Judges, as originally recommended by the Judiciary Committee, will not be enough for our permanent needs.  I ask approval of the Dáil of the general principle of the Bill, namely, that special measures must be taken, in the interests of litigants, to hear pending Circuit Court appeals, and that the proper remedy is to appoint Commissioners, with the powers of a High Court Judge, to aid the High Court in disposing of these accumulated arrears.</P>

      <P>I think that the necessity for overcoming arrears is obvious, and on that account, of course, we would all desire to see the Bill pass. But I think that the remedy that the Minister proposes is one of very doubtful validity.  We are told that these Commissioners shall have &ldquo;all the powers, jurisdictions and privileges of Judges of the High Court.&rdquo;  I think that that would make them judges, and I cannot see that we are entitled to appoint Commissioners to do the work of <Col N="492" /> Judges of the High Court and allow them to be dismissed or removed from office at the pleasure of the Governor-General, acting on the advice of the Executive Council.  I think we are bound in this case by Articles 68 and 69 of the Constitution.  It seems that if this is permissive under the Constitution, then the Constitution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the Minister has done it before I hope it is valid.  I hope the Minister will clear away the point of its validity.  I do not know, but as I read it a Commissioner who is made a Judge of the High Court must be subject to Articles 68 and 69 of the Constitution, and as I would imagine any decisions of that Court would be invalid I would make that point.  I do not know whether it is a right one or not, but it seems to me it is.  If we have done it before it seems to me to be a device in conflict with the fundamental law of the State and of doubtful validity or invalidity.  I hope the Minister will be able to make the matter clear and remove that doubt before we give a vote on the Bill.</P>

      <P>One is glad to hear that the Minister is about taking some steps to deal with this problem of the arrears in the Appeals Court.  Like Deputy Johnson, I am somewhat doubtful about the wisdom of the course that he proposes, but the Minister is in the better position to judge of the emergency that has arisen.  Whatever course he purposes taking, I hope that no further delay will be permitted, because this question of arrears has become so serious and so alarming that immediate steps are necessary to deal with it.  I hope that whatever course the Minister decides on taking he will see that no further delay than is absolutely necessary will be entailed.</P>

When I saw the exact figure, in fact I was rather pleasantly surprised. I had the impression that the figure <Col N="493" /> was substantially higher.  I think that within the last three weeks or a month the High Court has itself made considerable inroads on the appeals that had accumulated, and I should think that perhaps three months' work on the part of these Commissioners will clear the slate.  I thought, as I say, the figure of the pending appeals was very much higher than 520.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Those were not isolated cases.  That was a very general matter.  A court of first instance &mdash; a County Court&mdash;gave a decision in June or July of one year, and if there was an appeal, that appeal very often was not heard until March of the following year.  So, while the trouble is there and is admitted and we are taking steps to deal with it, I want some kind of a sense of proportion in discussing it.  It is not just as big a grievance as Deputy Good makes out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Deputy Johnson's point on the Constitution, if anyone wishes to raise that he can get it finally determined in the courts.  In this matter we proceed on the advice of the Attorney-General, but it is not, in fact, in conflict with the Constitution to appoint Commissioners ad hoc to exercise for the time being the powers of a High Court Judge in the matter of trying <Col N="494" /> these cases.  The District Justice is a Judge, and he can be removed from office in a particular way &mdash; on the joint certificate of the Attorney-General and the Chief Justice, if he has been guilty of impropriety in office.  The Oireachtas legislated to that effect.  These Commissioners are not made High Court Judges by the fact of being set up by statute and vested for the time being with particular powers, the particular appelate jurisdiction of High Court Judges.  I stress the fact that it is the particular powers of a High Court Judge which are vested in the Commissioners.  Four persons will be appointed and they will sit in pairs until these arrears of appeals are cleared off, which I hope will be in a short time.  Deputy Good and others may be assured that there will be no unnecessary delay.  The moment this Bill is signed by the Governor-General four persons will be ready to proceed immediately to take up the work of hearing these appeals.  We have already approached certain members of the Bar and secured their agreement to act in this capacity if the Bill is passed, and there will be no delay after the passing of the Bill.</P>

    <P>I think that this finishes the very long list of Supplementary Estimates. The Supplementary Estimates on this list are, with just one exception, token estimates, although in certain cases sums that are of some importance are involved.</P>
    <P>Vote No. 2 for the Oireachtas, is to provide a grant in aid for the Oireachtas restaurant and kitchen.  It is a token vote, because we always provide in the Oireachtas Vote for the allowances to all members elected, whether they take their seats or not.  The amount to be provided is £600 under the sub-head.</P>
    <P>Vote 7 is the substantial one.  The Supplementary Estimate would be for £40,000.  Heretofore the numbers of Old Age Pensions have been declining fairly rapidly, and in each year's Estimates for the Old Age Pensions we allowed for that decline.  This year the decline has not taken place.  Consequently, the amount that was provided for in the original Estimate will not suffice.  In Vote 26&mdash;&mdash;Law Charges&mdash; there is a sum of £11,000.  The main portion of that is to provide for a deposit in connection with the American litigation about Dáil Funds.  That is a sum which will be recoverable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not quite guaranteed. Vote 27 is concerned with Haulbowline Dockyard.  There is a sum of £1,000 required, because the <Col N="496" /> military post has been abolished and a contribution which we got from the Army Fund is no longer available. Vote 35 is a token Vote of £10 for the Supreme Court and High Court of Justice. It is necessary because of the passage of the Court Officers Act.  The people who were court officers have been abolished and have had their offices abolished, and they have been re-appointed under the recent Court Officers Act.  It is not possible to pay them under the original Estimate passed by the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Vote 37 &mdash; Circuit Court Officers &mdash; is for £2,000.  That is because the original Estimate was cut too close and will not be sufficient to meet the charges, largely because several Assistant Circuit Judges had to be appointed.  Vote 50 &mdash; Reformatory and Industrial Schools &mdash; is a token Vote required because of increased committals of children to reformatories, but the amount can be met from the other sub-heads of the Vote.  Vote 53&mdash;Forestry Fund (Grant-in-Aid)&mdash;is a token Vote in order to bring to the notice of the Dáil the appropriation of a certain surplus in the Forestry Fund after 31st March to be expended on cultural operations. Vote 56&mdash;Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash; is a token Vote to enable the cost of the staff for Census work to be met.

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of the Telephone Capital Bill, 1927.  It is to enable the Minister for Finance to borrow and advance to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs a sum of £500,000 for telephone capital. The sum of £500,000 provided in the Telephone Capital Act of 1924 is now <Col N="497" /> exhausted.  The expenditure, since the setting up of the Saorstát, on telephone capital has been as follows:- 1922-23, £40,457; 1923-24, £23,870; 1924-25, £110,377; 1925-26, £205,733.  That left a sum of £90,000, roughly, available in the present financial year.  That £90,000 has been exhausted.  In fact, in recent weeks we have advanced what was available in the Contingency Fund, pending the provision of capital otherwise, to prevent the stoppage of work in connection with telephone extensions and improvements.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for POSTS and TELEGRAPHS (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect it is necessary to give the House a brief review of the necessity for this rather big advance of State monies.  As the Minister for Finance has explained, up to date this House has been good enough to extend the use of its finances to the extent of practically half a million. The present request is for a similar amount.  The former monies were used in general development. That development fell under what I may term for convenience four distinct headings.  On the construction of trunks throughout the country we spent £26,900; in the setting-up of subscribers' connections and call offices, £38,600; for underground work, £111,180; and for automatic extensions, £123,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the product of this sum of money was portrayed in a map which I caused to be issued to members of the Oireachtas within the last month, and it was more adequately portrayed there than I could possibly portray it through any remarks of mine here.  It showed development prior to the taking over by this State, the development since, work in being, and work in contemplation. I venture to say the progress which has been made in the telephone development here, as seen through that map, came as a pleasant surprise to a great many people.  It showed an expansion, in the brief period of two years since the clearing up of the trouble consequent on the civil war, which must certainly be regarded as satisfactory and, if continued at the rate obtaining during that period, it <Col N="498" /> must necessarily within a brief period of years find telephones very general in the State.</P>
    <P>When we ask for monies from the State for this purpose, we really take nothing from the taxpayer.  We merely utilise his monies just as we utilise a loan from banking institutions.  They are paid back in their entirety, principal and interest, over a number of years, varying from fifteen to twenty. Therefore the taxpayer has had no loss in this advance.  In the sum which we now seek, we find that a rather considerable part will be required for building and extension work.  With the development throughout the country it has been borne in on us that no further time can be lost in enlarging our central offices.  Crown Alley, for instance, is altogether inadequate for present-day extensions.  Similarly, in the case of Cork, we found it necessary to take over the big sorting office there for telephones.  We took over the entire sorting office, and we took a substitute office for postal work in another section of the city.  Generally, the same principle applies to the smaller offices. In other words, we have got to make progress with buildings in keeping with this development which the Deputies saw in that map which we circulated.</P>
    <P>Deputies from certain parts of the country may perhaps feel that sufficient attention in this development has not been paid to their respective quarters. But it will be understood at the same time that it has not been possible, with a necessarily limited technical staff at our disposal, to grapple with every place at the same time.  We have to do it on a regular system, taking the nearer quarters first and then striking out.  There are two parts of the country which are rather behind time in this development. One is Mayo, particularly West and North Mayo; and another in Donegal But, notwithstanding, anything that Deputies may observe in the map to which I have already referred, no time will be lost in getting into these quarters either.  It is entirely a matter of time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;governed by staff requirements.  Now we are encouraged to get ahead with telephone development for one reason in particular, and that is, the fact that telephones are rather rapidly assuming the position of paying their way.  Prior to our time the telephone service in this country was run at rather a heavy loss.</P>
      <P>In 1922-23 that loss was £46,000; in 1923-24 we reduced that loss to £25,000; in 1924-25 it disappeared.  In the Budget of 1925-26 we caused a very considerable and a very substantial concession to be made to telephone users.  The result was that in 1925-26 we suffered a loss of £35,000.  Now during the current year, from the figures that have come my way, I am satisfied that we are breaking down that loss, and I do not think it would be over-optimistic to forecast the possibility of its entire disappearance during the financial year 1927-28.  This is not a matter to which I need necessarily refer here, but in such a contingency I would favour a further reduction on telephones, because I believe that the cheaper the telephones are the more rapid will be their installation; that is pretty obvious, of course.  The other course to follow &mdash; and the Minister for Finance at the time may be tempted to take that course &mdash; is to incorporate any profit arising from this section of the Post Office into the General Post Office Accounts.  In other words, to place it against the loss which will, in all probability, still obtain in the working of this service.  I think that would be an unfortunate decision.  We have approached a stage of cheapness here not very much wide of the most advanced countries. But there is still a gap to be bridged and it may be advisable to bear in mind that that gap should be bridged before anything like a very general use of the telephone will be availed of.  For that reason I would favour a still further reduction in telephone charges when the service pays its way, rather than take any profits arising from the service and place them to the credit of the common postal account.  If any Deputy should require information in regard to this proposal I will be only too pleased to endeavour to give it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is <Col N="500" /> entitled to be congratulated on that particular department of his service, that is the telephone department.  He has certainly given an amount of attention to that particular department, and he has made a greater success of it than any other department of his work. Possibly there are opportunities in that department that do not exist in the other departments.  But I would like to say that while I do not want to take from what he has done in that department, I should like to be able to congratulate him on an equal success in his other departments.  Speaking particularly of this work, I think part of the success is due to the policy that the Minister wisely adopted in connection with the telephone system.  He went out for cheap charges and he went out to extend the telephone system through the medium of cheap charges.  I hope he will continue to extend that system and that cheapness.  While we enjoy the telephone system at the moment at a comparatively low rate, I think it is possible to work that system even with still greater efficiency and at a still lower charge.  It is obvious that the more the charges are reduced the greater will be the attraction to telephone subscribers.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear from the Minister that he has that policy in mind and that he hopes to follow along the lines that have led to success so far.  There is one particular charge in connection with telephones that I would like some information about and that is in connection with trunk charges.  It does appear to me that trunk charges at the present moment are at a high figure. The Minister will, doubtless, have comparative tables to show us whether that is so or not, but he has pointed out to us that in his capital expenditure a considerable portion of that capital expenditure was allotted to the improvement of trunk telephones.  That, I think, is a wise capital expenditure.  But one would like to see more advantage taken of that expenditure and to see more advantage taken of trunk calls than there is at the moment.  I think that possibly the charges there are a deterrent.  On that particular question I would be glad if the Minister would give us some additional information.</P>

      <P>While I have listened to the Minister's statement with considerable interest I have not the least intention of congratulating him, as the previous speaker has done.  I have studied the map that was issued by his department with considerable interest, and while I find that the telephone services in many parts of the Saorstát have been highly developed, notably in Cork and many southern counties, we in Donegal, at least the area from which I come, have been left weeping in the wilderness.  According to the telephone system outlined in the map, so far as my study of it goes, my opinion is that the telephone will reach the town and area in which I live in about four years.  I might ask a very practical question: who will be there at the expiration of four years to enjoy the service?  I hope I will be there myself.  It is not in a spirit of criticising the estimates, or the statement of the Minister, that I speak this evening, but to make an appeal to the Minister to speed up the system in the county from which I come.  I do not think there is anything unreasonable in asking that, or in asking the Minister's special attention to this particular area of the Saorstát.  Four years is a long time to wait for telephone accommodation, especially when other towns &mdash; one town within ten miles of me on the east, and another within the same distance on the west&mdash;have perfect systems of wires, while we in Inishowen, an important market town, have no telephone system whatever.  According to the map, we need not expect a telephone extension to our town sooner than the period I mention, namely, four years.  I submit to the Minister and to his department that that is an unreasonable period to wait, taking into consideration the present position of affairs.  The Minister must well recognise the fact that the world, or rather the Saorstát, is travelling at a terrific pace.</P>

      <P>I expected <Col N="502" /> to hear from the Minister something in regard to the proposed development of automatic telephone services.  It was understood, I think, that his department was about to supply Dublin at any rate with some such service.  Possibly the provision for that will be made in a later estimate, but when the Minister gave us, as he did, an account of the progress which his department is making I feared that the absence from it of any such reference might herald the dropping of the intention to introduce automatic services.  I know that many months ago I had the honour of a visit of two of the myrmidons, minions, or servants of the Minister. Fortunately I arrived at home in time to discover these men laboriously making measurements and tramping about the house.  When I asked them the object of their visit they explained that they were devising a method of bringing wires from the back of the house to the front.  I was delighted to have any sort of telephone instead of the one I have, and I look forward to that arrangement with considerable satisfaction. I asked if they were for their own convenience replacing the present unsatisfactory telephone with an automatic instrument, would it be desirable to have it in a room at the back.  A fortnight later I received a notice that inasmuch as I wanted my telephone exchanged from the front to the back, it would cost me an estimated sum, about 30/- I think.  I had then to give an elaborate explanation to the Department that I did not want to transfer the telephone instrument from the study to the back of the house, but in view of the installation of a new service it would be easier to put it where the installation of wires and breaking through walls would be avoided.  Since then I heard nothing.  I have reason to believe that these men came to see whether or not I had a listening-in installation. What does it cost the Minister to tap lines and overhear conversations? Is any money included in this estimate to meet that expenditure?  I was frequently told by those who communicated with me that there was something wrong with my telephone. I knew there was, but I did not know exactly what it was.  The same thing <Col N="503" /> was wrong with my telephone during the Black and Tan period and it disappeared with the Treaty, or rather with the recent pacification of the country.</P>

      <P>It is rather an extraordinary thing that I was repeatedly notified of this phenomenon. At last I was driven to lodge a complaint, and was told by an agreeable employee that an observation would be kept upon my line, and for a fortnight, during the period of observation, the phenomenon disappeared.  Personally I make the candid confession that I think it was due to some technical flaw in the apparatus, but people who communicated with me refused to accept that charitable explanation.  The Minister takes credit for a great improvement in the telephone service.  It is, undoubtedly, a comfort to know that while little countries like Sweden, Norway and Switzerland are in front of all the world in telephone services, we are not left lagging behind hopelessly. The Minister has realised that the trend of affairs in the world of communication to-day is to substitute telephone for postal messages.  In the most progressive countries, while statistics show that the number of letters that pass in ordinary business transactions is lessening, the number of telephone calls is more than proportionately increasing.  The business community are entitled to an excellent service, and, possibly, it may be that the defects of the service for private individuals are due to concentration and the effort to cut down expenses. concentration rather upon services at certain hours of the day to help the business community.  If I could discover how to give notice for the discontinuance of my service, and at what precise date to make it operate, I should long ago have done so.  I mention this to bring some solace to the disconsolate heart of Deputy White. Deputy White and his people weeping in the wilderness while others secure <Col N="504" /> good telephone service make a pathetic spectacle.  I think it would be equally spectacular if Deputy White and his constituents were afflicted with a telephone service such as that of which I have reason to complain.  There are telephones and telephones.  I wish that the Minister, when spending money to extend the telephone services, would also give a little attention to the requirements of those who are provided with an installation, because he may lose from leakage in one direction what he may gain by new subscribers in another.  I sympathise unquestionably with his desire to cut down expenditure. I know that the attendants in the central office are overworked, and I make no complaint about them personally. I merely express the hope that the Minister will be able, in his extension of the service, to keep a cessation of subscriptions away.  He can only do that by trying to curb his endeavours in the direction of new accuisitions in so far as they interfere with the provision of good service to present subscribers.</P>

      <P>I would like to say a few words congratulating the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on the vast improvement he has made during the last few years in the telephone service. Deputy Magennis complained that his particular telephone seems to have been listened into more than ordinary subscribers.  Everyone knows in connection with wireless and telephones that the atmospheric conditions are often the cause of the difficulty in getting through.  I have got through to Dublin innumerable times, but found it impossible then to carry on a conversation over the wires.  I think there has been a vast improvement in the telephone service.  I also think the suggestion made by Deputy Magennis, that his special telephone was listened into in order that the conversation going on between him and others might be heard is uncalled for and unfair to the Department.  I do not believe one word of it.  I stand up to defend the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, as I believe I am entitled to do so, as one who has a very considerable amount of experience in the use of the telephone.</P>

      <P>I would like to support what Deputy Shaw has said in praise of the Minister's work in distributing the telephone services throughout the country.  It has been extended in County Kildare, and, after several years, I succeeded in persuading the Minister to establish it at Kilcock. I am curious to know if it is paying there.  Whether it is or not, it is very much appreciated there and in other places throughout the county. The telephone is being largely used, and all who use it realise what a convenience it is.  I am on a party line with 13 other people, and I would sooner do without any other service than the telephone.  I think the other subscribers think the same way.  I would like to see the telephone in every house throughout the country.  I would like to see it provided cheaply, so that those who are not now able to afford it would be able to do so.  Nothing opens up the country so quickly or is a greater source of convenience to the great body of the people in the rural districts than the telephone service.  I hope the Minister's efforts to extend the service will be still more successful during the coming year.</P>

      <P>Deputy Good has urged that the earliest possible opportunity should be availed of to reduce trunk charges.  I agree.  I think it would be helpful to the general development if a reduction in charges were to take place.  I hope when that subject is being considered at some future date special reference will be made to these trunk charges.  For the <Col N="506" /> time being we have no special reason to make a reduction.  Notwithstanding our duplication, or, if you like, triplication of trunk connections through the country, we are scarcely able to keep pace with public requirements.  Nevertheless, I am satisfied the charges are somewhat heavy, and when a reduction in telephones is possible generally, because of the improving financial position, the special claim of trunks will be considered.  Deputy White seems unduly pessimistic regarding his particular territory.  However, I would like to remind him that up to twelve months ago we had no direct connection from Dublin to Sligo.  We have now two trunk lines with that city.  In addition to these direct trunks to Sligo, we have opened up and installed a great number of telephones in Bundoran and likewise in Ballyshannon.  We have opened a considerable number of call offices in the south-west of the county from Ballyshannon.  We are now laying trunks on through Ballybofey and Stranorlar to join up with Derry and eventually the peninsula of Inishowen. I should not be surprised if within the next six or eight months we find there is a trunk connection to the door of the territory which Deputy White refers to.  I believe he will find that the development in that district will be very much more rapid than he anticipates.</P>
      <P>Deputy Magennis wishes to know whether we have made up our minds in regard to automatic exchange development. We are installing two automatics in Dublin, one in Merrion and another in the Castle area.  The Castle area ought to be open about the middle of the present year, and Merrion about the end of the year or early next year. The question of introducing automatics through Crown Alley has arisen and is being considered.  It is a very heavy job, and one that we can only decide on after mature consideration.  We have to take into account the loss of employment as against the huge amount of money which the introduction of these automatics will necessitate sending from the country.  That viewpoint is being discussed just now, and within the next month or so I intend to submit a case to the Minister for Finance in regard to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="507" /> It is an easy thing to rush to conclusions in regard to the tapping of wires. Prior to the assumption of the authority that I now possess, I frequently came to the conclusion that my predecessors were engaged in that work &mdash; that was in the British days &mdash; and the consequence was that I avoided the use of the telephone.  I suppose that was common to many people connected with the Irish-Ireland movement.  The same feeling seems to obtain in certain circles now, but I want absolutely to assure the Deputy that as a policy or as a practice no such thing exists in the service.  The first step I took in taking over this service was to give a general and definite instruction that no tapping whatever of any communications passing through the service, whether in the form of telegrams, letters or telephone calls, should occur.  If there had been any departure from that it would very quickly be public property, and I want to assure the Dáil that there has not been and will not be as long as I am connected with the service.  Apparent tapping arises from a number of causes. The wires in the district to which the Deputy refers &mdash; the Merrion district &mdash; are very old and the general apparatus with which they are connected is very shaky.  Owing to these two defects the wire is inconstant &mdash; it is subject to variation over which we have no control in the absence of modern installation. Another point that should be borne in mind is that operators are bound by very strict rules to intercept calls at the termination of the scheduled time.  That may not be very popular with users, but it is indispensable to the conduct of the service.  It sometimes happens that a person engages in a conversation with a friend and forgets altogether the fact that other people may be requiring the line. In any case, the operator cannot indefinitely hold on until the conversation plays itself out.  These are two points which rather give the idea that there is interception.  Let me again assure the Deputy, not only on my own behalf, but in fairness to the staff, that no such practice prevails in the service to-day and will not prevail.</P>
    <P>In regard to the call which an official <Col N="508" /> made to the Deputy's house, I cannot, of course, state the exact object, but I take it that in anticipation of the introduction of the automatics to the Merrion district this call may have been found necessary.  Beyond that I cannot explain.</P>

    <P>The reason this particular Vote is brought forward is that the provision of sites appears in the Post Office Vote and not in the Board of Works Vote, as occurs in the case of other Departments. As a result of the discussion at the Public Accounts Committee it was agreed that for every proposal for a service of a novel character, or if a considerable sum was involved, a supplementary estimate should be introduced, and every proposal for a building where it involves a sum in excess of £5,000 should be laid before the Dáil as a specific proposal before being undertaken.  In order to meet the requirements of the Post Office in Cork it is proposed to purchase certain premises there for a sum of £13,500. This will give accommodation which it <Col N="509" /> is estimated could not have been obtained by the purchase of a site and the erection of buildings thereon for a sum less than, say, £65,000.  The other part of the Estimate is required for the purchase of a leasehold interest in certain premises in Henry Street, Dublin, which are to be used for the Post Office Savings Bank.</P>

      <P>In accordance with statute a contribution is made from State Funds of a proportion of the sickness, disablement and maternity benefits which are distributed.  The liabilities accruing in this respect during the current financial year are greater than estimated a year ago, as the approved societies are distributing larger sums in benefits than was anticipated; and it therefore becomes necessary to ask for an increased grant-in-aid to enable the State to meet its obligation.  Further, since the original Estimate was presented the results of the periodic valuation of approved societies have become available. A surplus was disclosed and additional benefits became payable from the 1st July last, to which the State has to make its contribution.  The additional amount required to meet these two obligations is estimated to be £14,500 in the current year.</P>
      <P>A small sum is also required to meet the cost of the Medical Referee Service from the 1st of January to the 31st March, 1927, such cost ceasing to be a charge on Insurance Funds as from the 31st December last.

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state under what circumstances an old age pension was refused to Mrs. Ellen Foy, of Kilgeever, Kilsallagh, Westport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>This claim was disallowed on appeal on the 16th of December last on the ground that I was not satisfied on the evidence submitted that the claimant fulfilled the statutory condition as to residence.  The claimant admitted that she spent the following periods in America:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  From June, 1912, to August, 1919&mdash;7 years and 2 months.</P>
      <P>(2)  From July, 1921, to August, 1926&mdash;5 years and 1 month.</P>
      <P>Total&mdash;12 years and 3 months.</P>
      <P>She attained the age of 50 years on the 6th of November, 1904.  Following that date she had, therefore, resided at home for only an aggregate period of 9 years and 6 months when she claimed a pension immediately on her last return in August, 1926.  This is short of the period of residence required by statute, viz., twelve years after reaching the age of 50 years.</P>

Mayo, containing 117a. 0r. 15p., which were published on the 1st October, 1926, in a provisional list of lands which will, if not excluded in consequence of a valid objection, become vested in the Land Commission on the appointed day.  The lands were purchased under the Land Purchase Acts, and are subject to a Land Purchase annuity.</P>
      <P>Mr. James Brannick lodged an objection to the acquisition of his lands and the matter was heard in Court by the Land Commissioners on the 26th ult., judgment being reserved.</P>
