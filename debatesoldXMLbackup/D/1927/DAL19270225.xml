      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware of the great hardships entailed on jurors resident in West Wicklow in having to attend at Wicklow Town in discharge of their duties as jurors, and if he will make arrangements to hold sittings of the Circuit Court at Baltinglass for the disposal of business from West Wicklow.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the fact that sittings of the Circuit Court are held in Wicklow Town has resulted in undue hardship on jurors who are resident in West Wicklow.  I am aware, however, that jurors both in West Wicklow and throughout the country generally have a disinclination to leave their own districts to attend courts elsewhere, and that it would be more convenient for them if they had not to do so.  From this angle the existing arrangements may not be perfect, but they are the best that can be made having regard to the interests of efficiency and economy.  I should add that it is the function of the Rule-making Authority for the Circuit Court to prescribe the places where court sittings shall be held, but I cannot hold out any hope to the Deputy that the town of Baltinglass will be one of the places prescribed by the Rules.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The claimant was originally allowed a pension of four shillings a week from September, 1921.  The rate was increased by the Pension Sub-Committee to six shillings, and again to seven shillings.  A question was raised for reduction of the pension to five shillings a week as from the 2nd of July, 1926.  The Sub-Committee decided to reduce the pension to six shilling and, on appeal, I confirmed this decision on the 1st of September, 1926. This was the most favourable decision that could be given in view of the means of the pensioner and her husband.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to advert again to the point I made on the Second Reading stage of this Bill, and to give expression to my doubts as to the wisdom of this form of legislation. I doubt whether it is, in fact, in accordance with constitutional requirements. I have a belief that there was some meaning in the provision of Article 68 of the Constitution which provides that the judges of the Supreme Court and High Court shall not be removed except for stated misbehaviour or incapacity, and then only by resolutions passed by both Dáil Eireann and Seanad Eireann, and that the remuneration of judges shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.  I think the provisions regarding judges were not intended mainly to protect judges.  I think the object of provisions of that kind was to protect citizens, and they were inserted in the Constitution rather to protect citizens against possibilities of panicky action or unfair discrimination on the part of an Executive or even a Parliament.  It is not an unknown thing that Parliaments have been apt to introduce legislation of a panicky nature in time of political excitement, and the object of the Constitution is largely directed to saving the public from that kind of spasmodie action of Parliament.  In defending this provision the Minister made certain statements which certainly raised or rather increased the doubts which I had as to the wisdom of this provision. He pointed out that these Commissioners are not made High Court judges by the fact of being set up by statute, invested for the time being with particular powers&mdash;appellate jurisdiction of High Court judges.  &ldquo;I stress the fact,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that it is the particular powers of a High Court judge which are vested in the Commissioners, and they are being set up ad hoc to deal with certain functions of a High Court judge to try certain classes of cases.&rdquo;  It is not because of the immediate circumstances that I am making these representations, but because <Col N="951" /> of the precedent that is being created and, particularly, in view of the explanations given by the Minister for making this precedent.  The section says that when hearing and determining appeals under this Act the Commissioners shall have all the powers, jurisdiction, and privileges of judges of the High Court, and in every way these judges are to be judges of the High Court for the particular purposes of the Act.  If that is possible, under the Constitution, I want to know what is to prevent a Ministry and a Parliament passing an Act of a similar kind, getting round the Constitution, and setting up High Court judges with particular powers to try particular cases? In my opinion the effect of this kind of specially set up ad hoc court is to evade the requirements of the Constitution. It is a bad principle and makes of no effect that provision in the Constitution, so far as that provision is intended to be a protection of the public &mdash;as a protection of the judge it is all right&mdash;but we did not put into the Constitution articles of that kind merely for the protection of judges' salaries or their tenure of office.  The Constitution provision is to protect the public against panicky action on the part of the Legislature or Executive and, I think, the precedent that is being set up by setting up judges to fulfil functions of a High Court judge in special cases might be followed when political excitement prevails, and it is sought to set up a special court to try a special kind of prisoner.  That, I say, is an evasion of the constitutional provision and I think we ought to avoid it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy avoided saying in so many words he considered the Bill a breach of the Constitution&mdash;that he considered the Bill unconstitutional.  I wonder whether he thinks it is.  If he does, no doubt he will push his view and his protest further through the appropriate channel, but I am advised that that is not the position, that it is in accord with the Constitution to introduce and to pass a measure of this kind.  Unlike Deputy Johnson, I have to deal with the practical <Col N="952" /> situation with which I am confronted. I have to deal with facts rather more than with theories, and the actual position is that there are 520 appeals from the Circuit judges pending, the oldest, I think, dating back to October or November of 1925.  What action should I take to deal with that situation?  I am not satisfied, as I have said before in the Dáil, that there is a case for the appointment of an additional permanent High Court judge, and I will take a lot more convincing on that point.  I certainly would not ask the Dáil to sanction such a step until this accumulation of arrears has been cleared, and which I regard as abnormal, and we have had the opportunity of observing the manner in which the High Court is then able to keep in touch with current work.</P>
      <P>The tendency is, I think, and will continue to be, that the High Court will become less and less a court of original jurisdiction and more and more of dealing with appellant work from the Circuit Courts.  Before asking the Oireachtas to sanction the appointment of an additional judge of the High Court I certainly want to see the situation as it exists after these arrears have been cleared away.  I gave on the Second Reading of this Bill my reasons for believing that if the arrears are once cleared away the High Court will be able to keep in touch with its normal work without an additional appointment.  Facing these facts I thought it right as an alternative to asking the Dáil to sanction an increase of the High Court Bench to appoint Commissioners of Appeal, who would exercise for a period the appellate jurisdiction of the High Court.  I think it is a reasonable proposal.  I do not regard it as either an infringement or an evasion of the Constitution.  If Deputy Johnson adheres to his view his course will be to challenge the Bill in the courts as unconstitutional.  That is not my advice.  I think, faced with the actual situation, faced with 520 appeals from the Circuit Court, that this is a sensible and appropriate step to take and the step that is most in the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I had intended drawing attention to the position outlined <Col N="953" /> by Deputy Johnson on the occasion of the Second Reading of the Bill, but I was prevented from doing so owing to being laid up and not able to attend the Dáil.  I think it is well the question has been raised, and it is also satisfactory we should know from the Minister that he has made inquiries, and is now satisfied that the action he proposes to take is constitutional. People like Deputy Johnson, if I might say so, and certainly like myself, are not in a position to take a matter like this and challenge it in the courts.  Neither are we&mdash;speaking for myself certainly&mdash;in the position of the Minister in having at our disposal expert opinion on the matter, but it is somewhat satisfactory, to say the least, that we have now a definite assurance from the Minister that he, having made inquiries, is satisfied on the advice given to him, which I presume is the best legal advice obtainable, that the action he has taken is constitutional. Prima facie there does seem to me something unconstitutional in the action.  As far as I can remember Article 64 of the Constitution lays it down that the judicial powers shall be vested in judges to be appointed as hereinafter provided for, and Article 68 then provides the method of appointment of these judges, laying it down that they shall be appointed on the advice of the Executive, and shall be permanent in the sense that they shall not be removable except they have proved themselves to be unfit for their office either by incompetency or wilful misconduct. That being so, it is hard to see at first glance that persons can be appointed in whom judicial powers are vested in accordance with these two articles of the Constitution.  I admit that there is a difficulty to be got over in regard to the present state of appeals, but my complaint really is that the Minister has not tackled this question from another point of view, namely, that he has not come to see at long last that the whole system embodied in the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, has broken down.  I am sorry that evidently he has not seen that, and that the appointment of temporary Commissioners, or call them what you <Col N="954" /> please, is only a mere temporary expedient to bolster up a system which is well known to have failed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a huge number of appeals pending.  It has been stated that one of the reasons for this is the operation of the Damage to Property Act, but that is not my information.  Most of the appeals pending are appeals in ordinary civil cases that would have taken place even if there had been no damage to property, and even if these appeals will be wiped off by this temporary expedient, what is there to prevent a subsequent number of appeals accumulating in the future?  The system whereby these appeals have been undisposed of is a system which was not in existence before the Courts of Justice Act.  The old civil bill appeal from the County Court Judge was abolished. The civil bill appeal prior to the Act of 1924 consisted of a re-hearing of the case, and that re-hearing took place before judges who went down the country to hear these cases.  The Courts of Justice Act did away with that and said: &ldquo;No; there shall be no re-hearing by judges in the country.  All appeals must come up to Dublin; they must be on the stenographer's notes, and they must be heard by judges of the High Court in Dublin.&rdquo;  The Judges of the High Court have not been able to hear these appeals, because they have not been able to devote the time to them and at the same time attend to their other duties.  I think, with respect, that it would be better for the Minister to have made a through investigation of the whole working of the Courts of Justice Act and to have devised some means, not only for disposing of these appeals now but for preventing such a state of affairs coming into existence again. The Minister says that he would be loath, if he could avoid it&mdash;I think that that was the sense of his statement&mdash;to appoint another High Court Judge.  I quite follow his position in that regard as a custodian of the purse of the State.  But if he, on investigation, were to come to the conclusion that another High Court Judge, or two, were required, I put it to him that it would be more satisfactory to settle this matter upon a permanent basis <Col N="955" /> than for the moment to use a temporary means, which, to say the least of it, though it may not be unconstitutional, is not exactly in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>While I am on that point let me say that the Constitution under which we now are is a written Constitution, that it has embodied some of the greatest axioms of the British Constitution, which is an unwritten one, and one of the great safeguards of the British Constitution for the public at large is the absolute independence of the judiciary. That has been, very rightly, embodied in our Constitution.  But though this may not be a strict departure from the letter of the Constitution, I do not think it is advisable in any way to depart from the spirit embodied in the principle that I have enunciated. These gentlemen who will be appointed will be, in many respects, equivalent to Judges.  The Minister may say that they will not actually be judges, but they are to be vested with the full judicial powers of High Court Judges, in respect, it is true, only of the work on which they will be called upon to adjudicate.  These gentlemen will, no doubt, conduct their courts with all fairness and impartiality, but at the same time there is no getting away from the fact that while they are there, they are there only for the moment, and they are not in the same position, no matter how well-meaning they may be, as judges, who, once appointed, are for ever absolutely independent of the Executive.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest for a moment that any appointment such as the Minister contemplates will mean that special treatment will be given, say, to State cases.  In these very cases that I have mentioned&mdash;Damage to Property Act cases&mdash;the Minister for Finance is himself one of the parties.  He is in most cases the appellant, and he will come as the appellant before this Court, a Court that is only brought into existence temporarily.</P>
    <P>I say that that is not a right position, either for the State or the court to occupy, that no matter how upright the judges may be, it is not fair either to the party on the other side, which is <Col N="956" /> not the State, nor is it fair to the judges themselves, nor is it proper for a Department of State to come before a court which is only brought into existence temporarily and the conduct of whose affairs must inevitably form the subject matter of comment by the State afterwards.  I think, therefore, from all points of view, from the point of view of the breakdown&mdash;I say the breakdown&mdash;of the Courts of Justice Act, from the point of view of the semi-unconstitutional, if not completely unconstitutional action in the appointment of these judges, and from the point of view of the conduct of the affairs of the State by the Government, that it would be far better for the Minister to have evolved, after due consideration and investigation, some plan whereby the Courts of Justice Act could be permanently amended to meet the requirements of the case at the moment, which requirements may occur in the future just as much as in the past, and which this remedy certainly will not be the means of avoiding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;let us go back to the good old days of assizes, civil bill appeals, and so on.  This appeal on notes to the High Court is all wrong. It does not give the same opportunities to the legal profession.  Incidentally may I add, it does not give the opportunity to litigants that existed in the past to mend their hand.  If the Courts of Justice Act is defective, as the Deputy suggests, might I remind him that it was based on the unanimous report of a committee of experienced lawyers, who had every opportunity of familiarising themselves with the defects of the system that had hitherto existed.  They condemned the practice of a full rehearing of Circuit Court cases, and they condemned it with very intimate knowledge of the abuses to which it gave rise.  But the Deputy, I <Col N="957" /> am aware, in yearning for the good old days is, in fact, speaking the authentic voice of his profession.  But we have to decide whether the law and the legal processes exist for the lawyers or for the people of the State, and it will take more argument than the Deputy has so far retailed to us to convince me that it would be in the real interest of the people of the State to scrap the system of appeal on notes from the Circuit Court and go back to the full re-hearing, with all the opportunity which that afforded for a stopping of the holes which manifested themselves when the case was first tried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that the County Court trial of the past was simply like the preliminary gallop before the race. Each litigant sized up the strength and the weakness of his opponent's position. He mended his hand in the interval between that and the appeal, and the real test was when the re-hearing came on appeal.  The other was fencing. Five hundred and twenty appeals from the Circuit Court is the position with which we are faced, and there is sought to be built on that structure that the Courts of Justice Act has broken down, that it needs either to be scrapped in its entirety, or drastically overhauled.  I do not accept any suggestion of the kind.  I gave, on Second Reading, in the Deputy's absence, the considerations which led me to believe that when these appeals were cleared away the High Court will be able to deal with its normal current business.  The considerations were that the Central Criminal Court, which is presided over by a High Court Judge, disposed of a very large volume of business since its constitution, and the arrears of criminal business are now practically wiped off.  It is to be presumed that that court will not make such demands on the time of High Court judges in the future.  In addition, fifteen days have been taken off the Long Vacation since last year, and the High Court is now assisted by a master.  The work performed by the master was performed in the past by the judges, and the fact that there is a master under the Court Officers Act <Col N="958" /> must mean a saving of practically the time of one judge.  For these reasons I refrain from recommending to the Dáil any addition to the High Court Bench at the moment.  As I say, it does not surprise me in the least that the Deputy would hail these 520 appeals as a complete case against the Courts of Justice Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that it is the decentralisation which is disliked and the lopping off of the old full re-hearing of a case, with new evidence admitted, instead of an appeal on notes.  Many of these appeals will be withdrawn when the Act is passed and when the Commissioners get to work.  The Deputy knows that.  He knows that many of them are simply blocking, bogus appeals which neither the litigants nor their professional advisers will persist in when the court is there, functioning and ready to hear them.  It has been our experience in the past that quite a large proportion&mdash;over 50 per cent.&mdash; of appeals were put in simply for the purpose of blocking the judgment creditor over a period.</P>

If the Bill is unconstitutional, the matter can be brought before the High Court, or the Supreme Court, for a decision. But if the real contention is that, quite apart from the Constitution, the thing to do to meet this 520 appeals position is either to add to the High Court Bench here and now, with no belief that the normal situation will require such addition, or to scrap or drastically amend the Courts of Justice Act, then I do not accept either of these contentions, and I adhere to the position that the step that the Executive Council is taking, on the advice of the Attorney-General, is the soundest and most appropriate step to take.</P>

      <P>The amount of the vote on the forestry estimate for cultural operations was £29,000, and it has been found that £32,553 will <Col N="960" /> be required.  That is to be found by an additional vote of £10, by an estimated saving under sub-head A of the Vote of £722, and by utilising in full the balance of £6,221 on the fund on the 31st March.  At the beginning of the year it was proposed only to utilise £4,000.  The balance can be utilised and that will make £2,221, and by the appropriation of additional receipts up to £600, that will make the total required, £3,553.  The programme of the Department for forestry this year aimed at planting 3,500 acres. There will be considerable extension of the work next year and gradually over the next five or ten years.  It was thought well this year to increase the nursery scheme of the Department itself so that seedlings for the extended programme would be raised in the Department's nursery, and that it would not be necessary to have to go elsewhere to purchase seedlings.  It was found that for that purpose very much more money was required this year than was provided for in the Estimates. Of course the Estimates last year only provided for nurseries for the normal programme, not for the programme as it is likely to develop in the next two or three years.  In any event, as it is likely to develop, it was thought well during the year to make provision against that and to provide extra money, so that the nurseries can be extended and the seedlings required for the extended programme in the year 1927-28, and may be in the following years, 1928-29, and 1929-30, would be-available in the Department's own nursery, and there would not be any necessity to buy seedlings from outside nurserymen.</P>

    <P>A token sum of £10 is taken because, as Deputies are aware, it is customary to include in the Oireachtas Vote sufficient to pay the allowances of all Deputies elected.  We do not make any deduction in anticipation of people continuing to remain out of the Oireachtas, so that it is only necessary to take a token Vote.  The sum actually required under the sub-head is £600.  In 1925-26 a supplementary estimate of £300 was granted towards the expenditure of the Oireachtas restaurant.  In Part 3 of the Estimates it was described as a final contribution, but I put that down as an optimistic view, and when the estimate was before the Dáil I said it would be probably necessary to take further sums.  When the restaurant was set up in 1922-23 there was a grant-in-aid of £250, and for a very considerable time that £250 remained unexhausted, because the Dáil sat continuously and the restaurant consequently, during certain periods, was able to make profits, which carried it over the slacker period.  About eighteen months or so ago the sittings began to be less prolonged, and during the past year have been still less frequent, and that has resulted in greater losses being incurred by the restaurant, so that to enable the Joint Committee controlling it to pay its debts and carry on, a further sum of £600 is necessary.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance requested the Committee to go into the working of the restaurant to see what could be done either to make it pay its way or reduce the losses that were being incurred.  I believe the Committee did examine the matter to some extent, and they have been urged to go further into it.  Of course it must be recognised that if we have the sort of sittings that we have had there are bound to be losses.  If the Dáil sits only for a day or two in the week, it is impossible for the restaurant to pay its way, and I think there is no alternative to providing the money.  I think that for the conduct of the business of the House when it is sitting it is necessary <Col N="962" /> to have the restaurant, and that it would not be possible to ask members to go outside the precincts of the House for meals.  It may be that after the general election the number of Deputies attending will be larger, and perhaps the attendance will be more regular, so that there may be a chance of the restaurant paying its way.</P>

      <P>What is the actual loss on the restaurant?  The Minister said that a contribution of £250 was originally given.  Now a further contribution of £600 is necessary.  There is no fixed period attaching to this payment, and I should like to know what the annual loss is on the restaurant.  As far as one can judge of a restaurant of that character, I am not satisfied that there should be a loss on it.</P>

      <P>I could not tell the Deputy what the annual loss was; it varied.  I think in the first year there was no loss, or very little, because the Dáil sat regularly for a long period. In the year we are in now the loss must be somewhere in the neighbourhood of the £600 required.</P>

      <P>This raises a rather serious matter.  The Minister comes along with a token vote for £10, while the actual amount we are dealing with is £600.

The position is that the country is called upon to pay in the neighbourhood of a thousand pounds this year towards the upkeep of the restaurant.</P>

      <P>I see.  At all events, the Minister may be right in saying he <Col N="963" /> cannot anticipate what the restaurant is going to do, but I think if a very substantial loss is to be visualised as taking place in the future, we would be entitled to consider the whole question of the restaurant and whether it is worth the money which it is going to cost the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise quite clearly it is necessary to take into account the cost of this restaurant.  I want to make it clear the loss does not arise because Deputies get special service or special terms for what they consume. It is not a loss because of any special benefit to Deputies as Deputies.  It is a loss because it is deemed to be necessary for the proper conduct of parliamentary business&mdash;I am speaking now of the restaurant.  I think it is the experience of every parliament in the world that there must be attached to that parliament a place where people can get food, and if we have to have such a place, and I think we must have, we have to face the possibility of a loss unless you can so regularise the meetings of the House and the habits of members, that the service of the establishment can be adjusted to the regularity of the requirements.  But when we are bound, as we are, to have a service to meet regular meetings, and that by the accident of Parliamentary business regular meetings do not take place, you cannot have a continuous relay of temporaries to deal with this kind of service, and I think this is one of the normal charges that must be attached for the purpose of transacting the business of the House.</P>

However, that is a matter I am sure the Committee, of which I am not a member, can take into account, but I can see no likelihood of that being a solution of the problem.  The only way whereby I can see the loss could be avoided would be to make it a public restaurant&mdash;and that would be undesirable&mdash;or <Col N="964" /> to ensure that the House would sit regularly at stated times and that there should be regular attendance of members on those benches as well as on other benches, and that there should be something like constant demand upon the restaurant.</P>

But it is impossible. I look upon the matter from the point of view of a private Deputy, and I tried to examine it from the point of view of economy, and I can see no possibility of the restaurant meeting the requirements of a commercial undertaking unless you can ensure something like a regular business.</P>

At any rate, I think Deputies will agree that it is not possible to allow the public, generally, into the Oireachtas restaurant. That being so, there is no remedy except this one, other than shutting down the restaurant which would be very serious for some of us, because our fast would be extremely long.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="965" /> That a supplementary sum not exceeding Forty Thousand Pounds be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1927, for the payment of Old Age Pensions under the Old Age Pensions Acts, 1908-24, for certain administrative expenses in connection therewith and for pensions under the Blind Persons Act, 1920.</P>
    <P>In framing the original estimate for the year it was anticipated that there would be a decrease in the number of persons receiving pensions as has occurred for many years past, but a decrease did not take place.  I have certain figures before me showing the number of persons in receipt of old age pensions for a number of years. In 1914 the number was 154,000; in 1915, 151,000; in 1916, 147,000; in 1917, 141,000; in 1918, 137,200; in 1919, 132,000; in 1920, 130,000.  In the year 1920 the Blind Persons Act was passed and that caused a little increase, because of the blind persons coming in, and so in 1921 the number was 131,400. In the next year, 1922, the number was 130,000; in 1923, 127,323; in 1924, 122,000; in 1925, 115,000, and it is still about 115,000.  It is difficult to state exactly the reasons for the fact that the number of pensions have not decreased, but one of the reasons seems to be that just about 70 years ago there was a rapid decline in the number of births.  The estimated decline in births in 1851 was 5,700; in 1852, 4,400; in 1853, 3,700; in 1854, 3,700; in 1855, 3,200; and the next year 1,300.  Then, by 1861, it had gone down to 1,000. The decline which had been at one period almost 1,000 a year, became very much slower.  Then, in recent years there seems to have been an improvement in the public health and a decline in the death rate.  When the returns of the present census are available it will be possible to anticipate almost accurately the number of persons that will be eligible for old age pensions in each year, because we will know the number of persons who will become 70 years of age.  These figures were not available and the result was that in calculating the amount required <Col N="966" /> and the number of persons to receive pensions during the year when the original estimate was being prepared, an underestimate was made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might have gone a little bit further in his explanation.  I think the Deputies need not be reminded of one of the causes on which the Minister has not touched &mdash;of the rapid decline as from 1923 to 1925.  I do not think he gave the figures for 1926.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>They are about the same.  For 1925 I did not give the odd hundreds.  The figure for that year was 115,817.  For 1926 the figure was 115,095.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that it was because of the administration and the cutting off of so many people consequent on the action of the Ministry that there was so great a decline from 1923 to 1926 as 10 per cent., as compared with less than half that, or 4 per cent. in respect of any other period of the same length in previous years.  It is idle to talk about the responsibilities of parents of 70 years ago when the explanation lies in the administration of the Old Age Pensions Act, and on the legislation passed by this House at the instigation of the Minister.  It is just as well that we should face the explanation of this sudden fall in these periods and the impossibility of any further fall in the number entitled to the pensions until the Minister amends the law further, to depreciate the advantages which the old age pensioners have received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. BYRNE Mr. A. BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if I would be in order in drawing attention to the methods by which the officers of the Old Age Pensions Department assess the values of the incomes of the claimants.  They certainly do not do justice to the persons claiming in putting a value on the privileges, etc., that these latter enjoy, and they do that in order to make up the amount required to disqualify the claimants.  In putting a value on a bed or a room of the old man or the old woman that is stopping with a son or relative, I find that these officers put down five or six shillings a week on a bed occupied in <Col N="967" /> one room in order to reduce the amount of the pension claimed by these people. That is not playing the game.  It is not fair to those people that because a son or daughter provides them with a bed that privilege should be classed as an income of 5/- or 6/- a week.  That thing is going on all over the country. To-day we had a question on this matter by one of the Labour Deputies, who stated that there were three people in a house, and because there was 27/- coming into that house with a family of three dependents on that 27/-, that the claimant got no pension.  The method of dealing with these poor people and their claims is all wrong, and when the Minister was giving his figures about the number drawing pensions now, compared with 1920, he overlooked the fact that at that time the full pension was 10/- a week, whereas of the 115,000 people now drawing old age pensions it is probably that at least 15,000 are only getting 3/- or 4/- a week.</P>
      <P>It would be of interest to know exactly how that 115,000 is made up. They are not all getting the full 9/- pension.  I should imagine that 15,000 would be getting 3/- a week, and another 15,000 receiving 5/- or 6/- a week.  The number drawing the full 9/- would not be anything like 115,000. I cannot allow this opportunity to pass without drawing attention to the treatment of claimants for old age pensions generally by officers, who are trying to pile up the so-called incomes of these people.  Sometimes it happens that charitable institutions give poor persons 2/6 a week, and because they are getting that 2/6 it is taken into consideration and the amount is deducted from the pension they get.  I think the Minister ought to see that the benefit of the doubt is given to those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point is the continued refusal of officers to accept statements made by old people in the country where certificates of baptism or certificates of birth cannot be found.  The officers refuse to accept statements proving the age of the claimant.  They refuse to accept sworn declarations. This has happened on more than one occasion, and all that the claimant gets <Col N="968" /> is the mere reply that the authorities or the Minister were not satisfied.  Then there is a case where the claimant makes an appeal.</P>
    <P>That appeal goes on behind the claimant's back.  The claimant only knows of the officer's intimation to appeal against the decision of the local old age pensions committee.  He gets no opportunity of going before the Appeals Board or of submitting any further evidence.  The claimant is merely told that the officer is lodging an appeal against the decision and then, some time after, he gets another notice stating that the Appeals Board has refused the pension.  I hold that the claimant should be given an opportunity of going before the Appeals Board in order to submit a further proof of age.  I think the officer should be a little more free in the matter of accepting statements from claimants for the old age pension through the country in cases where baptismal certificates or birth certificates cannot be found.  He should accept affidavits and statements of old people who knew the applicants and believe them to be over 70 years of age.  I know of many cases where the applicants could swear definitely that they were over 70 years of age and they were turned down.  We all know that in many areas the question of registration of births was not as well carried out as it is now, and in many cases there are no records at all. Consideration should be given to the old people in these cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to protest against the officials who are administering this business.  There are at least 50 cases amongst my constituents where the certificates of birth or baptism cannot be found and where sworn affidavits have been put forward by respectable people of 80 years of age, and in these cases the pension has not been granted.  The advice of the local officer is taken.  If the local pensions officer goes into a house which is kept clean and tidy and has any appearance of comfort he appears to make up his mind that these people are sufficiently comfortable without the pension.  But if he goes into a place that is dirty and untidy, then his decision <Col N="969" /> is reversed and the pension is granted.  The people who have lived and worked in the country until they were 70 years of age should be appreciated.</P>
      <P>I believe that the 10 per cent. decrease in the number of old age pensioners alive is due primarily to the reduction in the pension.  The amount they receive at the present time is not at all adequate.  If they are in receipt of 3/- a week home help, that amount is deducted from the 9/-, if they are successful enough to get the pension. If a workman and his wife are living together, and he succeeds in getting employment, his wife, although she may be the required age, will not get a pension.  The husband may be 70 years of age and he may still have the health to labour in the interests of his employer and, incidentally, in the interests of his country.  I hold that if it is in the interests of his employer it is in the interests of the country.  That man may be earning 34/- or 35/- a week, and because of that, his wife will not be granted the pension.  If that man resigns, or is dismissed by his employer, then he and his wife will have only their pensions to live on. Surely it would be a great help to that man if his wife could get the pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of persons claiming a blind pension, it is deplorable the examinations they have to go through.  It does not matter how many doctors' certificates are submitted indicating that a person is blind, a medical inspector comes down from the Department, and he will question that person.  If that person can possibly notice the light he or she will not be entitled to receive a blind pension.  People would need to be, as it is termed, stone blind.  I have brought under the notice of the Minister cases of persons who are blind, and who are unable to earn means of livelihood for themselves or their children, who in a great many cases are young and unable to work.  Notwithstanding the fact that these people are certified as blind by doctors, if they are able to stand up and walk across the kitchen floor they will not be entitled to a pension.  We all know that a blind person is in some way gifted, and Providence often leads the blind so as <Col N="970" /> to avoid serious accidents.  If a blind person applies for a pension and the inspector finds that person is able to go about, no pension will be granted.  That is certainly a hardship.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister give us an estimate of the amount of money paid out by local authorities by way of home help to those old people whose pensions have been reduced?  The ratepayers in the different counties have to pay the amount saved by the Minister for Finance on Pensions.  The sooner the pension is brought to its original level the better for the State in general. Every ratepayer has suffered because of the reduction of pensions.</P>
    <P>We have in the Saorstát a number of officials.  I daresay if the Minister were to tell us the number of persons employed on the administration of old age pensions, it would almost come to the same level as the actual number of pensioners.  I would like to know how much of this extra £40,000 will be given to the pensioners and how much will go to pay the officials.  I believe we could do with a smaller staff in connection with the administration of old age pensions, and in that case we could spare a little more for the old people to live on.</P>
    <P>There was a Commission appointed by this House 18 months ago and we have never received the report of that Old Age Pension Commission.  Anything that Commission recommended has not been put into operation.  In the case of many pensioners requests were made by the authorities that the pension granted should be refunded.</P>
    <P>If an old person living in a remote country district happens to possess a goat, three hens, a pig, or a donkey&mdash; these things would include the whole means of livelihood&mdash;no pension will be granted by the Government on the report of the old age pensions officer. If it is a thing that we want to show our appreciation of those old people who, in a great many cases, have succeeded by their manual labour in building up this country, something must be done.  It must be remembered that but for the workers and their wives, the country could not progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to refer to the method adopted by the pensions officer in the different districts when arriving at the means of claimants for a pension.  In my opinion, the method adopted is not fair and is not equitable. In the first place, I question the ability of the pensions officer to assess fairly the value of the different possessions of, say, a small farmer.  I do not know what training the pensions officer has had in order to judge whether a cow is value for £5, £10 or £2.  I do not believe he is capable of doing it, and I am convinced, from my own experience, from contact with the Department, and through looking after the claims of old age pensioners, that the methods adopted are not satisfactory and react unfavourably on the claimants.</P>
      <P>I cannot by any stretch of imagination see how it is possible that a cow, say, in Limerick, will be put down as an asset just equal to a cow in West Donegal, Connemara, or even in the mountainous parts of my constituency. So far as I know, that is the order.  I do not know if that can be claimed to be fair or equitable.  I do not believe it is, and there is an urgent necessity for an alteration in the present method of arriving at the valuation by which the claimant's right to a pension is decided. Time and again I have come up against claims where the income put against a claimant was a surprise to me and would be a surprise to any practical farmer who knows what the income from land is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When you get a man living on the side of a mountain, having two cows from which he will probably get milk for three months of the year, and when you consider that the same value is put on those two cows as on animals owned by a small holder living in South Tipperary or East Limerick, or on some of the best land in Ireland, you begin to realise that the Old Age Pensions Act is not being fairly administered. I have often thought of raising this matter.  Representations have been repeatedly made to me&mdash; honest representations&mdash;that this matter should be brought forward and the policy of the Minister or the Revenue Commissioners altered.  Other Deputies <Col N="972" /> have had the same experience, I am sure.</P>
    <P>I feel that a change is overdue, and I think if the Minister gives ten minutes' attention to this side of the problem, he will recognise that in hundreds and thousands of cases justice is not being done.  I urge on the Minister that the standard of values should be judged in the first place by men who are capable of judging, and, in the second place, the values put on the possessions of a small farmer or his wife, who may be claiming a pension, should bear some relation to the part of the country where these people reside, the land they hold, and what that land is capable of producing.</P>
    <P>If the Minister stands to the hard and fast rules that are enforced in connection with the whole administration of the Act, then I say he is not dealing fairly with the claimants for old age pensions.  In my opinion an effort should be made by those in authority to see that claims are not rejected on incomes which any practical individual dealing with the cases would know to be false incomes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesSprouleMyles" hpid="Major MYLES Major MYLES">
      <NameTxt>Major MYLES</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to ask the Minister if he is prepared to give effect to the recommendations of the committee that dealt with this problem within the last year or two.  At present I propose to confine myself to two classes of cases of real hardship.  I will pass over for the present the class of case to which Deputy Baxter referred&mdash; the case of people who already have something.  That kind of case is not so urgent as the two to which I am going to refer.  The Minister, in his statement, said that in a few years he hoped to be able to forecast accurately the amount of money required for pensions. I hope he does not mean by that, that the people who now cannot get certificates of their age will all be dead and hence will never receive a pension. That is one class I would draw his attention to: the class of people where it is simply a question of age, and where the people have no means of producing certificates.  In cases of this kind I hope the Minister will advocate a slackening of the red-tape that at the moment is binding that question.  I <Col N="973" /> consider this to be one of the most important problems involved in the administration of the Old Age Pensions Act.  It deals with the cases of people, not with farms, but with no means whatever.  I now come to the question of the blind.  I think that every Deputy in the House has come across cases of this kind.  The fact that a man is not stone blind and does not reach a certain formula laid down by the doctors means that he gets nothing. I came across a case the other day where a very fine tradesman who had not quite reached the formula laid down by the medical profession, did not come within the Act, and it was suggested to him that he could earn his living as an errand boy.  I ask the Minister is that a reasonable sort of objection to make, and can he not deal more sympathetically with the cases of men who are not totally blind but who are certainly incapacitated from following their ordinary occupations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points that I want to put before the Minister in connection with this, particularly the matter referred to by Deputy Myles regarding the Blind Persons Act.  I raised this matter last year when the Estimates were under discussion, and drew the Minister's attention to the fact that under the law as it is a person would want to be almost stone blind before he could qualify for a pension.  The Minister on that occasion said that he was prepared to consider sympathetically the introduction of a measure which would lessen the restrictions in that respect.  A case was quoted of a man who had been a tailor during his lifetime and had reached a degree of blindness that made it impossible for him any longer to earn his living at his trade.  The position at present is, that if that man had sight sufficient to enable him to shovel mud off the road he would not be qualified for a pension, or if he had sight sufficient to enable him to walk from one end of the street to the other he would also be disqualified from receiving a pension.  Would the Minister tell us whether he proposes to keep his promise in that respect, and if so when he hoped to be able to bring in legislation <Col N="974" /> to alter the law so far as it affects blind persons?  The two points that seem to me to present the most difficulty and to inflict the greatest amount of hardship in regard to this question of old age pensions are those relating to age and means.</P>
      <P>The Committee appointed by the Minister to go into this matter found some difficulty in devising a better scheme for establishing a person's age, where the applicant could not obtain a baptismal certificate, than the system of affidavits.  My complaint is that affidavits are not recognised by the Department when they are supplied.  The Department's reply is that the affidavits are not made out in the prescribed form&mdash;that they are not definite enough.  I submit to the Minister, as I did to the Committee that was appointed to go into this matter, that in very many cases that is due to ignorance of what is required.  The Committee in their report suggested that steps should be taken to give applicants some rough idea of what sort of evidence they would have to submit in order to establish their claim for a pension. We do not know whether the Minister has given effect to that recommendation of the Committee or not. We do not know what part of the Committee's recommendations he has given effect to, or proposes to give effect to. I think the Minister might take advantage of this discussion to make that known to the House.  I have a good deal of sympathy with what Deputy Baxter said on the question of means, but I might remind the Deputy that his Party and himself are responsible to a certain extent for the limitation of means by the vote they gave in this House when the question was under consideration.</P>

      <P>I imagine the Deputy will never have to make application for an old age pension.  If he has to do that I hope he will be able to get his birth certificate.  What I do say is that the present method of assessing means is not a fair one.  Deputy Baxter has very rightly said that in most cases too high a value is placed upon the possessions of an applicant.  There is no question about that.  An ordinary man would find it hard to understand how the pension officer arrives at the value he puts on the possessions of an applicant for a pension.  I think that the Minister for Finance, or his colleague the Minister for Local Government, might usefully give a little more attention to this question of old age pensions.  It is a very important matter in this country where we have so many old people who look forward to getting the pension and who are dependent on it for an existence when they are no longer able to work.  I think in conclusion that we are entitled to know from the Minister what parts, if any, of the Committee's report he proposes to give effect to.  Does he propose to give effect to the report as a whole and, if so, when?  I would ask him to state whether he has decided to introduce legislation to improve the Blind Persons Act.  If he has decided to do that, I would ask him to introduce the legislation as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I do not think anyone can object to strict inquiry being made into applications for old age pensions, in order to ensure that they are granted only to necessitous persons. One direction, I think, in which injustice is done is in estimating income. Some time ago I called the attention of the House to the case of a woman, admittedly over 70 years of age, who had no independent income from any source, but was taken into and kept in his home by a connection by marriage. The pension officer estimated the applicant's means at £37 a year.  It is <Col N="976" /> hard to understand how that figure was arrived at in the case of a person who was taken into the house of a small farmer out of charity.  When dealing with the case the Minister for Local Government asserted that what had been done was strictly according to law.  If that is so, I say that a change should be made in the law in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDoyle" hpid="Mr. M. DOYLE Mr. M. DOYLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. DOYLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to emphasise the remarks of Deputy Conlan, as I have many cases in my constituency similar to the one he mentioned.  I know two applicants for old age pensions, both over 70 years of age.  They saved some money while at business, and when it was exhausted a nephew took one of them into his home.  There was no compulsion on him to do so. The pension was refused because, as Deputy Conlan stated, a relative took her in out of charity, so that she would not have to go to the county home. The maintenance of the applicant was valued at something over the standard. Cases of this kind should be dealt with on the merits.  If a relative of an applicant desires to keep that person out of a county home, it is not fair that the pension should be refused.  If people of this class got the pension it would help considerably, even towards providing them with lodgings.  I wish also to call the Minister's attention to the claims of blind persons.  I believe they are not treated fairly, sometimes.  I remember having a case where an applicant was examined by three doctors, one of whom was an eye specialist in the city. They specified that the person was blind to the extent that he was able to do no work whatever.  On an appeal by the pension officer, after a visit from the Departmental doctor, the pension was refused.  I would as soon have the opinion of the eye specialist as the opinion of the Departmental doctor.  In that case I believe it was unjust to deprive the applicant of the pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>A great many of the remarks made by Deputies have reference, really, to the law, and not the <Col N="977" /> administration of the law.  For instance, the law at present includes maintenance.  That is perfectly clear. If a person is being maintained, then that person has means to the value of the maintenance they are receiving, and the officials would have no alternative but to take it into account.  Certain of the matters referring to blind persons are also questions of law.  As I said in the Dáil before, I am inclined to agree&mdash;I do agree, in fact&mdash;that the present provisions in regard to blindness are too rigid, and that some change might be made.  I would not like to go as far as, I think, Deputy Myles went, when he stated that if a person could not follow his ordinary avocation he should be entitled to a blind pension.  I would not go as far as that.  On the other hand, I think the present arrangement, whereby a person cannot receive a blind pension if he has eyesight to do any work is too rigid.  The method of arriving at means has been examined from time to time. I have not gone into it recently.  I think it is the best that can be done. The whole matter, of course, is one subject to appeal by the Department of Local Government.  I know that a very great amount of attention has been paid to this question of estimating means, the value of, say, a cow, or of other things that come into account when dealing with applicants from agricultural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be injustice.  Certainly there will be disappointments.  There are disappointments in every law court. Every case that comes to be heard in a law court leads to some disappointment. If you are attempting to examine the facts in any one of these applications you are liable to cause disappointment. The applicant, and the applicant's friends, may feel that they have been hardly treated, but it does not follow that injustice was done.  The only thing we can do is to try to be equitable, and, where it is a case of absolute doubt, give the benefit to the applicant.  That is the policy that has been adopted.  On the other hand, you cannot afford lax administration.  Between strict and just administration <Col N="978" /> and administration that would never leave anybody feeling that they had been judged somewhat hardly, the difference is very small indeed.  I do not know that I can promise any change that would lead to Deputies hearing no complaint.  Every possible care has been given the system, and not once has it been the subject of great care by the Minister, but several times during his period of office. Really, I do not see what can be done.</P>
    <P>With regard to the recommendations of the Committee, I have not got the report before me now.  I do not remember the recommendations but I can answer in the Dáil in regard to them.  A great number have been carried out.  Others will be carried out as soon as possible and some will be, at least, partly met by changes, if not fully carried out.</P>
    <P>It is very well known throughout the country in what form affidavits should be made.  Even with no satisfactory affidavits, in many cases pensions have been given&mdash;sometimes after the visit of an inspector and sometimes simply on a mass of evidence, no portion of which was very good in itself but the accumulation of which served.  I think the position must always remain that the onus of proving age shall be on the applicant.  As long as that is so, you will have people who are, perhaps, genuinely 70 years of age unable to obtain pensions.  On the other hand, you cannot have a system of loosely giving out pensions.  We are always discovering cases of persons who received the old age pension before they were 70 years of age, notwithstanding what Deputies allege.  I can see no way of devising a system that would be satisfactory to everybody.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out to the Minister that in raising this question of people who have been turned down on the question of means, I am going on facts which I myself have come up against.  If the Minister had come up against these facts, I think he would recognise that the Act is not being equitably administered.  I would urge him to take up with the branch of his Department which is responsible, this question of means.  It is unfair to judge means on the same basis in every part of the country.  As far as I can discover, that is being done at the present time.  In my own constituency, the same value is put on the very poorest land as is put on the very best land, and the crops are similarly valued.  If you are to administer the Act fairly, it is essential that some change should be made in the manner of assessing means.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this vote is to meet an amount which was advanced for a deposit in connection with the proceedings that are going on in America with reference to the Dáil funds.  This sum has been carried as a suspense account in the Law Charge Vote for some time. It was expected that the proceedings would have terminated before this and that the amount would have been recovered. However, the proceedings are dragging on, and we have now reached a point where there will not be a surplus in the Law Charges Vote that would enable this to be carried over. Consequently, this supplementary estimate is being presented.  There will possibly be a certain loss in the amount because of the exchange variations, but the amount will be recoverable.  It was first put on deposit but has since been invested in United States 4¼ per cent. Liberty Bonds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister might give us a little more information on this matter.  It has been before us from the point of view of advances towards expenses of law charges in connection with Dáil Funds, and it has not been always quite clear how much <Col N="981" /> of it was likely to be in respect of litigation respecting Dáil funds in Ireland and how much in respect of litigation regarding Dáil Funds in the United States.  There has been a considerable sum voted towards those expenses and there was some money spent, I think, before this form of estimate was presented to us.  I think we ought to have some information from the Minister as to the total expenses up to date in America.  What is the amount in question and what are the prospects of the litigation being concluded? It has been suggested by people competent to make a prophecy &mdash;people who have a knowledge of American law and conditions&mdash;that, bad as things are in these countries, they are much worse in America and that there is likely to be interminable expense, with very little for the successful party after the lawyers on both sides have been paid.  I think the request for this £11,000 for deposit gives the Minister an opportunity, which he should take advantage of, to explain to us much more fully than he has yet explained the position in regard to these monies that are the subject of litigation in America.  We voted in 1925-'26 £7,000, and considerably less than that was, I think, spent.  In 1926-'27 we voted £5,800.  I do not know how much of that was in relation to American expenditure and how much was in relation to Irish expenditure. Now we learn that the sums voted for expenses are almost depleted, and a proposal is made for paying £11,000 as a deposit.  We ought to have some more information from the Minister as to what is likely to be the expense of the present phase of the American litigation.  Is the hearing that is now in prospect to be the final and conclusive hearing, or is there the possibility of further expenditure in continuation of the proceedings between the parties concerned?  One may also ask &ldquo;Is there any possibility of arriving at a conclusion without a decision of the courts?&rdquo;  I would ask the Minister to give us more information in a general way on this question.</P>

The matter has been fairly fully reported in the Press, but it would be well that we should have an official statement from the Minister as to the position.  I should like to know the exact amount involved, and I should like to know, in the event of the Saorstát succeeding in the law proceedings, to what purpose the funds are to be put.  I should like to know if the finances of this State are at present responsible for the payment of interest on these bonds and if there is an accurate record of the holders of the bonds.</P>
      <P>The only other aspect I want to refer to is that mentioned by Deputy Johnson as to the amount of money already spent, the possibilities of spending a still greater sum of money, and the question of whether it is considered reasonably worth while to persist in the case at all.  Anyone with a knowledge of American law cases must be well aware that a great many cases which come into the hands of American lawyers are simply providing revenue for those lawyers, and that the litigants very often end up by having nothing.  I do not suggest that that is confined to America, but it is accentuated with regard to American legal cases.  The question arises whether we can justify a continuance of these votes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the figures at hand that would enable me to make a statement as to the amount heretofore expended in the litigation in America.  The sum is a comparatively small one; it will not, if we succeed in our case, be such a serious consideration. Deputies have asked as to the prospects.  I know nothing as to the prospects.  I am advised that our case is a good one, and that we should win it.  Whether we shall or not, I could not say unless I were a prophet.  There is just this point in connection with it: when this litigation was started the question was of absolutely prime importance to the State.  If the funds in America, some half a million pounds, had fallen into the hands of those waging war against the State, a tremendous amount of damage would have been done.  The damage that would be <Col N="983" /> done by the people laying claim to this at present might not be so great, but I certainly fear that if they were to obtain possession of those funds results highly deleterious to the prospects of the country would ensue.  Apart from that, I think, as we have accepted responsibility in our Dáil Loan and Funds Act for the repayment of the amounts raised in America, we should obtain the bonds if we can.  We are certainly advised that we have a good case and should win it.  We would be bound to proceed with the case, even if the prospects now held out of a fairly speedy issue were not to be realised.  I understand American litigation is liable to be exceedingly protracted, and I would not like to say that the trial just now about to take place would settle the matter.  At any rate, we are moving to a definite stage in this particular litigation, and it is to be hoped that, if it is not finally disposed of in the next month, we will, before very long, get a final decision in the matter.</P>

They alleged they might be subject to certain losses and incur certain liabilities as a result of that.  Application was made to the court with the result that we had to make a deposit to indemnify them against losses which might arise from delay in dealing with the funds.  I understand that such losses will not arise and that the amount of the deposit, which had to be made hurriedly, will be recoverable.</P>

The Minister said he was sure the Saorstát <Col N="984" /> would win.  But if the Saorstát does not win will we have to bear the cost of all these proceedings?

When the estimate was prepared, the inmates of the military hospital numbered about 130, and the estimate was made on the basis of that number.  Very shortly afterwards the number was reduced to about 60, and it remained at that figure since. Accordingly, there will be a smaller amount available from the Army Vote than was anticipated.

There is no appropriation-in-aid in connection with this.

      <P>I quite appreciate that, but we were given to understand by this estimate that the total sum to be expended within the year on Haulbowline dockyard was £15,200.  No question arose on the face of the estimate that there was a larger sum than that actually expendable.  It was to be reduced by a certain income from another account.  That did not appear on the estimate, and therefore we were, to that extent, misled.</P>

      <P>This raises the whole question of the form of estimates, and I think that the matter which Deputy Johnson has raised is an important one, especially from the point of view of the Dáil having information before it on the estimates.  Obviously what happened is that the estimate that was put forward was not a proper one.  The estimate that should have been before us should have shown the total cost of running the dockyard, whereas before the estimate came to us it had been reduced by the amount of money they expected to receive.  I maintain that that is an incorrect form in which to put forward estimates because the Dáil, in order to know what it is voting, should, in the first instance, know what the total expenditure on Haulbowline is going to be, so as to be able to check the amount with the ultimate expenditure. <Col N="987" /> If the total amount asked for from the Dáil was less than the amount of estimated expenditure it should be shown in the form of an expected appropriation-in-aid.</P>

      <P>Possibly a contribution from the Deputy for Cork city would enable us to see a little way ahead in this matter.  It is important that we should know whether there is any prospect of the dockyard being used.  I understand that it has a great deal of very valuable machinery which could be made productive, and we know that there are many things required in the country for which it might be made useful.  The cost of maintenance of the undertaking, if it is not likely to be made use of, is heavy. £16,200 a year is a big sum to pay for whitewashing an elephant.  I would like to know whether the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs could give the Dáil any information, which the Minister for Finance evidently cannot, as to the possible use of the dockyard.</P>

      <P>This is a token vote.  It is financial purism really. The position is that this vote is brought before the Dáil to secure its agreement to the payment of the salaries and expenses for seven months of the current financial year of the various officers and offices attached to the Supreme Court and High Court of Justice, which were established under the terms of the Court Officers Act, 1926.  Under the operation of that Act which came into operation on 1st September last, the existing Supreme and High Court Offices, except District Probate Registries, disappeared and were replaced by a completely new establishment. The salaries, allowances, etc., of this new establishment for the period 1st September, 1926, to 31st March, 1927, are shown in detail in Part III. of the Supplementary Estimate, and amount to a gross total of £35,118.  The final details of the staffing of the various offices are still under consideration, but the ultimate arrangement will not differ in any material instance from the details given in this estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total cost of the new system over a period of a whole year will show a considerable saving on the system which it has replaced, and will be reflected fully in the 1927-1928 estimates. The actual saving will be about £10,000 per annum.  It will be observed from <Col N="989" /> the notes to Part III. of the estimate that a number of officers are on scales of salary in excess of those attaching to the posts which they occupy.  These are in nearly all cases abolished officers who have accepted re-appointment under the Court Officers Act and who are being allowed to retain the emoluments which they were in receipt of prior to the coming into operation of the Act.  All future appointments to the posts in question will, of course, be on the new scales of remuneration.</P>
    <P>Advantage has also been taken of this token estimate to obtain the sanction of the Dáil to an increase of £50 in the sum originally voted for incidental expenses&mdash;that is, from £230 to £280&mdash; which will, it is considered, prove insufficient as a result of certain small miscellaneous charges arising out of the change over, for instance, stocks and share certificates representing court funds held in the name of the former Accountant-General had to be altered to conform with the change of this officer's title to Accountant, and for this a small fee is charged by the companies who issued the certificates. The gross vote, therefore, amounts to £35,168, and against this is set off a sum of £35,158, representing savings as from 1st September on the salaries, etc., originally voted for the full year for the abolished offices leaving a net token requirement of £10.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>This supplementary estimate is necessary as a result of the coming into operation in September last of the Court Officers Act.  Deputies will recollect that under the terms of that Act certain important offices which for many years formed part of the Country or Circuit Court machinery were abolished and other equally important offices were established.  The money voted at the beginning of the financial year 1926-1927 for the various offices then in existence cannot, it is considered, be diverted towards the payments of the salaries and expenses of the new office holders, and the Dáil is, therefore, now being asked to vote the sum required to meet the cost of the new services for the period 1st September, 1926, to 31st March, 1927. The most important change from a staff point of view resulting from the operation of the Act was the substitution of the office of County Registrar for that of Clerk of the Crown and Peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sum required to pay the salaries of the county registrars for the seven months of the current financial year during which they will hold office will be found under sub-head AA of the Estimate&mdash;£13,600, and bonus £4,100. There are in all 26 county registrars, and their total salaries show an approximate annual saving of £5,000 as compared with the salaries of the former Clerks of the Crown and Peace. The salary attaching to each county will be shown in detail in the estimates for 1927-28.  The Act also instituted the office of summons server in place of that of process server.  The number and cost of the summons servers will not materially differ from the officers they replace&mdash;575 at £20 per annum. A sum of £12,000 was originally voted for process servers, and we are asking for £7,000 (also under sub-head AA) for the summons servers for seven months.  Twenty-five court messengers will also act as summons servers and <Col N="991" /> receive extra remuneration from this vote for their services in the latter capacity.  This remuneration is at the rate of £20 per annum.</P>
    <P>With regard to sub-head BB, under the new system the remuneration of the staffs in the County Registrar's office is borne entirely on public funds. Each former Clerk of the Crown and Peace was paid a clerical allowance which was intended to meet his office expenses and which he could divide in whatever manner he pleased among the persons employed in his office. These allowances were quite inadequate and had to be supplemented, in many cases substantially, out of the fees which the Clerk of the Crown and Peace received from local bodies in connection with the revision of voters and jurors lists.  The new arrangement provides for the payment to the County Registrars of a fixed annual salary, and for the surrender by them of such of the above-mentioned fees as are intended to meet the personal and office expenses incurred in the carrying out of the work of revising jurors and voters lists.  On the other hand, the State now undertakes to defray all the expenses which were formerly paid out of the fees, and in the net result no increased cost will result.</P>
    <P>The matter of permanent staffing of the County Registrars' offices is at present under consideration, but a temporary arrangement has been come to by which the existing staffs are being continued at a rate of remuneration equivalent to that which they formerly received from the old clerical allowances, plus whatever payments the Clerks of the Crown and Peace were in the habit of making them from their fees.  A sum of £14,700 (£9,700 and bonus £5,000) under this sub-head represents the anticipated cost of the staffs as from the 1st September last. The electroal fees for 1926 were, except in two counties, paid to and retained by the former Clerks of the Crown and Peace by whom the voters lists for 1926 were prepared.  The fees in respect of 1927 lists, which are now in course of preparation, will not be received until after 31st March next and will appear as appropriations-in-aid <Col N="992" /> in next year's estimate.  The two counties in which the 1926 fees will be surrendered are Dublin and Kerry.  In these counties vacancies in the office of Clerk of the Crown and Peace were filled prior to the 1st September last on the terms which now apply to all County Registrars.  The sums to be surrendered are expected to amount to £1,381 and are shown under sub-head E (appropriations-in-aid).  A sum of £600 is also provided under sub-head BB for incidental expenses which, under the agreement referred to above, are now payable by the State.</P>
    <P>Coming to sub-head CC, a sum of £750 is provided to cover the travelling, etc., expenses of County Registrars and their staffs as from 1st September last.  These expenses, which were formerly paid by the Clerk of the Crown and Peace out of his fees, are incurred in attending Circuit Court sittings and in connection with revision work.  The gross amount required for what may be described as the new services amounts to £40,810.  We must also allow for a sum of £250, which is the estimated deficiency on the original appropriations-in-aid estimated for the vote.</P>
    <P>Against this total of £40,810 we are in a position to set off £1,591, additional appropriations-in-aid, made up of £1,381, Electoral Act fees, received by the County Registrars of Dublin and Kerry, and a sum of £210, representing the estimated amount of the fees which will be received by County Registrars in three counties&mdash;Waterford, Wexford and Offaly&mdash;in which the office of undersheriff has fallen vacant, and in which the execution of court orders is now being carried out by the County Registrar. In the printed estimate the deficiency of £250 on the original appropriations-in-aid is deducted from the new appropriations-in-aid (£1,591), giving a net sum of £1,341.</P>
    <P>We are further in a position to deduct from the gross amount now required a sum of £37,019, representing savings on services which were provided for a full year in the original estimate, that is, salaries of Clerks of the Crown and Peace, process servers, etc., and which cease to exist after five months, viz., 31st August last.  The <Col N="993" /> gross sum required, £40,810, less the deductions amounting to £38,360, leaves a net balance of £2,450, which is the amount in the supplementary estimate for which the approval of the Dáil is now sought.</P>

      <P>I would like to get some information from the Minister with regard to the appointment of the new officers who replace the Clerks of the Crown and Peace&mdash;the County Registrars.  I think the Minister said that a considerable saving in salaries had been effected by the new arrangements made in that connection.  I would like to know if the Minister takes into account the superannuation of the Clerks of the Crown and Peace in the past, and also whether it was compulsory on Clerks of the Crown and Peace to retire on the coming into operation of the new arrangements or if they had power to continue in the position of County Registrar.  If they had that power and decided to continue did they continue at the old salaries or at the existing salaries? The point I make is that we have in certain counties a superannuated Clerk of the Crown and Peace and, at the same time, a County Registrar with a fixed salary.  Undoubtedly the combined salary and the superannuation would be greater than the total remuneration of the former Clerk of the Crown and Peace.  I would like to know was it open to the former Clerks of the Crown and Peace to accept the new office, and if the avenue was clearly open and if no obstacle was placed in the way of existing officers of that kind, how many of them accepted the new position of County Registrar?</P>
      <P>Another point on which I would like to get information is as to the fees formerly paid to the Clerk of the Crown and Peace.  Is the salary paid to the County Registrar absolutely inclusive, or does he get any additional remuneration of any kind from fees or bonuses of any class whatever?  With regard to sub-head CC&mdash;&ldquo;Travelling, etc., Expenses&rdquo;&mdash;I would like to know whether in the Act the question of travelling expenses is taken into account.  Perhaps the Minister would also say something about what &ldquo;etc.&rdquo; means in that case.</P>

As I gathered from the Minister, there will be an additional revenue from fees as compared with the estimate.  On the estimate we were advised of an expectation of £14,000 as extra receipts payable to the Exchequer from fee stamps.  Has the Minister any estimate of the increase likely to accrue to the Exchequer from fees?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Heffernan raised certain questions for the reply to which I should really refer him to the official report of the Second Reading and subsequent stages of the Court Officers Act.  He asked about Clerks of the Peace.  Every Clerk of the Peace who was not over the age limit prescribed by the Court Officers Act was eligible for, and was offered appointment as, County Registrar. There is one qualification to that, as I stated on the Second Reading of the Court Officers Act&mdash;that we were prepared to pay them their existing salaries subject to this: that in no case were we prepared to pay the Clerk of the Peace who accepted office as County Registrar, a salary greater than £1,450 plus bonus.  That was, no doubt, a factor making for the retirement of, perhaps, three or four of the Clerks of the Peace.  I do not say it was the whole story, but it was a factor in certain cases.  That qualification to the general proposition, that we were prepared to appoint Clerks of the Peace as County Registrars on their existing salaries, was fully explained in the Dáil and was approved by the <Col N="995" /> Dáil when the Court Officers Act was going through.  Those were the only qualifications&mdash;the age limit which applied in some few cases and the maximum salary that was mentioned to the Dáil when the Court Officers Act was passing through.  That was approved of by the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I have not here the exact number of Clerks of the Peace who remained on and accepted office as County Registrars, and the exact number that went, but, of course, that can be supplied at any time in answer to a question, or when the estimates for the year 1927-8 are under review.  With regard to the question about sub-head CC, the sum of £750 provided to cover the expenses of county registrars and their staffs as from 1st September last, these expenses, which were formerly paid to the Clerk of the Crown and Peace out of his fees, are incurred in attending Circuit Court sittings and in connection with the work of revision.  On Deputy Johnson's point I said that against the total of £40,810 we can set off £1,591 additional appropriations-in-aid.</P>

      <P>Of course this estimate only deals with the Circuit Court, but perhaps I might be permitted to say, generally, that there was no demand greater than was anticipated for retirement as a result of the passing of the Court Officers Act.  There was nothing in the nature of a general exodus.  If the Deputy puts down a question I could at any time give him the actual figures.  But in the staffs of the High Court, the Supreme Court and the lower courts the retirements were on the small side; there was no rush to get out.  The office of Clerk of the Peace was a life office.  Some of the Clerks of the Peace were above the age which we thought it wise to fix in the Court Officers Act, and some few others went because of the maximum which we laid down, or, at any rate, that entered into their considerations. But, generally, the Court Officers Act is working smoothly and there have been no exceptional retirements.</P>

I hope that there will be an increased interest in this question of industrial schools and the policy of committals, and, further, an interest in the kind of education and training that is given in them.  I do not want to press the Minister at this hour, but I would like him to be prepared for a future discussion on this matter.</P>

      <P>Despite all the Minister for Finance has said, the vote is really a supplementary Census Vote of £12,188.  No provision had been made in the estimate for my Department for 1926-27 on account of the Census, because when we were facing the preparation of the estimates the Statistics Act had not been passed, and nobody could decide as to whether the Department of Industry and Commerce or the Department of Local Government would, in fact, be responsible for the compilation of the Census.  How the £12,000 is arrived at is detailed on the face of the estimate, and particulars are given with regard to the extra staff required.  Outside that there are really only two large items which are bulked in one sum in the estimates. One is an amount of £3,200 which is to be paid to the Department of Justice in respect of work performed by the Gárda Síochána.  The other big item is in respect of the services of a machine expert amounting to £390.  It is, however, to be noticed that the only earlier amount voted by this House in respect to the last Census was a sum of £800 which was included in the 1925-26 Appropriation Account.  There is now this supplementary estimate of £12,188, which is only to meet such payments arising out of the Census as fall to be paid in the present financial year.  There will be additional sums required in the forthcoming estimates.</P>

      <P>As to that, I am afraid that I am not in any better position than I was when last questioned. I think I said then that a provisional estimate with regard to population would appear.  That, of course, has appeared.  A definite and final statement with regard to population will be the next thing probably to appear, but I do not expect that for some months yet.  I do not believe it will be ready before May or June.  After that, volumes dealing with particular subjects ought to appear in fairly quick succession&mdash;but &ldquo;fairly quick&rdquo; has to be used in relation to the material to be handled.  Month by month thereafter certain volumes will appear, but I have to throw myself on the indulgence of the Dáil with regard to this. I could easily have arranged to get out a simple type of enumeration and a rather elementary type of compilation such as have been produced elsewhere, but it was considered better to have the matter handled in a proper, way and have the volumes, when they appear, put up in such a way that there would be a definite advantage to the public in the volumes, that really should stand the test of examination, and in a way that people could get the best possible information from them.</P>
      <P>That is my promise as to what is intended. It can only be judged when the volumes appear, but I still have to say that having made inquiries from time to time from the Statistics Branch as to the progress being made, and having been consulted as to the form in which the final compilations are to appear, I am still convinced that the judgment that will be passed eventually is that it was worth waiting the extra time in order to get the volumes in the form in which they will be presented. But I cannot do more than make promises and give certain estimates.</P>

    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding ten pounds be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1927, for payments under the Railways Act, 1924, the Tramways and Public Companies (Ireland) Act, 1883, etc., and for other purposes connected with Irish transport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

      <P>This is a supplementary sum of £1,500 in addition to the original supplementary estimate of £5,000 granted in respect of the losses on the working of the railways named. When the original estimate was brought in it was considered that the sum of £5,000 voted, plus a similar sum granted to those railways by the Northern Government, would have been sufficient to meet the losses of working on the year, and had it not been for the coal strike the estimate that £10,000 would have covered the loss in working was likely to have been fulfilled.  However, in consequence of the coal mining dispute in Great Britain, the company has suffered.  Its traffic receipts have suffered to the extent of about £1,100 &mdash;loss on carriage of coal to parts of Donegal.  In addition to that they have been faced with very heavy expenditure by reason of the increased cost of coal from May last.  If the company had been in a sufficiently strong cash position to be able to buy coal early, the additional loss on the line would have been cut down somewhat, but owing to their particularly bad cash position they had to carry on from hand to mouth and the loss has been fairly heavy.  The £1,500 which we are asking the Dáil to pass now represents 50 per cent. of the increased loss on working, over the £10,000 previously allowed for.  There is actually a heavier loss than that, but that heavier loss includes certain charges which we have <Col N="1002" /> not yet considered to be a matter of which we could approach the Dáil&mdash; certain fixed charges.  It is possible that there will be a demand to meet those which, if it were divided in the same proportion as between this Government and the Northern Government, would probably entail a further advance of about £600.  But I am not proposing to meet that at the moment. I have not had the case made to me.  I simply want to indicate to the Dáil that the additional sum of £1,500, even if looked upon only as 50 per cent., or approaching half the additional loss incurred on this railway, is not sufficient. It does not meet the entire loss, and there may be a demand for an additional sum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister able to say how many tons of coal are represented by this sum in question, which is £2,900?  I make up the £2,900 in this way: £3,000, being two sums of £1,500 each; loss of receipts, £1,100; so that I take it that the increased cost of coal will be £2,900 on a certain tonnage. Can the Minister say what the tonnage would be?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The loss on receipts is £1,100, and the explanation given is that it is due to the increased cost of coal.  I take it that this explanation is a little defective in that respect; that £1,100 of the £3,000 is due to loss in receipts, but that the remainder, £2,900, is due to the increased cost of coal. Can the Minister say what proportion of that coal would be burned on the portion of the line that we are concerned with, and what would be the tonnage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if this will answer the Deputy completely. The amount of coal purchased for the whole year was 5,200 tons, at a cost of £12,000 odd.  If the coal was purchased at a price obtaining from January to April, which was round about 24/9 per ton, it would have cost £6,435.  The extra cost of the coal purchased between May the 1st and December 31st was £5,572.  The average cost from May to December of <Col N="1003" /> coal per week was £266, as against the average weekly cost in 1925 of £144. Now the mileage run which will have an effect on the coal consumed in 1925 was 14,000 miles more than in 1926, so that if the mileage in 1926 had been the same as the mileage in 1925 the cost for the coal would have been increased from £12,000 to £14,670.  Taking an equal mileage as between 1925 and 1926 the weekly cost for coal can be compared on the basis of £144 in 1925 as opposed to an average cost of £282 per week in 1926.</P>
      <P>On the other matter as to what amount of this coal can be properly applicable to the three lines, I cannot give the details of that as to the mileage of these lines.  The Londonderry and Lough Swilly is a very small fraction of the total, but a far larger proportion is on the Government-owned lines.  The actual mathematics will not tally because there was a reduced expenditure, apart from coal altogether, amounting to something over £3,000, on the working of the Government railways during the year in comparison with the year 1925, but that has been upset by this item for coal, which is absolutely the main item making towards increased cost.  I am not sure if I have answered Deputy Johnson.</P>

Are we to take it that he had at his disposal when he went there to examine the accounts on behalf of the Minister all the facts and figures of the Londonderry and Lough Swilly railway?

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

      <P>His authority is that there is a special definite agreement that owing to the provision of this money we get the most accurate and detailed investigation by any official or auditor I send down.  The accounts are entirely at his disposal. But there has been an arrangement, I think, that in order to effect certain economies and not keep a separate staff employed we should not insist upon the completest separation of the accounts of the Londonderry and Lough Swilly portion of the Donegal lines as apart from the three Government lines.  The Londonderry and Lough Swilly Company are working these lines on that particular basis established pre-war.  There has been a question of a change for a long time. Personally I think it is more economical, from our point of view, even though perhaps it is not formally so correct to have this supplementary estimate coming along from year to year. It would be better if the thing could be settled and put in as a normal item in the estimates, but I think, on the whole, the advantage financially comes <Col N="1005" /> to the twenty-six counties by having it done in this way.</P>

    <P>That a Supplementary Sum not exceeding ten pounds be granted to <Col N="1006" /> defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1927, for the cost of the Army, including Army Reserve.</P>
    <P>This supplementary estimate follows certain investigations of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The items have been paid, and for that the authority of the Dáil is now definitely sought. The items are:&mdash; (1) An item of incidental expenses of £483 that arose out of the publication of &ldquo;An tOglach.&rdquo;&ldquo;An tOglach&rdquo; was the organ of the Volunteers pre-Truce.  During the period of the civil war it was regarded as of great importance that the publication of &ldquo;An tOglach&rdquo; should be continued, and from October, 1922, until August, 1923, it was published by the Stationery Office.  From September, 1923, onwards, it was published by the officers of the army as a private venture, they having received a subsidy of £100 from the army vote. While it was published by the Stationery Office any income accruing from advertisements should be paid over to the Stationary Office.  At the time that it became a private venture there was a sum of £483 owing to it for advertisements.  These advertisements were paid for to the officers who were running the journal, and the money was used by them to extend the journal and for the purpose of the journal. The Army Finance Officer paid over this sum to the Stationery Office in order to put the Stationery Office accounts right, but the Army Finance Officer was not able to recover the amount from the officers who were conducting the journal.  These officers had, of course, received no benefits from the money.  They used this sum that came from advertisements for the purpose of the journal after it had ceased to be a definite Government publication. Authority is accordingly sought to have this money made good to the army vote out of which it was paid to the Stationery Office.</P>
    <P>The next item is the Army Athletic Association Grant-in-Aid.  In the middle of 1923 practically peaceful conditions were restored in the country, but we had a very big army of 50,000 to 55,000 men.  It was not possible <Col N="1007" /> to demobilise them rapidly at that point, and it was regarded as of great consequence that the work of the Army Athletic Association should be forwarded and that the men should be induced to take as great an interest as possible in athletic activities.  It was regarded as likely to be good for their health and morale and as likely to save trouble.  A sum of £5,000 was paid over to the Army Athletic Association. There was no sub-head under which it could properly be paid.  Some of the amounts might have been allocated to other sub-heads, but in point of fact this £5,000 was mixed with other sums obtained by the Army Athletic Association in other ways, by concerts, gate money, and so on, and the whole thing was expended on the ordinary work of running the Athletic Association, in fares, transport, medals, prizes, equipment, rent of grounds, printing and advertising.  This sum of £5,000 was paid over in 1923, and the other amount of £483 was paid over to the Stationery Office in June, 1924.  These are, of course, unsatisfactory matters, but they are matters which had their origin at the time when we had not got normality in the conduct of affairs, particularly in regard to the army.</P>
    <P>There were many matters in regard to the army particularly which were not done just exactly as they should be done.  It was impossible when you built up a big organisation like that not to have certain things done in some sort of rough and ready way.  These matters did not occur just at the very beginning of things, but they occurred before everything in connection with the army and the Department of Defence had been reduced to absolute order.  As far as the £483 is concerned, it was regarded as well worth while to spend State money up until August, 1923, in publishing the journal, and if this £483 went towards helping the journal it must be remembered that there was, perhaps, fairly good value obtained for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to this vote in the circumstances, either in regard to &ldquo;An t-Oglach&rdquo; or in regard to the Army Athletic Association. In neither case are they to be recurrent, <Col N="1008" /> as I understand the paper is at present not run as a charge upon the State.  It is, no doubt, necessary that a sum of £483 should be voted, and I would like to make it clear that there is to be no suggestion that the officers who collected a sum of money for the advertisements which had appeared during the time that the Stationery Office ran the paper, did not collect that and use it for the furtherance of the paper which was, in fact, a semi-official organ and run for the purpose of promoting Army service, while necessarily, I think, it is run as an independent organ now and does not necessarily represent official policy.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Army Athletic Association Grant-in-Aid, I am not opposing that either, but I am not quite sure whether I heard the Minister's statement quite clearly that it might have been possible to allocate the sums to different heads of Army expenditure. I hope he did not say that, because it would appear he was prepared to support the attitude which was taken up at the time when this money was expended or rather when it was being accounted for, and that aspect of the matter received some consideration and disapproval.  I hope the Minister did not mean that it would be allowable for these sums to be charged under different sub-heads in different parts of the Army accounts.  I would like to have the Minister's disclaimer of that.</P>

Is the Minister clear on this, that the £483 and also this £5,000 are to be non-recurrent?  Is he quite clear on that?  Assuming, for instance, that it is not a financial success, is it clear to the officers who have taken over the publication and to everybody that they cannot come back and claim any loss that may occur? Likewise the same question arises with regard to the Army Athletic Association which now or in the future may <Col N="1009" /> come into operation.

      <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar Chéad agus Seasca Punt chun íoctha an mhuirir a thiocfidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1927, chun tuarastail agus costaisí Coimisiún na nDleacht (Acht um Choimisiún na nDleacht, 1926).</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding One Hundred and Sixty Pounds be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1927, for the salaries and expenses of the Tariff Commission (Tariff Commission Act, 1926).</P>
      <P>Deputies will see that the amount of work here charged is comparatively a very small sum.  It does not, of course, actually represent the cost of the Tariff Commission, because while the three Commissioners have given a certain amount of time to the work performed by the Commission and will probably in the future give a greater amount of time to that work, their salaries are borne, as is customary, on the votes of the Department to which they belong and to which, of course, they give the greater part of their time.</P>
      <P>The Secretary of the Commission is seconded from the Department of Finance and, as is customary, his salary is borne on the vote of the Department to which he belongs and from which he has been seconded.  It might occur that a little later he would be definitely appointed, in a more or less permanent way, to be Secretary of the Tariff Commission and would be removed from the Department of Finance and his salary would no longer appear in the vote of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As, I think, was explained on another <Col N="1010" /> occasion to Deputies, there was a certain delay in setting up the Commission, and even when the Commission had been set up certain technical and unexpected difficulties arose.  For instance, a certain difficulty arose in making a regulation for the charging of fees, and it was necessary to get an Order made under the Adaptation of Enactments Act in regard to it.  The Commission is now pursuing its work. The Secretary of the Commission has been devoting himself to the work of the Commission since the 20th January last.  Up to the 20th January, while he had been doing an amount of Tariff Commission work, he had also been doing the work on which he was previously engaged in the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>Only one public sitting of the Commission has taken place, and one of the things that emerged at that public sitting was that the people who made the application, although they had had it before the Government for a considerable time, had not occupied any of the time in making a real good preparation of their case so that it could be speedily disposed of.  On many matters they were not able to answer&mdash; many matters on which they might have anticipated questions.  As a consequence of that the hearing had to be adjourned.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the volume of work of the Commission will steadily increase.  The amount of time occupied, and perhaps the amount of staff required, will steadily increase because, before one application has been disposed of&mdash;and, with adjournments, no application can be disposed of at one, or perhaps two, sittings&mdash; other applications will come in and will be occupying the time of the Commission. Applications which come in first would be still undisposed of, while others would be occupying the time of the Commission.  I think it is rather like the Dáil which, if it has only one Bill before it, must adjourn at frequent intervals.  If there are certain Bills which can be taken on different days it can work continuously.  The Commission will only be able to work continuously when it has a number of applications before it.  If there is an <Col N="1011" /> adjournment of one application for the purpose of getting additional evidence or for some particular matter, another can be taken up.  It will be some little time before the Commission gets into full swing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first estimate the House has been asked to agree to for the purpose of enabling the Tariff Commission to carry out its functions.  We had a reply from the Minister to a question put by Deputy Johnson some short time ago, in which he indicated the number of applications already made to the Commission.  We heard just now that only one of the applications made some considerable time ago had, so far, been heard by the Commission.</P>
      <P>If this Commission is meant to be a real live body with authority to give careful consideration even to the small number of applications that have already been sent in, I think there will have to be more time given to the work of the Tariff Commission, and that will mean that we will be called upon at a later date to provide more money to enable the work to be conducted in a proper way.</P>
      <P>I took the view when the Tariff Commission Bill was brought in that the members of this Commission would be detached from whatever work they might be doing as civil servants and put on this special work, this very important work, for a year or two.  That need not mean that the very prominent civil servants now composing the Commission should be detached permanently from whatever work they were previously carrying on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talks about the attitude of certain people who have gone before the Commission and stressed the point that they did not appear to have gone before that body with their case carefully and fully prepared.  So far as I understand the working of Commissions, it has been customary for the Secretary, after consultation with the Commissioners, to prepare a questionnaire. If the proper questionnaire form were sent out to whatever firm or firms were concerned they would, <Col N="1012" /> and should, have replied to the questions which the Commissioners had in their minds, that is, if the questions were put in a clear or straightforward way.  I am not sure whether a questionnaire was sent out in this case.  If there had been it would overcome the difficulty mentioned by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Are the people of this country to understand that the Tariff Commission is to be the only machinery, the only medium, through which tariffs can be imposed?  I think there is a genuine reason for asking that question, and I hope the Minister will make the matter clear.</P>
    <P>In the last Budget introduced by the Minister he stated quite frankly that no more tariffs would be imposed until after the general election.  He subsequently qualified that statement.  Next we had a proposal for the establishment of a Tariff Commission, which gives everybody to understand that nothing would be or could be done in the shape of imposing tariffs, so far as the future policy of the Government is concerned, unless the applications were put before the Tariff Commission and evidence given in support of it.  We came then to a very startling statement made by the Minister about five weeks ago in his constituency.  Whether under pressure or otherwise he said: &ldquo;There are certainly going to be more tariffs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Has the Minister by that speech in Monaghan prejudged the decisions of the Tariff Commission?  Fifteen applications, we were told, were put before the Tariff Commission.  Are we to understand that the Minister has actually in his possession the full facts and all the evidence that would enable him to prejudge or prejudice&mdash;some people say it would be prejudicing&mdash; the decision of the Commissioners on any particular application?  Let us know here and now, when money is being asked to enable it to carry on this work, if this is to be a real body: this body which is to receive applications, hear evidence and eventually to make recommendations or a report to the Government as a result of which the Government will or will not agree to impose tariffs.  There is an organised body of small farmers in my constituency which has set up an organisation <Col N="1013" /> for the purpose of creating an agitation for tariffs to assist agriculture. At a recent meeting of that body what I believe was a genuine difference of opinion was shown as to whether it should prepare a case to put before the Tariff Commission.  It was decided by a majority not to do so because of statements that were made, such, for instance, as the one made by the Minister for Finance in Monaghan.  I think it is up to the Minister, who is credited by every Deputy in the House with being very blunt and straightforward to say now whether or not tariffs will be imposed in the future, independent of the work of the Tariff Commission. The House, I think, is entitled to that information in view of the conflicting statements that have been made between the date of the introduction of the last Budget and the recent speech by the Minister himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want any remarks which I make now to be taken as in any sense acquiescing in the existence of the Tariff Commission. In view of the statement made by the Minister for Finance on the Budget of 1925, I think this Commission should not be in existence.  Its existence is a direct proof of the value of promises or pledges made by Ministers in the House.  The Commission, of course, does exist, and there is no use in ignoring that fact.  With regard to the putting of cases before the Commission, there are certain points which I would like to have cleared up by the Minister. According to the Act, representations for the imposition, abolition or modification of tariffs must be made by persons substantially interested, by persons engaged in, or proposing to engage in, the production in Saorstát Eireann of goods of any particular class or description.  With regard to abolition, I want to know if that section of the Act means that only persons who are substantially representative of people engaged in a particular industry are entitled to apply for the abolition of a tariff in that particular industry, or if it is possible for representatives of another industry, having no connection whatever with that particular one, to do so?  Take, for instance, <Col N="1014" /> the case of an association of even small farmers, of whom Deputy Davin is very fond of speaking.  Apparently the Deputy thinks that large farmers have no right to exist at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>You mean claim to represent.  I want to know if a body, representing small and large farmers, decided that a particular tariff was injurious to their industry, would they be entitled to go before the Tariff Commission and apply for its abolition, or in the case of an application for a tariff for that industry could they attend and oppose it?  Judging by the methods of the working of the Tariff Commission, I am inclined to think that a term originated in this House by the Minister applies to it&mdash;that it is merely eye wash.  The Minister is well aware that it is not in the interests of this State that there should be additional tariffs.  It seems to me that the Tariff Commission is not facing up to the question of dealing with tariffs at all.  That is the impression that one gains from reading the report of the sitting the Commission held, and doubtless between one delay and another this House will not be asked to deal with any tariffs between this and the General Election.  That, to all intents and purposes, will be the case. Another thing that is pretty evident from the report of that one sitting of the Commission is this, that those who have not yet got tariffs are devoting their attention to proving their case to the people of the country through means of propaganda rather than in the manner of making a real genuine case before the Tariff Commission. When the margarine people made an application before the Tariff Commission they were told, in effect, that they had not half prepared their case, and that as far as the ordinary person could judge they had made a very bad case for the imposition of a tariff in that particular industry.  With regard <Col N="1015" /> to the fees charged in connection with the making of an application, I understand that these are based, to a certain extent, on the trouble and expense the Commission is put to in dealing with each particular case.  I think that is a wrong basis on which to fix fees.  It might mean that in a particular case prolonged inquiry would be involved and that those making the application were not financially in a position to deposit a large amount at the beginning. I would like to know if a deposit also applies to cases where a claim is made for the abolition of a tariff? Does it apply in all cases, whether for abolition or imposition?  These are some points on which I would like to have information from the Minister.</P>

When I said that there would, certainly, be more tariffs, I said it because <Col N="1016" /> I am positive that, in my opinion, there will be some applications out of the many that have come forward, which will so commend themselves to the Tariff Commission that they will lead to a report which will justify the Government in going on with tariffs. The intention is not to impose any additional protective tariffs, except following a report in that sense from the Tariff Commission.  With reference to the two points raised by Deputy Heffernan, only persons engaged in the industry can make application to the Commission.  People opposing the tariff before the Commission can, of course, give evidence.</P>

      <P>I raise this question with a certain amount of hesitation, as I recognise, in making any suggestion or allegation against the conduct of a trade whose exports are value for something like £4,000,000 annually, I may be committing a very serious offence against the producers and those connected with the trade, particularly should the consumers of Irish butter on the English side believe or have any suspicion that there was any ground for this statement.  An article appeared in one of the local papers in the county I come from last week, and statements were made in it which I feel could not be passed over.  After consideration I felt that it was my duty to raise the matter publicly here.  I am only able to give the statements as they appeared in the newspaper.  I am not able to produce any evidence in support of the statements, but I want to have the matter cleared up in the interests of those concerned and the good name of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I read this article I recognised that if the conditions were as <Col N="1018" /> there stated, they were very serious indeed.  I felt that to come to the Dáil and make a statement without being able to advance evidence was rather difficult for me.  I also felt that if the statements could be supported by evidence, for instance, that some Irish creamery butter had been found to contain a considerable amount of margarine, and that the Department of Agriculture know about it, the question was: &ldquo;What are they going to do about it?&rdquo;  I felt that if that statement was true, the negligence of the Department in the matter was something that could not be passed over.  I also read in the article that creameries are putting in margarine.  I should say right off that, for my own experience of creameries in my own county, I am confident the article could not have any reference whatever to them. I know the men managing the business in my county, and I felt that they have too much respect for their good name, and for the reputation of their concerns, to give any countenance whatever to a policy that would hold within it such dangers for their future trade.  I have not sufficient knowledge of the conditions elsewhere, but I have hope that the men managing the dairying industry in the country, and particularly those responsible for the manufacture of our creamery butter, are really concerned for the improvement and progress of the industry as a whole, as well as having a concern to raise the standard of the article to the highest possible pitch.  I felt that they have so much concern for their own reputation, and are so keen on the good name of the country, and doing honest business with people who would be honest with them, that they would hardly be so stupid as to act in the manner indicated.  I hope these are the conditions existing, and that that is the outlook of our people.  On the other hand, I recognised that when an article like this is written responsible men would only write with a knowledge of the facts, and I felt I should probe this matter to the foundation.</P>
    <P>The charge was made not alone against those engaged in the trade but against the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1019" /> Unless the Minister for Agriculture in his responsible position, answering for the administration of his Department, is able to produce evidence to this House which will clear this matter up and contradict these statements I feel that in the minds of the people who have read this article, not alone in my county but in other counties, and in the minds of people who might read it outside this country, it might have serious consequences for our Irish butter trade this year and for some time to come.  Accordingly, although, as I said in opening, I raised the matter with a great deal of hesitation because I am not in a position to produce proof, I thought it my duty to raise the matter in order that it might be cleared up and that we should know whether the statement could be supported by facts. If the Department is negligent why so, and if it is we should consider what judgment we are to pass upon the management of this branch of our business, which is such a big thing for the country.</P>

      <P>I do not see this paper, as a rule, and it was Deputy Baxter who drew my attention to this article.  It was in that way that it came under my notice.  I will quote from the article:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Just at present many small farmers who send milk in dirty cans to the creameries are being prosecuted and fined heavily for their neglect, but there seems to be a hesitancy with Mr. Hogan's Department about dealing with the creameries which are importing foreign margarine and injuring the character of our Irish butter by putting this stuff into it, nor is it the creameries alone that are to blame.  There is an enormous amount of this margarine reaching the Free State in small consignments. It is coming to thousands of people, and practically every ounce of it is being mixed with butter on the farms.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is a gross libel from start to finish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In the creameries and on the farms.  That is a gross libel. I would not have seen the paper but for the fact that Deputy Baxter drew my attention to it.  If I were to view the matter from the point of view of the authority of the writer, I would take no notice of the article. But outsiders are not in a position to judge the authority of any writer, and what appears in a paper is very often taken as accurate.  The best thing I can do is to give figures of samples taken of creamery butter in creameries, and farmers' butter in shops, together with the number found adulterated and the cause of the adulteration. The total number of samples taken by the Department's inspectors in 1926 was 624.  Of these, the number of samples of creamery butter was 315. The total number found adulterated was 77.  Of these 77, the creamery butter cases were 14.  Of the 77 adulterated cases, excess water was the fault in 73; added fats was the fault in four.  Of the four added-fats cases, creameries were at fault in one.  Deputies will agree that inspection is pretty stringent and very widespread.  In fact, I do not think we should increase either the number of our inspectors or the amount of inspection done.  We are doing inspection constantly, and any further increase would almost amount to interference.  Out of 624 cases inspected last year, there was only one case in which there was a conviction for added fats in creamery butter, and there were only four cases of added fats in the whole country, three of them being in respect of butter sold in the shops.  These are the facts which I put side by side with that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not comment further on that statement except to say that it amounts to a gross libel on the whole creamery and butter making industry of the country.  I would pay no attention to it whatever if it were a question of the authority of the writer, but even provincial papers are quoted outside and this quotation might be used and might be taken to be authentic.  The last time I heard of the gentleman who edits this paper was under the following circumstances: There was an article written in his <Col N="1021" /> paper over a year ago, the implication of which was that there was foot-and-mouth disease in this country.  I can quote that incident now, when everybody knows that there is no foot-and-mouth disease in this country and when even our most virulent enemies in England and elsewhere would not make the suggestion.  There was an article written in this paper dealing with the incompetence of the Department of Agriculture and particularly of the veterinary branch.  It was written in such a way that it was copied into the English &ldquo;Veterinary Record&rdquo; as complete evidence of the prevalence of foot-and-mouth disease in this country.  On the strength of that article, the Canadian Government refused to admit a pedigree bull that was being exported from this country.  I did not take the slightest notice of the <Col N="1022" /> matter myself.  There is practically no import of cattle to Canada from here. But it just happened that that year one bull was going to Canada and the Canadian Government, professedly acting on this article, which appeared first in the &ldquo;Anglo-Celt&rdquo; and which was afterwards quoted in the &ldquo;Veterinary Record,&rdquo; refused to admit the bull, which had been exported from Northern Ireland.  The implication in the article here is about as true as the implication that was made in the &ldquo;Veterinary Record&rdquo; when they quoted this article from the &ldquo;Anglo-Celt.&rdquo; There has not been foot-and-mouth disease in this country for the last three years, and one statement is just as true as the other.</P>

      <P>It was only on the 16th instant that an application was lodged on behalf of Thomas Berry, the proprietor of a parcel of land held by him under a fee farm grant for an advance under the provisions of Section 38 of the Land Act, 1923, for the purpose of redeeming the rent payable under the grant.</P>
      <P>It is now the duty of the proprietor to apply to the Judicial Commissioner in the manner prescribed by the Rules of the Land Commission for an order for the redemption of the rent, and on the steps prescribed by the Rules as to title, etc., being complied with the advance will be made.  Until this has been done the purchase annuity on the advance will not begin to run, and in the meantime the proprietor is liable for the rent as heretofore.</P>
