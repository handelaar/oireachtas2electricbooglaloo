      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The recommendations contained in the Report of the Gaeltacht Commission have been under examination by all the Departments of State concerned for a considerable time, and the various departmental observations have, on numerous occasions, been considered and reviewed by the Executive Council and by special sub-committees set up for that purpose.  The examination is now almost complete, and a White Paper will shortly be issued setting forth the Government's proposals in regard to the recommendations contained in the Report.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, so as to obviate delay in giving effect to certain of these proposals, the preliminary steps have been taken of transferring the Land Commission to the Minister for Fisheries, and of appointing a Parliamentary Secretary to assist him.</P>

      <P>I have <Col N="1330" /> received an application in this case but as I have already informed the interested parties, I have not yet been given sufficient particulars to enable me to determine whether it is one which I have any power to entertain.  If the application is intended to be for a loan I have no power to grant a loan.  If it is for a guarantee of a loan under the Trade Loan Guarantee Acts, the parties have been notified of the additional information I require before the application can be submitted, in accordance with these Acts, for examination in the first instance by the Advisory Committee.</P>
      <P>It appears that those responsible for the application do not clearly understand what my powers are in this matter.  I have explained the position fully to them, and will be glad to furnish the Deputy with a copy of the Department's letter if he is interested.</P>

      <P>I am not prepared at present to recommend expenditure from State funds on the construction of a landing place at Barley Cove, Corranmore. The number of locally-owned yawls is very small, and the fishing for herrings in the Cove is at present being carried on by an adequate number of motor yawls and boats from outlying districts which land their catches at Baltimore. The work, as a matter of fact, would cost between £400 and £500, and the number of boats working there would hardly warrant that.</P>

Halvey, Kilkerrin, Ballinasloe, which came under the control of that Department on the 18th June, 1925; if he is aware that the creditors of the estate have been subjected to heavy legal expenses in endeavouring to obtain payment of <Col N="1333" /> their claims and whether steps can be taken to induce the Lunacy Department to expedite the winding-up of this estate.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that serious delays have occurred in the Office of the Registrar to the Chief Justice in dealing with lunacy cases which come under the control of that office.  I am informed that it is usual for a Report Order to be made giving directions as to the complete management of an estate within a month of the date of the declaration of unsoundness of mind. In the particular case of John J. Halvey, to which the Deputy refers in his question, an Order was made on the 22nd June, 1926, declaring him to be of unsound mind, and his business was carried on by the Office of the Registrar to the Chief Justice until his death on the 2nd January, 1927.  Letters of administration were issued on the 27th January, and if creditors are paid within one year from the date of death there will be no unreasonable or unusual delay.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hall has consulted me with a view to having an opportunity afforded to him to-day of making a personal explanation with regard to certain proceedings <Col N="1334" /> yesterday.  I intend to afford Deputy Hall that opportunity, but it seems to me a very undesirable practice that we should begin each day's proceedings with personal explanations arising out of the proceedings of the previous day. It would, I think, be very undesirable if we fell into any such habit.  A personal explanation should be, I think, of such a nature as not to cause in any way any debate or give reason for any other Deputy to make further explanations. It must be clear that we cannot go over the proceedings of the previous day; they must be regarded as finished. It might be worth while to say that when a Deputy takes exception to something that has been said in the Dáil, the attention of the Chair must be drawn to that before any other Deputy has intervened, or before the Chair itself has proceeded to make any statement or to take any other business.  I will hear Deputy Hall, very briefly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HALL</NameTxt>
      <P>In yesterday's discussion on Section 15 of the Public Safety Bill certain statements were made by me which went to show that there would be a possibility, in the near or distant future, of having people in the Gárda Síochána who would be morally undesirable, and, that being so, that they would act in a manner prejudicial to ordinary moral decency.  I made that statement, and, having made it, I wish to say that I was not charging the Gárda Síochána with being an immoral force, or any section of the Gárda Síochána with being immoral.  They are a force that to my mind command the respect and the confidence of every citizen who is law-abiding.  There is no member of the Gárda Síochána with whom I have come in contact but that I have the highest respect for, and I agree that they are a force that this State would be badly served without.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made a charge against me yesterday, as I take it, from the report in the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; this morning, which apparently is so uncharitable as to fail to publish my statement as an introduction to the discussion, but of course the uncharitableness of the Press has not become known to me only to-day; I knew it years ago.  The Minister said that &ldquo;he did not place any member of the Gárda on as low a <Col N="1335" /> level as the two Deputies who had spoken.  Deputy Hewson, in a quite irresponsible manner, had talked very lightly of there being very little difference between agents-provocateurs and the C.I.D.&rdquo;  Mr. Hewson said: &ldquo;I repeat that,&rdquo; and the Minister later said: &ldquo;If we had men of the types of Deputies Hall and Hewson in the Gárda I would be very loth to give them these powers.  We have respectable people in the Civic Guards.&rdquo;  I am sure, if the Minister had any respect at all for the Assembly or for the Deputies in opposition, he did not mean to infer that when I entered on this question I was one of those immoral individuals whom, possibly, he would find in a force of 7,000 people, and I ask the Minister to accept my statement that I have made no charge that would entitle him to put me on the same level as some person, out of a number of 7,000, who might be serving the State and who might misuse that service for the purpose of satisfying an immoral inclination.  I realise how yesterday's happenings will be read down the country&mdash;not by the Gárda; I am not concerned about the Gárda, but I am concerned about the way the ordinary public will read it.  I made no such charge as was levelled yesterday and sanctioned, I might say, by the declaration of the Minister, against the Gárda Síochána.  For every member of the Gárda Síochána with whom I am acquainted I have the highest respect.  The Gárda are a force, whether they be plain-clothes men or men in uniform, that I feel demand respect of every decent and honest citizen in the State.  It is uncalled-for to charge me with being responsible for making a statement that infers, as the Minister put it, that I would be if placed in the same power as they are, guilty of immoral practices in enforcing Section 15 of this Bill.  In conclusion I think the Minister should withdraw as far as I am concerned.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be taken as accepting all that Deputy Hall has alleged I have said.  I would rather leave all that out of the discussion. I do regret that certain remarks <Col N="1336" /> of mine might be held to impugn the Deputy personally or Deputy Hewson either.</P>

Deputies are giving all the services that are required of them and every Deputy is prepared to give of his best.  It is difficult to understand why the President endeavours to stampede Deputies into working all day and all night in the interests of the Public Safety Bill.

    <P>SECTION 20.</P>
    <P>(1) Whenever the Executive Council is of opinion that it is necessary in order to secure the due administration of justice and the sure punishment of crime that persons charged with any of the offences <Col N="1339" /> mentioned in the Schedule to this Act should be brought before and tried by special Courts established under this Act in lieu of the ordinary Courts, the Executive Council may by proclamation declare that Part IV of this Act shall come into operation.</P>
    <P Just="Center">* * * * *</P>
    <P>(4) Every proclamation made under this section shall be forthwith published in the &ldquo;Iris Oifigiúil&rdquo; and shall also be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and if either such House shall, within the next subsequent twenty-one days on which that House has sat, pass a resolution revoking such proclamation such proclamation shall forthwith expire but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under such proclamation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentRice" hpid="Mr. RICE Mr. RICE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. RICE</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to sub-section (1) the following words: &ldquo;but such proclamation shall not come into force until each House of the Oireachtas has passed a Resolution approving of such proclamation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will notice the provisions of the sub-section.  I put my amendment down by way of asserting the democratic principle that the Oireachtas should remain in control until the last possible moment, and that they should be the final voice to decide on questions of emergency.  My objection to this section as drafted is that under it, it would be possible for the Executive Council, with the two Houses sitting here, to issue a proclamation without first allowing that proclamation to come before either House.  That is, in fact, the effect of the section as it stands, and I hope that that is not the intention of the Executive Council.  Under this section, assuming this Bill was law at the present moment, we sitting here today might not be informed that a proclamation would be issued to-night or even while we were sitting.  Under the Bill there would be no obligation on the Ministry to submit to us the proclamation or the grounds on which they intended to publish it.  I hope that that is not the intention of the <Col N="1340" /> Government and I hope that they will give an assurance during the discussion on this amendment that there is no such intention on their part.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would draw the attention of the Deputy to sub-section (4) which states that &ldquo;Every proclamation made under this section shall be forthwith published in the &ldquo;Iris Oifigiúil&rdquo; and shall also be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made.&rdquo;  I would like the Deputy to consider that the circumstances which, in the opinion of the Executive Council, warrant the issue of this proclamation are grave circumstances, very grave circumstances indeed.  But the usual course in connection with matters of this kind is to allow such a provision in the Bill to negative the proclamation.  That is the usual course.  Otherwise, if the Deputy's suggestion were put into force, it would mean first the summoning of the Oireachtas and secondly an actual decision of the Oireachtas in favour of the proposal.  The Executive Council is accepting responsibility in this and in other cases for Executive control.  There has been at least one occasion here in which it would have been inconvenient and difficult, perhaps impossible, for some Deputies to attend the Dáil.  There is an ample safeguard when a motion can be made disapproving of the action of the Executive.  The proclamation is then of no force or effect any longer.  I think it would be unwise to adopt the suggestion that has been made in the amendment.  It would delay the proceedings which, as I said, are proceedings to deal with a grave emergency, and grave emergencies need prompt measures.</P>

      <P>The President referred Deputy Rice to sub-section (4) of this section.  He proceeded to read (4) in so far as it went in support of his argument such as it was.  The President should have continued to read the sub-section to the end, which says that the House may pass a resolution revoking such proclamation, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under such proclamation.  That is the point.  I <Col N="1341" /> suggest that Deputy Rice's amendment is a reasonable amendment and an amendment that should be inserted in the Bill.  If there is necessity for declaring a state of emergency it is very easy to get the House together.  It is very easy to get the necessary sanction for the proclamation.  The President knows that, and in order to get that sanction, if necessary, the President can move for an all-night sitting with an adjournment for three hours' rest and to sit all the following day and night. In view of those possibilities, I cannot see why he should have any objection whatever to the very reasonable amendment moved by Deputy Rice.</P>

      <P>As the President and the House will see, I have an amendment down&mdash;it is Amendment 45, and Deputy Hewson's name is joined to mine.  It is to delete all words after the word &ldquo;expire&rdquo; at the end of sub-section (4) which the President mentioned. My objection is practically the same as that of Deputy Rice in his amendment.  If the President will give me an assurance that when we reach sub-section (4) he will be prepared to accept my amendment, or words to that effect, I, for one, would not persist in supporting the amendment we are now discussing.  That amendment proposes that before the proclamation is made the two Houses should be called together and that the proclamation should not take effect until the Oireachtas deems it necessary to have such a proclamation.  The effect, as I say, is somewhat the same as the proposal in my amendment.  In my amendment, while a proclamation may be made without the calling together of the Oireachtas.  Yet anything that is done during the period that will have elapsed between the proclamation and the calling together of the Oireachtas should not be valid unless ratified by the Oireachtas. From the nature of the President's remarks one would think that he would be inclined to accept my amendment, because he did not, as was pointed out, read the whole sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is because of the last two lines in sub-section (4) that in my view the whole section, as well as the sub-section itself, is a bad one.  If a proclamation <Col N="1342" /> can be made then, whether the Oireachtas ratifies that proclamation or not, anything done by way of an Executive act during that period is to be valid. It simply comes to that: that for that period the Executive Council is supreme.  Though I am not going so far as to say that it would be likely, even if they so desired, that anything should be done that they could not stand over subsequently, at the same time I think it is a wrong principle that even for any period sole authority should rest with the Executive Council. It is quite possible under the Bill, as it now stands, that a citizen of this State might be brought before one of these special courts and might be executed, and there would be, according to this section, no responsibility on the Executive Council.  At any rate, nothing could be done subsequent to that action to fix responsibility upon them, because it is expressly stated in sub-section (4) that, without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under such a proclamation, such a course shall be taken by way of laying it upon the Table of the House.  I think it is open to the Government to accept either one or other of these proposals, both of which I venture to say, are reasonable and democratic proposals. Either let no proclamation be made before it is passed specifically by the Oireachtas, or if a proclamation is made let no act that shall be done under that proclamation be valid unless it is subsequently ratified by the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>That is the point. I do not know whether Deputy Redmond has read this section very carefully. I would like to know if he has in mind any Executive Council in any part of the world or any Government in any part of the world that would accept this proposal.  What is the essence of it?  It comes to this that, taking the minimum number of days, we have three days which is the shortest number of days on which it is possible to call the Parliament together, and 21 sitting days of the Dáil.  We have four sitting days per week, and even if we were to add an additional one we would have five weeks after the issue of the proclamation. Now a proclamation is not issued lightly, but if Deputy Redmond's amendment were to be seriously considered it would, in effect, mean that an emergency proclamation which has got to be issued is going to be held up for five weeks.  Surely that is not seriously put forward.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has again referred to this as an emergency proclamation, but it is not an emergency proclamation.  It is a proclamation authorising the establishment of special courts.  Now one would like to know what is the purpose behind the objection to having a resolution of the House approving of the proclamation? The prisoner is in custody, and the effect of the proclamation is not to add one iota to the powers of the Executive in respect to the arrest of prisoners. <Col N="1344" /> It is not adding anything at all to the powers of the Executive in respect to anything except the establishment of special courts.  The proposal is that on the issue of the proclamation there shall be established a military court which will try all the persons who are under charge in respect to any portion of this Act.  Well, unless one is thinking of executions in a hurry there is no real reason why the necessity for the proclamation should not be supported by the Oireachtas within that time.  When the proclamation is issued special courts will be established, and then every person who is charged with any offence mentioned in the Schedule to this Act, including any offence which is declared to be a treason or a felony or a misdemeanour under the Treasonable Offences Act, or declared by this Act to be a misdemeanour, as well as certain offences under the Firearms Act and others&mdash;any of these offences which include what may be minor offences under this Act, are then referred to be tried by a military court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy McMenamin says, there is already the power to detain, and these persons will be in custody.  They will be tried, in the absence of the ratification of the proclamation by the Oireachtas, by the ordinary courts.  The absence of the proclamation will not affect their trial.  The only thing it will effect is that they will not be tried by military courts, but if a military court proceeds to try and give judgment then there is no appeal and the execution will be carried out in due course of law: that is, if it is a capital offence, or imprisonment will follow if it is a minor offence.  If it is a minor offence surely there is no good ground for demanding that the proclamation of the Executive shall have effect immediately, because the trial would go on by the ordinary courts and judgment would follow.  But if it is a major offence, then if the special courts are set up the persons will be tried and judgment will be given.  If found guilty, execution will follow; then the Dáil might come along and declare the proclamation was not true. That would mean, then, that the special courts had acted on the fiat of the Executive Council.  You have removed <Col N="1345" /> the appeal from the prisoner and you have left the Executive Council in full control in respect to the disestablishment of the ordinary courts of the land. There is no case whatever, as far as I can see, for the carrying out of this proclamation unless with the approval of the Oireachtas.  Certainly the case is not one of the emergency that has been referred to, but somehow or other Deputies have been persuaded that all the provisions of this Bill are emergency provisions dealing with emergency conditions.  They are not.  They are dealing with normal conditions, except that the establishment of special courts will bring about a proclamation, and it may be inferred that a proclamation will only take place in a state of emergency.  When it is effected, it only establishes special courts, which means military courts, and there is certainly no justification for the establishment of these courts without the approval of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr HEWSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Deputies make up their minds on this section I should like to draw their attention to words occurring at the end of the next section.  They are very similar to words in this section, but they give a clearer key to the intention:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... but without prejudice to the validity of anything done thereunder, or the continuing operation and effect of any conviction, sentence, order or judgment made thereunder.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Although those words do not appear in this section, the two sections are clearly drafted with common intent, and I think it clearly means that coming to this House, at a special meeting, five days after the proclamation, we might be expected to sit and look at a sentence of twenty years, inflicted in the interim, running out, with our hands tied.  It is owing to the very clear indication of that further section that I put down an amendment to delete the wording in both these sections, but if the President accepts Deputy Rice's amendment I would be prepared to withdraw Amendments 45 and 47.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw attention to the provisions of the Public Safety (Emergency Powers) Act, 1926.  In <Col N="1346" /> Section 1, sub-section (4) of that Act it provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every proclamation made under this section shall be forthwith published in the &ldquo;Iris Oifigiúil,&rdquo; and shall also be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and if either House shall, within the next subsequent twenty-one days on which that House has sat, pass a resolution revoking such proclamation, such proclamation shall forthwith expire.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Presumably it is following that precedent that this section is presented in the Bill before us, but the Emergency Powers Act of 1926 gives certain powers to the Executive to do certain things, m an emergency, causing arrest and detention, giving certain officers powers to arrest in exceptional circumstances, power of entry into a dwelling-place, establishing special appeal courts, and so on.  These are definite things of a continuing nature which can be remedied if any fault has occurred in the Executive Council.  If anything that has been done under these emergency powers has not the approval of the Oireachtas they can be remedied, but when you execute a man you cannot remedy it.  When your military courts have passed a judgment on a hurried conviction, and an execution has taken place, all the resolutions of the Executive Council will not bring the man to life again.  I point out, too, that after the establishment of these special courts, all persons who are in custody waiting trial for any offence scheduled in the Bill are to be sent forward to the special courts notwithstanding that they may have been before a civil court, and that there has been a jury disagreement. The majority of the jury may be convinced of the man's innocence, a minority differing.  Then, as a matter of automatic effect, that man is to be sent to a military court immediately, and to be tried before a military court. We do not know yet what kind of regulations will determine the course of the hearing at the military court.  We do not know whether it will be public or private, but the military court will be in operation.  The consequences may be the execution of the prisoner, and then afterwards the Dáil may decide that <Col N="1347" /> the state of the country is not such as would justify the setting up of the special courts.  I think it is necessary to emphasise and re-emphasise this aspect of the case.  In effect, military courts will be established, and will be acting even though the Oireachtas may believe there is no reason for the establishment of military courts.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson's point would be quite sound if you admit his two assumptions: one that the Executive Council would set up those courts in time of peace without any reason, good, bad or indifferent and also the assumption that military courts will find wrong verdicts.  I do not think that is justifiable.  There is no more reason to assume that than that the ordinary courts of the land would find wrong verdicts.  Let us look at the procedure suggested.  There is a serious state of affairs making it necessary to set up the military courts and a proclamation is issued for good reasons.  The Dáil is called together after three days.  Even if you shorten this period of twenty-one days to seven sitting days you will get something normally like fifteen days.  There is a serious situation in the country and for fifteen days there is a debate going on here.  There are speeches on all sides. The Dáil is debating the whole thing for fifteen days.  In a serious state of affairs the Executive Council should have the right to act promptly.  What happens?  Even with the goodwill of everyone, it can be held up for fifteen days, that is, even if you inserted &ldquo;seven&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;twenty-one&rdquo; days.  If there was a small minority, and even a small number of Deputies wanted to prolong it, it must go on for fifteen days.  That is a procedure that will not appeal to any sensible man.  I do not assume that military courts are going to sentence people in the wrong. I do not assume that the Executive Council will issue a proclamation without good and sufficient reason.  If these two conditions are present, everyone with a sense of responsibility will realise that not only are you bound to do justice in time of emergency but <Col N="1348" /> you should do speedy justice in such circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quarrelling as to whether it would be seven or fifteen days.  What I want to get at is what would be held up?  Will not the prisoner be in custody?  It is not a question of powers of arrest but a question of the method of trial.  The prisoner is already in custody when these special powers are being asked for.  What will the delay be occasioned by?  By nothing but the time of trial. If the prisoner is, as he would be, in custody for a period, according to the Bill of two months, if it is considered desirable, what would be the urgency or necessity for getting him brought to trial for a space, according to the Minister's calculation, of fifteen days? I cannot see the urgency or necessity for this.  If the prisoner is in custody and if the only question is as to the mode by which you shall try him, where is justice going to suffer?  What considerable danger is the country going to run the risk of if, in order to await the full ratification of the Oireachtas, fifteen days shall have to elapse?  When the Minister speaks about a prolonged debate in this or the other House, while I agree with him that it might be, let us say, inconvenient for the Executive or for individual Ministers to have such a debate, I would ask Ministers and Deputies to realise what they are doing by this section.  They are abrogating the Constitution.  They are taking away one of the greatest, if not the greatest right of the individual citizen, and that is the right of trial by civil and not by military court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1349" /> Is the period of fifteen days too much to spend in discussing a matter like that, especially when, as I have pointed out, nobody can suffer by this delay?  All that would be delayed would be the actual trial.  If the Dáil or the Oireachtas did not consider the emergency sufficient, then the prisoner would still be in custody, but he would be tried by a court other than a court set up by the Executive Council.  I do not approve of the description &ldquo;military court&rdquo; given to these courts. They are not military courts.  They are not even courts-martial.  They are Executive Council courts, courts nominated by the Executive Council and by Ministers, courts from which there will be no appeal, no <i>certiorari,</i> no power of relief, no power of revision, nothing to stand between the decision of that court and the fate of the prisoner.  All we ask is that before such court are set and before such extreme departure is taken, depriving the individual citizen of his fundamental right, such courts should be ratified by the Dáil, even though there may be long and, perhaps, heated debate.  The course of justice would not be interfered with.  It would be merely a question of delay in the mode of trial whereby the prisoner is sought to be brought to justice.  That is what is considered to be an extravagant or factious demand on the part of representatives of the ordinary people. I do not know to what state the government of this country is coming. I do not think that anything could be fairer than to suggest that, with a prisoner in custody, in a position in which he could not continue the course that he has been continuing, even only on suspicion, the Oireachtas should take fifteen or twenty-one days to determine this great question affecting the liberties and lives of individual citizens.  I say that that is not an extravagant or undue demand to make upon the Executive Council.</P>

The lives and liberties of the people will be as safe after this measure has passed as they are now when it is under consideration or as they were twelve months ago.

When an emergency exists prompt measures must be taken.  I cannot say this too often, namely, that this is a measure to deal promptly with disorder, to put down attempts to overthrow the State and to sap and undermine its institutions. These measures are just as unpalatable to us as to the exponents of liberty who have spoken against them here, but we have courage enough to tell the people when they are necessary and that we are going to bring them in and make them law.</P>

      <P>There is an insinuation in the statement made by the President that those of us who are opposing or endeavouring to amend the Bill are refusing to give sufficient powers to protect the Ministers of State or public officials.  That is wrong, and the President knows it is.  If the President wants to protect the lives and liberty of the people he is not going to do it by the passage of the measure as it stands. If you want to give protection to the Ministers, a protection which would have saved the life of the late Vice-President, you will require to have a more efficient police force to carry out the measure if passed in its present form.  No member of the present or the last Dáil took any exception to the amount of money demanded by the late Minister for Justice, or the Ministry, that would enable the Government to set up the most efficient police force possible.  I challenge the Minister to name anyone who made any objection to that in the late or present Dáil.  I am prepared, and always have been, to vote whatever money is necessary to create a more efficient police force, because it is by having a more efficient police force and compelling them to protect the lives of Ministers and public officials that you will get the desired effect.  There are members of this House and many people outside who believe if we had more efficiency in the police force the late Vice-President would be alive to-day. That is what many people outside are saying publicly and privately.  It is by making the police force more efficient and not by bringing in drastic and ridiculously-worded measures that you are going to bring about the state of affairs desired.</P>

The reason given for the rejection of that amendment has been now departed from.  Is there any logic in the House and are we to be told when we make a <Col N="1352" /> statement that we should be in a place of detention?  When I proposed that the three months be reduced to fourteen days I was told that period was not long enough, and that at least two months was necessary to make inquiries as to whether the man should be detained. The President spoke of urgency.  If a man is dangerous he should be arrested.  No harm can be done as long as he is behind prison walls.  If it is necessary to have fourteen days to make inquiries surely it would take a longer time to decide on the mode of trial.  If the Government had agreed to my amendment under Section 16 I could see the logic of the case made to-day, but in view of the case they made yesterday they have swept from under them all grounds of logic and reason for refusing to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>With regard to Deputy Davin's speech I want to say what I think could be better said from the Opposition than from the Government Benches.  I think it is not fair to the police force to charge them with inefficiency, and make them responsible in the way the Deputy did.  We knew the late Vice-President, and we knew his almost reckless courage.  Once after a somewhat stormy meeting, on which we both had spoken on opposite sides, I offered him a lift home&mdash;there was a nasty crowd outside&mdash;and he said no, that he would walk home.  He was the Ministerial head of the police force, and how could they protect him when he choose to take those risks?  It is not fair to them.  They sorrow for his death as keenly as we do.  I do not think that what Deputy Davin said was intended in the spirit in which it may be read in to-morrow's papers.  Deputy Davin is a man of generous mind, and I do not think he wished to hurt the feelings of the Gárda Síochána, as would happen if what he had said had gone without comment.  The police are, for a young force. extremely efficient. and I am quite confident they did all in their power to protect the late Vice-President, and that it was through no default on their part he was murdered.</P>

      <P>To my mind there has been a good deal of talk that is not <Col N="1353" /> applicable to the amendment.  It would be very regrettable, indeed, if a situation should come about which would make it necessary to issue a proclamation in accordance with this section, and that the Dáil should be called together to decide whether these courts should be established or not.  I should like to be clear as to the situation that will confront the Dáil under those circumstances. I think there is a good deal in the plea made by Deputy Redmond that no decision should be taken by a court until the Dáil has met and declared that the court was legally entitled to function.  That is a matter we must seriously think about.  When the Dáil is called together, and we come here, we will know that a certain number of individuals have been arrested, are in custody, and are to be tried on a certain charge.  We will have to face up to our responsibility, and declare by a vote here whether these courts are to be set up or not.  Perhaps a good many Deputies might be prepared to declare these courts should be set up, and some might not.  We would have, I am afraid, a very unsatisfactory condition of things here.  The debate as to whether this proclamation should be rightly issued would centre around the fact that a certain number of individuals were in custody, and likely to be brought to trial on a certain charge and the possibility that our act might have certain consequences for certain individuals will undoubtedly place the Dáil, if it ever has to face that situation, in a very difficult position.  I can visualise that position.</P>

      <P>If they are not actually under arrest I cannot see, inasmuch as they are not in custody, that it is not possible to wait actually until the Executive are armed with authority from the Dáil to set up these courts.  The Minister for Agriculture made a statement that if there is to be justice, then speedy justice is best and justifiable.  In cases, perhaps, I am not disposed to quarrel so very much with the principle of what he says.  It may be if a state of emergency were declared and these courts were set up that it would be far better if every individual Deputy was prepared to take his responsibility for the setting up of these courts.  I am quite well aware that when we come to that we will have the same case made as is being made here to-day and the same differences of opinion.  One body of representatives will think that the circumstances are such as to justify the setting up of the courts.  Another body of representatives may think the contrary.  It might be that the more disagreeable task, will have to be shouldered by one group and the less disagreeable by another.  That may not occur for a number of years but it is not unlikely, knowing human nature and understanding the peculiar psychology of many of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all those circumstances I can to some extent appreciate the attitude of mind of the Executive Council, that they might as well take responsibility for doing this, on their own shoulders because eventually it will be pushed on to them.  I am not inclined to agree with that point of view.  I prefer, as far as I am concerned, that the responsibility for doing that should be put on every member of the Oireachtas. In any event if they are not all prepared to take the responsibility no more odium will come to the people who have got to do this kind of work than would come to them if they took on the responsibility without being armed with authority from the <Col N="1355" /> majority of the Oireachtas.  While the period of 21 days might be a period that perhaps in certain circumstances the Executive might think too long to wait, I think we should be able to arrive at a shorter period, a period that would really not be too long, before bringing into existence these special courts and at the same time a period sufficiently long to enable the Oireachtas to come to a decision.  I think the President ought to try to meet that point of view and if he did he would to a considerable extent meet the claim that these courts are to be set up at the behest of the Executive Council and are to do a certain kind of work for a certain short period at their behest.  It would show that the courts are going to be legally constituted courts which, if there is justification for their being brought into existence, will have the support and the approval of the majority of the Oireachtas.  In the meantime before the decision of the Oireachtas is come to no decision would be taken by these courts which would not be taken if the decision of the Oireachtas had been given.</P>

      <P>I interrupted Deputy Baxter a moment ago with the intent of adding to the point that he was making.  The Deputy was making the argument that if we discuss this Bill while persons are not under arrest, we can discuss the matter without any advertence to individuals.  If we accepted any amendment such as Deputy Redmond and Deputy Rice propose, definitely it may mean, that by the time the Oireachtas assembles, we will have all the talk centring round individuals. The individuals will be under arrest, and Deputy Redmond makes what appears to him to be the valuable point that this section gives no power of arrest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy <Col N="1356" /> might let me conclude and he can make his own argument when on his feet.  He makes the valuable point that this gives no powers of arrest.  It has not been insinuated that it gives any powers of arrest, but hereafter, when the Dáil comes to discuss the proclamation which has been made, it may then discuss that proclamation apart from individuals. There need not necessarily be people under arrest.  But Deputy Baxter is right in saying that the most likely contingency will be that there will be individuals awaiting trial. Deputies will have their discussions coloured by the fact that it is so and so's fate that is being decided, and surely it is better to decide the issue in vacuo.  It is better to decide it without advertence to individuals.  It is better to decide it on the terms of the general proposition as to whether or not these powers should be given rather than to wait for the application of the powers when certain individuals are under arrest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that we can get an easy discussion on that.  Look back on the last couple of days and see what discussions we have had centring around some unconscientious action that some muddled Executive Council might take about some trade unions.  Think of all the hypothetical cases that might be ranged around an individual awaiting trial, and how his case might be made the exemplar of more of these imaginative trades unionists who might be charged with all sorts of crimes which the Executive Council might set out, operating under the powers of the Bill. We have had talk of executions.  It is, apparently, being put to the House, insinuated, that what is being asked for is in effect the power of swift execution before the Executive Council has to meet the House.  Just take the situation that would confront us, a situation so bad that some Executive Council would decide that the death penalty was necessary.  In the first place, the Executive Council deciding that, would have to find out whether the offence triable before a special court was one which warranted death.  There are not many offences named in the Schedule which do warrant death, but an Executive Council afraid to come to <Col N="1357" /> this House to face a discussion on a proclamation under the terms of which executions might take place in the future is going to execute and then come before the House.  Are they not signing their own death warrants?  I go further than saying that they are signing their own political death warrants. They are surely signing their own political death warrants, and they will cease to be Ministers of this State in a very short time.</P>
    <P>What is likely to be the fate of men carrying through an execution which is supposed to be an illegal and unauthorised one, and then going out as ordinary citizens, to walk through the streets of this peaceable city?  That is the contingency the House fears, and that is the slender foundation on which we have all this fabric of horror and suspicion reared.  I have already alluded to the Schedule.  If special courts are going to be set up they are going to be set up to try certain offences.  The offences are treason, the carrying of arms, offences under the Firearms Act, murder or attempted murder of certain people named, and any offences declared by this Act to be a misdemeanour.  No act or offence declared by this Act to be a misdemeanour warrants the death penalty. So we find that in respect of the only sentence which cannot be remitted, death, there are very few offences in which the special courts have that power.</P>
    <P>They have it under Section 24 with regard to treason and murder and, under Section 27, with regard to certain offences relating to firearms.  Those are offences for which an Executive Council is going to be so mad as to establish a special court&mdash;even pick a special court &mdash;which will give a death sentence and see that it is carried out.  And you are going to have an Executive Council mad enough to do all that, but which will be afraid to meet this House.  Yet the Executive will have to meet the House within at least three days of the death warrant being carried out.</P>
    <P>We are discussing this section in the same atmosphere as was previously created with regard to trade unions.  If you count on a completely mad Executive, a completely corrupt and subservient <Col N="1358" /> military court and a completely inefficient police force, anything may, of course, happen.  But there are checks on all these things.  There are cheeks on the special courts and there are checks on the Executive Council.  The biggest check on the Executive Council is that the Dáil has to be summoned by the proclamation.</P>
    <P>The case against accepting the amendment is definitely what the Minister for Agriculture stated&mdash;that there should be a prompt reply to certain types of crime when committed and that there should be prompt and exemplary sentences. But let nobody's imagination run away with the idea that death is the only exemplary sentence which, if carried out promptly, will have that effect.  The mere fact that military courts are functioning and that sentences are being given, even though there is a review by the Dáil afterwards, in the sense that there is a debate as to whether the proclamation was rightly issued and whether the military courts were properly established, will have a deterring effect.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to the police. I hope there will not be many who will follow Deputy Davin's line&mdash;that he is going to excuse his own inaction by an attack upon the police, that he is going to salve his own conscience for doing nothing and preventing people who desire to do something getting the necessary powers, by merely saying that if the police had been more efficient the Vice-President need not have been killed.  Will the Deputy point out what standard of efficiency the police force will have to attain to protect every citizen of this State against a sniper's bullet?  Let him think in what different ways people might have been murdered in this country.  Let him examine all the different things which might have been done leading up to the murder, and he or anybody in this country can see whether he is justified in blaming the whole thing on the police.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cooper and the Minister for Industry and Commerce appear to take exception to the statement I made regarding the efficiency of the police force.  Until ten minutes ago, I had refrained from expressing <Col N="1359" /> that view but I came to that conclusion &mdash;a conclusion which other people came to outside&mdash;when I heard the statement made by the President in support of the Second Reading of this measure.  The President gave members of this House a historical review of the activities of a certain political party and a certain secret military organisation by way of justification for the passing of this measure.  When did the President and the members of the Executive Council get hold of that information? Why did they not give members of this House and the country, as a whole, that information when it came into their possession and then justify the introduction of a measure of this kind and not wait until a certain incident had cropped up? That is my justification for the statement which I made here to-day.  I am entitled to hold that view and I do hold it in spite of what the Minister for Industry and Commerce has said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>The root of the trouble in this country lies in the existence of secret military organisations.  I stated that in this House three or four years ago, when a similar measure was being discussed and when I introduced a certain amendment.  There is no hope of destroying the element responsible for the recent assassination until you cut root and branch out of this country the secret organisations, whether military or otherwise.  I moved an amendment to a previous Bill of the same type and, if the Minister for Industry and Commerce will look up the division list he will see whether I was then, as I am now, prepared to give power to the Executive Council to cut root and branch out of this country every element of secret organisations.  Until you do that, there will be no use in passing measures of this kind.  I know and the Minister for Industry and Commerce knows and those who sit with him on the Front Bench know perfectly well that there are men in the <Col N="1360" /> police force&mdash;even in high positions in the police force&mdash;who have been themselves members of a secret military organisation.  That secret military organisation divided five or six years ago.  One element went one way and the other element went another way. Does he not agree that it was reasonable to assume that the men who went into the Gárda Síochána should have been keeping a careful watch over the element which remained attached to that secret military organisation?  We are told that it is only a little remnant of the secret military organisation that led up to the occurrence responsible for this Bill.  Those who remained attached to it should be known to the members of the police force and they should have been dealt with before now and before this Bill was introduced.</P>

But I do not think we can have a Second Reading debate on amendment 43 or on any other amendment.  The question of the efficiency of the police force does not arise, and now that statements have been made by Deputy Davin, by the Minister and by Deputy Cooper, we may let that point rest and endeavour to confine the discussion to the question which arises on amendment 43&mdash; whether, after the proclamation has been issued, it will be valid without an approving resolution of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>May I point out again that what is proposed in the amendment is to give the Oireachtas another opportunity before finally suspending the Constitution.  The Bill says that in regard to certain sections of the Constitution, the power of suspension lies, for at least a period, solely with the Executive Council.  The amendment, in effect, provides that <Col N="1361" /> power to suspend the Constitution may be proposed by the Executive, but can only be exercised with the approval of the Oireachtas.  The Minister for Agriculture defended this proposition on the ground that the military courts are perfectly sound and reliable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Pardon me.  My position was that I was just as much entitled to assume that the military courts are sound as the Deputy is entitled to assume, as he always does, that they are unsound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Inasmuch as I have never assumed they were unsound, he has no right to assume they are sound &mdash;just about as much right.  On the very face of it, these courts are to consist of &ldquo;three or more members, of whom one (who may be or not be an officer in the Defence Forces of Saorstát Eireann) shall be a person certified by the Attorney-General to have legal knowledge and experience, and the others shall be officers of the Defence Forces of Saorstát Eireann, not below the rank of Commandant.&rdquo;  They may be, and I am sure will be, perfectly honest men in regard to the weighing of evidence, but they are not experienced in the weighing of evidence&mdash;they are not men of judicial temperament.  Most of the men at present&mdash;I do not know what the case will be in five years&mdash;are men who have gone through a fierce political and military fight, and they have very definite prejudices and antipathies. With all the desire in the world to be honest, one must recognise that they are not of the judicial type, and are not trained in the weighing of evidence. One person must have legal knowledge and experience, but if he is one of those who are in the Army, as he may be, according to the section, his experience will not have been of the kind that is required in a criminal court.  If there was at any time in the mind of the Executive Council any belief in the necessity for having a <Col N="1362" /> judiciary of experience, away from the influence of the Executive, and, as I said yesterday, standing between the Executive and the citizen, as a protection for the citizen, we ought to be slow before we give power to the Executive to abrogate that protection.  The Constitution proposed by the Executive Council shows that they did at one time believe it was desirable, even necessary, that there should be some surety that the courts would not be military courts. Article 69 of the Constitution provides that</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All judges shall be independent in the exercise of their functions, and subject only to the Constitution and the law.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Article 70 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No one shall be tried save in due course of law, and extraordinary courts shall not be established, save only such military tribunals as may be authorised by law for dealing with military offenders against military law.  The jurisdiction of military tribunals shall not be extended to or exercised over the civil population save in time of war, or armed rebellion, and for acts committed in time of war or armed rebellion, and in accordance with the regulations to be prescribed by law.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At that time there was a belief in the Executive Council and in the Oireachtas that there ought to be special provisions made in the Constitution regarding the trial of prisoners, and it was provided that there should not be extraordinary courts established save in certain circumstances.  According to this section we are going to forego that; we are suspending that, or leaving the right to suspend it in the hands of the Executive Council.  Inasmuch as the only reason for the establishment of these courts is a speedy judgment, all the more reason is it, in my opinion, that the Oireachtas should have the right to say whether the circumstances, as defined by the Executive Council to the Oireachtas at the time, satisfied the Oireachtas that the Constitution should be suspended.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson <Col N="1363" /> seems to me to be appealing to our sense of beauty in matters of the written Constitution, as if the Constitution is a piece of lyric poetry that was to ensure definitely perfect peace and liberty, and fill everyone with a full appreciation of the liberties and rights of others, whereas, as I have said before, it can be of no use to us if the institutions that it is supposed to set up and guard are destroyed.  I submit to Deputies that the reason for this particular section is that we are trying to persuade the Dáil that the information which the President gave in his Second Reading speech, and the acts which we have known have taken place, show that a conspiracy exists in the country of such a nature that it is quite possible that in a serious state of affairs later on, when it would be absolutely necessary for the safety of the State that justice should be dealt out and fully administered, the proper administration of justice would be prejudiced and destroyed by the very conspiracy that was bringing about the dangerous state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Deputies are called upon to decide in dealing with this section is whether the information given them and their knowledge of the facts and the possible tendencies that lie there are such that they can contemplate, at some particular time when it is necessary that justice should be fully administered to the people, that the courts are likely, as a result of the conspiracy, to be reduced to a condition in which justice will not be capable of being properly administered, and whether, granted the possibility of such a state of affairs, they are going to contemplate the setting up of military courts so that justice can be dealt out.  It seems to me that if Deputies are convinced that there is any possibility of such a state of affairs being brought about, then the only thing they can do is to give the Executive Council the powers sought in this section.  The Executive Council will have the fullest and the completest possible information&mdash;at any rate will have the responsibility for safeguarding the State at that particular time and for handing that responsibility on <Col N="1364" /> to whoever takes it from them.  They should be put in a position to say that the time had come when the conspiracy had jeopardised and perhaps destroyed the courts for the ordinary administration of justice, and be enabled to take a decision to set up military courts. Anybody who wanted to argue against the necessity for taking such action as that would have to make his case against the Executive Council, which standing up to its responsibilities was taking the kind of action that it considered necessary for the preservation of the State.</P>
    <P>It does seem a fair and reasonable proposition that the Executive Council, which is responsible for the safety of the State at the moment, should be given the power that Deputies may consider would be required by it.  I submit that that is the only consideration. Niceties as to whether the Executive Council in such a position should be controlled within five or seven or twenty-one days cannot be compared with the question as to whether you are going to arm the Executive Council with power to take such action as that, and to stand up and defend that action if possible; and if they are not able to defend it, at any rate to hand over in a healthy and safe way the Government of the State to whatever other Council will take its place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BELTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the amendment.  No argument put forward from the Government Benches, to my mind, carries any weight against the proposed amendment. No explanation was given by any of the Ministers in support of the original section which would hold water.  This proposed amendment would act as a useful break on precipitate action by the Executive Council.  We are assured that no Executive Council in the world would take precipitate action in such an emergency.  Very well.  Why want such power as to rush a man to his doom in a few days?  There is no disguising the fact that it is executions that are prompting this sub-section (4). We are not fools on these Benches not to see quite plainly written across that section that executions may be required. <Col N="1365" /> I will not go any further than that.  I feel inclined to but I will not.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce pointed out the invidious position the Executive Council would be in if they came up here, having prisoners in custody, to get special courts and these prisoners got severe sentences which were carried out.  If they asked for these courts and they were turned down by the Dáil they would have to resign and go out as ordinary citizens, and what would their lives be worth? In effect that was the way he put it.  I put it to this House that if they rush men to their doom and a vote of this House, although it cannot censure their action, disapproves of the courts continuing any further, can any Ministry with any honour retain office for one hour further?  They would have to go as private citizens.  Then the very argument put up by the Minister for Industry and Commerce applies, and their lives would not be worth an hour's purchase.</P>
      <P>It was rather unfortunate what the President said with some heat in reply to Deputy Redmond.  &ldquo;Who tried the Vice-President&rdquo;? he asked.  &ldquo;Was there a judge and a jury&rdquo;?  I wonder does the President and other Ministers want to come down to the same level and compare themselves with assassins?  Is not that the standard of comparison made by the President himself?</P>

I do not know what other meaning could be taken out of it.  Either of the amendments proposed by Deputy Rice or Deputy Redmond would relieve the Executive Council of a very irksome responsibility.  I think it will be difficult for the Executive Council to justify the tenacity with which they are sticking to their original proposal if they do not concede the very reasonable amendment proposed by Deputy Redmond.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BELTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not going to labour the point, but I want to connect certain statements made in the House. Deputy Cooper said that the Vice-President took unnecessary risks.  There is not a member of this House nor a man, woman or child in Ireland who will not say he took unnecessarily foolish and made risks in view of the information disclosed by the President on the Second Reading of this measure.  Now, if a man asks for trouble he will get it, and if he goes into danger there is no use crying out when his fingers are burnt.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, I am afraid, &ldquo;blew the whole gaff.&rdquo;  He asked what state of efficiency would you want the police force in this country to be in to save a man from the sniper's bullet.  Will this Bill save a man from the sniper's bullet?  Will any legislation you pass here save a man from the sniper's bullet?  The Ministers know that there are men in this country who, if they are driven to it, will walk up in the street in face of a battalion of soldiers, blow the brains out of a man if he drives them into a corner, throw their revolvers on the ground and say, &ldquo;My life is forfeit.&rdquo;  That is what you are <Col N="1367" /> driving these men to.  You are not dealing with criminals or with an underground of ruffianism, but you are dealing with the remnants of the I.R.B., that Ministers manufactured into being members of the I.R.B., and who now, according to their definition, are criminals, but who are men imbued with the loftiest ideals of patriotism.  We may disagree with their methods and you are going to have revenge, perhaps, for some difference of opinion with you when you were at one time fellow-members of the same organisation.</P>

      <P>I think the interruption is unworthy of any remark, and I will treat it as such.  This is a terribly grave step that the House is taking, and perhaps it would not be extravagant language if I were to describe it as a step on which the destinies of the country will depend.  We were told. until we got this Bill, that we had a perfect harvest of law and order, but if the Government really want to restore law and order they should go cautiously, and when they are met with suggestions by men who are as anxious to restore law and order as they are they should consider them seriously for none of us wants to live in a criminal lunatic asylum, nor do we want our children to be brought up in one.  We all want law and order, but I think that the Bill was forged in a criminal lunatic asylum, particularly this section, which is the tit-bit and the kernel of the whole thing.  It puts it in this way: &ldquo;There are certain fellows we want to get hold of, and we want to get hold of them when the Dáil is not sitting.  We want to set up our special courts, and put these fellows over the top, and even if our action is not approved of we cannot be censured or called to order for it.&rdquo;  In what I might call plain, agricultural language, <Col N="1368" /> that is the position as it appears to me. That is and will be the position of the man in the street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This proposed legislation puts Buckshot Forster in the shade.  Whether it is people of a certain political outlook or of an opposite political outlook who do certain acts in this country, these acts go all over the world as the acts of Irishmen to Irishmen, and we have to bear the shame and disgrace, or the opposite, according to whether they are well-advised or ill-advised.  Amendments are put down to this Bill in perfect faith, reasonable amendments that will not allow justice to be cheated, as has been pointed out by Deputy Redmond and Deputy McMenamin.  You get your man; you have power to keep him for two months; during that two months you can employ either of two courses, having the machinery of Executive government; you can summon the House before you act or you can be responsible to the House after you act.  What is more reasonable than that?  Did any organisation go to the people and ask them to put into the hands of seven or eight men the lives, liberties and property of the citizens and the destinies of the people?  Nobody did so, because neither his life nor his property would have been safe if he had dared to stand on a public platform and advocate that.  But having got in here, the Government wants to manipulate the House.  It is not the Executive Council that the country will look to but the Dáil.  The whole 153 Deputies cannot be members of the Executive Council.  They are members of the Dáil.  They can raise any question that interferes with the liberty of the citizen.  But the people were asked to vote for them to protect the liberty of the citizen.  No Deputy has a mandate to place the liberty of the citizen in the hands of seven, eight, or ten individuals, I do not care who they are Deputies who vote for this measure vote for something that, in my opinion, they have no constitutional authority for, and I hope that the legal luminaries on the Government Benches, who take good care to be out when this is being considered, will answer this question, put, not from the bar or from the library of the courts; where I understand all <Col N="1369" /> legal points are decided, but put straight from an ordinary class, the principal and, I must add, the most honourable class in the country&mdash;direct from the plough.  What authority have you to vote for a dictatorship of one man, or seven men, or ten men?  Who gave me authority to do that?  I got 9,000 votes at the last election.  Did any man vote for me to do that?  No, and they will repudiate&mdash;and they would not be worthy citizens if they did not&mdash;every Deputy who votes to hand over the lives and liberties of the people to seven or eight individuals, who did not use moderation in days gone by.  If they had, there would be less need for this measure now.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the amendment.  I cannot see any reason why the Minister, or the Ministry as a whole, as I suppose there is collective responsibility, would not accept some of the amendments that were put down to this section.  There is no reason why the first amendment should not be accepted, and let the responsibility for the proclamation be the responsibility of the Dáil instead of being that of a few Ministers.  In the course of the 21 days during which a resolution annulling the proclamation might be passed here, we might find that the courts had been set up, men arrested, tried, sentenced to death, and executed within 21 days before the Dáil had come to a decision.  I think the amendment aims at guarding against that state of affairs, to protect the citizen from execution before the elected representatives of the State had an opportunity of considering the matter and coming to a decision.  I think the amendment is a reasonable one, and should appeal to any man who desires to do right, and that Ministers should not be allowed to overload themselves with greater responsibility than is necessary to maintain law and order, and all that it includes.  It is an appalling state of affairs to find a Ministry wanting powers for the whole 21 days.  Under the proclamation courts would be established, arrests made, and trials and executions could take place in that period.  Can the Minister for Local Government tell us, as we have only him here, and he is not likely to be in <Col N="1370" /> charge of either of the two Departments concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not criticising the attitude of the Minister in the past.  I referred to the fact that having past experience he might be able to reply now.  Is he not aware that, under the proclamation we might have from the Executive Council, in the very near future, men could be arrested, tried by these military courts, sentenced to death and executed before the Dáil assembled?  That is not impossible. There is nothing to prevent that.  Even if the present Executive Council would not agree to such a course being taken when this Bill comes into force, is there any guarantee that the Executive might not be displaced by others, who might not be so lenient as the present Executive professes to be?  It must be realised that there are many other Deputies than the 46 that go to form the present Government Party.  The whole position needs review.  I think it is the opinion of every man who desires to see State affairs proceeding normally, that Deputy Rice's first amendment to this section should be accepted, and that the Executive Council should take no action, nor allow any court to be set up nor any trial or execution to take place, until the Dáil has given them authority to do so.</P>

      <P>All this talk about the possibility of persons being taken within a few days for the purpose of being executed is avoiding the real issue, which is that these sections are put in, in the first place, as a protection <Col N="1371" /> against an attack on the civil courts by the conspiracy we are dealing with, and in case of the expectation of these courts not succeeding in protecting the civil courts, securing that justice shall be properly and effectively administered.  It is simply running away from the question, as to how our civil courts are to be protected, and what steps are to be taken to secure the proper administration of justice, if the operations of our civil courts are prejudiced in any way.  Deputies are running away from the consideration of what should be done in these cases when they talk about the execution of persons who are caught within a few days.  Section 24, sub-section (3) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Every sentence and every order and judgment of a special court shall be carried out by the civil authorities and officers by whom and in the like manner as a life sentence, order, or judgment of the Central Criminal Court is required by law to be carried out.</P>

      <P>I want to register my protest against Section 20 as it now stands.  I also want to register my personal protest against military courts.  We ought to have had in this country quite a sufficient experience of military courts, an experience which should certainly influence us not only against establishing these courts, but even against the very phrase &ldquo;military courts.&rdquo;  These words convey very bitter memories to many Irishmen to-day, and, in my view, there is nothing more calculated to revive some of those old feuds, and some of the very recent feuds, that existed in our country than the use of this term &ldquo;military courts.&rdquo; The intention apparently is to prolong the period of remand at present, and it gets away from what, I feel sure, most of the Deputies desire, namely, that if crime is committed there should be speedy and adequate justice.</P>

      <P>The proclamation certainly mentions a special court which, after all, is a military court.  Of course I can understand the Deputy's interruption if he has not read the Bill. In my view, this proposal is an attempt to filch from the people their natural rights and privileges.  We have been told that the people are our masters, and that all power comes from the sovereign people of Ireland.  I submit that in this part of the Bill we are proposing to abrogate those powers absolutely.

I presume that in dealing with the section I will have the opportunity of saying some things that I might have said if I had taken part in the discussion on the amendments that have been dealt with.  In the course of the debate the President stated that the Executive were willing to take all the responsibility in this connection and to relieve the Dáil of any responsibility in connection with the ratification of the proclamation necessary to set up such courts.  I do not know that the members of the Dáil would be anxious to be relieved of their responsibility in that matter.  I do not know that it is quite fair to suggest, as it has been very frequently, that any section of the House is willing to evade its responsibility in this or any other connection. This Bill is a very serious one, and whether Deputies support it or oppose it they all realise that it is a very grave measure.  I think there should be some general agreement as to the safeguards necessary if the Bill is to be put into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1378" /> During the course of the debate yesterday Ministers referred very frequently to the check that would be on this legislation, when enacted, as a result of Parliamentary control.  I submit that a clear case has been made for rigorous Parliamentary control in this connection, having regard to the very grave nature of the Bill itself.  I am in agreement with Deputy Anthony in regard to what he said about military courts.  Within the last few days I heard a very eminent lawyer, who had very considerable experience of military courts, discuss them.  He said that while they were very just, and composed of men who were always anxious to do their duty fairly, that the members of them were entirely ignorant of the law.  He referred to the courts set up by the British Government in this country.  We have no reason to think that the courts to be set up by our own Government, and consisting of military officers in this country, will be any wiser in the administration of the law than the officers who adjudicated in similar courts previously.</P>
    <P>This section is one of the most repugnant in the whole Bill, and whether the Government agree with me or not I am quite satisfied that the very general opposition there is to the Bill throughout the country is largely because of this particular section, because it opens up an avenue to feuds, bitterness and recollections that are painful to everyone in this country.  Military courts in the old days were known, in many cases, to have sentenced men to death.  These sentences were carried out, although it was generally known all over the country that the men so sentenced were entirely innocent.  While I am not at all anxious to suggest that mistakes of that kind will be repeated. I do suggest that the setting up of courts with men who have no knowledge of the law&mdash;two members of the courts, at any rate, will not be bound to have any knowledge of law&mdash;is a very dangerous procedure.  While I grant that there is a grave situation to be dealt with, I feel this proposal is entirely too drastic, and that at any rate, if military courts are to be justified at all they ought to be composed <Col N="1379" /> entirely of people who would have legal knowledge and who would have, as was suggested some time ago, the method, the ability, and the knowledge required for summing up the evidence tendered at these courts.  I sincerely trust that even yet the arguments that are being advanced in favour of a revision of this proposal to establish rough-and-ready courts to dispense rough-and-ready justice will be accepted in the light of the case that can certainly be made for such a revision.</P>

      <P>This section proposes to set up special courts and outlines the methods by which they shall be set up, namely, by proclamation. For my part I would like it to be understood that if the Executive Council have reason to believe from information or reports&mdash;information which perhaps they are not able to impart to the Dáil from the point of view of public policy&mdash;that some form of special courts might be necessary in case of grave emergency, I would not object, but where I quarrel with the Executive and the Government is as regards the form of the court and the method of the proclamation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to deal with the form of the courts on this section, because I have an amendment down specifically proposing to alter that form in a subsequent section, but I would have been disposed to have gone this far with the Government and the Executive Council in this section, to have permitted them, as far as I was concerned, to obtain powers to set up certain special courts, even by way of proclamation.  I object entirely, as I think I have stated on the discussion of the last few amendments, to the mode of such proclamation.  To this section two amendments have been proposed, one by Deputy Rice, the other by myself, the effect of which would have been practically identical and which would have altered this section but would not have altered, in my view, its main purpose.  The purpose is that if, <Col N="1380" /> in the opinion of the Executive Council, the emergency is such that special courts should be set up, they should have the power to set up these special courts by proclamation, but that proclamation should be subject to the approval, whether by ratification or otherwise, of the Dáil or the Oireachtas and within that period in which they might get that approval no act that would be done should be legalised by this section.  Therefore I am constrained to vote against this section, because not only are the Government requiring special courts but they are insisting upon every letter of their proposal in the section.</P>
      <P>Now, I thought that there was a possible means of accommodation when I suggested to the President that I would be prepared to allow the time which was stated here as twenty-one days to be shortened, but even there, neither he nor any of his colleagues would abate one jot.  It is against that attitude as much as against the distinct proposal contained in this section, which is nothing short of this, that for a certain period the Executive Council shall be the sole masters of the lives of certain people in this country, that I propose to record my vote.  I think that there might have been accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that what Deputy Rice and myself asked in our amendments was reasonable, and would in no way have interfered with the working of the section, and, further, that the proposals that we made were sound, constructive proposals which the Government might have been well advised to have adopted.  Instead of that they have chosen the other course.  They have chosen to insist on every word in this section which will enable a proclamation to be made setting up these special courts which will ensure, as the last two lines of sub-section (4) provides, that no matter what takes place during that period&mdash;however short that period may be, it does not really matter or affect the argument&mdash;the Executive Council shall not be held responsible for any action that will take place.  I object to that, from the point of view of the Ministers themselves.  It is placing them, I think, in an unnecessarily invidious position.  I object to it also <Col N="1381" /> from the point of view of the fundamental basis of our constitutional rights.  This State is supposed to be governed by representatives elected by the people, who elect the Executive Council, which is responsible to that representative assembly, and through them to the people.  This takes away such responsibility.  I think in that respect it is injurious to the proper regard and respect which should be expected from the people of this country towards the Constitution and the State in which they live.  Therefore, as far as I am concerned, I will vote against the section as a whole, not because I think that it might not be advisable to give the Executive certain powers to set up courts by proclamation, even if they so desire, but that it should not give them powers to set up courts by the method and in the manner of the proclamation proposed in this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GilbertLynch" hpid="Mr. G. LYNCH Mr. G. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister for Agriculture gave us the keynote of this Bill and this section when he stated &ldquo;speedy justice.&rdquo;  He did not tell us what he meant by speedy justice, but we, in this country, have had many examples of speedy justice, and I, for one, do not want any repetition of that speedy justice.  In dealing with this section we have to take into account the sections we have already passed.  We have to take into consideration that it is provided in those sections that several political organisations and some semi-military organisations, and any organisation the Executive have a mind to declare unlawful, are to be suppressed and put outside the law.  If the sections are put into operation they will immediately mean arrest, imprisonment, the breaking up of home life, of social life, and all those things, and it will be up to these citizens to decide whether they are to be quietly taken from their homes and cast into prison, or whether they are to make some kind of resistance.  Personally, if I were one of these I would say, &ldquo;If I am to be taken, I will be taken forcibly; I will not be taken quietly.&rdquo;  That is the position of this, and it is bound to lead to turmoil and civil war, and the result will be the sacrifice of human life on both sides. That is the state of emergency the Executive <Col N="1382" /> pre-supposes to exist before this section is brought into operation.  That being so, they have got to take into consideration the state of mind in which these courts will assemble.  We have had experience of military courts in the past.  Deputies who took part in the 1916 Rising are fully aware that from the military point of view the Rising was an absolute failure.  Had it not been for the incompetence and blindness of the British militarists of that period we would have been laughed at as fools.  At the most, we would have been looked upon as over-zealous people.</P>
      <P>The rising that was a failure was made a success because of that speedy justice that was meted out to Padraig Pearse and his gallant comrades.  We do not want to see a repetition of that in this country.  So far as I am concerned, I do not want to give powers to any Executive to set up courts which will be in operation for a number of days before this assembly will know anything about it and which will be able to administer that speedy justice to which a Minister referred to-day but did not define.  Questions such as banishment from the country are matters that can wait.  The only speedy justice that cannot wait is the speedy justice of execution.  We who know something of military courts cannot expect much justice from them.  The President tells us that there will be a check on the Executive.  I presume that he means that this Oireachtas should be a check on the Executive. Look across the benches and see the check on the Executive.  Deputy Baxter told us that when the Oireachtas meets to consider the proclamations some will think that this is right and some will think that that is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told we are not prepared to shoulder our responsibilities.  I submit that some Deputies are not prepared even to think at all, or, if they do, they are not prepared to give vocal expression to their thoughts.  We have had no contribution to this debate from those Deputies.  We have not had even the usual &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; from Deputy Gorey.  They have sat tight, and when Bunty pulls the strings the marionettes come into the Division Lobby and vote <Col N="1383" /> as they are directed.  During the time in which we are discussing the most important section of the Bill, where are its supporters?  They are lounging about somewhere, listening for the bell to summon them in to vote and to give away what is most important and vital to all citizens, namely, the right to be tried by their peers.  We talk about the British régime in the past, but all through that régime we never had a measure containing clauses of this description which would put &ldquo;Bloody&rdquo; Balfour and the rest of them to shame. I hope when the Division is called that Deputies will realise that there is a greater duty than the duty to Party, that there is a duty to humanity and liberty, and that they will answer that call by voting in the proper lobby and not act merely as machines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidHall" hpid="Mr. HALL Mr. HALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this section, as I believe it is the most tyrannical one in the Bill owing to the fact that it gives effect to all that is despotic and unwarrantable in it.  It is news, both in this country and elsewhere, to discover a Government establishing military courts when no necessity for a state of martial law exists.  When we had military courts in this country they operated under a state of martial law, and many of our citizens in those days were tried by those courts.  Many of them were sentenced to death and many of them to terms of imprisonment, but there was a right of appeal from such courts.  In this particular case, by proclamation certain courts are to be set up without any right of appeal from their decisions.  Let us not be worse than those whom we once called foreign despotic brutes across the water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One gentleman, who has been a past member of the Government Party and who is not here now, once made that reference to the people whom we were then fighting, and I am sure when he made it it was in accord with the minds of the people with whom he was associated. There is no necessity in any country for setting up military tribunals unless in times of revolution accompanied by the use of arms.  We have no revolution here now and we are not promised one.  There is nothing <Col N="1384" /> at the moment that would justify this particular section being put into operation. Ministers may say that it is all right to set up military tribunals to protect the State from the guns of assassins but, no matter how much we deplore it, I do not think that the assassination of one individual, be he Minister or otherwise, justifies the setting up of military tribunals. Deputy Gorey may laugh.</P>

      <P>Of course he can, and I believe every time he laughs he is satisfied. I want to say that not one of those who constitute the Ministry has put up a concrete case to show why we should have military tribunals to try prisoners without giving them a right of appeal.  Even on that point alone, every Deputy who thinks rightly and who has at heart something more than the retention of the Government, who has at heart the interests of the citizens, will vote against the section, whereas those who vote for it merely in order to retain confidence and preserve the Government, will vote against the expressed will of the people in relation to this particular measure.  There is not an individual, who is not a partisan outside this House, who does not condemn this piece of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We may have declarations and manifestations in support of this particular measure from the Ministerial benches, but they are such as have been acquired from partisans, because Ministers do not go down amongst the people of the country and do not acquire the information which ordinarily Deputies acquire.  If they did, they would not be so determined or so anxious to force their views on this House and to have a section such as this inserted in the Bill and put through the House by means of what has just been described as a voting machine.  Every Minister realises what it means to have military courts.  I realise it.  I saw many men going <Col N="1385" /> before military courts long ago, men with whom I was associated and whom I knew would not, and did not, get justice from those tribunals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HALL</NameTxt>
      <P>They were British military courts and we know that they did not give justice.  That is known to the President and every Minister.  Justice was not given by these military tribunals to the people who were at their mercy.  We cannot say that even in a court chosen from our own Army to-day there will not be prejudiced individuals. Some men who have been in custody before would probably be marked men and may be arrested again.  These may be men who were interned only and no charge preferred against them, men who gave good service in other days and who are likely to become an eyesore to some of the officers of the law in the future.  We know instances where men were sadly abused while in the custody of certain officers of the Irish Free State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasLawlor" hpid="Mr. LAWLOR Mr. LAWLOR">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LAWLOR</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to emphasise my objection to this section.  It is difficult to say which is the worst section in the Bill; every section seems to be bad.  One is inclined to believe that Section 20, like other sections that have been passed, was born in a panic&mdash;perhaps panic might not be the correct word, but it was born at a time when it was not reasonable to expect, because of what had occurred, that those responsible for the measure would have that sobriety of mind necessary in dealing with alterations of the Constitution such as is proposed in Section 20 as well as in preceeding sections. Whether the section was born in panic, or was due to disturbance in the minds of the Ministers or not, the fact remains that an extraordinary effort is being made for the purpose of upsetting the Constitution and depriving the ordinary citizen of his fundamental rights. When a Minister stands up in justification of the measure and says that there must be liberty in the country, and that those who are opposed to that must realise their position and take responsibility for their actions, one wonders is he alive to the fact that he is endeavouring to justify the deprivation of the fundamental rights of the ordinary citizen.  Say what we will as regards the constitution of the officers comprising the court, we know that the name of a military court in this country is abhorred by all peaceful, decent citizens.  We know from experience in the past that the person who is going to be tried before a military court is going to be summarily dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Minister in contributing to the debate used the unfortunate expression &ldquo;speedy justice.&rdquo;  That may be afterwards explained as meaning, not speedy justice, but speedy action.  We have Deputies only recently returned by the electorate coming into this House and indicating by their votes on this very important measure that they are carrying out the desires of their constituents in supporting the Bill.  No man can say what the effect of this measure will be before this day twelve months.  We all know that history has a happy knack of repeating itself in this country. One can imagine what will be the outcome of Section 20 being applied <Col N="1387" /> to military courts set up to administer speedy justice, or, perhaps, as I have said before, speedy action.  What are you going to have as a result of another swing in the political pendulum?  People may say that what occurred in the past happened because the executions and actions of military courts then were the outcome of foreign régime.  It must be remembered that during the time this House is not in session those sections may be put into operation, and there may be many arrests, deportations, and, perhaps, executions.  With a swing of the political pendulum you may have another political party in power imbued with the same spirit as some may be imbued with in passing this Bill, and feeling that they too would be justified in taking extreme action.  Where do the ordinary persons, business men, artisans and labourers not concerned with political activities come in?  It would be little consolation if it was found necessary that justice must be done, and done speedily, if after that speedy justice is carried out we awaken to the fact that mistakes are made.  Other Deputies have stated that this is the most important section in the Bill, but, so far as I am concerned, I do not, as I have said, know which is the most important, they are all so far-reaching, they all mean so much, and they all seem to be contributed to in such a flippant manner.</P>
    <P>One could understand that on yesterday, when dealing with a section similar to Section 20, we were obliged to sit until 10.30.  One cannot refrain from thinking that reprisal is coming on reprisal, and that, perhaps, the reason we have got to sit here until 8.30 in the morning is a reprisal, because of the fact that we have had the temerity to question some of the sections in the Bill.  If it is true to say that we are guilty only of showing an anxiety that this Bill will not have a reactionary effect on the whole country, nobody can say we are constitutionally wrong in criticising it.  Nobody can say that in criticising the Bill, after we have fulfilled all the obligations laid down by the Constitution, we are exceeding our rights.  If our actions are <Col N="1388" /> to be open to a reprisal such as I have mentioned, surely that fact would tend to confirm the contention that those who set themselves to draft these sections were not in the sobriety of mind they would normally have been in if they were dealing with a measure such as this under other circumstances.</P>
    <P>I can understand their heated feelings. Perhaps, if other people had the responsibility of government and had to meet the state of affairs that the present Government had to meet, they might feel in the same estranged state of mind that some of us believe Ministers were in when drafting these sections. If we go so far as to say that, it is no justification whatever for such a Bill.  I think we are justified in saying that such sections as are contained in the Bill would never have seen the light of day except for the circumstances which obtained.  I do not know whether panic is the correct word to apply to that state of mind, but I do believe that the measure will not carry out the intentions of the Government, but will absolutely destroy even that which the Government hope to achieve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyQuill" hpid="Mr. QUILL Mr. QUILL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. QUILL</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose Section 20 of this Bill.  One of the main reasons I do so is that I believe the power given to the Executive Council is entirely too great under this section.  I believe the power given to the Executive Council is a power of dictatorship for the time being.  Dictatorship in the case of life and death and dictatorship by any Executive Council for the time being is a proposition for which no Parliament in the year 1927 could reasonably stand.  There is a principle involved when an Executive Council for a certain time will not be responsible to a Parliament chosen by the express will of the people.  That is the first objection which I make to this Bill.  To-day, when President Cosgrave said his Government were saving Parliamentary institutions, I could not help thinking that they were doing the very opposite and that it was the people on these benches&mdash;people who are taunted with evading their responsibilities&mdash;who were saving Parliamentary institutions. If there is any section of this Bill which a reasonable man detests more than another, it is the section authorising <Col N="1389" /> the setting up of special courts which in reality will be military courts.  Any man who has lived in this country for the past eight or twelve years knows what is meant by a military court. Moreover, the men who occupy positions as military officers to-day came through the Anglo-Irish trouble and also through a period of internecine strife.  The military tribunals which they served on in the past were held at midnight by the side of a fence in the years 1920 and 1921.  No man can expect an officer who went through such a period to have any very accurate idea of the law, and he cannot be expected <Col N="1390" /> to sit down a few years later in a camp, perhaps behind barbed wire entanglements, and mete out even-handed justice. It is not to be expected from a military man, and it is not fair to a military man to put him in that position. We have been told that we are evading our responsibilities and that we are standing in the way of those who are trying to save Parliamentary institutions.  But I claim that we are the people who are trying to save Parliamentary institutions, and who are trying to save the people from military courts and despotism.</P>

It is as plain as a pikestaff to me that this and the previous sections, which constitute Part III. of this Bill, are worded to give the dominant political party, for a period of not less than three days, and possibly as much as five days, liberty to run riot with the lives and liberties of their late political friends and present political enemies through these courts before this House can possibly intervene.  Anything done within that time under the Proclamation stands valid even as to its continuing effect.  I call particular attention to these words in sub-section (1), &ldquo;continuing effect,&rdquo; which appear to me to cover the case of a man hauled before a military court within the three days or five days intervening between the Proclamation and the reference to this House and receiving a long sentence of penal servitude or something of a like nature.  Although, as soon as the matter comes before the House, the Proclamation and everything done under it may stand condemned in the clearest terms, still his sentence continues, as far as I can interpret the wording, without the possibility of revision. If merely temporary measures or precautions were intended by these sections, these indemnity clauses would have been omitted.  I think that their insertion points clearly to the motive of the clauses, and that they are a very serious warning to those who are asked to pass them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter that I should like to refer to: that there are outside the House at present at least fifty Deputies elected only the other day by the vote of the people, and we are quite <Col N="1392" /> safe in assuming that this Bill is directly contrary to the mandate that they received and to their opinions. Inside the House we have a minority varying between twenty and thirty-five against the provisions of the Bill.  It is perfectly clear, therefore, that, on balance, this Bill is against the lately-expressed wish of the country at the General Election, and is being rushed through in the face of that very clear expression.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>According to that argument, we should say that we can do nothing, that we have to hold our hands and say that by reason of the decision given in the late election we must only mark time&mdash;that we are not in a position to do anything; that nobody has any authority to do anything. If the Deputy will take the trouble to look up the legislation passed since 1922 he will find that in any Act in which provision is made for the Oireachtas to object to an order or proclamation by the Executive Council, exactly the same terminology has been used, and that this is not any new method of giving an unusual indemnity to the Executive Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the President is in error.  If he refers to the Public Safety (Emergency Powers) Act, 1926, Section 1, sub-section (4), he will find that the words to which particular attention is drawn by Deputy Hewson, &ldquo;continuing operation and effect,&rdquo; are not included in the provisions of that Act.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every proclamation made under this section shall be forthwith published in the &lsquo;Iris Oifigiúil&rsquo; and shall also be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and if either such House shall, within the next subsequent twenty-one days on which that House has sat, pass a resolution revoking such proclamation, such proclamation shall forthwith expire, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under such proclation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is understandable.  Once the power is there to establish the courts and give them effect if the House or <Col N="1393" /> Houses then declare that such proclamation is not to be effective, that does not make invalid, or should not make invalid, Acts which have been sanctioned in a tentative fashion by the Oireachtas.  But there is a very great difference between making valid acts committed with the authority of the Oireachtas, even though that authority was of a temporary nature, and following it up by saying that &ldquo;anything done thereunder or the continuing operation and effect of any conviction, sentence, order or judgment made thereunder&rdquo; is to operate.  &ldquo;Continuing operation and effect of any conviction&rdquo; is, I think, much the more important feature of the portion of the lines <Col N="1394" /> which the Deputy desires to delete, because it means that, notwithstanding the decision of the Oireachtas as to the unwisdom of setting up special courts, the proceedings of these courts, and the judgments and sentences of these courts must continue, and there is no appeal from them.  If within that time there is a sentence of five, ten or fifteen years, there is no appeal, and the judgment must remain, and the only method of revising the decision of these courts will be by the exercise of the prerogative of mercy.  That is a very great distinction, and I think it is not correct to say that in any previous Act such words have been used, certainly not in the Public Safety Act of 1926.</P>

      <Col N="1395" /> SECTION 22.</P>
    <P>(1) As soon as may be after every occasion on which this Part of this Act comes into force there shall be established by the Executive Council one or more tribunals (in this Part of this Act referred to as special courts) consisting at the option of the Executive Council either&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move amendment number 48:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 16, to delete all words after the word &ldquo;Council&rdquo; to the end of the section and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;a tribunal consisting of three members who shall be judges of the High Court.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The effect of the amendment would be to substitute one class of civil court for the proposed court consisting partly of military officers.  As I said on Section 20, I would be prepared to give powers to the Executive by way of the institution of special courts, even by proclamation, if that proclamation was subject to ratification, or had to be preceded by ratification by the Oireachtas.  But I would not be in favour, in any circumstances, certainly not in circumstances which seem to me to present themselves to-day, of granting the powers set out in this section.</P>
      <P>The amendment reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;Council&rdquo; to the end of the section and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;a tribunal consisting of three members who shall be Judges of the High Court.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1396" /> That means that the whole section should be deleted after the word &ldquo;Council,&rdquo; that one court shall be established as a special court, and that that court shall consist of Judges of the High Court.  While putting forward Judges of the High Court as members for this special court, I want it to be understood that if it is considered wiser to make the whole judiciary available for this purpose I would not stand in the way.  If the Judges of the High Court were not easily available, owing to the pressure of their normal business, I would be inclined, in the first place, to ask them specially to act in these courts, and to set up some substitute for the conduct of ordinary business, because, to my mind, this is more important than the conduct of the ordinary business of the State.  But, even if that would not suit the desires of the Executive, I would be prepared to have any other judges, whether they be Supreme Court or Circuit Court Judges, available for a similar purpose.  It might be said that this proposal of mine may place the judges in a particularly awkward &mdash;shall I say dangerous&mdash;position.  As I said on the Second Reading, I have no doubt that the judges in the Free State are willing to take the responsibility, and to do what they consider their duty by the State.  From the position they are in, as men learned in the law, as men who have been thought fit to occupy the positions they do at present, I am confident that they could view it in no other light but as their duty to act, if they were so requested.</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to do away with what, personally, I regard as the most invidious proposal in the whole Bill.  This proposal to institute military courts&mdash;I shall deal with the term in a moment, as they have been so described up to this&mdash;is, to my mind, wholly unnecessary.  Not only is it unnecessary, but it goes very far indeed towards upsetting the bedrock of our Constitution.  Article 70 is, if not directly, very pointedly, abrogated by this section.  Article 70 has already been referred to in these debates, and I think on this particular amendment <Col N="1397" /> it is worth referring to again.  Article 70 of the Constitution reads:</P>
    <P>No one shall be tried save in due course of law and extraordinary courts shall not be established, save only such Military Tribunals as may be authorised by law for dealing with military offenders against military law.</P>
    <P>And not satisfied with making it clear that civilians and ordinary citizens shall be tried exclusively by civil courts, the Article goes on further to state:</P>
    <P>The jurisdiction of military tribunals shall not be extended to or exercised over the civil population save in time of war, or armed rebellion, and for acts committed in time of war or armed rebellion, and in accordance with the regulations to be prescribed by law.</P>
    <P>If a time of war were to come about, or if there were armed rebellion, then, even according to the Constitution, we should be justified in instituting military tribunals to deal, not merely with offences by members of the Army, but with offences by citizens in their civilian capacity.  Does the Executive Council really claim, from their knowledge and information, that there will be a period of armed rebellion?  If so, then let the military courts be established. But, if they say that there is not a likelihood of there being a period of armed rebellion, then I ask, what is the purpose of bringing in military tribunals at all?  We have heard a great deal said by way of praise, with most of which I substantially agree, about the Civic Guard.  There would be even more sense, shall I say decency, in proposing that courts such as these should be composed of officers of the Civic Guard, rather than officers of the Army, because the Civic Guards are a civil unarmed forced, while the military are not.  I fail to see the purpose of bringing military officers into courts to determine charges against civilians in a time which is not proclaimed by the Executive Council to be a time of war or of armed rebellion.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of these courts as military courts, and I think the other day my friend, Deputy Cooper, stated that, as far as he was concerned, <Col N="1398" /> he would almost prefer to be tried&mdash;I think that is a fair paraphrase of his words&mdash;by a British courtmartial than by an ordinary court of justice.  With that sentiment I am in agreement. Though the President seemed to question my experience of courtsmartial to-day, and I do not profess that it is anything like what his might be, at the same time, having been for five years in the British Army, I know something about British military courtsmartial. This I do know about them, that every sentence by a British courtmartial, and the whole proceedings of that courtmartial, are brought before the Judge-Advocate General, that he has to determine, after reading those proceedings, whether the sentence should be allowed to stand or whether it should be quashed, and that even if he upholds the decision of the courtmartial, there is a further appeal to the King, through the British War Council. Therefore there are two powers which may intervene between the sentence of a British courtmartial and its execution. As far as the military courts that were in existence in the Free State &mdash;I am now talking of our own military courts&mdash;were concerned, I understand that there, too, there was a possibility of revision by a person in a position somewhat similar to that of the Judge-Advocate General in the British Army.</P>
    <P>We cannot discuss this amendment or this section without referring to Section 24, because Section 24 provides that there shall not only be no appeals from the sentences of these courts, but that there shall be no possibility of review or revision by way of certiorari.  We are asked, therefore, not to set up courtsmartial like those that exist in the British Army, governed as they are by a code of British military law, and subject, as they are, as I have pointed out, to some form of revision or review, but to set up, not military courts at all, but nothing more or less than Executive Council courts.  According to this section, &ldquo;As soon as may be after every occasion on which this Part of this Act comes into force there shall be established by the Executive Council...&rdquo; They shall determine presumably, not only whether the three members of the court are to be military officers, but <Col N="1399" /> from what I can see on the face of the Bill they are to determine who these military officers are to be.  They will be in a very different position from judges, whether of the High or the Supreme Court, or even District Justices, because they will be nothing more or less than servants of the Executive Council. They will not be independent judges. They will not be in the same position as members of the Judiciary in that respect.</P>
    <P>The taunt has been and will be thrown&mdash;and it is natural, I suppose, that it would be in a debate of this kind&mdash;in the face of anyone objecting to these courts that the objector is saying that the decisions will be unfair or unjust.  I say nothing of the kind, but I do say that there should be some power to revise these decisions.  The decisions of these courts will be final, once and for all, and one of the reasons why I am proposing that the courts should consist of High Court Judges is that there would be power of revision by way of certiorari, or even, for that matter, by way of appeal.  If the Government had made anything in the nature of a case for the establishment of courts like these, one would be loth to take any action against them, but they have made no case.  They may have made some case for the establishment of some form of special court, but they have made no case for the establishment of any form of military court. Why should they not be civil courts? How will the military courts effect the purpose of this whole Bill any better than civil courts?  On the contrary, would there not be far greater respect for civil courts, for this reason, that it is only too obvious that military men, and especially men who may be appointed under this Bill, of only the rank of commandant, cannot be expected to have even the same experience of the world, much less of law or of evidence, or even of the administration of justice, as any of the judges occupying the benches of the Free State Judiciary?</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it has struck members of the Executive Council or not, but when it may be suggested that it would be invidious to put judges in <Col N="1400" /> this position, is it not far more invidious to put mere military officers in this position?  Did they join the National Army to sit in judgment on their civilian fellow-countrymen?  It is a different matter to sit in judgment upon the soldiers of the National Army, for that is part of the execution of their duty, but I wonder how many young officers at present in the National Army ever dreamt when they were joining that force that they would be called upon as members of the Army, in a time which had not been proclaimed a time of armed rebellion, to sit in judgment, with the possibility of having to pass sentences of death, upon their civilian fellow-countrymen.  I think that instead of it being a hardship to ask the judges to perform this duty, it would be a far greater hardship to ask officers of the Army to do it.</P>
    <P>The whole principle involved in this section permeates and vitiates the whole Bill.  If this section and the previous one, which provides for the machinery of the proclamation and the method employed by that machinery, had not been in the Bill, I for one would not have voted against the Second Reading of the Bill.  It is almost entirely upon the ground that where no sufficient cause has been shown our Government thought fit to substitute military for civil courts, courts which will administer only, I admit, in certain contingencies, but which may administer in the case of all the offences under this Bill&mdash;it is because of that that I have strenuously opposed the passage of this measure.  If I could be convinced, if there could be any argument brought forward even now by the President or any other member of the Executive Council to show me what the civilian courts could not do that are expected to be done by these military courts, and how these military courts could effect the purpose of this Bill, the purpose of it being the detection and the prevention of crime&mdash;if I could be shown how these military courts could effect that purpose any better than civil courts, I do not care of what composition, I would mend my way.</P>
    <P>We have had no indication as to what the urgency, what the necessity&mdash;I do <Col N="1401" /> not like to use the word, but, shall I say, what the excuse?&mdash;is for bringing the military into it at all.  Is there a likelihood that under this Bill there will be a state of armed rebellion?  Is that the view of the Executive Council? If it is their view, then they need not alter the Constitution at all, because it is provided in Article 70 that in a state of armed rebellion or in a time of war military tribunals may be substituted for civil ones.  If there is not such a likelihood, then why bring in the military? I do really appeal to the Government.  I appeal to them because I think they will command respect from the people whom they are endeavouring to serve if they will not insist upon the introduction of these military tribunals.  It may be said they will act in a fair way.  That may be so, but still you have the fact remaining, and you cannot get away from it, that because they are military tribunals they will not be trusted or respected by the people.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, you have the great outstanding possible injustice that there will be no power of revision, no power of review, no appeal; there will be nothing, not even by way of certiorari, from a decision which may be made in error, which may be made even in good faith.  Are the circumstances such as to demand that drastic remedy?  I do not believe they are, and I think that if the President would reconsider this section and would set up any form of civil court&mdash;if he would even, if he thought it necessary, appoint special commissioners for the purpose&mdash;it would be very desirable.  The special commissioners may never have to meet; I hope that they never will.  But would it not be possible to set up some form of civil tribunal, either composed of judges as I have outlined in this amendment, or composed of those learned in the law and who would be willing to act as special commissioners if the emergency arose?  This section, to my mind, goes to the root of the whole Bill.  It controls and governs everything in the Bill, and as long as this section remains, not being shown either the justice or the necessity for it, I will feel bound to continue opposing this measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWSON</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Redmond's amendment would practically have the same effect as another amendment standing in my name, I think I might as well speak to this one.  It is only about three years ago that this country learned, to its entire disgust, that the Army, or, rather, the commissioned ranks in the Army&mdash;officers of the Defence Forces within the meaning of this section&mdash;contained two opposing secret societies, one apparently approved, if not actually approved, by the Executive.  There is an old proverb which speaks of the efficacy of setting one class of person to catch some other sort.  That may be at the root of this section; but even then to allow military officers to have the interpretation of the dangerously vague and far-reaching wording of this Bill, which would fully exercise the capacity of any lawyer, with civil judges in any degree, or even magistrates, available, is a proposition I cannot endorse.  A state of emergency or urgency which has several times been suggested by Ministers to be a condition precedent to the use of many of the powers of this Bill, should justify the suspension of any part or even the whole of all ordinary civil business in order properly to staff these courts.  Reference has been made to the fairness of the British courtsmartial. Speaking from a little contact with British officers at one time or another, I know the great aversion they have always had to be dragged into the domestic affairs of this country, and I would venture to suggest of the average British officer that, on his part, he would have less animus against, say, a Republican, than one of our factions to-day would have against the other.  Free Staters and Republicans have been so embittered against one another that I would not count either of them a fair judge of the other, whether military officers or otherwise.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the kind of speech that Deputy Hewson has delivered merits any reply.  He is one of the people who does not realise what has occurred in the country, or if he realises it, objects to it so bitterly and regrets it so bitterly that he will refuse to let his mind accept the consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1403" /> With reference to Deputy Redmond's speech, the Executive Council appreciates fully the importance of having all crimes tried by ordinary tribunals, if possible, and we appreciate fully that one conviction by an ordinary jury in the Central Criminal Court would do more to break up any criminal conspiracy than ten convictions by military tribunals or by any special tribunal. We put these powers into the Bill in the hope that we will not have to use them, and in the hope that they will enable the ordinary processes of law to be continued, and we make these provisions fairly strong and fairly drastic in order to obtain, if possible, that effect.  Ordinary tribunals would be more respected by the public, perhaps as courts, than military tribunals.  But in this case we are not so concerned to obtain the respect of the general public. What we want to do is to put a cold shiver of fear down the backs of the terrorists; and there is no doubt that while, during the civil war, no single innocent person was convicted, the sureness and speed with which the military tribunals operated did put a great many people amongst the Irregulars, who were no cowards, into a blue funk.</P>
    <P>We want to have the position that nobody will attempt to extend his activities in such a way as to prevent or interfere with the ordinary operations of the ordinary courts.  It would be no use.  I think, to put into a Bill merely a provision that there should be a court of three or more judges.  I think that if we are to obtain the effect that we desire to have, and if we are to have any good hope of not having to use the powers here, we must provide that there shall be a tribunal that may be described as a military tribunal. There is going to be no condition of war or armed rebellion.  The possibility of that, I think, has been very effectively put an end to.  The people who, perhaps, are constitutionalists to-day are not constitutionalists through any conviction except the conviction that it was no use to go on with war, and it would be less use to attempt to resort to war again.  There is going to be no war or armed rebellion.  If there were going to be a condition of war or armed <Col N="1404" /> rebellion, as Deputy Redmond has said, this Bill and the provisions of this Bill would be unnecessary.</P>

      <P>I could not attempt to enlighten Deputy Hall; that is a task that is beyond me.  We have here a terrorist conspiracy and a terrorist conspiracy is a difficult thing to deal with by the ordinary laws.  People who had no reason to be in dread, one would think, following the assassination of the late Vice-President, showed, by the care with which they have spoken and written about that event, that they were in dread.  And while, as I have said, the best way to deal with the terrorist conspiracy, just as the best way to deal with any ordinary sort of crime, is by the ordinary law and by the ordinary courts, we must make sure, if we are to prevent an extension of its operations, that it can be dealt with; that if the conspirators are caught and that if there is evidence against them their punishment will be sure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be much better to take no steps at all than to take steps to bring people to justice and have the machinery break down.  There has been a suggestion that people might be dealt with unfairly or that these courts might be set up when there is no need for them.  I do not think that there is any person who is anxious to have special tribunals set up.  I cannot <Col N="1405" /> visualise a position where any majority in the Dáil would stand for continuing in force a proclamation under which these courts operated if it was not felt to be necessary.  The present Executive Council have consistently endeavoured to get rid of abnormal powers and of the need for abnormal powers.  We have sometimes been accused, because we would not make a compromise.  We could at times have made compromises and got out of immediate difficulties which would have had the result of postponing the supremacy of the ordinary people.  We propose these powers and we would propose to use these powers just for the very same purpose as we used the very much wider powers which the state of armed rebellion and civil war put into our hands.  We used very wide powers and we did this for one purpose only, and that was to secure the supremacy of the ordinary unarmed civilian.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to be tender and careful about people who have been in a conspiracy.  But when certain measures have been adopted against the people, you must first think of the ordinary citizen, the majority of the ordinary citizens, and you must be prepared to be stern and severe with those whose actions are a menace to the liberties of the ordinary individual and whose actions are an attack on all ordinary individuals in the State.</P>

      <P>It appears that notwithstanding all the steps we have taken to inform people, there are still some individuals in the country who have an idea that the British Government is still here and that the British system and the British methods and the British atmosphere are still with us; that the Judiciary is part of the Executive and so on.  Now I would like to correct that view and to correct <Col N="1406" /> it very strongly.  The judges whom we have appointed are as independent of the Executive as the judges of the Supreme Court of New York or of the United States&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I suppose we know how to behave ourselves.  I said that the judges whom we have appointed are as independent of us as the judges of the Supreme Court of New York or the United States are of us, and I suppose they are quite independent of us.  Our Judiciary are as independent of the Executive Council as is the Supreme Court in the United States.</P>
      <P>I attended some conferences before this Bill was introduced, and I have not been the first person to announce that.  It was after these conferences, or as a result of them, that this section crept in, bringing in other persons than a military court.  It was not in our original Bill.  My legal advisers have informed me that it is not in the terms of appointment of any of our judges, that it would be something extra to ask the judges, and I am not going to ask them.  The Executive is not going to ask the Judges of the High Court, the Supreme Court, the Circuit Court or the District Justices&mdash;I am not going to ask a single one of them&mdash;to act on this tribunal.  So far as the judges of the High Court are concerned, it must be some other legal person who would be appointed if you want a judiciary of that sort.  That is my answer.  I understood it was plain and thought anyone would understand it&mdash;certainly a lawyer.  I would not have put down the proposal myself in the first instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Executive would not request them and I would <Col N="1407" /> not ask them.  I thought I made that point clear.  Deputy Redmond understands that there are certain people sometimes who go to court, who make the pretence of not recognising the court and who, in common with their practice of seeking to bring down every institution in the State, show their contempt of court and perhaps sometimes keep out of it.  Now the judges are not going to be asked by this Executive to go a single iota out of the terms of their appointment, and their business as judges is not to decide an issue of life and death.  That is a matter for a jury.  We do not want to place any judge on our bench in an invidious position, either to act now for a short time and then go back to the bench or to be afterwards under consideration for appointment to the bench.  We want to keep our judiciary above reproach of any sort or kind, and I suggest to Deputies that they cannot have it both ways.  I should like to say that I regretted very much to hear Deputy Hewson say what he said about the army and British officers.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that Deputy Hewson is an Irishman.  I may be wrong, but I assume that he is an Irishman. I have known of courtsmartial by British officers in which they have perjured themselves, but I do not know of any of our officers who perjured themselves, not one.  It is not with a view to scoring that I say that. We have made our peace with the British.  That business is all done and finished with, but it is certainly an exhibition of the slave mind for a member of this House to get up and practically paint the officers of another army as higher characters, as nobler beings and as better gentlemen than the officers of our army.  That is certainly not the work of an Irishman.  I am surprised at it, and I hope the Deputy will see his way to reconsider that statement.</P>

      <P>I have to disagree with the President in this matter.  I also resent Deputy Hewson's statement, but I understand that Deputy Hewson has not got the slave <Col N="1408" /> mind.  That is my opinion.  Deputy Hewson is speaking here for a very small and embittered faction who are sorry that the English have left this country, and when he speaks about the Free State Army as a faction I want to tell him that it was a faction that defended rich and poor, gentle and simple, Catholic and Protestant in this country. I want to tell him, too, that I know his form perfectly well.  There are Deputies now in these times who are quite ready to attack the Free State Army and the Free State Police because it is safe to do so.  They are in no danger from them.  They are disciplined forces.  They are the servants of the people, they are the servants of this Government, and they will be the loyal servants of any other Government that comes in.  Hence it is safe to sneer at them and call them a faction, but if the guns were to go off and if there was real trouble again between Republicans and Free State forces the small faction that the Deputy represents would be the first to whine for the protection of the Free State Army.</P>

      <P>I do know something, however, about British courtsmartial. I do not mind Deputy Hewson or the type he represents, but I do object to Deputy Redmond saying anything which even implies that an Irish courts-martial would be less likely to do justice and to give fair play than an English courtsmartial.  I do not think he said that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>But equally I do not think the Deputy made the position clear.  He tried to show that the organisation of a British court of this kind would be somewhat different to the Irish courts, and made the one point that there is a confirming authority. Now, there is a confirming authority, and I doubt if the Deputy is right when he says that it is the Judge-Advocate General.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Deputy said, and I doubt if he is right. The Deputy should know that the right is inherent in the Executive Council to review any sentence, that it is not necessary to give it to them by statute, that it is there always.  Deputy Redmond pointed out that finally it goes to the King in England.  The King in Ireland is the Executive Council&mdash;&ldquo;The Governor-General acting on the advice of the Executive Council.&rdquo;  That right is there in the Executive Council, and the Deputy should assume that the Irish Executive Council would be just as careful in exercising that right as the English Government would be in a similar case, or the English King&mdash;not the English King&mdash;but the King who is head of the British Commonwealth of Nations, acting in his capacity as King of England.  The Deputy must know perfectly well that the functions of the confirming authority, whether it is the Judge-Advocate General or anyone <Col N="1410" /> else, are very limited indeed, and that the real authority over any courts-martial in any country is the Executive. That authority is here, and when the Deputy tries to draw a distinction between these courts and the English courtsmartial he knows perfectly well that he is endeavouring to draw a very specious distinction indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no intention of drawing any distinction between the conduct of British and Irish courtsmartial for the simple reason that I have never been before an Irish courtmartial and am not aware whether there is any code of law in existence for these courtsmartial.  I am aware there is a British military court, but I am not aware that there is an Irish military court.  I would be the last one, therefore, to draw any distinction as between the two systems.  What I did mean to convey was that there was a power of revision from British courtsmartial.  I think I said I understood that there was a similar power in regard to the Irish courtsmartial, but that I cannot vouch for.  In regard to the British courtsmartial, the Judge-Advocate General has a very great say indeed, but it is not done in the name of the Judge-Advocate General.  The whole proceedings are brought before the Judge-Advocate General through the General Officer Commanding and it is the Judge-Advocate General who says whether the decision shall stand or fall though it is in the name of the General Officer Commanding that it is done.  That is the distinction, and if that is a distinction the Minister can have a present of it.  I hope, therefore, that he understands that my objection to these courts is that they are courts composed of military officers.  I do not know that there is any military code in existence in the National Army.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy agree with me that the really effective powers not alone in this but in any other country is the Executive or the King, as the case may be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with that statement, because undoubtedly there is a power to the General Officer Commanding as advised by <Col N="1411" /> the Judge-Advocate General.  Apart altogether from that, I was only endeavouring to point out, without condemning these courts, that some Deputies compare them with British courtsmartial.  I was endeavouring to point out that British courtsmartial had a certain power of revision and that these courts will have none, because it is expressly provided in sub-section (5) of Section 24 that there shall be no appeal and that no special court shall be liable to be restrained in the execution of its powers under this part of this Act by any other court, nor shall any proceedings before a special court be removed by certiorari to any other court.  Further, it is provided that it will be an Executive Minister who shall make regulations in regard to the procedure and practice of these courts.  It was suggested the other day by Deputy Cooper that the procedure and practice should be that which is in use at present in the Central Criminal Court.  That may be so, but that is not so in the Bill, According to the Bill, it will be the Executive Minister who shall make the regulations prescribing that procedure and practice.  My root objection to these courts is that they will be courts ad hoc set up by the Executive, manned by the Executive, composed of, not independent judges, but of members of the National Army, and from which there shall be no appeal or no possibility of revision by way of certiorari. That is my objection to these courts. When it is suggested that the members of these courts would be fair and just in their decisions I am not quarrelling with that suggestion, but I do not want to have it possible that an error may be committed without revision and review, and an error may be committed even by the best.  It is to guard against a possibility of miscarriage of justice, to have some form of review by setting up a court composed of judges from which there would be an appeal certainly by the method of certiorari&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I was only anxious to answer one point made by the President with regard to the position of the judiciary.  What he has stated is quite true and, of course, that is one of the great safeguards of the State, that the judiciary is independent of the Executive.  I quite agree that it would be a matter more by request than demand on the part of the Executive if they wanted judges to compose these courts, but at the same time I do not agree that they should not be asked to do so.  I think that it is just as much their duty to act in an emergency such as this as it would be the duty of officers of the National Army.  I do not say that the officers of the National Army ever had in view the possibility of having to sit on courts like these, trying civilians on charges which might amount to a sentence of death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, it is true that judges generally and properly have not the right to find a prisoner guilty on a charge which would demand the sentence of death.  They are merely there to pronounce the sentence and to interpret the law.  The constitutional right is for the individual citizen to be tried by jury, but here you are proposing to do away with the jury and, great as that alteration may be and drastic as it may be, I would be prepared, in view of the possibility of even intimidating a jury, certainly in view of the possibility of the invidious position which jurors might find themselves, to abrogate that right, but only <Col N="1413" /> to abrogate it to a court composed of men like judges who would not be in the position of military officers, who would be in the position of having experience of law and procedure, who would be in a dispassionate and in a strictly impartial and independent position from the Executive.  It is because of the position of the officers of the National Army and because they are not independent of the Executive that I am strongly in favour of a civil and, if possible, a judicial tribunal.  I do not know, but it seems a nice state of affairs that we have come to if our Executive Government are not able to ask the independent judiciary of this country to act on the courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of his speech on this amendment Deputy Redmond held out hopes that, so far as this Bill is concerned, he might mend his ways.  He said that he would mend his ways and would vote for the Second Reading if he was satisfied that there was sufficient cause shown why this section and the previous one should be incorporated in the Bill.  I think I will show him that there is a good case, and I trust he will keep his word and mend his ways if I convince him that that is so.  I will show him, I think, that there is sufficient cause shown.  When does this section come into force?  It comes into force when, in the opinion of the Executive Council, a crisis has arisen which requires special courts to be set up.  It comes into force when that proclamation of the Executive Council has been ratified by the Dáil and the Seanad. We have had that again and again this afternoon, and I do not know why Deputy Redmond could not bear that in mind.  If, in the opinion of the Dáil and Seanad, a condition has arisen which makes the two Houses conclude that courts of this nature must be set up in the interests of the country, then surely sufficient cause will have been <Col N="1414" /> shown.  These courts are not being set up at the moment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Redmond's amendment is that there should be a court of three judges.  In the course of his speech he has, I think, discussed a great deal more of Section 24 than he has of Section 22, which we are now discussing. I will confine myself for the moment to Section 22.  I will assume that the Dáil and Seanad are satisfied that special courts must be set up, and then the question arises as to what is the best form of special court to sét up if, and when, the jury system has broken down.  We all want the jury system as long as ever we can.  We want to hang on to that system up to the last moment, but, if the occasion arises in which the jury system breaks down and cannot perform correctly its proper functions, namely, the administration of the criminal law, then the question comes before us as to what courts we are going to set up as a substitute.  Deputy Redmond said that he would like to see a court of three judges.  I am not going to follow him into certain small points as to whether the judges ought, or ought not, be asked, whether it would be a hardship on them or not, or whether, if asked, they would be likely to accept.  These things, from the point of view from which I regard them, are beside the point.  I would intensely dislike to see any prisoners tried in this country before a tribunal of three judges.  I think it would be bad for the country and bad for the future administration of justice, and I have given this matter very careful thought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the House for a moment to bear with me while I speak of what is the true function of a judge and the true function of a jury in criminal cases.  The function of a judge is to keep his mind open.  The duty of a judge is, so far as he can, to form no conclusion as to the guilt or innocence of the prisoner.  If he is a good judge he will succeed in so doing, and will charge the jury fairly.  He will put before the jury everything that has been, or could be, said in favour of the prisoner, and everything that could fairly be said against him.  That is the proper function of a judge.  Now, <Col N="1415" /> you want to reverse all that.  You want to turn the whole of that system upside down.  You want to make judges not what they have been always through history in criminal cases, namely, impartial. You are going to make them form their minds, make up their judgment, and bring in verdicts which upset the whole judicial system completely.</P>
    <P>If judges were put in that position, if there were a state of trouble which caused these courts to be set up, and if the judges had to revert afterwards to their ordinary duties before a jury, I believe that they would become unfitted for their task, because, instead of being trained in criminal cases to keep their minds absolutely open, they would be forced to form conclusions at the close of the case, and that would be bad.  I will not deal with the small and obvious matters such as the appointment of other judges or special judges, as these are matters that can be easily argued.  There is another more serious matter.  We want, above all things, to have not only our judges independent, as they are, but we also want the whole country to recognise that our judges are independent. We must not only have the fact, but we must also have the reputation.</P>
    <P>I believe if a court of three judges were set up, and they found people guilty, and that their verdicts were canvassed by people who read imperfect reports, that the impartiality of the judges would be questioned in a great number of cases.  Deputy Redmond said that he would like to see special commissioners learned in the law appointed, that he wanted the whole court learned in the law, that army officers are not learned in the law, that they do not know the law of evidence, and that they ought not to be put on tribunals. Frankly, I am surprised at that argument of Deputy Redmond, because, if he reads the section, he will see that to a certain extent the old method is being carried out, that here you have a man learned in the law presiding over the Court. He is the only man learned in the law, and the only man who is required to be learned in it.  You do <Col N="1416" /> not want the whole jury to be learned.</P>
    <P>In ordinary cases you have the judge who lays down the law for the jury. In these courts, constituted by the military, you will have one man, trained in law, who will rule on points of evidence, and you will have the officers in the position of jurymen making up their minds.  It will be stated, probably, that they will be servants of the Executive Council and that they will be carried away by passion, that feelings will become heated, that factions in this country hate each other, and that you cannot trust courts of officers. Courts of officers sat during the civil war.  I did not defend any prisoners before them, but I have spoken to many members of my profession who did, and I can stand here and definitely state that I have never heard a single complaint made that one of these military courts brought in an unjust or unfair verdict.</P>

      <P>I am not quite sure if Deputy Redmond has been brought to mend his way by the patriarchal advice tendered by the last Deputy.  I do not feel like mending my ways.  I would be very slow to think that a man with mature wisdom in things of the law and the State generally, such as Deputy Redmond has reached, would be likely to be convinced by the statement of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney.  Certainly he has contributed some new points to the discussion.  We have had the Vice-President expressing admiration for the civil courts, and regret that he could not have them always, because he was afraid the machinery might break down if called upon.  He there gave expression to <Col N="1417" /> a mixed metaphor.  He admired the courts, but he was afraid that they would not be able to carry out what he is giving over to inexperienced officers to carry to success.  The President said he did not consider it would be right to ask the courts to take over this work.  He seemed to think that the fine feelings of the judges should get first consideration as to whether this particular job, which exceeded their terms of appointment, should be imposed on them.</P>
      <P>He seemed to think that would be of greater moment than the assurance of a fair trial for prisoners.  Instead he entrusts the job to officers of the Army, for whose fine feelings he seems to have little regard, and which, as pointed out by Deputy Redmond, is also outside the terms of their appointment.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said that it would be absolutely unfair to call upon judges to act, as for the first time they would have to justify their name, which, according to his description of their functions, is a misnomer.  I wonder what we should call them if their minds are so mobile that they would be in danger of being distorted if called upon to form a judgment upon evidence. There is a peculiar conglomeration of ideas as to why these civil courts should not be brought into operation. One thing that emerges is, it is perfectly clear that it is the intention of the Executive Council to have military courts, and all the arguments and eloquence against that on this side are futile.  No clear reasons have been given to convince Deputy Redmond or any impartial person that there is a need for these military courts, or that they are going to be useful.  If there is to be anything like elasticity there should be a change in the next division, and more should be found voting on our side than on the previous divisions.</P>

      <P>I have listened with very great pleasure, and I trust with considerable profit, to this debate.  It has helped to a large extent to get rid of some delusions under which I was suffering.  When the debate opened I was under the impression that I knew something about courtsmartial.  I doubt it very much now.  At the opening of the debate one <Col N="1418" /> of my delusions was that I had often attended at British courtsmartial.  I was under another delusion that I had often prosecuted at British courts-martial; indeed, I was under the hope that I could get corroboration within these walls of my latter statement.  I was also under the delusion that I had defended at British naval courts-martial and Free State courtsmartial. All these delusions the debate has helped to wipe out.  But I have, notwithstanding the existence of my delusions, one strong factor which is no delusion, and that was, and is, that whenever these courts were turned from the ordinary courtsmartial into what is called, in the words of this section &ldquo;special courts,&rdquo; they turned out to be a failure.  That is the history of the past, and, in my opinion, it will be the history of the future.  I say nothing about the fairness or unfairness of British courtsmartial, except that, in my view, they were to the best of their lights an absolutely fair tribunal when dealing with British soldiers, but when dealing with Irishmen they were in a great many cases dealing with matters which they did not understand and consequently were unfit to judge fairly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is suggested that this House should set up in its worst form these special courts, and that with the knowledge that they have proved a disastrous failure.  I, for one, will be no party towards allowing my fellow-countrymen to be tried by a court absolutely unfit to try them.  What a confession of weakness we have had from the Ministerial Bench!  I hope I took the Minister for Finance correctly when he told us that the object of this section was not to obtain the respect of the ordinary man.  If that is not the object I take it that the reverse is, and I will at once concede to the Minister that his object will be most admirably carried out if this Bill is passed, because if it is not intended to obtain the respect of the man in the street it will to a large extent obtain his disrespect, and the disrespect of every law-abiding citizen.  Then, we are told by the President that he wants to keep the judiciary above reproach, and hence he could not allow them to take part in these courts.  Again, I humbly and respectfully <Col N="1419" /> agree with the President that if they were mixed up in any of these courts as outlined by the provisions of this Bill they would to a large extent obtain the disrespect of the man in the street, the ordinary citizen.</P>
    <P>Then we have heard a confession from Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney which I hope will not get him into any serious trouble with the Government.  He told us in effect that the real object underlying the section was that the duty of the jury, as he understood it, was to obtain fair play, and hence the functions of the jury would be of no use for the purpose of carrying out the objects of this section.  I agree with him when he tells us these were the functions of a jury.  I assume what he means, and we have this from a representative of the Government policy, a statement from a responsible Deputy, that the function of the jury as he and the Government understand is to acquit the prisoners. I never heard that before.  I agree with the statement that the functions of a jury are to give to a man in the dock fair play.  So far as I know, these functions have in the Free State been carried out in a very efficient manner.  I was waiting to hear from some Deputy on the Government benches some suggestion that juries, from the passing of the Treaty down to the present, have not done their duty to Ireland.  Nobody suggested they have not.  They have done it in an especial degree. Why then cast a slur on the jury? Why is it suggested that the jury system has so far broken down that we must not only take it away&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>How is it suggested that the jury system has, so far, broken down, that it has become so hopeless that we must establish instead of it a system that, all through time, has proved a failure, namely, the setting up of military special courts.  The Minister for Agriculture is afraid that I overlooked him.  He has spoken, and he <Col N="1420" /> wants to know if anybody ever heard courtsmartial spoken of with disrespect. I am not going to oblige him, except to a certain extent, and I will leave it to him to say whether it constituted disrespect or not.  I have appeared before Free State courtsmartial.  I have defended a Free State officer, and I think he would be in a much better position to give an opinion not merely of the file, but of the rank of the Free State Army than anybody speaking in this House. I will tell you what the opinion of the Free State officer of the courtmartial was.</P>

      <P>If you, A Chinn Comhairle, suggest that I should not pursue that subject, even at the risk of disappointing the Minister for Agriculture, I will not.  I will content myself by saying that the subject is not one that he should pursue when he suggests that we should inquire as to the respect in which the Free State courtsmartial are held amongst the rank and file of his own Army.  I have appeared before a Free State courtmartial quite recently and I am glad to say that I noticed a very marked improvement as compared with the time I went before such a tribunal four years ago.  I can say, without getting anybody into trouble, that I went there by appointment to defend a Free State officer.  He had full permission for his defence and was informed by the authorities that he was free to employ and consult with a legal agent.  I was placed in a hut when I went there, and remained there about two hours.  None of the officers would admit that the man was on the premises or would give him facilities for coming to see me.  That was my experience of a Free State courtmartial on the 17th March, 1923.  I hope none of the people brought up under this Act will be placed in the same position.  I hope that an advocate called upon to defend <Col N="1421" /> accused persons will not be hunted from the doors of a barrack or kept waiting in a hut for two hours.  If that does happen it will not increase the respect which he says&mdash;I take his word for it, because I know he would not say anything except what is in accord with the principles of George Washington&mdash; these courts command.  That disrespect will disappear.</P>

If that be so, I am rather puzzled as to how I came into this House.  I think that if the Minister wants to be personally offensive, he should at least temper his remarks with logic.  I do not propose to deal with the other suggestions he made here, because I think some of them are more suited to the election platform than to this House.</P>

      <P>Might I say this about this debate: We are speaking here in the most important institution in this country.  The country has not got so many institutions, and those which it has were conceived and born in very troubled times.  Their growth was difficult, and their development is not improved by loose aspersions cast upon them in debate here.  I think this debate on the subject of special courts can be conducted without Deputies casting aspersions either upon the Army or upon the police or any other of our institutions.  If we could remember that, we would be doing good to this particular institution, which is the most important of them all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. BELTON Mr. BELTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BELTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot deal with this matter in the very learned legal way in which it has been dealt with by <Col N="1422" /> previous speakers, but to me it seems that there can be two states in a country.  You can have a state in which you can deal with crime by civil courts, and you can have a state of war or armed rebellion when you will want military courts.  I think the promoters of this Bill should define which of these two states we are in, whether it is war or whether it is peace.  Under the Constitution, we are provided with courts for either peace or war, and I do not see the necessity for these special courts.  I join with Deputy Wolfe in condemning the statements made by the Vice-President, that these courts were set up not to win the respect of the people, but to put a cold shiver down the backs of the terrorists&mdash;he might have added&mdash;the men whom he made terrorists.  He also went on to say that in dealing with this matter the ordinary machinery might break down.  Will the Ministry give us one single instance where the ordinary machinery of the civil courts in dealing with crime has broken down, or what makes them think that they will break down?  I do not want to be uncharitable, but are we to accept from their attitude that they want punishment that is not deserved to be meted out for crimes?  If they do, I quite agree with the Vice-President that they are not out to win the respect of the people. The President stated that judges were not appointed for this sort of work.  I might ask him were military officers appointed for this sort of work?  The Judiciary wants to be kept above reproach. We all agree with that, but I should think that the Army and the Army officers should be kept above reproach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we have special pleading on the part of a Deputy learned in the law. In effect, he says that this work would spoil judges.  That is really what it means to the ordinary man&mdash;it would spoil judges.  Well, if crime is dealt with in such a way that it will spoil the judges, then it will be improperly dealt with.  Is that not the logical conclusion? The speeches made in support of this section, or any section, or the measure taken as a whole, have been the best speeches to damn the measure.  The friends of the Bill are <Col N="1423" /> its greatest enemies.  Judges will be spoiled if they are brought down from the fount of justice, where every citizen, according to the Constitution, has to get a fair trial by his fellows. In these special courts, if you put in that judge, he will not only be spoiled, but he can never be reclaimed if you send him back to the judiciary.  He can never be fit for his old job.  He can never be fit to get back to what Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney in a very ponderous way referred to, that state where he could keep his mind open and free.  We may imagine, though we cannot describe, what sort of justice these special courts will mete out.  Remarks have been made that certain Deputies here are English, or have belonged to a certain small pro-English faction.  I do not think that these remarks were deserved. I do not think that it is a compliment to our sense of justice here, even if they did belong to the pro-English faction, that this machinery we Irish are devising is machinery to run to earth fellow-Irishmen.  I think we stand condemned by the words spoken out of our own mouths.  We have insulted ourselves by these remarks, and we have not insulted the Englishman or those who may be chosen to speak for a small minority with the English spirit or outlook.  We have insulted those who claim to have the Irish outlook.</P>

      <P>I am not one of those who think that this section, or the previous portion of the Bill, is the worst portion of the Bill, because, at least, there is the assurance, small as it may be, that Parliament shall be called together, and shall be at least sitting every three months while these courts are operating.  Nevertheless, I think the case made for their establishment is very far from being conclusive.  I draw attention to the point made by Deputy Belton in reference to the position of the judges.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney and the President made a great point of the undesirability of the judiciary, or even legal persons, for fear of the consequences to their judicial temperament, acting as a court which had to decide a matter of life and death.  But one of the members of <Col N="1424" /> the court is to be a person who has legal knowledge and experience, who may be, but need not be, an officer of the defence forces.  If he is not an officer of the defence forces and has legal knowledge and experience, it is probably intended that he should be a barrister.  Apparently he might give judgment on questions of life and death without spoiling his future career or future habit of mind in matters of criminality and of fact.  He does not matter.  The probabilities are that in our defence forces there are very few persons who have legal knowledge and experience.  There are, let us say, one or two, or, perhaps, three or four.  I imagine that their functions in normal times is to act on courts-martial or in respects to courtsmartial. When acting on these courts they may be allowed to form judgment on matters of fact involving the death penalty.  But when they have ceased to act on these courts, what is to be their function?  Are they to be judicial persons to any degree afterwards? Surely not, because they have been spoiled&mdash;their mentality is altered radically and they may not any further act as judicial persons.  The Vice-President emphasised the case that these should be military tribunals by the statement that there is no question of civil war, but that there was a criminal, treasonable, terroristic conspiracy, which apparently is to be met by a counter-terror.  I do not think that that is the way to approach it.  I think that speech, the speeches of the Minister for Agriculture, and the speech of the President this afternoon really present to the House the strongest arguments against the Bill, because they are the arguments of people who want to meet terror by terror.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are assured that the jury system has not broken down.  No Minister is basing his case for these courts upon the proposition that it has failed.  Presumably then, the courts are to be set up when that system has failed, and we are to wait until there is some evidence of its failure before the courts are to be set up.  Section 20 says that, &ldquo;Whenever the Executive Council is of opinion that it is necessary in order <Col N="1425" /> to secure the due administration of justice and the sure punishment of crime,&rdquo; a proclamation may be issued and the court set up.  The jury system has not broken down, and there is no evidence that it is breaking down, and presumably, on the argument, these courts will not be set up until it has broken down.  But is the jury system going to break down at one fell swoop?  Are we to have the jury system in operation up to a certain date, and then suddenly is it to be declared that it has broken down?  That must be the presumption of Ministers, because on previous sections they have refused to give even the House an opportunity to say whether the jury system has broken down until they have declared that it has.  The Executive is to be the deciding voice as to whether the jury system has broken down, and the House may afterwards say, &ldquo;Yes, we believe it has,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;We believe it has not.&rdquo;  But the courts have then been established.</P>
    <P>This amendment is to ensure that the court to be set up will consist of judges, and that is the counter-proposition to that of the Ministry, that it should consist of two persons who are officers of the Defence Forces and one person who may be an officer of the Defence Forces, but must have legal knowledge and experience.  That court is to act as jury and judge&mdash;the two members who are military officers to be the jury and the person with legal knowledge to be the judge.  That is the case presented by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney. I do not think it is any aspersion to say that military officers sitting to decide questions of fact and law in circumstances such as these, in a court, which on the assurance of Ministers, is only to deal with terroristic movements, treasonable conspiracies and seditious agitation, are not by their very training and antecedents capable of satisfying any impartial citizen that they will be a good court.  In no case will military officers be able to give a fair judgment when they are trying their enemies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wolfe, I think it was, drew attention to the difference between British courts-martial as he knew them, when trying their own people, and <Col N="1426" /> when trying prisoners in Ireland.  I think it is a very natural thing, and that it is no aspersion upon the character of any members of the forces, to say that when trying a prisoner who is charged with engaging in a movement or conspiracy to overthrow the State, these officers will not constitute the best kind of court or even a good court. There is a natural and inevitable prejudice. I do not hesitate, because I do not think I am doing the slightest wrong to anyone, to say that officers of an army, which has had its inception in a political movement, has grown out of that political movement, and has not had long enough tradition to get away from the effects of that movement and training, do not constitute the best court to try political prisoners&mdash;prisoners who are engaged in a political conspiracy to overthrow the State.</P>
    <P>I know a great many men now in the Free State Army.  I knew them long before they were in the Army&mdash;very good, decent workmen, and good trade unionists they were.  I knew their mentality before they went into the Army, and I know their mentality now.  It is not a fair thing to the officers concerned that this duty should be put upon them.  I say this, and I know it is a fact from the officers themselves, that they dislike this proposition quite as much as the judges dislike it.  I think there is less reason for putting it upon them.  They say: &ldquo;Yes, they ask us to do the dirty work.&rdquo;  I say in reference to them that they know they are not competent to constitute fair courts, not because they will not try to be fair, but because they know that their training does not justify them in trying prisoners under these provisions.  Coming back to the statement of the Minister for Finance, that the intention of these courts was to put down a terroristic conspiracy, I want again to point out, and to emphasise, that the duties of these courts are not confined to putting down terroristic or treasonable conspiracies. These courts will have to decide whether a person is in fact a member or has been associated with an unlawful conspiracy, that is to say, an unlawful association.  There are a great many matters of much less gravity to be tried by these courts than the putting <Col N="1427" /> down of treasonable conspiracies. The proposition of the Minister for Finance, that the whole purpose of these courts is only to deal with treasonable conspiracy, is overstating the case; they will have much lesser things to do than that, and they will have much smaller offences to deal with than the activities of treasonable conspiracy.</P>
    <P>I think that some such court as Deputy Redmond has suggested is a better court than a court of military officers.  No one has met the point or suggestion of Deputy Redmond that if one has to go outside the judiciary or even outside the legal profession you are bound only to go to the military courts.  Deputy Redmond made a suggestion&mdash;I do not know whether he laid stress upon it; it was not touched upon by Ministers&mdash;that a much more suitable court would be officers of the Gárda Síochána.  I do not say anything either in commendation or condemnation of that, but it has not been met, and the proposition of Ministers is that the only court that can be established in substitution for the jury system when it has broken down is a military court.</P>
    <P>I do not think, as a matter of fact, that this is going to wait for the breakdown of the jury system.  I think that the likely outcome of the passing of this section will be that the courts will be established when, and if, any incident takes place which seems to show the continued existence and activity of a treasonable conspiracy.  It will be a new answer to the new terroristic activity.  It will not be because the courts have broken down, but it will be the new answer of the Executive to what they deem to be the requirements of a further answer to a terroristic act. I, therefore, will support the amendment moved by Deputy Redmond.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisCullen" hpid="Mr. CULLEN Mr. CULLEN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CULLEN</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say why I feel strongly that the amendment of Deputy Redmond should be passed by the Committee.  The special courts set up under this Act are for the special purpose of the detection of crime, and for dealing with crime and misdemeanours at a time of crisis.  We <Col N="1428" /> may well agree that special courts, in special circumstances and special emergency may be necessary for the safety and well-being of the State.  At the same time these special courts, we believe, should take into account the safety of the citizen, and I think it is apparent, and very evident, from the statement of Ministers in support of the Bill generally, and in support of this particular section, that while they are rightly concerned with bringing criminals to justice, at the same time they are having no regard to the fact that fair play should be given to the accused.  I think the accused, in the sense of being, perhaps, not guilty, is being left out of account altogether, and I think that any legislation, even special legislation dealing with any emergency, should jealously guard the rights of the citizen to a fair trial.  I do not want to say anything as regards the relative fairness of courtsmartial, English or Irish, but I think it will be agreed that military courts or special courts of the descriptions in this section are regarded with uneasiness by the general body of the people.</P>
      <P>They are regarded with uneasiness and with grave concern in almost every country in the world, and I think history has shown that in the efforts to build up States and a proper system of jurisprudence every step has been taken by legislative assemblies to see that the judiciary would be on the same basis as we have it in this country in normal times, and it is only on the very rarest occasions that military courts are allowed to be set up by any assembly.  I submit that we have not heard from the Ministerial benches anything to justify the belief that the times ahead of us are such as will warrant us departing from courts composed of ordinary judges.  I think that Ministers, in approaching the question of the composition of the courts, in leaving out of account altogether the fair play that an accused should get, apparently believe that every man they arrest is a criminal and that every man arrested should therefore be convicted. I think that there is a little too much of that coming out, as it were, from the utterances of Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dealing with another section regarding <Col N="1429" /> trial by jury this evening, the President asked Deputy Redmond in a very heated way what jury tried the late Minister and what kind of trial did he get.  I can, and I think everyone of us can, sympathise with and appreciate the feelings of the President in thinking of and in referring to the murder of a valued colleague.  But is that spirit the right spirit in which to approach legislation involving the lives of citizens?  I submit that it is not.  Whilst appreciating the feelings of the President, I think that he is not warranted in bringing that forward as any reason why we should support sections such as this, and for that reason I think the House should approach it in a calmer atmosphere, away altogether from the personal aspect or from the feelings brought about by this unfortunate occurrence, and whilst everyone of us is prepared to give the Government all the support possible in putting down crime, conspiracy, and such things, it seems to me that we require to guard the rights of the ordinary citizen and see that if he is accused he should at any rate have a fair trial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>It is really very difficult to decide on the relative merits of the case put forward, and the more we hear the more confused we get.  Deputy Cullen concluded by saying: &ldquo;We are prepared to do certain things; we are prepared to give the Government all the support that is necessary to enable them to put down crime.&rdquo;  One must ask what does Deputy Cullen mean by that, and we have all to ask ourselves the same question.  Is Deputy Cullen prepared to concede all the powers that the Government think are necessary to enable them to put down crime, or is he prepared to give only what he considers necessary for that purpose?  If I am to make any comment at all on that statement of Deputy Cullen's, let me make this with regard to the attitude of the Labour Party, that that statement has been made time and again by their leader and by members of the Party with regard to this measure.  This measure is as objectionable to my Party, and to me, as it is to the leader of the Labour Party, or to the members of that Party.  I think, with the exception <Col N="1430" /> of two, they voted against every section in the Bill so far. These sections would be of very little value indeed in regard to the extra powers that the Government are seeking and which the Labour Party say they are prepared to concede.  Even last night&mdash;and I passed it then and I passed it since, but I cannot help commenting on the fact&mdash; Constitutionalists, great defenders of the Constitution though they are, voted against the section that seeks to penalise men who come before properly constituted courts of the country and who will not recognise these courts I find it difficult to see exactly how that attitude squares with the high constitutional aspect which the Labour Party advanced here, and on which they want us to base decisions.</P>

      <P>Deputy Redmond's amendment is definite and explicit.  It asks us to accept &ldquo;a tribunal consisting of three members who shall be judges of the High Court.&rdquo;  I have not heard all the arguments for and against.  On the one hand, the plea is made that a court consisting of three judges would be more competent than a military court, that the prisoner and justice would be better served by such a court.  If I am to make a choice, I agree that it would be better to have such a court.  As far as Deputy Johnson is concerned, he is not acting more constitutionally in supporting a court of three judges&mdash;that is, a special court &mdash;than in supporting the other type of court, drawn from officers of the defence forces of Saorstát Eireann.  In that sense, either court is abrogating the Constitution.  No one can plead that he is a greater defender of the Constitution in one point than in another.</P>
      <P>In answering Deputy Redmond, the President stated that he was not prepared to ask the judges of the High Court to serve on these special courts. I think he said that it was not in the terms of their appointment.  I would like it to be clear whether or not the terms of their appointment are so definite that, if they were called upon under an Act of this House to perform such functions in order to serve the ends of justice in a particular way, they could claim that it was outside their functions to serve in such a manner. I think that is hardly a justifiable attitude for the President to take up. I think it is hardly an answer to Deputy Redmond's case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to military courts, the point that they would not dispense justice <Col N="1432" /> in the fashion that three judges might do, largely because two members of that court will not have experience or knowledge of the law, has, I think, a certain amount of weight.  Undoubtedly, our officers are young; many of them are less experienced in law and in the affairs of the world than the members of the Judiciary.  I am not going to suggest&mdash;I think it is unworthy of any representative in this House to suggest&mdash;that any officer of the National Army would be such an unworthy citizen as to act unjustly towards any offender brought before him.  I believe that an offender would stand as good a chance of a fair trial there, and be treated as justly as if he were before a jury of his countrymen in the courts. I can see no reason whatever for believing that the contrary would be the case.</P>
    <P>To some extent, we have to remember how the defence forces of Saorstát Eireann were brought into existence. They were born in revolution, came through a period of civil war, and for a considerable time since then have been engaged in the work of hunting for arms and so on.  I am conscious of the fact that these courts are to be set up if and when certain conditions exist&mdash;conditions which we, at least, do not anticipate will come about&mdash;on which military men are to serve to try offenders who had been possibly in arms against them at an earlier period in the life of this State.  I am not going to suggest that that fact would influence the men on these courts.  Nevertheless, the fact that the members of the court have stood at one time for one thing, and that those who are being tried by it were and even now are standing for something else, is a factor which we must take cognisance of. Weighing the whole matter up, we would prefer that these special courts should be constituted in the fashion suggested by Deputy Redmond or in the manner suggested in sub-section (a) of Section 22.  On the other hand, I think that a case has, to some extent, been made that would warrant our believing that it was possible a decision on the part of this House&mdash;if and when certain conditions were created here by other people who have no sympathy <Col N="1433" /> with this House, no respect for the State and nothing but hate for some of its citizens&mdash;under such circumstances, to have a military court to try such men, if necessary, might act as a deterrent and even would be a threat to these people, that there was danger ahead for them if they committed a crime against the State or lives of citizens.</P>
    <P>I think the existence of sub-section (b) in this section might actually strengthen the position of our civil courts as they operate at present, and might in fact be a protection for these courts, might make people who would be prepared to intimidate men who would serve on a jury, so as to prevent them doing their duty, just as some of these people might be found prepared to intimidate members of this House and prevent them doing their duty by the State.  It might be a deterrent and might make these people believe that if they committed an offence the safest thing for them would be not to commit such an offence against the life of the State or the lives of citizens of the State.  They might consider the best thing they could do would be to commit no offence against the civil courts, to do nothing that would prevent the civil courts functioning and continuing to dispense justice.  Knowing that, and realising that if any action of theirs was responsible for creating a position in which this or another Executive Council could declare that the civil courts had failed, and could come to this House and ask for support for a proclamation to establish other special courts, these people might feel that the position they were creating for themselves was more serious and more difficult.  With that belief and conviction, this section, standing as it is, might actually operate so as to preserve stability and order.  In my view, there is no justification for the President proposing in amendment 49, which we are not prepared to countenance or support, not to ask the courts to do this work.  Our attitude and belief is that if this House declares certain work to be the function of officers of the courts of this country, it is their duty to carry out its decisions, just as we have to take other decisions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1434" /> On the other hand, it seems to me that Deputy Redmond's amendment stands for one court and one court only, while serving the purpose perhaps of being the very best under the circumstances which a prisoner could expect from the point of view of trial and justice.  Taking away the military court, leaving the Supreme Court alone, would weaken the section and have such an effect on the present position of our civil courts that we might be called upon to bring into existence these special courts much sooner than might be necessary; or by doing that we might be doing something that might prevent our ever having to meet here to bring these special courts into existence.  I do not think that Deputy Redmond is wise in stressing his amendment.  On the other hand, the President would, in our view, be asking for something wholly unjustifiable by attempting to take from the Bill this section.</P>

      <P>I am quite at a loss to understand the irritation betrayed by Deputy Baxter at the attitude taken up by the Labour Deputies towards this Bill.  I have been a frequent visitor to the Dáil for the past four years, during which Deputy Baxter has been a member and I found him a very strenuous critic of the Ministry and of the various measures introduced by them during that period.  It does not seem an adequate justification to me, because certain things happened and because the mantle of Deputy Gorey fell on Deputy Baxter, to find that that justified him in changing his attitude towards the Ministry and that he should upbraid Deputies of the Labour Party because they were not as agile in changing their political outlook as he has been.</P>

      <P>Neither was there any justification for saying that as far as the Labour Party are concerned there were certain Deputies who, while opposing the measure in this House, were anxious to have it passed.  I do not think the members of the Labour Party are more deficient in courage than <Col N="1435" /> any other Deputies here, and I repudiate the innuendo contained in that remark.  The Deputies of the Labour Party have always had the courage of their convictions.  They have been prepared to stand up for what they believe.  Like other members of the Party who have spoken, I deplore the decision of the Executive Council in coming down here and asking us to set up these special courts and thereby abrogating those rights and guarantees that citizens are given under the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made by Deputies that some Deputies appear to forget the history of the past ten or twelve years.  But to anybody who is familiar with the remarkable and revolutionary period in which we have lived in that time, it is surprising that in such a short period after these events have taken place that things should be anything like normal.  Just consider that eleven years ago the President of the Executive Council was a convict in an English prison serving a life sentence, after narrowly escaping being shot; that fifteen months later he was elected representative by the great majority of the people; that one and a half years after that he was a Minister of a revolutionary Government; that a year later again he was a fugitive, liable to be shot at sight; that two years after that he was the head of an established Government, and that a few months after that again he was the head of a State waging civil war; that it was his duty, and the duty of his colleagues, as they conceived it, to execute seventy-seven of their fellow-citizens, many of them close colleagues in the revolutionary movement through which they had passed, some of them personal friends; that they were called upon to send to prison hundreds of men who had been closely associated with them in the same movement, and to intern fifteen thousand citizens of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say, in case I may be misunderstood, that as references have been made by other Deputies to that state of affairs, that I personally do not doubt that in any steps taken by the President and his colleagues in that <Col N="1436" /> time they did anything except what they believed was absolutely necessary for the safeguarding of the State.  The steps taken by them were taken with the greatest reluctance.  I do not say that I agreed with what they did, but I am satisfied that they were convinced that these steps were necessary.  But now, having regard to that, is it remarkable that there should be an aftermath of all that?  That there should be not only what exists to-day, but a great deal more?  I know my personal view was, and it was expressed to my friends on many occasions, that the end of the period of civil war would see wholesale assassinations of the leading figures who were concerned in it.  I was most agreeably surprised and delighted that that state of affairs had not occurred, and that, up to the assassination of the late Vice-President, we had a state of affairs in which the passions aroused by the civil war, and the things surrounding it, had, to all appearances, almost died down, and we had advanced by giant strides towards a state of affairs in which political differences would flow in the ordinary accepted channels, and that the gun and the appeal to force were rapidly becoming things of the past.</P>
    <P>We were all shocked and horrified, of course, to find that they were not. That single incident showed that that was not so.  But I have the view that that was an isolated occurrence and that it does not indicate that we are likely to have an epidemic of that state of affairs.  I have a firm hope in that. The Government, I know, hold the contrary view.  Deputy Baxter asks us: &ldquo;Are you prepared to trust the Ministry if they say this Bill is necessary?&rdquo; Personally, I am not.  I am not prepared to trust this Ministry or any other Ministry.  We are here as elected Deputies of the people, to exercise our own judgment as to what legislation should be passed, and we are not to act on anybody else's judgment. If we have arrived at a state of affairs when we have to trust the judgment of the Ministry or the judgment of somebody else, then there is no case for us being here at all.  Personally, if I were convinced that the only way to prevent Minister or men who go on <Col N="1437" /> discharging their public duties incurring the risk of assassination, if I were convinced that this was the only way to prevent it, I would be prepared to support this measure, but with reluctance. I am not convinced that it is the only way.  I am rather inclined to believe that it would have the opposite effect.</P>
    <P>Political assassination is not a new thing in the world.  Most, if not all, countries have been troubled by it. Countries that have been governed in an autocratic fashion, like Russia up to 1917, and countries with a democratic constitution, like England and America, have been bothered by it. America, with its democratic constitution, lost two Presidents by assassination within twenty years, and I believe that it is not a coincidence that the country with the most autocratic government was the country with the most attempts at political assassination, and that in countries with the most democratic Constitution there were fewer of those attempts.  I believe that measures such as this will promote and favour and encourage conspiracy and assassination.  I believe that the only true remedies for it is to trust the people and not to adopt this measure.  The President and the Ministers may say: &ldquo;This is all very well, but we are the people who are running the risks, not you.&rdquo;  That is perfectly true, but they ran risks before when they thought it was necessary, and I put it to the President that it is necessary to run this risk, and I admit it is a risk.  It is necessary to run it.</P>
    <P>The free development of this country upon democratic lines is a big thing, and it is worth taking a risk for.  I put it to the Ministry that they should take that risk.  I would refer to an incident that occurred, very closely associated with the late Vice-President. Right at the time that the civil war was still on it fell to the duty of the late Vice-President to establish a police force.  At that time he took what appeared to a great many people a very great risk in establishing an unarmed police force.  That act was described by Deputy Johnson, speaking for those he represented at the time, as a far-seeing act of statesmanship. <Col N="1438" /> It is one of the greatest monuments that the late Vice-President has left behind him.  I think that a further risk should be taken by the President and his colleagues, and that he should regard what has happened as an isolated incident which, I believe, is condemned by all fair-minded people in the country, not excepting the vast majority of the political opponents of the present Government.  I believe that this risk should be taken, and we offer our opposition to the setting up of these special courts and to this Bill in general not upon party grounds or to make party capital, but simply and honestly because we believe it is not the right way of going about what is intended and we believe it will have the contrary effect to what is intended.</P>

      <P>It was a speech of serious argument, put forward temperately and reasonably.  Having said that, I must disagree with some of his matter.  He says that political assassination is no new thing, and that, alas, is true.  I do not remember the murders of Lincoln and Garfield, but I do remember many murders of heads of States and responsible Ministers.  I remember the murder of McKinley and I remember the murder of the King of Italy; I remember the murder of the Empress of Austria, and I remember many unsuccessful attempts at assassination against persons holding high powers in various States.  What was the characteristic of all these murders? They were murders committed by men of unbalanced minds with no organisation behind them; the murderer was invariably apprehended.  There was no motor car waiting, no men on the look-out, no organisation to enable the murderer to get away.  We have gone back from those political assassinations. This is a very different one.  The murder we have had to deal with recently and the murders we may have to deal with in future, are not murders <Col N="1439" /> committed by unbalanced boys, full of some crazy story of rights and wrongs; they are deliberate cold-blooded murders planned in advance, with motor cars stolen and arrangements made for escape.  Surely they need some more serious mechanism to counteract and confront them than merely the expression of public opinion.</P>
      <P>With all respect to Deputy O'Brien, my criticism of the Labour Party is that on this Bill they have offered us no alternative of any kind whatever; not a single amendment on the paper; divisions, discussions, always ending up in a negative.  We must assume that in their view the present state of affairs is for the best, and that we should carry on our business now as we have done it for the past four years, punctuated by an occasional funeral procession. That is a risk that we must take in order to assure the multitude. Well, I will not take it.</P>
      <P>It is not my business to defend Deputy Baxter; he is very well able to look after himself.  I, like Deputy O'Brien, listened to Deputy Baxter criticising the Government, and I fancy I shall listen to Deputy Baxter criticising the Government again; but he generally put forward an alternative: he generally said what ought in his view to be done.  He did not only say what the Government ought not to do: he gave a constructive line of advance, and I see no tendency of that constructive line of advance on the benches on my left.  I do not want to detain the Dáil.  I will only say I agree with every word Deputy Baxter said, including his comment on the amendment the President has tabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like also to express the view that the first sensible speech that I heard against this measure was uttered by Deputy O'Brien.  I believe what he said to be the soundest conviction of his own mind.  But he might have gone a little bit further and he might have reviewed the events of the last five years a little more closely.  We have not met those events of five years by the methods that he recommended in his closing sentences. We had to take strong action, <Col N="1440" /> whether he agreed with it or not, and I must say that running through his speech there was at least an indication that there was there a mind which, if it had never exercised authority, at any rate knew something about the exercise of authority.</P>
      <P>It would be an easy thing for us to take the line that this was an isolated incident and that the public condemnation which was expressed would have brought home to the minds of those engaged in the conspiracy that there was no support for any such action. But I listened to at least one speech from one of the Deputy's friends on that side and I never heard a single expression which would lead me to believe that there was a desire on the part of that person that the perpetrators should be apprehended.  Deputy Lynch was the speaker, and he can now express the wish that he would like to see them apprehended if he desires.  That is our position at the moment.  Mr. de Valera did the same thing.  He condemned it, but he did not express any wish to see the perpetrators brought to justice.  It is not a spirit of revenge that animates us in doing our work here.  We are introducing a measure of this sort with a view to the prevention of a crime such as that.  I might be prepared to accept this as an isolated incident if we had not had some very considerable proof that it is no such thing&mdash;such as we had last November when various Gárda stations were invaded by young fellows with guns and when two of the best officers of their rank were shot dead.  We have other evidence that there is a conspiracy behind this, and while I am prepared personally to take any risk in this State, I have others to look to besides myself.  I have other Ministers.  You must have a Ministry and we have had to take the same strong steps with regard to this measure that we had five years ago when an attempt was made to prevent the State being born.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought I had explained the reason why we were establishing military courts.  It is that the policy of the Executive Council for five years has been to have an independent judiciary. It would not be an independent judiciary <Col N="1441" /> if we were to appoint three members of the High Court, or any of our judges, to perform the duties which would be allotted to them after this measure had been passed.  Judges are not called upon to express an opinion as to the guilt or innocence of a prisoner.  That is for the jury.  We intend, as long as we have the responsibility, to keep the judiciary independent, and I hope that our successors will do the same thing.  I hope it will be a characteristic of this country for all time.  There is a remarkable difference between that particular line of policy and the mid-Victorian radical policy that prevailed here in which there was an association between the Executive and the judiciary.  It did not bring public confidence in the judiciary in consequence.  We have established the utmost possible safeguards, the utmost possible liberty with democratic rights and privileges for the people of this country, and yet with all that these crimes have been committed. Now it is the duty of a Government to punish crime and to take steps to prevent it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance explained at great length the reason for including Part 4 in this measure&mdash;the setting up of special courts.  The Deputy is quite within his rights not to give that privilege or that responsibility to any Government, but he must remember that along with that right there is a very great responsibility.  It is that responsibility that we are putting to the Dáil to-night: that a very serious attack has been made on the first institution in this country.  This is not the ordinary assassination of a Minister.  If it were one of the incidents the Deputy referred to I should have been the person upon whom the attempt should have been made for assassination.  It was not.  There was no attempt made upon me.  The Dáil is now faced with the problem of dealing with this matter in the only way in which it can be dealt with.  We can only again express the hope that it will not be necessary to set up these courts, but that if it be necessary they will be set up and the necessary action will be taken.</P>
    <P>While accepting what Deputy O'Brien has said, I do not accept many <Col N="1442" /> of the extravagant and elaborate statements that have been made by critics of this measure.  &ldquo;Any offence which is declared by the Treasonable Offences Act, 1925, to be treason or a felony or a misdemeanour&rdquo; will be triable by these special courts.  &ldquo;Any offence which is declared by this Act to be a misdemeanour, murder or attempted murder of the Governor-General or any member of the Oireachtas, or any judge of the Supreme Court, the High Court or the Circuit Court, or any Justice of the District Court&rdquo; will be dealt with by these courts, but not all of them carry with them the maximum penalty.</P>

That was the first honest attempt that was made. This is our contribution towards correcting the dangerous tendencies which have been evidenced by the conspiracy that brought about the death of a Minister of the State.  If that had occurred in the year 1923 or 1924, it would not have the same character that it has now in 1927.  It would not be so heinous, and it is on a par with most of the opposition there is to the State.  Those who speak about the economic situation and about the need for ensuring stable conditions to persons likely to invest capital in this country, ought at least have a very big concern that conspiracies such as we know are in existence should be dealt with by law, and this is the law to deal with them.</P>

Not only because the late Deputy O'Higgins was the Vice-President of this Council but even if he had been one of the most humble servants of this Government I believe his murderers would be just as equally entitled, if caught, to meet the just merits of their ghastly deed.  It ought not to be necessary for me to make a statement of that kind, and I sincerely hope that they will be caught.

We have had, during the last couple of days, charges hurled at us because we opposed the Bill, or perhaps certain sections of the Bill, to be more correct, that we are shirking our responsibilities and taking the safer course.  Those of us who were here in the 1922 Dáil during the all-night sitting in that Dáil, listened to those charges then as we are listening to them now.  Surely it is not going to be contended that we are trying to save our own skins, trying to shirk our responsibilities, merely because we do not see eye to eye with every measure introduced in this House?</P>
      <P>That is the gist of the speeches that have been made by at least one member of this House for the last two or three days.  Deputy Baxter has done that in every speech he made.  Those who have the temerity to oppose any section of this Bill are shirking their responsibilities.  I have only to say this, that it comes well from Deputy Baxter.</P>

      <P>Declarations were made by practically every member of <Col N="1445" /> his Party, and by the leader, that they were prepared to give support to any measure necessary to meet the present situation.  That statement was made. I am sorry that I came on after Deputy Cullen.  He has not cut across this debate very much, and is very reasonable.  My complaint is that neither Deputy Johnson nor any member of his party as a whole gave any indication of the sections in this Bill that they were prepared to support. Deputy Johnson has repeatedly&mdash;I have listened, I have watched&mdash;incited his men to obstruct, telling them they could speak three times, and ordering them to stand up.  That is not the kind of attitude to give us the kind of measure the House wants to have brought out.  If I have to ask myself what kind of measure we are to get, I do not see a single section you are going to give, and you gave us nothing else.  I leave it to Deputy Johnson and Deputy Morrissey to explain what they would give.</P>

If I were to admit the truth of what Deputy Baxter said, and if all this matter were not as serious as it really is, I would be inclined to say that we were following the example of Deputy Baxter for the last four years, for the lifetime of the last Dáil.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy would be only satisfied with saying that we could go on.  Deputy Baxter made certain statements and I called on Deputy O'Brien in preference to Deputy Cooper because he was sitting on the front bench of the Labour Party.  He dealt with the matter in a particular way.  The President dealt with it in a particular way. We are going back instead of going forward.  I know that is not Deputy Morrissey's own wishes.  I know his wishes are to the contrary.</P>

      <P>We will leave Deputy Baxter to his own conscience and consistency, but I want to say that we are as anxious for the safety of this State, and for every citizen in this State, as any Member of this House. We may differ as to the means for ensuring that safety, but in our opinion, and our opinion on this matter as in all other matters in this House is sincere <Col N="1446" /> and honest, this is not the best method to secure the safety of the citizens of this State, whether Members of the Oireachtas or not.  So far as I am concerned we have never hesitated to denounce in the very plainest possible language the murder of the late Vice-President. We have never hesitated for one moment to say that we hope the people who are responsible for that murder will be brought to justice and get what they deserved.  We go further and say that if it were possible that we were in a position to help to bring them to justice not one of us would refuse that help.  I think when we have the courage to come here and face up to our responsibilities and give expression to our opinions that we ought not be charged with cowardice. I think most of the members of this House know that the Labour Party faced up to its responsibilities and shouldered its responsibilities when it was in much more danger than now in 1922.  Most of the Members who were in the 1922 Dáil know quite well that the Labour Party as much as the Executive Council made it possible to carry on the Parliament of this nation, and the President knows well that the members of this party were in as much danger as any member of the Executive Council.</P>
      <P>It was often thrown at us during the threats which we received that it was because the Labour Party were here acting as an Opposition that they gave this assembly the semblance of a Parliament, and that if we were not here it would be merely a mutual admiration society.  I think we ought to get away from the cheap sneers and the loose talk which, I admit quite frankly, has come from all sides of the House in the past two days.  I have heard during the past couple of days more loose talk than in the previous five years.  I hope Deputies will thrash issues out in a reasonable way, and give all parties in the House credit for trying to do what they think the best, according to their lights, in the interests of the country.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1448" /> I have no regard for technical points of order, and I did not interfere.  The discussion has contributed nothing of any importance on Deputy Redmond's amendment.

      <P>I move amendment 51:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) (b), lines 24-25, to delete the words &ldquo;a person certified by the Attorney-General to have legal knowledge and experience&rdquo; and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;at the date of his appointment a practising barrister or solicitor of six years' standing at least.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving this amendment, I have two objects in view.  The first is, if the sub-section is carried setting up this court, that the odium of nominating the legal adviser should not rest <Col N="1451" /> on the shoulders of the Attorney-General. No question arises as to the fitness or bona fides of the Attorney-General to nominate anybody for the position, but what is liable to follow? It may be said that so-and-so has been appointed legal adviser and that he only qualified as a solicitor last year, or as a barrister six months ago.  The other important thing is that this court will apparently have only one member who will have any legal training, and I think every Deputy knows that in admitting evidence in a criminal case, more particularly in one involving a question of life and death, there is nothing more highly technical than what should be admitted and what should not be admitted as evidence.  I think that the odium or the responsibility should not be thrown on the Attorney-General of determining what person is qualified to act in this capacity, and that the Dáil should say that the person to be appointed should have certain specified qualifications. That would relieve the Attorney-General of any responsibility in the matter and would be a guarantee to the public that the man appointed was sufficiently long in the practice of his profession to know what he was doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It takes a late hour of the night to bring forward the greatest joke in the way of amendment and in the way of reasoning that could be put forward for an amendment. The Deputy wants the public to have confidence in the person with legal training who is to be associated with the military court.  He proposes the amendment for the reason that confidence must be obtained for the court, and that the Attorney-General should not have the odium thrown upon him of selecting the person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Leave the solicitor out of it for the moment.  On the other hand, the Government's suggestion <Col N="1452" /> is a person certified by the Attorney-General to have legal knowledge and experience.  There is many a practising barrister of six years' standing whom the Attorney-General could not certify to have legal knowledge and experience.  Deputy McMenamin knows that full well.  A practising barrister of six years' experience means a barrister who at the moment of his appointment is in practice, is attending the Bar Library, is looking for cases, is not retired from the Bar and is six years qualified.  He may have passed his whole six years as a barrister without a single case.  As long as he is still looking for practice at the Bar he is a practising barrister, and if he is six years qualified he is of six years' standing. That is the sort of type the Deputy would have the public have confidence in.  On the other hand, we suggest that he should be a person certified by the Attorney-General to have legal knowledge and experience. The Attorney-General reaches his high position after he has been in practice at the Bar&mdash;not looking for practice at the Bar, but practising at the Bar&mdash; the leader of the Bar.</P>

      <P>He has to certify that the person has legal knowledge and experience.  Is the Attorney-General likely to certify that a person has legal knowledge and experience unless in fact he has?  Are we going to get any better substitute by adopting the absurd suggestion that it should be any man called to the Bar six years ago, who has not given up the chance of practising, has not given up the hope of a brief at the moment at which he is appointed?  That is the gist of the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister now is endeavouring perhaps to liven up the proceedings, but not exactly by turning them into a joke.  He has completely misinterpreted the spirit of the amendment, and he knows perfectly well that the spirit of the amendment is precisely the same as that embodied in the Courts of Justice Act, which provides that no member of the Bar shall be appointed a judge unless he is a practising barrister of so many years' standing.  What was the point of putting that into the Courts of Justice Act <Col N="1454" /> if it is not to be applied here?  Was it done as a standing joke?  Is it to be suggested that because a principle, which has been acted upon by the Government, is embodied in that Act, and because that same principle is put forward here by a member of the Minister's own profession for the same purpose, that it was done as a joke?  I must say that I think the joke smacks very much of the North&mdash;of the part of the country that the Minister comes from.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point to which I should like to call attention, which I am not quite clear about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section reads: &ldquo;As soon as may be after every occasion on which <Col N="1455" /> this part of the Act comes into force there shall be established by the Executive Council one or more tribunals,&rdquo; etc.  It would seem from the wording of that, that the Executive Council would be the means of establishing the court.  What I would like information on is as to whether the nomination of members of the court would rest with the Executive Council.  Who would be the nominating authority?  Who would be the authority that would actually nominate the three members of this court?  Would it be the Executive Council or not?  I think it would be wise to have some reply on that.  In regard to the amendment which has just been voted upon and defeated, that amendment was described by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, rather hurriedly, I admit, as a joke at this late hour of the night.  In reply, rather hurriedly also, I admit, I stated that a similar provision embodying a similar principle was inserted in the Courts of Justice Act, 1924.  Since then I have discovered that this huge joke&mdash;which seems to have been a joke in the imagination of the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;has also been perpetrated in every Emergency Powers Act passed already by his Party and his Government.  I find in the Public Safety Emergency Powers Act of 1923 a provision&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am pointing out why it is a mistake not to have it inserted in the section, and, further, why I am going to vote against the section.  One of the reasons why I shall vote against the section is the manner in which this amendment was so lightly disposed of by the Minister.  This proposal was actually embodied in Section <Col N="1456" /> 4 of the 1923 Public Safety Act, where it states: &ldquo;Councils consisting of not less than three members, of whom one shall be a practising barrister or solicitor of not less than five years' standing.&rdquo;  It was not a joke under that Act; neither was it a joke under the Public Safety (Emergency Powers) Act, 1926.  But, because it is proposed by an ordinary member of this Dáil, the Minister hurries in and informs the House at this late hour that it is a joke.  I hope, as he seems to be so anxious to consume the time at this late hour, that he has seen the joke.  I also hope that in future, when amendments are proposed to legislation brought in by the Government, especially amendments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I must ask Deputy Redmond to resume his seat for a moment.  I gave the Deputy plenty of time to explain why he wanted the amendment re-discussed, but I cannot allow him to get on with a discussion of an amendment that has been rejected by the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, of course, I bow to your ruling, and I shall deal with the section.  The section proposes that three or more members, of whom one (who may be or not be an officer in the Defence Forces of Saorstát Eireann) shall be a person certified by the Attorney-General to have legal knowledge and experience, and the others shall be officers of the Defence Forces of Saorstát Eireann not below the rank of commandant.  This does not contain a provision similar to that contained in the Emergency Acts that I have recited, and there has been no reason advanced why such a similar provision should not be contained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart altogether from this particular sub-section I think that it should be fairly obvious now that there has been no adequate reason advanced why this particular form of court should be set up, as distinct from and against any other form of special court.  The trend of the debate which latterly largely took the form of a Second Reading debate seemed to point to the direction, especially from speeches made from the Government benches, that this was the only course open to them, that <Col N="1457" /> nothing else would be of any use or assistance, that nothing short of a military court, or a court composed of such military officers would serve the avowed purpose of this Bill.  But no reasons have been advanced for that conclusion.</P>
    <P>I asked during the course of my remarks, in moving my amendment, whether any reason could be given by the Government why a civil court, no matter how it was composed&mdash;whether of High Court judges, Supreme Court judges, Circuit Court judges or special Commissioners&mdash;could not effect a purpose similar to that required by the military court.  I have got no reply whatever to that statement except perhaps the remarks passed by the Vice-President when he seemed to suggest that terror must be met by terror and, I suppose, stroke by counter stroke. There I beg profoundly to disagree with him.  I think if there was not a certain anxiety to get to work and have what is called speedy justice brought about, if there was a desire to endeavour to allow things to improve instead of actually encouraging them to disimprove, such a drastic measure as this would not be adopted.  There has not, as far as I am concerned, been <Col N="1458" /> any reason why courts composed of civilians rather than military officers would not more than adequately meet the case and would not be such a distinct breach of the Constitution as are the military courts provided by the section.  It has been said that any kind of special courts are in fact a contravention of Article 70 of the Constitution. That is so, but at the same time, to my mind, courts composed of military officers go even one step further than special courts composed of civilians, because it is not only expressly laid down in the Article of the Constitution that no one shall be tried save in the courts of law and by the ordinary court but it is also expressly laid down that the jurisdiction of military tribunals shall not be extended to or exercised over the civilian population save in time of war or armed rebellion. Therefore, I am more than ever convinced that this proposal tends to aggravate the situation in which we find ourselves to-day rather than improve it, and it is because of that I propose to vote against the section.</P>

      <P>This section provides for ensuring that a person who is charged with an offence mentioned in the Schedule of the Bill shall, no matter whether he has been already before the courts, provided that no conviction has been obtained, and if there has been a disagreement, go forward to this special court.  It is clearly a section which intends that there shall be a conviction, and I think that the section ought not be passed until we know what kind of regulations are to govern the conduct of the special courts.  I think it is quite an important thing to ensure that when the person charged has in his defence been able to raise doubts in the minds of the jury as to his guilt, he should at least have similar opportunities in respect of his defence in the next court as he has had in the first court.  If the regulations that are to be made respecting the method of trial are not of the kind and nature that would protect the accused, then the sending forward is undoubtedly prejudicial to the accused. and I hope that that will be taken into account when you come to the question of the regulations governing the conduct of these special courts.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 55, after the words &ldquo;to suffer death&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;such sentence to be subject to confirmation or mitigation by the Executive Council.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>During the course of the debate on other sections many Deputies practically dealt with this amendment.  Its object is plain on the face of it, that as there is no appeal from the sentence of a special court there should be some tribunal to revise a sentence which might be regarded as too severe.  I can conceive a state of circumstances, and it would not be the first time in this country when a great number of people would be brought before these special courts on whom sentence of death might be imposed, and a miscarriage of justice might occur in many cases if the sentence were carried out.  The tribunal that is to try these people in the first instance, is one specially set up for the purpose.  The House does not know, and has not the slightest information, as to what the personnel of the tribunal will be except that it will be composed of two military officers and a legal gentleman certified by the Attorney-General. They are nominated by the Executive Council.  I think that the highest tribunal in the land, that is, the Executive Council, who nominate this court and who might make a mistake as to the calibre of the men nominated, should be the people to revise the sentences passed in these courts. Had the amendment for setting up the judiciary as the people to try offences of this sort been passed, I would have moved for a judicial court of appeal. At least, I would make that the final court of appeal.  As that is not the case, I think the only way to meet this case at present is to have those who nominated the court in the first instance as the persons to revise the sentences, and, if necessary, to mitigate the penalties imposed by that court.  We are going through a trying time, not made easier by the introduction of this Bill.  It is quite conceivable that there may not be the necessity for this Bill that we are to-day led to believe is the case.  But assuming for a moment that there is a necessity and that many people will be brought before these courts, I can foresee a change of attitude, after the softening influences of time, to an atmosphere very different from the atmosphere we are in to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If numbers of men are to be sentenced to death for treason and murder&mdash;and there is no question as to what that sentence should be for those offences; it is the same in all countries in the world&mdash;I can imagine that time and, possibly, promises of good behaviour in the future, might alter the view of the Executive Council in dealing with these persons.  It would be too late for them to change their minds <Col N="1465" /> if the sentences had been carried out, as would be the case if there was no court of appeal or any method of revising and possibly mitigating the sentences. I think this is a reasonable amendment, and I would like to see it go through by agreement.  I would ask the President to accept the amendment in its present form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an inherent right in the Executive Council. In every case during the last four years in which a sentence of death has been passed, the Executive Council could consider and could mitigate the sentence, and that has been done in several cases.  Putting in this amendment does not give the power a second time; it is there already, and it is the duty of the Executive Council, in all these cases in which there is a sentence of death; very carefully to consider them.  There has not been any case, as I have said, since July, 1923, or even earlier than that, in which a sentence of death has been passed that the matter has not been considered by the Executive Council, and I think if the Deputy looks at the records he will find quite a number of commutations of sentences since that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>All that the President has said is no doubt true, but I do not think it entirely affects the desirability of having these words actually in the Bill.  It would give the Executive Council no more power, but it would make it plain to those who have to administer the Act.  No doubt the person versed in the law might realise the practice of the Executive Council, though I do not think it is a statutory practice.  It is a reversion of the power of pardon or commutation originally enjoyed by the Crown, but it is not statutory.  The two officers may not know of it, and there is a possibility that a court of this character, sitting in a remote part of the country, might carry out a sentence of death without referring it to the Executive Council. I believe that the officers who will sit in these courts, while they will not acquaint themselves with the whole body of statute law, will acquaint themselves with the Act under which they will be working, and it would be <Col N="1466" /> desirable to have words in the Act to make it clear that any sentence should be referred to the Executive Council for revision.</P>
      <P>There was, at an earlier stage in the evening, certain competition as to who knew most about courtsmartial.  I would say that the President knows them much more intimately, while I know them from another angle.  These courts will be in the nature of courtsmartial, but no British courtmartial can carry out a sentence without having that sentence confirmed, and between the pronouncement of the sentence and its confirmation there is a delay, which, in one case at any rate, has been very beneficial to this State. I think that there should be an opportunity for revision.  In the British Army Act it is definitely provided that the sentence must be confirmed, and not only that, but it provides, or did provide&mdash;I am afraid my edition of it is not very recent&mdash;that in the case of a courtmartial pronouncing a sentence in the Dominion of Canada or the Commonwealth of Australia, that sentence must not only be confirmed by the military officer who summoned the court but also by the Governor-General of that Commonwealth or Dominion, and the Governor-General of course would act on the advice of his Ministers.  The last Imperial Conference has secured a new status for the Governor-General.  That is a statutory provision in the British Army Act. Should we not have in the case of these exceptional courts a similar statutory provision so as to make it clear to every officer who acts in accordance with this measure that the sentence should not be carried out until it has been reviewed by the Executive Council?</P>
      <P>The British court-martial can only have one final act.  They can acquit, and the purpose of Deputy O'Hanlon's amendment is that sentence should be reviewed by the Executive Council, who have, after all, a fuller knowledge of the general situation of the country than two officers and a lawyer can possibly have.  I think that the acceptance of this amendment would remove very many, if not all, of these objections to these courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Two points have been urged by Deputy Cooper.  One is briefly that no sentence should be carried out until an opportunity for review is given.  The President has stated that no sentence will be carried out until the penalty has been reviewed by the Executive Council.  The second point is that this should be stated.  I think it should not be stated. If it is stated, the entire responsibility is going to be thrown back upon the Executive Council.  The whole objection urged in this House about any power being given to the Executive Council is based on the assumption that the Executive Council is mad, is going to do extraordinarily foolish things.  Is a court of officers more likely to pass a heavy sentence if it thinks the Executive is behind it to review, than if it believes it has the final say?  I suggest it is wrong to put down that the sentence should be subject to confirmation or mitigation by the Executive Council.  The Executive Council always has the privilege of exercising the prerogative of mercy.  It cannot be changed.  That remains unless it is taken out by words in an Act.  From the point of view of officers in a court it is better to leave them with the responsibility of believing that they decide the fate of certain people brought before them.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce stated that most of us who opposed this Bill have considered that the Executive Council are mad.  I never intended to refer such a matter as this to people who are mad.  It is stated that the prerogative of mercy rests with the Executive Council and remains with them.  That is all right dealing with ordinary law, but we are not dealing with ordinary law.  This Act is superior to the Constitution, to the ordinary law and the unwritten law, and is superior to custom.  What objection can there be to having it put down in black and white in this Act that the sentence is subject to review, to confirmation, if they like, to mitigation if they like?  I think in connection with the argument put forward by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that certain people think that the Executive Council are <Col N="1468" /> mad, this is the one thing to show that the Executive Council are not mad and are not out to have people sentenced to death by a tribunal which they themselves were responsible for setting up. It shows confidence in your own tribunal.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Cooper looks at the Bill I think he will see all through it that these courts are to carry out the ordinary criminal procedure.  Also the Central Criminal Court is referred to again and again.  I think he may take it the procedure laid down under Section 25 will be procedure closely modelled on the existing procedure in the Central Criminal Court.  What will happen in one of these courts will be that the sentence will be delivered by the trained lawyer who will preside over the court.  What happens in murder trials is this.  Sentence of death is passed and a date is fixed for the execution, and the date fixed for the execution is about three weeks after the sentence is passed.  The death sentence could not be passed by one of these courts and carried out the next day.  Who would carry it out? If there is to be an execution it will be an ordinary execution to be carried out by a hangman.  The sentence will be that a man is to be hanged by the neck until he is dead, and all the arrangements will have to be made by the Sheriff.  That will take three weeks, and you may be perfectly certain that that period must elapse before any death sentence will be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general question it does not seem to me to be of great importance whether this appears or does not, but there can be no doubt that the prerogative does exist, and that sentences can be annulled or lessened or altered.  The power existing is inherent.  The only objection I see to the insertion of these words in the Bill is, that it might be subsequently argued that because these words are inserted in this Bill it therefore  <Col N="1469" /> implies that the prerogative is being repealed.  Frankly, I do not think that would carry much weight.</P>

      <P>I would be convinced if the Minister for Industry and Commerce had not replied first.  He stated that of course the Executive Council had the prerogative of mercy and the second branch of his argument was that it was undesirable that the officers should know that their judgment could be over-ruled.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said that there could be no harm in making it clear that the final arbiter was the Executive Council.  The only other argument was that perhaps it was an unfair responsibility to impose on the Executive Council.  They have shouldered many responsibilities.  I do not think they will be unequal to shouldering this one.  I do not think the Minister intended to suggest that they could wish to devolve their responsibility on persons learned in the law.  I am certain that they are prepared to review those courts and that these words would not <Col N="1470" /> weaken the section.  In my view it is of considerable importance that officers who are the majority of the court should realise the scope of their position.  I urge the acceptance of the amendment.</P>

In sub-section (3) it is stated that every sentence order and judgment of a special court shall be subject to the same rules as those of the Central Criminal Court.  It is even more explicit than Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney explained to us.

      <P>I am not as much disposed, with all respect to my learned colleague, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, to take his view as to what may be intended by this Bill as Deputy Cooper appears to be.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney says that we may take it that the procedure will be the same as in the Central Criminal Court.  With all respect to the Deputy I will not take anything that I do not see in this Bill for granted because it is well known, and I am rather surprised that for the second time the suggestion should come from the same quarter to the contrary, that one is not entitled to read things into Bills that are not in the Bills.  The Minister, in supporting Deputy Kenney's suggestion, in answer to Deputy Cooper, said there was a likelihood of one legal member being President or Chairman of the Court. Are we legislating for likelihoods or are we legislating for acts that are to take place?  I think it is time that this kind of talk about what you may take will be done, and the likelihood of certain contingencies arising, should cease.  These are actual matters of life and death because the courts will have the question of conviction on a charge on which conviction would carry sentence of death.  Are these matters to be treated as if we may take it something will be done or that there is a likelihood of something else taking <Col N="1471" /> place?  I am not disposed to take either of the assumptions, whether that of the Minister or that of his supporter, upon these matters, and I think, we should not be satisfied, unless it is put in clear and explicit terms into the Bill, as to what will take place when it becomes an Act.  In regard to the particular amendments the Minister has said, very rightly, that the prerogative of mercy rests with the Executive Council.  That is so, but with all respect it is quite a different thing from making the operation of the discretion, let me put it, mandatory.  I am not suggesting that the Executive Council must exercise the prerogative of mercy.  What I am suggesting is that there must be an affirmation of the sentence.  It is quite a different thing to say that the Executive Council have an inherent right or power of mercy.  It is quite another thing to say that before sentence is carried out that sentence must be concurred in by the Executive Council, and that is, so far as I understand the British military law, the system in vogue there.</P>
      <P>As stated by Deputy Cooper, it is not merely a right of revision only that the military have, but there is an actual operation of that power of revision whether by confirmation or by reduction which is performed by the authority there.  From what I can gather that seems to be, if I interpret Deputy O'Hanlon's proposal correctly, his idea.  Not that there shall be created a right which undoubtedly does exist, but that this right shall be used as a power of revision, and that no sentence shall be carried out unless it has been confirmed by the Executive Council.  That is what I think to be the real usefulness and the purpose of the amendment, and in pressing this, which is confined to the death sentence, the Deputy has suggested some means whereby there shall, of necessity, be given to a body other than the actual court which convicted the power of revision which as far as I understand this amendment should in every case be exercised.</P>

I said nothing further than that.  The Deputy proceeded to argue on the basis of what was going to happen.  I leave the matter to the House to judge between us.  We come now to the further point of confirmation.  The Deputy has for the seventh or eighth time brought in what happens under British military law.  We are not dealing with British military or Irish military law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with the law laid down in this section which is going to be the law quite soon. If the Deputy wants Irish military law we can give it to him, and that provides for confirmation.  It seems he is ignorant of the fact that there is Irish military law.  The Deputy is a practising barrister and would be certified by the Attorney-General as having legal knowledge; but he does not know that.  Why bring in all this talk about English military law?  If Deputy O'Hanlon is going to press this amendment I suggest that he should make a change if he accepts Deputy Redmond's argument.  Deputy Redmond thinks some court other than the court that passes sentence should have the right of confirmation, but apparently he does not make the distinction that some body other than the confirming body should have the right of confirming the sentence thereafter.  Is it reasonable to ask the same body to confirm a sentence and to exercise the prerogative of mercy?  If we are to have both to do the same thing and if that body is the Executive Council, it seems to me that at this hour, ten minutes to one in the morning, wisdom has struck some people rather late. Is it suggested that the Executive Council should be the body to confirm a sentence passed by a tribunal of its own creation, and should thereafter sit down as the same Executive Council to exercise the prerogative of mercy? Does Deputy Cooper not consider that a body of officers set up as a tribunal to adjudicate on matters of life and death, are going to be made shoulder their responsibilities better by having it declared <Col N="1474" /> to them that they are really the last thing in the way of saying that is the sentence for the offence, and leaving it in the ordinary way to come before the Executive Council.  If anyone says that the prerogative of mercy is affected by this Act then a new situation has arisen, and we can have that examined, but no one suggests that anything takes away the prerogative of mercy from the Executive Council even for special courts.  If Deputy O'Hanlon sees any virtue in putting in such words into a statute, I ask him to consider the advisability of getting some confirming authority other than the body that is to proceed thereafter to mitigate the sentences.  Sub-section (6) deals with certain consequences that will follow upon the judgment of the special court similarly to those that will follow upon the judgment of the Central Criminal Court.  It is one of the ordinary pitfalls of law, that where you put in a seemingly innocent statement it may have consequences far beyond what you intend.  I put it to the Deputy if he agrees that the prerogative of mercy is not defeated by anything in the Bill, it adds nothing with regard to mitigation, though it might add something by way of confirmation.  Is there any virtue in having the Executive Council to decide, when the same Executive Council must proceed, not to confirm the sentence or not to refuse confirmation, but to mitigate it to nothing?  Does the Deputy gain anything by that?  Will he admit that there may be some consequence beyond what he thinks may follow from the insertion of this phrase?  If he is determined to press this matter he must consider a confirming authority of a different type from the Executive Council.  Is the Executive Council going to appoint a special tribunal to try people, and immediately afterwards going to proceed to mitigate the sentence?</P>

      <P>If I were satisfied that this question of the prerogative of mercy were in the Bill, written or unwritten, I would agree that the word &ldquo;mitigate&rdquo; should be taken out of my amendment but I would not agree to withdrawing the word &ldquo;confirmation.&rdquo; This Act when passed will stand upon <Col N="1475" /> its own legs, independent of other statutes passed in this country, or in any other.  It stands independent of custom and law and I cannot see, for the life of me, what objection there can be to agreeing to this confirmation or mitigation of the sentences passed by these courts.  Offenders brought before these courts may get a hasty trial.  In fact I think it was mentioned that these things were done quickly.  They may get a hasty trial, and a hasty sentence and they may get a hasty execution. It is to avoid these things that I have brought forward this amendment. Nothing was more foreign to my mind than to place more responsibility upon the shoulders of the Executive Council. I go further and say that the object of putting in this amendment is to relieve the Executive Council from some of the odium that this Bill has incurred already and to give them power afterwards in calmer moments to revise what it has done.  There will not be merely one tribunal, there will be many of them up and down the country. There may be many men sentenced to death by them and I believe that the Executive Council would be very glad to have the power of mitigating such sentences if they were passed.</P>
      <P>I hope that if such a thing does happen no man will be sentenced under it.  I believe too that the Executive Council would mitigate the sentence. Deputy Thrift has raised a point about sub-section (3).  Sub-section (3) does not meet my case at all.  If you read down sub-section (5) that does not follow the procedure of the Central Criminal Court.  There is an appeal from the Central Criminal Court.  Here it distinctly specifies that there is no appeal.  We have dealt with boys up to 16 years of age, but boys of 16½ years of age may come under these courts and be executed.  Why?  Because some older people may put guns into their hands and tell them to shoot somebody.  I say if a case of that sort is not a proper one to bring before the Executive Council for confirmation or mitigation of sentence then I do not know what justice is.  I cannot retreat from this amendment and must put it to a division.</P>

The Deputy says if he could be convinced that the prerogative of mercy still existed the question of mitigation might be left out.  How am I to convince the Deputy? I have asked for evidence to the contrary that anything that takes away the prerogative of mercy should be shown, but nobody has attempted to show it.  We can, at any rate, leave it until we get some information going to show that the prerogative of mercy has disappeared in some way under the provisions of this section.  As regards confirmation, we could consider the question of confirmation not by the Executive Council but by somebody else.  As long as the Executive Council has the prerogative of mercy, and I hold it still has it, the matter of confirmation and mitigation should not be with the same people.  I can promise the Deputy to have that matter considered between this and the Report Stage.  That is, the question of some confirming authority, but that confirming authority not to be the Executive Council.</P>

There is the possibility of an appeal, and then there is the prerogative of mercy.  In the case of a trial by a military court, whether English or Irish, there are two safeguards: there is the necessary confirmation, and then there is still the prerogative of mercy. In this case there is only at present the prerogative of mercy.  If the Minister could find a way out I do not think Deputy O'Hanlon would insist on the Executive Council being the authority.

      <P>I move amendment 54 in sub-section (4), line 7, &ldquo;to delete the words `save as is hereinafter provided,' &rdquo; and amendment 55, to delete sub-section (5).  Then sub-section 4 would read:&mdash;&ldquo;Every conviction, sentence, order and judgment of a special court shall have the like consequences in law as a like conviction, sentence, order and judgment of the Central Criminal Court would have,&rdquo; and so on.  The object in moving to delete these words is that there shall be an appeal from this court as there is from the Central Criminal Court, and in conjunction I am moving to delete sub-section (5).  The result of the two amendments would be that there would be an appeal from this special court as there is from the Central Criminal Court.  Of course, I put down these amendments at the same time as I put down the amendment which has been defeated, providing that the court should consist of judges, not of military officers.  The position now is somewhat altered.  At the same time, having the assurance of the Minister that on the Report Stage he will endeavour to provide some form of confirmation by another court or another body in the case of sentence of death, I am not <Col N="1478" /> moving these amendments so much in regard to that as in regard to the various other offences, the charges for which will be tried before this court and the sentences passed.</P>
      <P>The offences have already been alluded to.  They are offences, including misdemeanours, and various penalties attach to them throughout this Bill. There should be, in my view, some form of appeal, review, remission or confirmation of these sentences, just as has been suggested in regard to the sentence of death.  In fact I would go further and say in regard to the sentences for these minor offences there should be some form of appeal.  If these words are omitted there would be the form of appeal which is permitted from the Central Criminal Court, and that is not altogether a very wide form of appeal.  There have to be special grounds and leave has to be granted for that appeal, and the Court of Appeal has to be satisfied that the grounds are justifiable before they grant leave to appeal.  It is not altogether the same form of appeal as there would be from a lower court.  Therefore, I do not think it would be a very great stretch of leniency to ask for this particular form of appeal in regard to these particular offences.  Of course, there are two distinct forms of offence, one carrying the death penalty and the other not. I would like to hear what the Minister has to say in regard to these two classes and whether he would consider the wisdom and advisability of having some form of appeal such as I have suggested, especially in regard to the minor offences.</P>

      <P>The promise of some amendment to meet Deputy O'Hanlon under the previous amendment is, in <Col N="1479" /> effect, a promise to consider whether anything less than a death sentence should follow a verdict of guilty in respect of treason or murder.  The proposition here, as I understand it, is really a different one.  It is not merely to say whether a sentence of death should inevitably follow a verdict of guilty in a treason case or a murder case, but as to whether the circumstances surrounding a less heinous offence than treason or murder would warrant the sentence that is being imposed by the special court.  Surely there is more reason for appeal from the military court in such a case.  If the special court is qualified to decide a question of fact as to murder or treason, then the question of penalty is a very different one from these other cases. There are maximum penalties in the other cases, and a discretion is left to the court, and presumably they will take into account the circumstances surrounding the guilt.  If there is that discretion in the less heinous offences than murder or treason, surely there is all the more reason why there should be an appeal from such a court where they have perchance inflicted the maximum penalty.  If the court is competent to deal with the question of fact in relation to the capital offences, then the criminal law is altered completely if there is an appeal court.  No doubt, as has been pointed out, the prerogative of mercy remains.  But here you have an entirely different set of circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The penalty ranges from anything from one week up to death in the case of firearms.  Anything from one week up to death is a discretion.  Surely there is a case where some discretion might be allowed, or some court of appeal. A less sentence than death might be inflicted by the court.  Twenty years' penal servitude might be inflicted.  The circumstances should be reviewable by some authority above this court as to whether a sentence of 20 years is war ranted.  Quite apart from the question of carrying firearms, in regard to which I am quite willing to admit the case that is made, that in these circumstances it is equivalent to an attempt at murder or practically to murder, there <Col N="1480" /> are very many much less serious offences. A person who is found guilty of being a member of an unlawful association is liable to five years' penal servitude. That is a case, surely, where there ought to be a higher tribunal to decide whether the circumstances justify the five years' sentence or not.  I think the promise that was made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in respect to death sentences has no relation at all to the proposal in the amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not know if I understood Deputy Redmond aright.  I gathered from him that in the matter of confirmation and mitigation, in the sense that the prerogative of mercy would apply to a sentence other than death, he would not be disposed to press this matter of an appeal.  If that is so, the undertaking that I gave already with regard to the confirming authority can be made to apply to all sentences passed by special courts.</P>

      <P>I must admit that these are now courts composed of military officers.  They are not in any sense ordinary courts, they are not even civilian courts and I would be disposed still to suggest that there should be an actual appeal from these courts, especially in view of the wording of sub-section (4), which would tend to suggest, were it not for these words &ldquo;save as hereinafter provided,&rdquo; that the whole law in regard to the sentences of these courts should be the same as in regard to the Central Criminal Court.  We had it quite recently from Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney&mdash;he informed us very gratuitously and kindly&mdash;that we might take it that the procedure and practice were to be the same as in the Central Criminal Court.  Is it too much to suggest that there might be a similar appeal?  The Minister has, I think, said that he would propose that there would be set up some body other than the Executive Council which would have the power of confirmation and mitigation.</P>

      <P>Rather it would have the power of confirmation without mitigation.  Certainly that is some advance on the position as it is in the Bill, and I suppose I should be grateful for small mercies.  But it does not go quite as far as I should desire.  However, in the circumstances, I think that the best thing for me to do is to hold over these amendments until the Report Stage and then I would be able to judge the nature of the Minister's proposal.</P>

      <P>Before passing I would like to ask Deputy Redmond or any other Deputy who could help whether this proposed power of confirmation which is probably taken from the parallel case of a court-martial means anything more than confirming. Supposing the higher authority does not confirm, what is the effect?  I think I have heard it stated that the effect of a refusal to confirm is &ldquo;not guilty.&rdquo;  I am not sure whether that is correct or not but I do not think it is right to say if the higher authority does not confirm it may mitigate. That presumably is intended to be a matter for another authority or the Executive Council in this case.  Am I to understand then that the procedure would be if the higher authority is not prepared to confirm, that the case will not go back to the original court, but that the authority's comments would appear before the Executive Council and be taken into account when the question of mitigation arises.  I do not understand exactly what is to happen if the sentence is not confirmed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

      <P>The two Deputies who have spoken on these amendments have stressed the point of review of sentence.  I should like to call attention to the other point of review of conviction, <Col N="1482" /> which is a very different thing. The power of that review would be completely taken away by this section. Of the two reviews it seems to me that the review of conviction is a far more important one because the question of innocence is involved.  Surely the question of the review of sentence which is a matter of degree of guilt is of less importance than the question of the possibility of conviction of the innocent.  Sub-section (5) would completely take away that possibility of review and for that reason if Deputy Redmond sees his way to withdraw the amendment which stands in our two names I do not think that I can follow him.</P>

The amendments, no doubt, will be prepared and distributed to Deputies in due time for them to consider the new Bill as amended, or as it will be amended when the Committee Stage amendments have been inserted, and it is requested that there should be time to consider the new Bill.

      <P>I support the amendment principally because of a good deal of abuse which I have got from a good many members on the opposite benches owing to keeping them from the Horse Show.

      <P>That is the Minister's point of view.  Members of this House have certain rights as well as duties and responsibilities, and if they think it is desirable to move certain amendments on the Report Stage of the measure they are entitled to do so, and entitled to get time in which to consider the amendments.  I suggest it is most unreasonable that we should be expected to take the Report Stage of this measure at 11 o'clock.  It seems to me to be holding up the big stick to members of the House.  You have either to give this Bill a free passage, to refrain from criticising the Bill, from making amendments or challenging divisions, or else we will insist on your sitting continually until the Bill passes.  That is the choice we have got from the opposite benches.  I do not care if you sit all night to-morrow night again, and the night after, but I do not think we ought to approach the measure in that spirit.  We ought to realise the seriousness of it, and give members opportunities to put down amendments.  I suggest if Deputies want to move amendments, and are told by the President &ldquo;you have got to get them in now,&rdquo; that is not dealing with the matter seriously.  I think the amendment moved by Deputy Johnson is a very reasonable one, as I think the motion made by the President is an unreasonable one.</P>

I should like to know whether it is the state of Ireland that we have all visualised. Is it the State of Collins and Griffith, or is it the State of Birkenhead? I think they would want longer than eleven o'clock to-day to explain it.  I suggest that they defer the taking of this Bill until next Tuesday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made reference to the position of Commissioners or the substitute, Commissioner for Oaths, in the case of an absent Deputy, but it does not seem to me that that makes very much difference in the case of a Deputy who is absent and does not bring him within the reasonable possibility of being nominated as a candidate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time of the Second Reading the Minister for Agriculture said it was a very simple matter to make provision <Col N="1498" /> for a person who was outside the country to be nominated as a candidate for the Dáil or Seanad.  I have not been able to see how that can be done easily, or even with difficulty, and maintain the present scheme of the Bill.  I think the question to be answered is whether it is desirable that we should enable persons who at the time of election, either a general election or a by-election, are not in the country, or easily available between the time of the declaration of a vacancy and the time of election, to fill that vacancy.  I think if we make up our minds that it is desirable that a person who is away from the country during that time should be enabled to become a candidate we have to consider whether the proposition in the Bill will enable that to be done.  I cannot see how such a person can become a candidate if he is any distance away from the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>During the previous reading I think I instanced the case of Deputy Bryan Cooper and ex-Deputy Esmonde who last year were away in Australia. They left Ireland and I think were away for about five months.  They left Ireland at a time when there was quite a possibility&mdash;I will not say a great probability&mdash;that an election might take place during the time of their absence.  I ask the Dáil to consider the position of either of those Deputies or any other Deputy in similar circumstances at the time of election.  They could not be nominated under this section because they would have to get an affidavit and have it presented to the returning officer before their nomination would be valid, and that is impossible.  In fact one need not be in the Pacific Ocean but a very much shorter distance away from this country to make it difficult if not impossible for him to be nominated.  You have declared vacancies for two constituencies in the county and city of Dublin.  Conceivably a person not expecting a vacancy to be declared is away let us say on the continent of Europe.  How is that person going to be approached to get an affidavit or is it intended that you shall make it impossible for such a person to be nominated.  That is the <Col N="1499" /> effect of this section.  I shall be quite glad to hear from the Minister that I am wrong and that it is possible for such person to become nominated in some other way than by making an affidavit and lodging it before the returning officer in time for the election.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy has quoted me quite correctly.  On the Second Reading of this Bill, Deputy Johnson made the point which he has just made now.  He asked how were Deputies who were outside the country to get nominated.  My answer to that was not, I think, that it was easy to provide for these difficulties. I do not think I entered into the merits of the case at all, but I stated that so far as there were any difficulties it was essentially a Committee point. I did not express any views upon the merits of the point.  I confined myself to saying that the Deputy's point did not go to the principle of the Bill, that it was essentially a Committee point.  I did not say that there was any easy method of dealing with it.  Supposing this Bill, with that amendment, passes, every Deputy or prospective Deputy must be expected to know that an affidavit must be handed in before nomination, and any Deputy or prospective Deputy should provide against any possibility of a General Election before going on one of these long journeys.</P>

      <P>Perhaps Deputy Johnson will admit that there is a certain radius inside of which the amendment proposed to Section 1 would be a help&mdash;to a person in Great Britain, France, or Spain.  He will have a second string to his bow in Amendment 6, which is an amendment to the Schedule.  An affidavit can be made at any time before an election, so that a Deputy going to Australia on any particular work, can leave with his election agent an affidavit duly made, which could be presented to the Returning Officer on his behalf.</P>

      <P>I spoke on the introduction of this measure and disapproved of the prudence of introducing it now.  I left the matter at that. But I would like to know from the Minister if we are not very well wasting time in debating this measure.  A distinguished Irishman said at one time that you could drive a coach and four through any Act of Parliament.  It struck me in looking over this measure that there never was a measure through which it was so easy to drive a coach and four and a tandem as this one. There is no doubt, and it is useless to conceal it, that this measure is aimed at a certain political party.  What effect is this measure going to have on them? Is it going to prevent them making that declaration?  They have in the past complied with the provisions of the Electoral Acts up to a point, and they can comply with the provisions of this measure and yet not take their seats, This measure is not going to solve the problem.  The supporters of these people are not going to run away because they do not take their seats.  The outcome will be that the bitter partisan struggle that is going on in this country will be continued.  To my mind this measure is merely a waste of paper, more so than any other enactment that has been introduced.</P>

      <P>I am in agreement with Deputy Johnson.  I think there are possibilities that an individual whom people might want to go forward as a candidate, not an individual who himself might want to go forward, might be prevented from doing so.  A representative in the Dáil or Seanad would take the precautions the Minister speaks of.  He would leave an affidavit behind.  Perhaps he would leave it behind him for twelve months. But the other type of man, who might be a much more desirable type, might have gone out of the country.  He might get an invitation from a constituency <Col N="1501" /> to stand as candidate and he might be so far away that he could not make an affidavit and forward it in time.  Sub-section (2) states: &ldquo;The affidavit required by this section shall be delivered by the candidate or his seconder on his behalf.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not know if the affidavit could be handed in on behalf of the candidate in time, but as Deputy O'Brien says, it would not be possible to find a solution, because we cannot at the moment visualise a position arising where suitable candidates might not be in the country and might not make this affidavit.  After all, this is going to be an Act that is to stand and, like Deputy McMenamin, I am convinced that this Act is not going to solve the problem.  Accordingly, this problem will be with us for a considerable time. We will have to guard as far as possible against the possibility of the disadvantages under which prospective candidates might labour, because by accident or for some other reason a desirable candidate might be so far away from his base that he could not possibly have an affidavit made by him delivered in time.  If there is any possibility of that happening we should guard against it in this section.  I am not prepared to say how exactly that might be done, but I think if a reputable citizen were prepared to come forward and make an affidavit on behalf of the candidate, or his proposer or seconder were to come forward, it might easily be considered.  There is the other suggestion of Deputy O'Brien that if a proposer or seconder were prepared to enter into a bond that the candidate going forward was prepared to comply with this Bill, there should be no objection to having such a provision inserted.  Both positions would be amply safeguarded then.</P>

      <P>I do not think the situation Deputy Baxter fears is likely to arise once in twenty years.  Candidates who are away out of the country, who are not going to return for some time after the issue of the writ, who have not been mentioned and who were not thought of as candidates before, are <Col N="1502" /> not likely to be selected.  The position of a man being selected as candidate who has never even been mentioned before is not likely to arise, and we are asked really to provide for a contingency, the occurrence of which, if it happens, will be very rare, so rare that it will not constitute a problem that requires to be provided for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is making too little of this disability. It is quite against the spirit of freedom and the equality of citizen-rights that we are supposed to have safeguarded. He says that not once in twenty years is this likely to happen. That is a prophecy I cannot deal with. I think with the development of travel it is going to happen very much oftener than that, and it is not an easy thing to be sure of getting a message away, even to parts of Spain that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health spoke of.  It is not very far away but one would scarcely be back again in a fortnight.  A fortnight is not the maximum period, I think, which might be required.  The Minister for Finance suggests that it is only those people who have foreseen the likelihood of their being candidates who have to be considered as likely candidates. This proposition is placing a disability upon citizens who may desire to become candidates in a particular constituency in particular circumstances. I think we should not place that disability upon any person. What is said in regard to candidates for the Dáil is equally valid in respect of candidates for the Seanad, and this is a disability which is entirely against the intentions of the Constitution which provided that there should be freedom and equality in those matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I agree that the law may impose disabilities, those disabilities are usually in the nature of a penalty or an obstacle placed upon certain people who cannot serve in two capacities with satisfaction to the country, but there is neither a penalty intended for any offence nor any disability imposed because of being unable to perform the duties satisfactorily or without prejudice to the State's interest.  Neither of those conditions applies.  I am <Col N="1503" /> speaking now of the disability respecting civil servants or soldiers, but in all other cases there should be a fairly general, in fact, a completely general, equality of rights of citizens to membership of the Dáil.  Here an accidental or temporary absence from the country is going to be placed as a barrier against one of the important rights of citizenship.  I frankly admit I see no way out.  Deputy O'Brien makes a suggestion if it is satisfactory.  It would probably meet 999 cases out of 1,000, but it is always possible that the bond would be forfeited.  I am sure it would be a practical, effective method of arriving at what the Ministers desire.  Certainly the proposition in this section is going to bar out people who have a right to become candidates for the Dáil.</P>

      <P>It must be remembered that the Bill was introduced for a particular purpose&mdash;the safeguarding of our institutions here, of the Dáil and of the Seanad, in particular circumstances.  Full consideration <Col N="1504" /> was given by the Executive Council to how the particular difficulties mentioned by Deputy Johnson and Deputy O'Brien might be overcome. It was considered whether a particular form of statement by a proposer or seconder and a bond might be allowed, but the decision was come to that in view of the particular circumstances that the Bill was called upon to meet we were allowing a sufficient opening for such cases as have been mentioned by providing that the necessary affidavit could be made outside the country in particular circumstances and by providing a form of affidavit of a nature, that the person who did intend to become a candidate for the Dáil or Seanad and who was leaving the country could take as a necessary precaution to ensure that his nomination would be in order.  Amendments No. 1 and No. 6 were the only amendments that we were prepared to suggest in the Bill in order to meet the cases spoken about.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-sections (1) and (2) and substitute three new sub-sections as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  No person shall be nominated by Dáil Eireann for inclusion in a panel of candidates for a triennial election to Seanad Eireann unless, within such period prior to such nomination and in such manner as shall be prescribed by Dáil Eireann, such person or a member of Dáil Eireann who has taken his seat therein has delivered to the Clerk of the Dáil an affidavit in the form set out in the Schedule to this Act duly sworn by such person in the presence of a Commissioner for Oaths or a Peace Commissioner to whom he is personally known.</P>
      <P>(2)  No person shall be nominated by Seanad Eireann for inclusion in a panel of candidates for a triennial election to Seanad Eireann unless, within such period prior to such nomination and in such manner as shall be prescribed by Seanad Eireann, such person or a member of Seanad Eireann who has taken his seat therein has delivered to the Clerk of the Seanad an affidavit in the form set out in the Schedule to this Act duly sworn by such person in the presence of a Commissioner for Oaths or a Peace Commissioner to whom he is personally known.</P>
      <P>(3)  No person shall be elected at a by-election to be a member of Seanad Eireann unless, within such period prior to such election and in such manner as shall be prescribed by Seanad Eireann, such person or a member of Seanad Eireann who has taken his seat therein has delivered to the Clerk of the Seanad an affidavit in the form set out in the Schedule to this Act duly sworn by such person in the presence of a Commissioner for Oaths or a Peace Commissioner to whom he is personally known.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section as it stands at present requires that every candidate for election to Seanad Eireann shall deliver to the Clerk of the Seanad an affidavit, and that, failing delivery of that affidavit, his name cannot be put on the Seanad panel.  The Seanad panel is constituted of a certain number of persons nominated partly by the Dáil <Col N="1507" /> and partly by the Seanad, and the amendment is intended to obviate a situation in which the Clerk of the Seanad might find himself unable to put on the Seanad panel a person who had been nominated by the Dáil or by the Seanad because of his failure to deliver to the Clerk the necessary affidavit.  The amendment requires that before a person can be nominated by either the Dáil or the Seanad to the Seanad panel there shall be delivered to the Clerk of the Dáil or the Clerk of the Seanad respectively the necessary affidavit.</P>
    <P>Article 33 (b) of the Constitution deals with persons who are entitled to be on the Seanad panel, that is persons who have at any time been members of Seanad Eireann and who notify to the President of the Executive Council that they desire to be included in the panel. These people have an intrinsic right from the Constitution to go on the panel, and in view of the fact that they have already been members of the Seanad, it would require an amendment of the Constitution to keep them off the panel in the absence of an affidavit.  People who are so entitled to go on the Seanad panel are not being required to provide an affidavit in the same way as a person who had not been a member of the Seanad and was not being put on the Seanad panel by virtue of Article 33 (b) of the Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite interesting to hear the Minister explain why special privileges should be given to members of the Seanad as compared with members of the Dáil. A person who has been a member of the Dáil and has taken his seat in the normal course, and goes up for re-election is obliged to follow the course set out in Section 2. But if a person has been a member of the Seanad he is excused from that obligation under this proposal because, forsooth, it seems to run across a section of the Constitution.  We have been hearing for some time that the Constitution should not stand in the way of any change in the law.  It has been treated lightly enough in other matters, and it is rather surprising that the <Col N="1508" /> Minister should come along now and say we must take particular notice of this section of the Constitution because, presumably, it deals with members of the Seanad, that it affects their interests and they would not agree to have those interests touched by a proposition from the Dáil.  Sub-section (3) of the amended section again gives a special privilege to the Seanad over and above the Dáil inasmuch as it will allow the Seanad to prescribe its own period within which the affidavit may be lodged.  It may say twelve months so as to allow a foreign traveller an opportunity of returning.  But the Dáil has no such privilege.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Supposing the Seanad does not take that view; supposing the Seanad does take the view that it has taken in the recent past and makes the election of a Senator follow very quickly upon the vacancy, how is the eligible person to have his opportunity to be elected? There is not even the fortnight or three weeks&mdash;that is the period in which in normal times a candidate for the Dáil can have an opportunity of having this affidavit and being sent forward. But in the case of a vacancy in the Seanad by death, and a by-election takes place there is a very quick election sometimes, and sometimes not quite so quick.  But it is usually a comparatively short time from the declaration of the vacancy to the election of a successor.  The class of person who is supposed by many people to be indicated in the constitutional provision regarding the membership of the Seanad is the class of person who would be likely to be travelling abroad. You are clearly setting a barrier there, unless the Seanad is going to make special provision under its own regulations, that &ldquo;no person shall be nominated by Seanad Eireann...unless within such period prior to such nomination and in such manner as shall be prescribed by Seanad Eireann such person or a member of Seanad Eireann...has delivered to the Clerk of the Seanad an affidavit.&rdquo;  So that the Seanad has power to make this period as long as it wishes by resolution.  If it does not take advantage of that privilege, then persons are going to be mulcted and prevented, from exercising these <Col N="1509" /> citizen-rights, just as in the case of the Dáil electors.  Again I think that provision is a bad one, and I shall vote against the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is acting unwisely, when putting this Bill through at all, in discriminating between probable candidates for the Dáil and Seanad.  If a disability is to be placed in the way of any candidate for either the Dáil or Seanad, while it might be true that the candidate for election in the Seanad might be a type with whom there might be less trouble with regard to subscribing to the Articles of the Constitution, yet the knowledge of that fact does not justify us in placing such a candidate in what might be looked upon as a more favourable position than that of a candidate for the Dáil.  The same treatment should be meted out in both cases.  If there are to be barriers placed in the way, the same barriers should be placed in the case of a candidate for the Seanad as for the Dáil.  I do not think it is justifiable that the Dáil should be asked to treat the candidate for the Seanad in a different manner from that in which the candidate for this House is treated.</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
    <P>(1)  The oath shall be taken by every member of the Oireachtas elected thereto after the passing of this Act within whichever of the following times is the longer, that is to say:&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw attention to the effect of this section.  The period that is given, two months, appears to me to be unreasonably short. the section provides: &ldquo;The oath shall be taken by every member of the Oireachtas elected thereto after the passing of this Act within whichever of the following times is the longer&rdquo;&mdash; two months after his election or one month after the first day on which the House of which he is a member sits after his election to be a member thereof.  There is a provision later which allows the House to which the member belongs to make extensions of the period, which shall not exceed in the aggregate six months.  Supposing the House does not make any such extension, that member who actually intends to take his seat, who has no objection to taking this oath or any other oath, may be taken ill.  The illness is thought to be temporary, one that would be over in a week or two, but it extends, and he may be quite unable to take the oath.  He may in fact be out of the country, he may be in England, and the House of which he is a member may not be sitting part of the time.  The position of that person, who is required to take his seat within two months, is that he may easily be precluded from doing so by this penalty and, if so precluded, the penalty is that for five years afterwards he is disqualified from membership. That may happen no matter how willing he may be to take the oath.  I am instancing a case that may clearly arise.  In fixing the period of two <Col N="1513" /> months the Dáil is making the period entirely too short; it should be six months.  That would make it almost certain that the House would be sitting at some time in that period, and it would allow the person concerned to know, at least, the likely length of his sickness.  Two months does not give him that opportunity.  This section may well be an injustice to people who are acting in perfectly good faith, who have an intention of taking the oath and of carrying out the requirements of the Constitution.</P>

I think it would be better to put into the section a longer period and so avoid what will have to be done in the next section, should the successful candidate fail to put in an appearance within the specified time.  I have in mind at the moment a man who was a candidate at the last election, two months ago.  I am aware that that candidate was then ill.  He is yet ill, so that even if he had succeeded he would be unable to come to this House and subscribe to this Article of the Constitution. The procedure would then be that we would have to go into a discussion as to why this candidate did not put in an appearance and ask the House to pass a resolution extending the time.  I do not think that is a desirable course to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Bill would be weakened by extending the period from two months to six months.  If a man is elected in perfectly good faith to come and take a seat in this House he should be given that opportunity.  I think that it is not the kind of thing that the candidate would desire himself, nor is it the kind of thing that the House should be asked to do, to pass a resolution extending the period in which the candidate might subscribe to the particular Article of the Constitution, when possibly every member of the House, and outside it, knew that the only thing preventing this man coming forward was the fact that he was ill.  On the other hand, if you are thinking of dealing with the people who are outside now, and whom we might anticipate would be prepared to come <Col N="1514" /> forward and make the required declaration, which declaration they were not prepared to act up to, I do not see, even in dealing with them, that it might not perhaps be an advisable thing to give them longer than two months.  If this Bill had been in operation, Deputy Belton, for instance, would only have escaped.  We do not know what may yet happen in the next four months. I think in all the circumstances, the Minister would be well advised to reconsider this particular section.  By extending the time he will save the House from a rather delicate situation at a later period.</P>

      <P>As far as the last matter that Deputy Baxter refers to is concerned, there is certainly full and complete notice for any party or individual, and further notice is not required.  In the case of a person in normal circumstances and health after election to the Dáil two months is not too short a period in which to ask him to come and fulfil his obligations with regard to taking the oath.  Where there is a case of illness, Section 5 makes ample provision for extension being granted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A member of the Oireachtas may be seriously ill for longer than six months, but if sick longer than six months he shall thereby become disqualified from becoming a fully effective member of the Dáil.  That, to my mind, is quite unreasonable.  There is nothing to justify that whatever.  Surely the Dáil and Seanad are to be trusted to make extensions in respect to their members' sickness as often as they think necessary. If the future Dáil is not concerned whether people take their seats or not, why should we tie them up like this?  You say in this Bill that no person should be allowed to be a member of the Dáil unless he has taken his seat within six months and that even sickness will not be an excuse.  Supposing this Dáil thinks that way, are we entitled, in all reason, to lay a similar obligation upon succeeding Dála, that they may not have the opportunity to make extension in respect to any individual, no matter what doctor's certificate may be submitted?  The effect of my amendment is to allow the Dáil or the Seanad in the future to be masters of their own membership so far as this matter is concerned.  Even if they decide that they are not going to disqualify, it can only be on account of sickness; on account of unavoidable absence or illness.  The Dáil must be satisfied and the Seanad must be satisfied that the person is prevented from attending by illness or unavoidable absence.  These Houses should be capable of repeating that leave of absence owing to sickness or some other unavoidable cause, just as often <Col N="1516" /> as they are convinced it is necessary. We should not seek to tie up the discretion of future Dála.</P>

      <P>I can visualise a successful candidate suffering from illness that might necessitate the candidate leaving the country.  It is customary for many of our people to go to Switzerland for treatment for a particular complaint.  That treatment is dependent on the person being able to remain in that climate for a certain rather lengthy period.  As Deputy Johnson points out, surely the power should be left to the Dáil itself to declare whether or not the period should be extended.  After all, I cannot imagine the Dáil agreeing to an extension of the period unless there is good and sufficient reason.</P>

      <P>There appears to be two questions raised in this amendment. The first is: should there be any time limit, and the second is, if there is a time limit what should that be?  I think there should be some time limit, but I am not sure that a time limit of six months is reasonable.  You might have a case where a Minister for Defence is ill and has not been able to take the oath within two months of his election. He might have to go away and convalesce and exceed the six months limit.  I think a longer period is needed, and I hope Ministers may make that concession so that the extreme limit should be a year or eighteen months.  I think there must be some time limit.  You might let a Deputy run on indefinitely saying &ldquo;I have lots of time and I will take my seat some time.&rdquo;  I think Ministers might, before the Report Stage in about eight hours' time, reconsider the exact limit there is to be.</P>

      <P>I would like to support what has been said, and I can cite an actual case that happened here.  Ex-Deputy McCurtain was prevented for three years from taking his seat.  That was a perfectly genuine case, and the situation in respect of the payment of members' expenses was met in a particular way when the Ceann Comhairle issued his certificate.  I suggest that that would strengthen the case very much.  It is inconceivable that any <Col N="1517" /> case would come under consideration except a perfectly genuine one.  Here is a case in which a Deputy was prevented from taking his seat for a period of three years.</P>

      <P>I expect a case like that of ex-Deputy McCurtain is not going to occur again.  The fact that it did occur does really open the point where Deputy Johnson suggested a completely open period.  It might be more advisable than a period of even twelve or eighteen months.  I would be inclined to bring up an amendment on this point on Report; but, perhaps, it might be better to end the matter by accepting Deputy Johnson's amendment now.</P>

    <P>I put this amendment down as a continuation of certain remarks made in the Second Reading debate.  At the same time I regard it as of a tentative character and as an attempt to express what I wish.  It served the purpose of bringing the matter up for review and having a definite decision arrived at in connection with it.  There are two points I want to clear up.  One is that this new law shall definitely apply to the next general election and the other is to secure that it shall not apply to what I might call the near and immediate future.  I tried to draft an <Col N="1518" /> amendment of an alternative character that would satisfy these two points but I was not successful in satisfying myself and I put down this to make the Act operate as from the next General Election.  If you put a longer period or six months I am not satisfied we are paying sufficient attention to what is a possibility, namely, that a General Election may take place at an earlier date, and it seems to me that the essential thing is that this law should be established before the next General Election.</P>

      <P>My sole reason for moving this amendment is that these words are not necessary and have no value.  To be consistent, if we are going to connect up the Treaty, the Constitution and law, we should go further and say the Standing Orders of Dáil Eireann, because the Standing Orders provide for a certain contingency following the election, and prescribe that the oath shall be taken.  It is not complete without reference to the Standing Orders, and yet it is complete without any reference to the Treaty, Constitution and law.  They add nothing whatever to the schedule.  I put this forward as a reasonable proposition, and I suggest to the Minister that there is some justification for the deletion of these words.  Can he tell us what strength they add to the Schedule?  I think they add nothing whatever to it.</P>

I am advised that it would not be an affidavit at all, unless the person making it was personally known to the commissioner. I do not know whether that is so in strict law.  It may be true in regard to our Peace Commissioners. Supposing the proposed Deputy is travelling, and he is advised that an election is taking place, and he is quite prepared to take an affidavit, what is his position in the foreign country that he is passing through?  He has to go to a commissioner.  How can that commissioner possibly say that the Deputy is some one personally known to him?  It is a technical point.  I do not know how it can be remedied. I simply draw attention to it, and if there is anything definite in it it can be remedied.</P>
