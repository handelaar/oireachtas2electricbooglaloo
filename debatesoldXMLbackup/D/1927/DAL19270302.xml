      <P>asked the President whether there have been any further developments in connection with the bequest to Dublin of the Lane collection, and whether he can say if the offer of portion of the collection on loan has been considered, and whether, in case of the return of the pictures to Dublin, any provision has been made for a suitable building for their reception.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to an answer given to a question on this subject in July, 1926.  Before the publication of the report of the Committee set up by the British Cabinet I was afforded an opportunity of seeing it, and I addressed a letter to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs setting out the considered observations of the Executive Council on the report.  This question is admittedly of international importance, even though the City of Dublin is the principal party concerned.  It will be remembered that the codicil to the will of the late Sir Hugh Lane was written on the 3rd February, 1915, during the war period, and that although it was signed it was not witnessed.  The codicil was, therefore, not legally valid, although the form would have been sufficient in law at the time if the deceased were a soldier or sailor on active service.  The Committee found, however, that Sir Hugh Lane was of opinion that he was making a legal disposition when he signed the codicil. The codicil reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;This is a codicil to my last will to the effect that the group of pictures <Col N="1142" /> now at the London National Gallery, which I had bequeathed to that Institution, I now bequeath to the City of Dublin, providing that a suitable building is provided for them within five years of my death. The group of pictures I have lent to Belfast I give to the Municipal Gallery in Harcourt Street.  If a building is provided within five years, the whole collection will be housed together.  The sole Trustee to this question is to be my aunt, Lady Gregory.  She is to appoint any additional Trustees she may think fit. I also wish that the pictures now on loan at this (National Gallery of Ireland) Gallery remain as my gift.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&ldquo;HUGH LANE.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would like my friend, Tom Bodkin, to be asked to help in the obtaining of this new Gallery of Modern Art for Dublin.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If within five years a gallery is not forthcoming, then the group of pictures (at the London National Gallery) are to be sold, and the proceeds go to fulfil the purpose of my will.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&ldquo;HUGH LANE.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;3rd February, 1915.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Committee nevertheless reported that it would not be proper to modify the will by public Act of Parliament, and so the matter stands.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that in view of the technical invalidity of the codicil, the fact that a gallery has not been provided by the Municipality could not justly be regarded as a determining factor in the case, especially as the Governor of the National Gallery of Ireland has undertaken to house the pictures in the meantime, but it is nevertheless significant that considerable attention was directed in the report to the fact that through the munificence of Sir Joseph Duveen a gallery or an annexe to an existing gallery has been provided to house the Lane Collection in London.  I am not in a position to say whether if a gallery were provided by the Municipality of Dublin any change would take place in the minds of those who are not at present disposed to honour the expressed wishes of the late Sir <Col N="1143" /> Hugh Lane.  It is, I think, generally conceded that the building in which the municipal picture collection is at present housed cannot be regarded as suitable for the purposes of a permanent gallery.  Some&mdash;I do not believe all&mdash;of the thirty-nine pictures are on view at the London Gallery, which was built by money provided by Sir Joseph Duveen.  I took the opportunity of my stay in London during the Imperial Conference to pay a visit to the Gallery, and at that time all the pictures were not on view.</P>
    <P>The question of the acceptance of a portion of the Lane gift on temporary or permanent loan is, of course, a matter for the Municipality of Dublin, which is the body for whom the gift was intended by Sir Hugh Lane.  The Government have expressed no view upon the matter other than that in their opinion the question is an international one, and an offer of this kind cannot be regarded as fulfilling Sir Hugh Lane's last wishes.</P>
    <P>If I may venture to express my personal opinion, it is that the claim of the city of Dublin would be very much strengthened if the proviso in the codicil were fulfilled, viz., that a gallery should be provided by the city of Dublin.  I do, of course, admit that some objection might lie to this course &mdash;the expenditure of a considerable sum of money in an anticipation which may not be realised.  I feel, however, that once a gallery had been provided and the donor's wishes in that respect fulfilled&mdash;a responsibility which, if it were mine, I would shoulder&mdash;an entirely different situation would have arisen, which would afford very strong grounds for a variation of the decision of the British Government when the report was published.</P>

      <P>When the President was in London, did he observe that the Lane pictures formed a very small proportion of the pictures exhibited in the Galleries presented by Sir Joseph Duveen, and will he call the attention of the British Government to the parable of the prophet Nathan addressed to King David, and ask them to spare this ewe lamb?</P>

      <P>I want to protest against this treatment of the Dáil&mdash;the discourteous treatment that the President so frequently metes out to the Dáil in the matter of the time-table. Had he given notice last night that it was his intention to move that the sitting be extended, Deputies would have known exactly where they stood, but when we come here at 3 o'clock we are told we are to sit until 10.30, instead of the usual hour of adjournment&mdash; 8.30.  At the very least, it is discourteous to the Dáil, and there is absolutely no necessity for it.  We have had only a couple of hours discussion on the Committee Stage of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill; there is no sign whatever, as far as I can see, of any undue delay in the consideration of Bills, and treatment of this kind, to my mind, signifies a disregard of the convenience of Deputies.  I think it is treatment that ought to be protested against by the Dáil as a whole.</P>

      <P>I want to support Deputy Johnson's protest.  Somehow I felt a couple of weeks ago, when I came to Dublin, to find that the Dáil had adjourned the day before, that we would be up against a proposition of this kind.  I do not think there is any justification for the business of the Dáil being conducted in this manner. I do not think it is fair to expect Deputies to come here at 3 o'clock and to remain until 10.30.  I do not know what the view of the Ministry is that demands that we should put in so much work at this stage, particularly in view of the fact that we were brought here on one occasion to do one day's business and then go back again, and on another occasion we were brought here to do two days' business.  I strongly support the view of Deputy Johnson, that the Dáil should not agree to this suggestion.</P>

      <P>I wish to support Deputy Johnson on one specific point, that a motion of this kind ought not to be made without notice.  I ought to <Col N="1147" /> attend a meeting of a local authority this evening.  I assumed when I saw Deputy Connor Hogan's motion on the Paper that I should be able to do so. Had I known that I was not going to be able to do so, I would have written to the Town Clerk expressing my views on the various matters that are to come before that meeting.  As it is, I have not an opportunity of doing so.  I think it is unfair to put forward a motion of this kind without notice, and if Deputy Johnson divides the House I shall certainly vote with him.</P>

If I had got notice last night I would have been able to put off that.  I would ask the President, therefore, in future to think of Deputies who may have other appointments, or rather I would ask you, sir, who are responsible for the regulation of business and of order, to ensure that notice is given at least the evening before to Deputies of any change in the hours of sitting, so that they may be able to make their arrangements accordingly.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;That in the opinion of the Seanad it is expedient that a Joint Committee of both Houses, consisting of seven members of the Seanad and seven members of the Dáil, be appointed to consider and report upon the advisability of amending the Articles of the Constitution which prevent members of the Seanad being appointed members of the Executive Council.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Ná fuil sé oiriúnach Có-Choiste den <Col N="1148" /> dá Thigh do cheapa chun breithniú agus tuairisciú do dhéanamh i dtaobh ar mhaith an rud é na hAirtiogail den Bhunreacht do leasú a choisceann baill den tSeanad a cheapa mar bhaill den Ard-Chomhairle.</P>
    <P>That it is not expedient that a Joint Committee of both Houses should be appointed to consider and report upon the advisability of amending the Articles of the Constitution which prevent members of the Seanad being appointed members of the Executive Council.</P>
    <P>The President has asked me to put briefly to the Dáil the considerations which prompted the Executive Council to take the view that the Dáil ought not to take part in a Committee with the terms of reference set out in the resolution sent down from the Seanad.  The objection to that course is in a sense two-fold.  The first objection deals not so much with the merits of the proposal as with the setting and attendant circumstances in which the proposal comes before us.  Deputies will remember that some time ago a Bill was passed through the Dáil, and sent to the Seanad, providing that the maximum membership of the Executive Council should in future be twelve rather than seven.  The reasons for that step were explained when the Bill was before the House.</P>
    <P>Enthusiasm for the Extern Minister idea has waned, somewhat, by our experience in the actual operations of the Constitution.  I explained that the single responsibility of an Extern Minister was a matter, even under the Constitution as it stands, rather more of theory than of fact, because for every major departmental proposal the Minister must look for finance, and, looking for finance, must turn towards the sphere of collective responsibility, and as long as we retain our present system of financial control this single responsibility of the Minister who is not a member of the Executive Council is largely theoretical.</P>
    <P>In the matter of staff also, you have a radiation from all departments into the field of collective responsibility. Civil servants hold office on a tenure dependent on the Executive Council. They are removable only by the Executive <Col N="1149" /> Council.  The personnel of the Civil Service is controlled substantially by the Establishment Branch of the Department of Finance.  There, again, you have that necessary overlapping as between the Department represented here in the Dáil by an Extern Minister and the field of collective responsibility that is covered by the Executive Council. While we felt that these considerations, cumulatively, were not, perhaps, strong enough to make a case for the complete elimination of the Extern Minister idea from our Constitution, at least they sufficed to warrant us in asking the Dáil and the Seanad for a discretionary elasticity for each succeeding President as to the extent of the field of administration that he would choose to take into the sphere of collective responsibility&mdash;that each President, judging his own position after election, would decide how much of the general administration of the country he would call into the circle of collective responsibility and how much, if any, he would leave outside that circle. That Bill went to the Seanad.  Members of the Seanad took the view&mdash;the view that really underlies this resolution that is before us&mdash;that that Bill constituted an encroachment on their rights.  One may wonder what rights? An encroachment on their right to be Extern Ministers?  That, in so far as it is a right of members of the Seanad, is a right also of every citizen of the State.  It arises under Article 55 of the Constitution&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Ministers who shall not be members of the Executive Council may be appointed by the Representative of the Crown and shall comply with the provisions of Article 17 of this Constitution. Every such Minister shall be nominated by Dáil Eireann on the recommendation of a Committee of Dáil Eireann, chosen by a method to be determined by Dáil Eireann, so as to be impartially representative of Dáil Eireann.  Should a recommendation not be acceptable to Dáil Eireann, the Committee may continue to recommend names until one is found acceptable...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that there is nothing in the Article prescribing that Extern Ministers shall be members of Dáil <Col N="1150" /> Eireann, nor is there anything in the Article prescribing that Extern Ministers shall even be members of either House of the Oireachtas.  As I interpret it, any citizen approved ad hoe by this representative Committee of the Dáil could be an Extern Minister, on complying with the provisions of Article 17 of the Constitution.  So that if there is an encroachment on a right by the Bill that was passed here and sent to the Seanad, enabling the maximum number of the Executive Council to be raised to twelve, it is not a right peculiar to Senators but a right which Senators share with all citizens.</P>
    <P>The Bill was referred to a Special Committee of the Seanad, which I attended.  The proposal that emerged from that Special Committee was that no further progress should be made with the Bill that was passed here and sent to the Seanad; that they should mark time on the Bill; that they should pass a resolution inviting the Dáil to take part in the proceedings of a Joint Committee, the object of that Joint Committee being to decide whether or not Article 55 should be amended so as to make Senators eligible for membership of the Executive Council, the view being that if the field of Extern Ministers was to be encroached upon, as it might be under the Bill and under the discretion which the Bill proposes to give to succeeding Presidents, then the compensation for that must be that Senators must be eligible for membership of the Executive Council.  Whatever may be said for or against the eligibility of Senators for membership of the Executive Council or the propriety of making them so eligible, the Executive Council objects to the bargaining complexion of this resolution, the suggestion that unless this resolution is passed&mdash;unless the Dáil agrees to take part in a Committee which would consider the alteration of Article 55, so as to make Senators eligible for membership of the Executive Council then, presumably, the Bill which was passed by the Dáil, which is at present before the Seanad, will be consigned to some Limbo reserved for Bills that fail to secure the assent of both Houses.  In other words, there is underlying this resolution a threat&mdash;a <Col N="1151" /> leverage: Senators must be made eligible for membership of the Executive Council or a Bill, which aims at giving a discretion to succeeding Presidents as to the total number of Ministers to be included in the Executive Council, will not be passed.</P>
    <P>We object to the setting of this resolution; we object to its bargaining complexion.  We object to the underlying threat, that unless this resolution is passed, and, presumably, unless those who represent the Dáil on the proposed committee agree that Senators should be eligible for membership of the Executive Council, then the Bill that is before the Seanad will not be passed by the Seanad.  We do not think that public business&mdash;important public business&mdash;ought to be dealt with along lines of that kind.  That is our first objection to this resolution&mdash;our first reason for asking the Dáil not to accept the proposal embodied in the resolution.  The second objection is on the merits.  To accept this proposal to take part in the proceedings of a Joint Committee, to consider the alteration of Article 55 of the Constitution, so that Senators may be eligible for membership of the Executive Council is, in effect, equivalent to giving a Second Reading to the proposal that Senators should be eligible for membership of the Executive Council.  Are we sure they should?  The Seanad at present consists of 60 members.  Thirty-one of those members were elected; twenty-seven were nominated; two were co-opted.</P>
    <P>But none of these persons, whether nominated, co-opted or elected, were nominated, co-opted or elected with a view to their being anything else than members of a Second Chamber, a Second Chamber with powers of revision, powers of criticism, powers of suggestion, and even powers&mdash;maximum powers&mdash;of delay.  None were elected, co-opted or nominated with any advertence to the possibility of their becoming members of a body which is collectively responsible to the people for major matters of administration, for the handling of the finances of the country, for the bigger issues of policy, domestic and international, that <Col N="1152" /> may arise.  The Executive Council do not consider that the Dáil should commit itself to the principle of Senator-members of the Executive Council, even to the extent of agreeing to take part in a Joint Committee to consider that proposal.</P>
    <P>I have been reminded that elsewhere members of the Second Chamber, or the Upper Chamber as its own members prefer to call it, are members of Cabinets, sharing in Executive responsibility. But clearly, when the Constitution was being enacted, there was very definite provision that that should not be the case here.  To make an effective liaison between the Executive and both Houses it was provided that Ministers should have a right of audience in both Houses, that Ministers can go with their Bills after they have been passed by the Dáil to the Seanad, attend there at every stage and explain, expound and defend their proposals.  If elsewhere you have members of the Second Chamber members of the Executive it is largely for the purpose of providing a liaison between the Executive and the Second Chamber which would not otherwise exist.  I do not think it is too much to ask of any man who is ambitious to take part in the administration of the affairs of State, in deciding in the counsels of the State, the major political issues that may arise, that he should face a constituency in the ordinary way, and stand for election to the Dáil.  I think it would be a wrong thing, an unsound thing for the Dáil or the country to say that persons who have been nominated in a rather haphazard way or, even persons who have been elected in the peculiar circumstances in which Senators were elected, should be even eligible to become members of the Executive Council.</P>
    <P>Some time ago one of our daily papers committed itself to the statement that people were apt to forget that the Seanad was even in a wider sense than the Dáil a democratically elected chamber.  I have the exact quotation here, and in a matter of this kind one ought to be exact:&mdash;</P>
    <P>There is too great a tendency to forget that the Seanad is even in a <Col N="1153" /> wider sense than the Dáil a popularly elected body.</P>
    <P>That statement is, of course, blatantly and demonstratively untrue.</P>

Even with regard to the 31 elected, it is decidedly an overstatement to say that they possess in a wider sense than the Dáil a popular mandate.  For, whereas the Senator who in those elections secured the highest number of votes, secured a total vote of 14,000 in the entire State, there are many members of the Dáil who secured in a single constituency very many more votes.  There are members in the Dáil who secured upwards of 20,000 votes in a single constituency. The Senator who secured the highest number of votes from the whole State secured 14,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the resolution, but on slightly different grounds to those enumerated by the Minister.  I think it is necessary to be on our guard against a possible movement in favour of strengthening the authority of the Seanad as compared with the Dáil, and in effect altering the character of the legislature as was intended by the Constitution.  I think it is clear to anyone who reads the Constitution carefully&mdash;it is certainly clear <Col N="1154" /> to those Deputies who were present in the Provisional Parliament which acted as the Constituent Assembly&mdash;that it was never intended the Seanad should be a mere duplicate of the Dáil.  I think it is clear that the function of the Seanad is restricted to matters affecting legislation, and precludes them from responsibility for administration. The Executive Council is an Executive responsible to the Dáil.  I think it would be a weakening of the position of the Dáil if we allowed it to grow into a practice, even by some amendment of the Constitution, that the character of the Seanad would be altered, and that it would be, not merely a Chamber whose function it was to consider and revise legislative proposals and make recommendations regarding Money Bills, but that it should also have something like supervision over the Executive Council.  I think that would be distinctly retrograde and in conflict with the principles on which the Constitution has been built.  Nevertheless, I think there is a plea that the Seanad seems to be making in this proposal which is not wholly that explained by the Minister. From my reading of the reports it seems to me that there is a desire for better facilities for the conduct of their business as a legislative assembly.  I think, probably, they have grounds for dissatisfaction and complaint in regard to the facilities that are provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps that is merely an excuse.  I do not know, but I make the suggestion that, instead of repelling this proposal from the Seanad, we should offer as an alternative suggestion that a Joint Committee be appointed to consider whether any improvement can be made in the procedure and practice governing the relations between the two Houses, and between the Ministry and the Seanad, which would facilitate the Seanad in carrying out its work of legislation.  The form of any such proposal would probably have to be considered by the Committee.  I think that has been the practice before, but I commend the suggestion to the House that it is worth while meeting the Seanad with a view to seeing whether any means can be devised which would allow them to keep in touch with the <Col N="1155" /> intentions of the Ministry regarding procedure, Bills, and the general conduct of the work of legislation.  I think it is probably a case where a Parliamentary Secretary might be appointed from the Seanad who would know something of the intentions of the Ministry and be able to speak with some official authority, but I do not know whether that would stand examination. I think, nevertheless, that there is something required to be done to improve the business methods of the Seanad as of the Dáil.  I think that the Seanad should not even attempt to be a replica of the Dáil, to go through Bills with the same object and the same method, and should not simply act as a duplicating, examining, and critical body, but that their function is somewhat different and was well described in the Constitution debates as that of a cooling chamber.  I think they are intended to be a responsible body of earnest legislators who would examine carefully proposals coming from this House, which is made of commoner clay.  I have been somewhat converted to the idea of a Second Chamber, with that function, by the experience of the last few years in this House.  I think it is rather a reflection upon the business of this House that it has been necessary for the Seanad to act, more or less, as a duplicate body of the Dáil. One might suggest reasons, but I think I will refrain.  I think, though, that one might say that the failure to recognise the importance of the Dáil&mdash;the authority of the Dáil and the supreme position it occupies in the Nation's life&mdash;on the part of the Ministry is responsible for some of the defects which, I think, I see in the whole legislative machinery.  It is not right, for instance, that the Dáil should be deemed to be second in the mind of Minister to a Party meeting for official pronouncements of Executive policy. It is not right that a Minister, and an Extern Minister particularly, who is directly responsible to the Dáil, should think so little of the Dáil as to go direct from it to a Party meeting, a political meeting held in public, and announce an Executive decision, as was the case the other night, on the matter of <Col N="1156" /> fisheries.  That is merely a repetition of acts of a similar kind very frequently experienced.  I think that the proposal I am suggesting might well lead to a general reconsideration of the position of the Houses towards each other, and of the Executive to the Houses, and that it would probably find a means whereby any grievance that is legitimate, which the Seanad has in this proposal, might be met.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice, perhaps, will be grieved to hear that I am going to oppose this resolution and to support Deputy Johnson. Deputy Johnson has contrived to get in as many hard knocks at the Government as he possibly could.  As regards any knocks that I may get in, the Minister will not be entitled to fall back on his friends.  I regret that Deputy Johnson did not embody the proposal he has made in an amendment to this motion, because that would have offered a way out to what seems to me a very serious and difficult situation which we ought to meet in a responsible spirit. The arguments the Minister made as to why we should reject this message from the Seanad and adopt the resolution on the Paper were two-fold.  He objected, in the first place, to the circumstances under which the proposal came before us, and secondly, to the proposal on its merits.  I do not propose to deal with the circumstances under which the proposal came before us.  It is, I think, admitted that the Seanad have the right to address us at any time on a matter of this character. That right is within the Constitution and the Standing Orders.  It is further, I think, admitted that they are to be the judges of the time at which they think fit to address us.  We cannot say to them: &ldquo;You are only to send us a message in February, March or April, and at no other time of the year.&rdquo;  They are certainly the judges in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister objects to the fact that the Seanad, in sending this message, coupled with it the consideration of a Bill which had been passed by the Dáil. I must say that in doing so the Seanad displayed more tactical ability than I have ever known them to do in the past.  The Minister objects to it becoming <Col N="1157" /> a matter of negotiation.  Is not all politics a matter of negotiation?  Is the Minister himself such a stranger to negotiation?  Has he had no experience of negotiation in the immediate past so that he should say, whatever we do with the Seanad we will not negotiate with it even on the subject of a Bill?  I suggest that the Minister, in doing that, is asking us to adopt a standard of morality almost too good for Heaven, and certainly excessive for politicians in this world.  The Minister's second objection to the proposal is on its merits which, in effect, comes to the suggestion that the objects to the terms of reference of the proposed Committee because to adopt such terms of reference would be equivalent to giving a Second Reading of the Bill. Why did not the Minister, instead of asking the Dáil to give a flat negative to the Seanad message, suggest an amendment to the terms of reference? It would have been possible to do so. Deputy Johnson, more far-seeing than myself, suggested the lines on which it could be done, but the Government preferred to offer a flat negative to a unanimous resolution of the Seanad. Let there be no mistake about it, that every Party in the Seanad concurred in this resolution, including the Labour Party.  There are many matters that we could discuss, and I think ought to discuss, with the Seanad.  There is, for instance, the question of Parliamentary Secretaries, an institution which has arisen since the Constitution was created.  Can Parliamentary Secretaries sit in the Seanad?  If so, why should not the Government allow one or more members of the Seanad to become Parliamentary Secretaries?  That is a point worthy of discussion.</P>

      <P>We are at present dealing with the Executive Council.  I suggest the course of the Minister should be not to offer a flat negative to this resolution, but rather to say that there are certain questions we are willing to discuss with the Seanad, including the question of Parliamentary Secretaries. If they refuse to discuss the <Col N="1158" /> question of the Executive Council, they might, at least, discuss the question of Parliamentary Secretaries and might possibly clarify the position with regard to Extern Ministers.  Now, there is no doubt whatever that the present position of the Seanad is unique and, I think, anomalous.  It is not in the same position as any other Second Chamber in the world that I know of. Ministers without portfolio sit in the Canadian Seanad.  Minister sit in the Seanad of New Zealand; the Vice-President of the Executive Council and the Minister for Home Intelligence sit in the Seanad of Australia.  In France the Prime Minister, Monsieur Poincaré, is a member of the Senate.  In every Second Chamber in the world, except that of the United States, where the Executive is entirely divorced from the Legislature, and where members of the Executive are not members of either House, members are eligible for office, and by the fact that there are Ministers in those particular Chambers they derive a great advantage because they get guidance, if I may say so without drawing on myself a reprimand from the other House, of which the Seanad has very often stood in need.  Deputy Johnson spoke of it as a cooling Chamber.  I was of the impression that occasionally undue heat was generated there, and it is largely due to the fact that Ministers, coming to it from outside, have not the same knowledge as the members of the House who are taking part in its deliberations from day to day, and they cannot have the influence that a member of the body itself would have.  One practical effect of adhering to the present position and refusing to discuss any change at all will be, in the end, to exclude men of ability from the Seanad.  No man of ability and ambition will be willing to go to the Seanad if he is aware&mdash;I do not think the position is fully clear although it was stated in the Constitution&mdash;that under no circumstances could a member of the Seanad go for a Ministerial position.  I am going to be offensive enough to take a personal illustration.  The Labour Party in the Seanad are led by a member of great ability and considerable <Col N="1159" /> Parliamentary experience, whose energy and tact&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In this debate it is difficult to prevent Deputies from illustrating their remarks by reference to the present Seanad, but if Deputy Cooper can be allowed to praise a member of the Seanad and someone else to take a contrary example I feel that would be extremely bad procedure. I think if he could take abstractions and hypothetical cases it would be better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to your ruling.  I will assume a hypothetical Party led by an abstract leader who is possessed of great ability, energy and tact, and who had rendered considerable service not only to his Party but the State; at the same time when that hypothetical Party came into office they would be debarred, whatever the ability of that member of the Seanad, from appointing him to any post in the Executive Council however will they may think he would be qualified for it. The only condition on which he could obtain it would be to resign his seat in the Seanad, to wait for a bye-election and then contest it, with all the doubts and difficulties that attend it under proportional representation.  Is it not the logical result that that man of ability who may aspire to office will not go to the Seanad at all and we shall have&mdash;am I in order to speak of fool amendments?&mdash;more ill-considered amendments sent to us from the Seanad than at the present time?  I do not think that is desirable.</P>
      <P>One argument I expected the Minister to stress and he did not, as strongly as I expected, was the non-representative character of the Seanad.  He did stress the point that the Seanad election was not a real representative election, because so few people voted.</P>

      <P>I did not say that; I queried a particular Press comment, which was: &ldquo;There is too great a tendency to forget that the Seanad is even, in a wider sense than the Dáil, a popularly elected body.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not endorse that claim or any claim made in that <Col N="1160" /> particular paper or in any paper unless I put it over my own signature, but the Seanad is partially non-representative now.  That is a passing condition that will change rapidly; within eight years it will be a popularly elected body. Surely it will, then, be very difficult to deny the Seanad any claim to a share in the Executive power?  Surely if any change is to be made it should be made now, because a change made eight years hence in the constitution, will only be made at great inconvenience and expense by means of a referendum, whereas up to 1930 a change can be made merely by Acts of the Oireachtas. Surely if there is to be a change made, consideration of whether a change should be made should be given to it before the Seanad election next year so that there may be no misconception in the minds of the electors as to the conditions under which they elect their Senators.  Is not that an argument for a committee on more general terms than are set out in this message&mdash;a committee of some kind to consider the relations of the Seanad to the Executive power and of the Seanad to the Dáil?</P>
      <P>It seems to me, so far as I could catch it on hearing it once, that Deputy Johnson's suggestion offered a way out. I hope it may commend itself to Ministers instead of this flat negative.  If it does I urge them to see, and there is considerable urgency in the matter, that such a committee would be more useful and produce more valuable results if it is composed, at any rate on this side, of Deputies who had four years' experience of the work rather than of Deputies newly elected to a new Dáil, and that even if the Dáil passes this motion they will not say that it is the last word, and will not say that they are unprepared to consider a suggestion of any kind whatever on the lines that Deputy Johnson made, because, if so, I see acrimony and embitterment between the relations of the two Houses.  I see a definite lowering in future of the character of the Seanad and I do not believe either of them would be of benefit to the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I approve of the motion put down, that we disapprove <Col N="1161" /> of the recommendation of the Seanad that we should appoint members on a Joint Committee to meet them to consider this question of the appointment of Executive Ministers from the Seanad. I object to it from the point of view that the Minister stated, of the element of bargaining in that regard and the fact that the very important Bill dealing with the amendment to the Constitution will be held up for some considerable time owing to that element of bargaining.  I think, in view of the public happenings which have taken place in recent times, it is of the greatest importance that immediate legislative action should be taken to ensure that the Extern Ministers shall be members of the Executive Council. I suggest it be compulsory that they should be members of the Executive Council.</P>
      <P>I think the people of the country have a right to expect a unified policy from the Government which is in power; and we have the extraordinary state of affairs which exists at the present time of a member of the Government making one statement with regard to the policy of the Government differing fundamentally from that laid before the country by the members of the Executive Council.  The statement put before the country by an Extern Minister differs from the policy of the Executive Council.  The passing of this Bill, which is at present before the Seanad, will have the effect of wiping out that ridiculous anomaly, and people will then have a right to expect what they do not get at present, that is, a unified declaration of policy from the Government in power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I just want to make one or two slight comments with regard to the technical aspects of the case&mdash;what the Minister refers to as the merits of the case.  I agree with the Minister to a certain extent that the Seanad cannot be regarded as a thoroughly representative body, even bearing in mind Deputy Cooper's statement that after the expiration of eight years the members of the Seanad will be elected.  I would point out that in view of the limitation as to the method of nomination, the Seanad can never, at any time, be regarded as representative in the sense <Col N="1162" /> that the Dáil is representative.  I think it is essential that the Executive Ministers shall be so placed that in the event of the Government having to resign and appeal to the country on a policy on which they have been beaten in the Chamber here, that all the Ministers should have to resign and should be forced to appear before the country and get elected on the policy which they have propounded.  The effect of the appointment of Ministers from the Seanad would be that we would have Ministers on the Executive Council who would not have to receive the suffrages of the people perhaps for a very considerable period and would not, in any sense of the word, be responsible to the electors for their actions as members of the Executive Council.</P>
    <P>I disagree with Deputy Cooper when he says that we should put forward an alternative suggestion or amendment. My suggestion is this&mdash;we have a definite claim put forward by the Seanad and we should meet that in a definite way, either by a negative or affirmative. There should be a better liaison between the Dáil and Seanad, and that should issue from this Chamber in the form of an independent document and should not in any way be regarded as a bargaining factor in this matter.  This particular suggestion should be decided upon its merits.  The opinion that I hold, and I am sure it is the opinion of my Party, is that we ought not to appoint members on the Joint Committee in this connection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are asked to consider what seems to me to be a rather serious matter as it concerns the relationship between the two Houses. I take it that the reply of the Minister and the request practically to throw back the resolution that has been submitted on behalf of the Seanad rather points to the beginning of a controversy between the two Houses.  What occurs to me really is this, that the resolution which has been passed by the Seanad expresses the dissatisfaction which is felt in the Seanad at the present state of things from their experience in connection with the business that has been developed in the Dáil. The suggestion is that there is an alternative <Col N="1163" /> and that some means should be found of putting the Seanad in the position of closer intimacy with the work of the Dáil through the service of Parliamentary Secretaries.  Whatever the solution may be, I think the position is quite clear.  You have a Bill of a highly contentious nature discussed in the Dáil, and probably discussed in a combative fashion as between the different parties and the Government, and the Minister after all that, has to go up to the Seanad and go through a similar process in the Seanad.  He is not in exactly the frame of mind to pay due regard to the reiteration, if it may be so, of the objections that he has to meet in this House, and to face them again at a meeting of the Seanad.  I would ask, at all events, that a bald resolution of refusal by the Government should, if possible, be tempered with a recognition of the difficulties as between the two Houses.</P>
      <P>How that difficulty is to be got over is a question that I do not think the House could be expected to solve to-day. But the point that I would emphasise, if I may, is that a recognition shall be given in this House to what is obviously a feeling of dissatisfaction in the other House with the proceedings as they have developed.  Now, of course, the question arises on a Bill dealing with Extern Ministers, but is it really in connection with that Bill that that resolution is being sent down to us?  I do not think it is.  I think it is an expression of the Seanad's dissatisfaction as it exists.</P>
      <P>As regards the Extern Ministers.  I do not think that at present it would be very much in order for anybody to criticise the Bill that has already passed from us and gone up to the Seanad, but I would add, if I might, a request that the House will recognise a certain difficulty and leave an opening, at all events, for that difficulty to be discussed as between the two Houses, before we come to a deadlock where a feeling of resentment will be felt by the Seanad and which will react on the business to be transacted in the Dáil in the future, unless some settlement is arrived at.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to subscribe to the opinions expressed by Deputy Heffernan.  In my opinion, the Dáil ought to agree with the resolution sent down to us from the Seanad, that we should appoint seven Deputies to meet them at a conference. Remember, we are not committed to anything when we send these seven Deputies.  The Committee must report back to us.  We are not even aware that agreement may be reached by the Joint Committee.  But in any case, even if it were unanimous in its agreement, the Dáil is not committed to the agreement from that Joint Committee. It can deal freely with the report of the Committee when it comes before it.  I say that that courtesy is due to the Seanad.  I really dread to provoke a constitutional crisis, and the language of the Minister for Justice was, in my opinion, extremely unwise. He imputed intentions to the Seanad which, I think, ought not to be given expression to&mdash;that they were in a measure bargaining, threatening us to hold up a Bill until they achieve their bargain.  I would direct Deputies' attention to the concluding part of Article 38 of the Constitution:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When a Bill other than a Money Bill has been sent to Seanad Eireann a Joint Sitting of the Members of both Houses may, on a resolution passed by Seanad Eireann, be convened for the purpose of debating, but not of voting upon, the proposals of the Bill or any amendment of the same.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The proposals of the Bill or any amendment of the same!  The Minister for Justice gave us the genesis of the resolution that has come from the Seanad.  He pointed out that one of the Constitution (Amendment) Bills passed here provided that the Extern Ministers may, at the discretion of the President, be included in the Executive Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Bill has gone before the Seanad. The Seanad have considered it, have set up a special committee to deal with it and, in pursuance of their policy, they now request a joint committee. They request a committee of this House to meet a delegation from their <Col N="1165" /> Chamber to form a joint committee. The Dáil, if it wishes, can refuse, but remember that the Seanad&mdash;and we have no option, as we are powerless&mdash; can convene a joint sitting of both Chambers.</P>

      <P>It might be necessary to put Deputies right on the particular question at issue.  The only way in which we can receive a communication from the other House is by means of a message.  The only thing we properly know about the other House is what is communicated to us by way of a message.  Communications cannot be made to us, for example, by means of speeches from the other House, but only by message sent in this particular way.  We are only concerned with actions the other House takes.</P>
      <P>In this instance the other House has taken particular action.  It has passed a resolution and sent a message asking us to appoint a committee to join with a committee of the Seanad to discuss a particular thing.  We need not, in fact, send a reply; but it would be only right and proper that we should send a reply, and our reply must certainly concern this matter.  This matter, the question of a joint committee to consider and report upon the advisability of amending the Articles of the Constitution which prevent members of the Seanad being appointed members of the Executive Council, must be disposed of, and the disposal of that particular matter cannot lead to a constitutional crisis. In fact, I do not know how a constitutional crisis can arise at all between the two Houses, because the Constitution exists for the purpose of seeing that a crisis will not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to what Deputy Hewat and Deputy Cooper said, and indeed Deputy Johnson, when this matter has <Col N="1166" /> been disposed of it will be still open to a member of this House to move for a joint committee on any other matter except this particular matter.  This matter will have been decided, but any other matter, such as was mentioned by those Deputies, would be open, and a Deputy could put down a motion suggesting that we send a message to the Seanad bearing on any other matter he pleases, but excepting, if we take a decision on this resolution, this particular matter.</P>

      <P>To come to the merits of the proposal.  Deputy Johnson took the line that we ought to be careful not to strengthen the position of the Seanad.  I altogether disagree from that view-point.  There is nothing more dangerous than to have a top-heavy majority in one House.  I believe the Constitution is best served by having a number of checks, a number of safeguards, upon the activities of one Chamber.  We ought to accede to the opinion expressed by the Seanad. It is not an unreasonable proposal, as I pointed out.  We are committed to nothing.  Let the position be examined freely and frankly and let the Committee report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>What I intended to point out chiefly has already been pointed out by you, sir.  A specific request is before us from the Seanad and, if there is one thing more than another <Col N="1167" /> that the Seanad in common courtesy is entitled to expect, it is an explicit reply to that request.  To treat this matter in any other way is, as if when asked for the loan of £500, you were to say &ldquo;No, but I have an excellent volume of Shakespeare's poems that I could lend you for an evening or two.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Seanad invite the Dáil to take part in the proceedings of a Joint Committee which will consider the desirability of eliminating from the Constitution those Articles which preclude the possibility of a member of the Seanad becoming a member of the Executive Council.  That is a matter of very real interest to the Dáil.  It is to the Dáil that the Executive Council is responsible, and, through the Dáil, to the electorate, and it is a matter of genuine concern to the electorate and to the Dáil what the composition of that Executive Council is to be, and whether it is to contain the members of the Second Chamber.</P>
      <P>The Provisional Parliament enacted this Constitution.  Only after its enactment did the Seanad come into existence at all.  It came into existence with certain prescribed functions, functions of revision, of criticism, of suggestion, and, as its maximum power, the function of imposing a certain delay to measures of which it disapproved.  Now we are asked to take the view that it is desirable to explore, at any rate, the possibility that some members of that Assembly so constituted, constituted for this purpose, to those ends, should be made suddenly and gratuitously eligible for quite other functions. None of the 31 members of the Seanad who were elected were elected with a view to their becoming members of the Executive Council, even potentially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>None of the 27 members who were nominated was nominated with that in view, and the same applies to the two who were co-opted.  We are asked to change all that and to say that men, elected, nominated and co-opted to perform particular functions, are now to be made eligible to perform quite other functions.  One can conceive that a man might be an excellent member of a cooling chamber and not necessarily <Col N="1168" /> an equally excellent member of an Executive Council.  But when Senators were appointed or in whatever way they became Senators, I submit there was advertence to the functions they would have to perform as members of the Second Chamber.  It conflicts with my conception of democratic government, that members of a House, to some extent arbitrarily nominated by the President of the Executive Council, should be eligible for membership of the body that takes collective responsibility for the major portion of legislation and administration.  Deputy Cooper talked about negotation and said that I ought to understand negotiation. Certainly, but I have tried to preserve throughout all negotiations a sense of the public interest.  We have passed a Bill; rightly or wrongly we have decided that the next President and succeeding Presidents ought to be free, each one envisaging his own position, to say how much of the sphere of administration he would take collective responsibility for.  Surely that is a matter on which the Seanad could say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no.&rdquo;  Instead of that, they raise a side-wind and say: &ldquo;Oh, but theoretically we are eligible to be Extern Ministers, and, in so far as this Bill is an encroachment, or a possible encroachment on the field of Extern Ministers, our rights are infringed.&rdquo;  They are infringed in common with those of Patrick Murphy, of Skibbereen, if there is such a person, as I am sure there is.</P>
    <P>I object to that attitude.  I object to the Seanad threatening, or implying that they will not deal with that Bill on the basis of public interest; that, in fact, they are more concerned with the question of whether or not they are to be eligible for membership of the Executive Council.  That is another matter that can be raised at another time.  I submit it should be raised at another time, but the question of the desirability of leaving discretionary elasticity to each succeeding President on the question of how much of the sphere of collective administration he would take responsibility for, should not be complicated by what many people would consider the individual ambitions of individual Senators.  There is a question <Col N="1169" /> put to the Dáil.  We should answer that question, and not some other.  There are vague suggestions about Parliamentary Secretaries coming from Deputies who, in other circumstances, would probably be lecturing about the unnecessary multiplication of Parliamentary Secretaries.</P>

      <P>All credit to us for that vacancy.  If the Seanad needs, or thinks it needs, a Parliamentary Secretary, it is quite another matter from this suggestion of eligibility for membership of the Executive Council.  But does it, in fact?  All Ministers have the right of audience in both Houses. A Minister goes to the Seanad in charge of every Bill and in charge of every proposal that emanates from any Department.  If that is not an effective liaison I would like its imperfections to be pointed out.  That is not the issue before us.  The issue before us is, that the Seanad has a Bill from the Dáil which proposes to increase the maximum membership of the Executive Council.  The Seanad has put that Bill on one side and said to the Dáil: &ldquo;Join with us in discussing the desirability of making Senators members of the Executive Council, and, in the light of your attitude at that Committee, we will determine our attitude to this Bill.&rdquo;  That is a procedure which is not in accordance with my conception of a decent stewardship of public interest.  I think that the Seanad should declare on this Bill on its merits, and that afterwards we might discuss the executive and administrative heights to which Senators should, or should not, rise.</P>
      <P>I consider that it would be much more satisfactory to give a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; reply to the Seanad on this matter than to answer some other question which is not before us.  I ask the Dáil, therefore, to accept the motion that stands in the President's name on the Order Paper.</P>

      <P>Yesterday evening when the opening hours in county boroughs from Monday to Friday were under discussion, the question was that the hour of opening, 10 o'clock, stand part of the section, and the matters that could have been under discussion were the alternative proposals.  I think there were two on the paper, one by Deputy Lyons to have publichouses open at 8.30, and the other was an amendment by Deputy Redmond to go back to the present hour, namely, 9 o'clock.  The value of putting this question is that it enables all the alternatives to be discussed, but if the words in the Bill are allowed to stand all the alternatives fail.  Deputy Thrift's amendment cannot arise if the words are taken out, but it does arise provided the words remain in.</P>

      <P>Like opponents of the Bill, I have not been idle since the Second Reading.  I have been exploring possibilities and impossibilities.  I would like to tell the Dáil the conclusions <Col N="1173" /> that I have arrived at in regard to this matter of split hours.  If the proposal in the Bill that there be a break in the day from 3 to 5 is put to the Dáil on a non-party vote, it will, according to my estimate at any rate, be defeated.  On the other hand, I have been able to arrive at an accommodation which I personally am prepared to accept.  It is to provide for one hour's complete closing in the four county boroughs, that is, whereas under this proposed two hours' break in the Bill mixed houses would be open for the non-licensed portion of their business, I can put to the Dáil, and I believe I can carry, a proposal for a complete closing of one hour&mdash;that the mixed houses be closed equally with the licensed houses pure and simple.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>

If this proposal to leave the words of the sub-section stand goes to the Dáil, I would ask the Deputies to vote for it on the understanding that on the Report Stage I will bring forward an amendment providing that the break in the day be a one hour's break, and that it be a completely closed one even for the mixed business&mdash;a shut door arrangement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would take either of the hours, but my preference is from 3 to 4.  I am fully alive to the fact that reducing the two hours to one hour means still an eleven hours drinking day in the four county boroughs.  On the other hand, it is perhaps something of a gain not to have to deal with the administrative difficulties that arise when you have a house opened for the non-licensed portion of its business and closed, or theoretically closed, for the licensed portion.  We will have that difficulty even as it is in the morning hour from 9 to 10, but it is not as serious matter then as it might be at a later hour of the day, and I am prepared to put to the Dáil the proposal for a complete closing for one hour in the day for the four county boroughs. <Col N="1174" /> If this motion now before the Dáil, that these words stand, be put, I ask for a vote on it on the basis of my promise that I will introduce the amendment I have outlined on the Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the position we are in now is that there is a proposal in the Bill, as originally printed, which suggests closing for two hours, but that is limited, because there is another section which provides that mixed traders shall be allowed to open during those hours for business other than the sale of intoxicating liquor.  The Minister now comes along with a further proposal.  On the Second Reading he suggested that this original proposal should be left to a free vote, and he now says that he is convinced if there was a free vote the original proposal would go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>On the merits.  The Minister contemplates defeat if the amendment is pressed. By operation of a free vote of the House the strong man will have met with a check.  To avert defeat he proposes a bargain.  The bargain is that we should let him carry this point of his Bill to-day and at a later stage he will radically alter his proposals.  In Section 3, mixed trading is dealt with, and the words used there are: &ldquo;the portion of such premises in which such non-licensed business is carried on is not structurally separated from the remainder of such premises,&rdquo; and the remainder of the provision in that section has reference to houses in which mixed trading&mdash;licensed and non-licensed&mdash;is carried on without structural separation between the two parts. But Section 2, with which we are dealing, is concerned with every type of shop which sells, or exposes for sale, any intoxicating liquor.  The broadest and the widest reference possible&mdash;&ldquo;in any county borough to sell or expose for sale any intoxicating liquor or to open or keep open any premises for the sale of intoxicating liquor.&rdquo;  The Minister's proposal, which arises in connection with Section 2, will affect such licensed premises as carry on a non-licensed trade as well and which have provided, what is so highly desirable, structural separation between the two. So that when we reach this further stage of dealing with the proposal of the Minister consideration will have to be paid to the difference between these <Col N="1177" /> two types of premises.  The Minister speaks of making a complete closing for one hour.  Such a house as I have referred to, with structural division between the two parts of the premises, will be compulsorily closed for one hour at mid-day as regards its non-licensed trade.  It will, therefore, be subjected to that handicap in competition with other houses that are not carrying on a licensed trade as well.</P>

      <P>I know that I could take no more unpopular course than to stand between the House and Deputy Heffernan, so that I shall, therefore, merely dwell on the one point which I understood the Minister to make, that his bargain was that he would substitute for the two hours mid-day closing a compulsory one hour total closing.  I wish to point out the effect of that in the light of his own illustration of from three to four being <Col N="1178" /> the one hour.  The shopping public will be at lunch, presumably, or at the mid-day meal, call it what you please, between 1 and 2, or between 2 and 3, and then when they proceed to do their shopping they will find the shops closed compulsorily from 3 to 4.  There is a lacuna in the working day for these people, not of two hours, as originally proposed, but of several hours.  I suggest that the Minister has not thought out his proposal with sufficient care.  It is rather a peculiar situation in which to find himself, that after the long time it took to incubate this measure, in consequence of the report of the Liquor Commission, it was suddenly altered in several respects and that then it has again been altered in this hurried fashion so as to leave these two defects, first its effect on the house carrying on mixed trading with structural alteration between the two parts, and also the inconvenience to the shopping public.</P>

      <P>In view of your ruling, and in view of the method which the Minister has adopted to bring this matter before the House, I feel that I have no alternative but to put the amendment before the House in the manner suggested by you.  I take exception to the methods adopted by the Minister in regard to this particular section and the amendment. They are somewhat of the same nature as those adopted by the Minister in regard to the Second Reading of the Bill.  We have here before us a Bill on the Committee Stage and we have the extraordinary procedure adopted by the Minister of coming to the House <Col N="1179" /> and making a statement with regard to an amendment he proposes to introduce at a later stage and which he had an opportunity of introducing at this stage if he had taken advantage of that opportunity.  I say the correct procedure, and the procedure which the Minister should have adopted, if only in courtesy to the mover of the particular amendment, would have been to put down the amendment at this stage or to have a Ministerial amendment put down proposing the method he intends to adopt.</P>
      <P>We had the Bill coming before us on Second Reading, and the Minister telling us that we were to pass that Bill, but that that was not the Bill we were to have eventually.  He is asking us to pass a Bill which is not before the House at all, a Bill which he is going to amend.  We have the same procedure to-day adopted by the Ministers.  I take exception to that procedure.  I say it is not fair to the members of the House, that when they have prepared particular amendments and prepared any arguments that they may intend to put forward, the Minister comes along with another suggestion which is quite new, which means a reconsideration of the whole section, a reconsideration of the whole position not only in regard to this section but to other sections dealing with another class of trading. In view of that I do not feel that I have the right to withdraw the amendment as there are other Deputies who may still persist in the point of view that the houses should not be closed between 3 and 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say, in regard to this amendment and to any other amendment which I put down, that I am not in any sense of the word speaking as official spokesman of the licensed trade.  I have not been in close contact with, nor have I been in any way approached by the licensed trade.  In putting forward this amendment, I am expressing views and principles which I have held for a considerable time with regard to the whole matter.  The underlying principle in my mind in regard to this and my other amendment is that bothersome and vexatious regulations in regard to the hours of opening and <Col N="1180" /> the control of licensed premises, are not likely to have the effect of producing less drinking.  I fully approve of any method which may be taken to diminish the number of publichouses. I believe that is the only effective clause in the Bill, and were it not for that clause the Bill would have been so much eye-wash and so much a waste of the time of the House in discussing it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion that the licensed houses in the county boroughs should be closed from 3 to 5, the objection that I have is that it will not have any real effect in causing a diminution in the amount of liquor consumed.  The Minister dealt with a type of men whom he called &ldquo;sitters,&rdquo; the men who sit in the public house for hours and who by means of this section would be forced to leave the house between 3 and 5.  I do not know what the Minister's knowledge or experience is, but I believe there are very few drinkers of that type in existence in the Saorstát.  My view in regard to this particular form of drinking, as in regard to any other form of drinking, is that the greatest influence for temperance we have had in modern times has been the increase in the price of liquor, and that while it remains at its present price there is practically no need for any restrictive legislation of any kind. People certainly are not drinking because they cannot afford it.</P>
    <P>Another matter with regard to this question of liquor reform is that it will cause, in my opinion, considerable inconvenience to the ordinary public.  I think cognisance should be taken of the fact that in this country we are really an agricultural people, that our cities are distributing centres for the agricultural community and are not industrial centres, and that there is a continual percolation of country people into the cities.  They come into Dublin almost every day.  They come in in the morning, do their business, as a rule, in the morning hours, get their lunch, and then, between 3 and 4 and 5, just at the hour when a man decides that he might want a drink to keep his spirits up, he finds the publichouses are closed against him.</P>

      <P>My experience of the existing regulations in England is that when I felt like having a drink &mdash;which is not very often&mdash;the idea always seemed to strike me between 3 and 5 o'clock.  The Minister has rather complicated the matter by introducing this question of closing for an hour, because that deals with the question of mixed trading and takes away an argument that I intended to use.  In view of the possibility that the Minister's amendment on the Report Stage may not be adopted, I want to point out that under the section as it stands there would be very considerable difficulty in regard to supervision of mixed trading.  You will have a house where liquor and groceries are sold over the same counter, and between 3 and 5 o'clock, according to this, the liquor cannot be sold.  In my opinion, that would make supervision almost impossible, and would add very considerably to the existing difficulties of the Gárda Síochána.  In view of the arguments which I have put forward, and in view of the fact that I believe there is no definite demand from any large section of the community that publichouses should be closed between 3 and 5 in the county boroughs, I ask that the question to be put, as suggested by the Ceann Comhairle, that the words &ldquo;between 3 and 5&rdquo; stand part of the Bill, be not accepted by the House.</P>

Owing to being too much interested in the welfare of the people whom I represent, I may have used words that probably I would not use on another occasion.  I hope this will be accepted by the Dáil in all sincerity, because I can assure Deputies that I am very sorry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have an amendment on the Paper similar to that moved by Deputy Heffernan. I did not put forward that amendment <Col N="1182" /> in the interests of the licensed trade, but as an independent Labour Deputy.  I have made inquiries from persons employed in the licensed trade and have been assured that if licensed houses are closed from 3 to 5 in the afternoon it will mean the dismissal of a large number of employees.  I am sure the Minister for Justice recognises the necessity for keeping people in employment.  On Second Reading he said he was prepared to allow this matter to be decided by a free vote of the Dáil.  I hope he has not bound his Party in the meantime, and that a free vote will be allowed.  We must appreciate the stand that the Minister for Justice has made against such a powerful organisation as the licensed trade. I, at least, do appreciate it, but I hope that he will adhere to the promise he made to allow this matter to be decided by a free vote of the House.</P>
    <P>If this amendment is not accepted the licensed houses in the county boroughs will be compelled to close from 3 to 5 in the afternoon, and that will add considerably to the number of the unemployed. By doing that you will show that you want to cripple the licensed trade, from which the greater portion of the revenue is derived.  I think every honest-minded Deputy must recognise that if this proposal is accepted you are going to do a great injustice to a very large number of people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>As the mover of the first amendment on the Paper, which covers the amendments moved by Deputy Heffernan and Deputy Lyons, I desire, at once, to associate myself with Deputy Heffernan in his protest against the manner in which the Vice-President has chosen to treat the House.  I do not see the good of having this Bill here at all.  Why have the Bill?  Why not have a blank sheet of paper?  Why not let us meet, say from day to day, and hear the latest report from the mind of the Minister for Justice?  On the occasion of the Second Reading he informed us that he was prepared to leave this matter of split hours to a free vote.  He certainly did not suggest that he was about to abandon the project that was in his Bill, because I suppose at that moment he had not arrived at that conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But his proposal now is that he is abandoning the closing of premises for two hours and the permitting of the opening of other premises, namely, mixed premises during these same hours.  In fact, he has admitted now that the arguments used on the Second Reading debate against the practicability of allowing houses known as mixed trading houses to keep open for the sale of goods other than intoxicating liquor and expecting them to be closed for the sale of intoxicating liquor were fully justified.  Well, then, what is the use discussing, now, the proposals in the Bill regarding the split hours?  The Minister has thrown them over.  It is like flogging a dead horse.  He has said that if these words are allowed to stand in the Bill he will, at the next stage, provide that they will not stand in the Bill and that something else will stand in their stead. Therefore, to discuss the present proposal is mere and sheer waste of time. Similarly, to discuss the question of the position of the mixed traders under these hours, as proposed in the original Bill, is also waste of time, because the Minister has announced that all houses are to be closed&mdash;that is the new proposal&mdash;the very latest from the Ministerial <Col N="1184" /> front&mdash;mixed and otherwise, for one hour.</P>
    <P>I submit that Deputy Heffernan's attitude is a commendable one and should be adopted by the Minister, when, at the last moment, he has come to see the error of his way in regard to his original proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Heffernan has asked whether if these hours are now deleted, if this motion is defeated, it will be within the right of the Minister to move, at another stage, a new section providing for his new proposal, and you, sir, have answered in the affirmative.  I suggest this is the attitude that ought to have been adopted by the Minister, and for that reason I will support Deputy Heffernan in clearing the path and, at any rate, in doing away with those words in the Bill now and at once, because the Minister himself says that at the next stage he himself is going to do away with them.  So I say the proper course for him to adopt now is to accept the essence of this amendment, namely, that the words do not stand part of the Bill at the moment, and it will be open to him, at a subsequent stage, to introduce his new proposal.  I do not think there is anything unfair either to him or to the Committee in that.  But his idea is so extraordinarily roundabout and complicated that I fail to see how he can press it upon the House.  He wants the words kept in the Bill, and then he wants to be given leave to say that they shall not be in the Bill but that something else shall be in the Bill. Why should he not agree to have the words struck out here and now in the Bill and then come along with his fresh proposals?  He said, very candidly I admit, that the reason why he is not proceeding with the Bill as originally drafted in respect of this clause is because, having announced that he would leave it to a free vote of the House, he is convinced that it would be defeated. If he is convinced that it would be defeated, if he knows that he himself is not going to insist upon these words at a later stage, but is going to substitute <Col N="1185" /> others for them, then I ask, in the name of reason, why he will not now agree to have these words deleted and then let him come forth with his new proposal at a subsequent stage?  There is no use, as I said before, now debating this question as originally proposed in the Bill.</P>
      <P>That is gone.  It is as dead as Queen Anne.  The suggestion that houses should open for the sale of one class of commodities and not for the sale of another class at one and the same time and that these houses could be properly supervised by the Gárda Síochána or any other force, was preposterous.  It has been seen by the Minister that that suggestion was utterly futile.  It has now gone and there is no use in labouring the utter impracticability of it.  Similarly, the suggestion in regard to mixed trading has gone.  But you have a further point to consider&mdash;a point which is covered, it is true, by a subsequent proviso standing in the name of Deputy Thrift.  I do not know what the Minister's attitude will be upon that question.  The proposal is in regard to houses which are licensed for the consumption of liquor off the premises. The question does not arise immediately under this amendment, and I am not going to deal with it now.  But there would be no necessity for that proviso at all if the Minister were to adopt the course I suggest, in company with Deputy Heffernan.  There would then be no possibility of these words ever standing part of the Bill.  He would agree to have them deleted at once.  We could then proceed with the rest of the Bill, and at any future date, when a suitable opportunity offered, the Minister could come forward with his new proposals.  There is only one drawback to that suggestion, and it is that when the time came for the Minister to make his new proposals, as outlined to-day, we would probably find a newly-amended new proposal.</P>

      <P>At any rate, the Minister has announced to-day that he has formed a coalition&mdash;by private negotiation, I presume&mdash;which will enable him to get over the difficulty created by the amendment now before the House. There has, I think, been more discussion of a proposal that is not before the House than there has been of the amendment that Deputy Heffernan has moved.  I understand that if this two-hour closing from 3 to 5 is insisted upon by the Minister and carried by the House, it will result in the disemployment of 100 to 150 grocers' assistants in the city of Dublin.  The actual figure given to me, and given to the Minister at an interview with representatives of the grocers' assistants, was 133.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said nothing and his supporters have said nothing as to what provision will be made for the people who will lose their employment as a result of passing subsection (a) of Section 2 of this Bill. When I spoke of the unemployment of 130 assistants, I referred only to the position in the city of Dublin.  I know nothing of the effect of the passage of this section in Cork, Waterford, or Limerick.  The Minister may, perhaps, have received information on that question. Sometime ago I had a conversation with a grocer's assistant in this city who was anxious to secure employment. He failed in his efforts.  As a result of investigation, I found that there were 300 grocers' assistants on the idle list in the City of Dublin.  Those who vote for the proposal in subsection (a) should realise that they are going to add 130 to the number of unemployed in the city.  We have heard a good deal of talk outside the House about the impression created upon Deputies by interested parties.  I believe that there is very little consideration given to Press reports of that kind by the Deputies themselves.  I do not believe that Deputies of any Party are so much subject to the pressure of <Col N="1187" /> interested parties&mdash;whether it be the temperance party or the publican's party&mdash;as the Press would lead the public to believe.  The general impression of Deputies of this House is that it is injudicious on the part of this Government, and would be injudicious on the part of a Farmers' Government or a Labour Government, to bring in restrictive legislation of this kind three months before an appeal to the people. If the present Government was as certain as the President appears to be of coming back with a bigger majority, they would have allowed the electors to pronounce judgement on this question, and if they were returned they could pass a measure of this kind, or even a more restrictive measure.</P>

      <P>This part of the Bill will not affect my constituency, but I hold that if the House agrees to payment of compensation for abolition of licences a good case can be made for some form of compensation to, or some form of recognition of, the people who will be thrown out of employment, as a result of the passage of this measure in the name of social reform.  We are discussing now a proposal to close for two hours.  Deputies will have, I presume, an opportunity of expressing their views and voting upon a proposal for one-hour closing later.  I believe that if the two-hour closing is made operative it will necessitate far more supervision on the part of the Gárda Síochána than at present, and supervision of a kind which cannot be effective.  I believe that you would require to have a policeman at the door of every publichouse from 9 to 10 in in the morning and from 3 to 5 in the evening if this clause is carried, in order to ensure that the publican is not taking undue advantage of the law. That will be especially so in the case of mixed traders.  I want to know from the Minister if he has investigated the question regarding the number of people likely to be disemployed and if he is prepared to give compensation to those who will be so disemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1188" /> On the merits of his reply my vote will depend.  But unless the Minister is prepared to give some consideration to those who are thrown out of employment, I will vote against the proposal for the two-hour closing, because it will undoubtedly add to the number of unemployed in the cities, without in any way making for the more effective control of the licensing business of the country.</P>

      <P>I should like to get from Deputy Davin some explanation as to how this immense unemployment is to arise as a result of the operation of this clause.  The sub-section in question proposes to close publichouses in the cities between the hours of 3 and 5&mdash;not the busiest hours of the day, by any means, in the four cities.  The publichouse will be staffed not in accordance with the requirements of the whole day's trading but in accordance with the requirements of the busiest hours of the day. How the publican is to reduce his staff because his house is to be closed during two of the quietest hours of the day, is a question I cannot understand without further explanation from the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I stated that I was informed that a deputation representing the Grocers Assistants' Association had met the Minister and discussed this matter with him for a considerable time.  I gave figures which would show that 130 assistants would be disemployed. The Minister says that the figure is 133.5.  That only shows the ridiculous way in which he is treating this serious subject.  There are 40 publichouses in the city of Dublin employing three assistants and over.  Any businessman can see that the services of one man at least can be dispensed with in each of these 40 houses if this clause is put into operation in its present form.</P>

      <P>Deputies voting <Col N="1190" /> for the Second Reading knew what they were voting for.  Let us take stock since it is necessary.  I think it will probably save the time of the Dáil. I indicated on the Second Reading with regard to the endorsement section that I was prepared to bring in an amendment on Committee, enabling a trader with an endorsement to sell a clear licence provided he satisfied the court that that was a bona fide transaction. That is a matter that has no temperance aspect whatsoever.  It is a matter of justice, of the soundness of which I was entirely convinced.  Without it the endorsement system, and the possibility of endorsement, was injuring the credit of traders, even those who were running their shops on perfectly correct lines.  It is not a temperance aspect one way or another.  The offer was that if Deputies wished I was prepared to vest in the District Justice that degree of discretion which the original proposal vested in the Circuit Judge, conditional on appeal to the Circuit Judge.  With regard to these things Deputies who voted solidly against the Second Reading of the Bill tried to have it every way by suggesting it was a grievance that I should indicate on the Second Reading my willingness to agree to this modification in detail.</P>
      <P>This Bill is based on the report of a public Commission, and on that public Commission there sat a member of the Farmers' Party in this House, and a Senator member of the Labour Party.

Surely I am entitled to point out that Deputies of the Farmers' Party, of the Labour Party, and of Deputy Magennis' Party who voted solidly against the Second Reading of the Bill, ought not to come along on Committee Stage and take up an attitude of being aggrieved.

But on this Bill, Deputies want it the other way&mdash;&ldquo;we who stand for temperance,&rdquo; said Deputy Magennis yesterday, having voted against the Second Reading of the Bill.  With regard to the proposal for split hours, the Bill in this particular represents a provision which I believe ought, without hesitation, to be passed by the Dáil.  I am strongly in favour of the 3-5 break in the day in county boroughs, and I do not consider that there is anything harsh or unreasonable in that.  Deputies think otherwise.  I am prepared to leave this 3-5 break to a free vote of the Dáil.  I have no expectation whatever that Deputies have yet the moral courage and sense of public interest that would bring them into the Lobby in favour of that proposal.</P>

      <P>I have reason to know that Deputies are not yet sufficiently emancipated, and having compassion on their weakness I hold myself ready to accept accommodation on this matter at a later stage, but if Deputies want this proposal put to a free vote of the Dáil so that the responsibility for its acceptance or rejection may lie on individual Deputies, irrespective of Party, then surely I, who favour the proposal, ought to have no objection.  If the proposal in the Bill, as it stands, were carried, then I would not bring in an amendment on Report Stage to delete it, and substitute a one-hour break instead of a two-hour break.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Redmond referred to the difficulty of administering the two hours' break with the mixed houses open.  That is a difficulty we are prepared to undertake, and I am not as pessimistic as the Deputy, nor have I as low an opinion of the licensed trade, in the matter of the observance of the law, as the Deputy seems to have.  I think if that provision was passed by the Oireachtas that it would be observed by the great majority of the licensed trade in these county boroughs, and observed strictly and honourably. The few weaker vessels who lapsed would, in due course of time, be detected and dealt with.  That represents my position on this matter.  I am perfectly willing to allow the proposal as it stands to go to a free vote of the Dáil as I promised on Second Reading. <Col N="1194" /> If it were carried I should be very pleased and my opinion of Deputies generally would have improved considerably, but if it is not carried, and I am afraid it will not, then on the Report Stage I will bring forward, as a matter of confidence, a proposal that there be a one hour break in the day, that one hour being a complete closing for mixed houses as for the others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that, on Second Reading Stage of this Bill, among the principles which we approved was one limiting facilities for the retail sale of intoxicating liquor. The particular section that we are dealing with proposes to limit the sale of intoxicating liquor during certain hours of the day.  I feel bound to justify my vote on this question because of certain statements I made on the Second Reading of the Bill and of <Col N="1195" /> certain statements I made elsewhere. I propose to vote for the Bill as it stands, although I have expressed doubts and gave perhaps a reserved promise that I would vote against this provision.  I have realised that there are certain defects from the point of view of the trade in the section.  It seemed to me to impose certain conditions on the licensed holder without, as it appeared to me, adequate advantage to the social well-being.  I have now come to a different conclusion, and I propose to say a few words to justify my attitude on this matter.  The Minister has pointed out time and time again, in the course of the discussion, that the Bill is based on the Report of the Liquor Commission.  This provision in the Bill was one of the recommendations of that Commission.  From my point of view, the Liquor Commission and the Bill proceed along a line which is vitiated by a wrong outlook.  The Minister, throughout the Bill, has dealt with it from the point of view of police administration rather than from the point of view of a reduction in the consumption of intoxicating liquor as a beverage.</P>
      <P>The Liquor Commission reported and stated certain principles which governed its report, and, no doubt, they are all very good in their own way, when they point out it is not the function of the law to make people good, that the essential function of the law is to maintain justice, preserve order, protect the community, and so on.  I think that is only part of the truth and, unfortunately, to my view, it is the acceptance of that as the whole truth, that destroys this measure and even makes the suggested change the Minister has been talking about less valuable as a temperance measure.  I think it is quite wrong to assume that the limit or function of the legislature and the law is to prevent people doing wrong.  I propose to vote for this provision, which limits the hours during which publichouses should be open, because it is reducing the facilities for drinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the justification for that goes beyond the proposition in this Liquor Commission Report and lies <Col N="1196" /> beyond the police administration aspect.  After all we have to consider the question not merely from the point of view of the trader or even of the consumer.  I believe that the attitude in regard to which this has been discussed has been mainly from the economic view-point or the restriction upon the satisfaction of appetites, quite legitimate, within limits, but nevertheless merely animal appetites. We cannot disassociate ourselves from our general knowledge of the effects of intoxicating liquor upon, let us say, five per cent. of the community.  We may well talk about the great majority of drinkers being moderate drinkers, that drunkenness is diminished and that the function of the law, in this matter, is merely to prevent disorder, but I am making the plea, and it is on this ground that I am supporting the Bill, that the function of the law in the matter is to limit the facilities for going wrong.</P>
    <P>We do, as a matter of fact, in practice limit the facilities for drug-taking. We do not hesitate to impose prohibitions upon gambling, as a practice, when it is pure gambling.  I suppose the police would be immediately on the track if, in the central part of O'Connell Street, a shop were to open as a purely gambling saloon, so that we do prohibit what might, in normal circumstances, be called a natural and legitimate appetite.  I think our plea should be that, if we find a social evil developing out of the undue facilities for taking intoxicating liquor, just as we would out of undue facilities for the consumption of noxious drugs, we have a right to do more than the Liquor Commission recommends; we have a right to limit these facilities, even when the evil is not as disastrous as drug-taking. After all, we know that to many people these unlimited facilities have the effect of creating a still further appetite in the same way as noxious drugs, what are called habit-forming drugs, create.  I think the limitation is justifiable, and I think, further, that the right approach to this matter is that the 95 per cent. of moderate drinkers, who are always masters of their appetites and of their will in this matter, might well be asked <Col N="1197" /> to give away something on behalf of the five per cent., or the one per cent. if you like, who we know as a matter of fact are not masters of their appetites, and who give way to undue drinking of intoxicating liquor.  One need not go into the evils resulting from it.  These are apparent and within the knowledge of everyone, but I am supporting this restriction, with such consequences as may ensue, on the ground that it is desirable to limit the facilities for the consumption of intoxicating liquor.  I think it is not too much to ask the great majority of liquor takers to sacrifice something for the common good in this matter, and for the protection of the weak minority who may have been hereditarily inclined to alcoholism but who may be prevented from disaster if, perchance, these restrictions are limited.</P>
    <P>Although it is not a matter which, I think, affects the average workman, this three to five opening, I know as a matter of experience that it does affect a considerable number of other classes, the intellectuals, artists, poets and commercial men.  I therefore, this evening, am in support of this proposal on the ground that it is limiting the facilities for the taking of intoxicating liquor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that I would have felt inclined to engage in this discussion, because I am not situated in a part of the country that is going to be affected, to any extent, whether the amendment is rejected or passed, if the Minister in charge of the measure did not see fit, in his accustomed style, to make an attack on our party and on the motives which inspire this party to action so far.  If the Minister had addressed himself to his own party, and lectured them on their want of moral courage, he would have no fear then of the results of the vote which he has put before the House.  The Minister is always very self-righteous, a strong man.  The combined moral courage of all the Deputies of the House never equals the moral courage of the Minister for Justice. He is going to go into the lobby, if he goes in alone, on this amendment, <Col N="1198" /> and his motives are always so worthy that those who oppose him must be always wrong.  If every Deputy were as narrow of vision as he, and were inclined to attribute as unworthy motives to others as he is, this would be a very unworthy assembly indeed. There are Deputies in this House just as keen for the promotion of temperance as the Minister.  I have not heard one word from the Minister in support of this section that would make me believe he is going to make one man in this country more temperate than he is if it goes through.</P>
      <P>I would like to consider this question apart altogether from personalities, by which, I do suggest, I am not influenced in the least.  But I am asking myself what effect is this amendment going to have on the cause of temperance? Has any plea been made to satisfy me that less drink is going to be consumed owing to this closing down for two hours in the day in Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Dublin?  I am not satisfied on that point.  On the other hand, the case has been made, and it is suggested to me by members of my own party who know the conditions in a couple of the four centres which will be affected, that the disadvantage that many people, the rural dwellers, will be at is going to be very great and very considerable.  I am referring to the rural dwellers who go into these cities to do their business and buy shop goods of various kinds. It would be a great disadvantage to them to have these places closed for two hours in the evening.  We have to consider the disadvantages on the one side against the possible, but very remote, chance of influencing a very limited number of people in the amount of alcohol they are going to take.  We have to balance one against the other and to see whether the case made by the Minister is sufficiently strong to justify us in accepting it.  I do not think the case is sufficiently strong for the two hours closing.  We may be taken to task for that here. The Minister is entitled to take us to task.  He is entitled to make charges against Deputies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He did not forget it; he is too careful.  He suggests that our Party is influenced by political motives, and that we are prepared to discount altogether the good that may come by an effort to promote temperance.  That is not fair to our Party.  While the Minister is entitled to select a couple of members of any Party for his applause, mar eadh, while he is prepared to do that, I want to tell him that every member of our Party is as anxious as he is to make social conditions better if we can be satisfied that the efforts of the Minister are tending towards that end.  Now, it has come to this&mdash;I believe that the Minister is not acting fairly, inasmuch as if he had acted fairly his intention of amending this section would have been down in the Order Paper to-day.  That is what he should have done.  Be fair to the House.</P>

      <P>That is not disclosing the intention, or what is going on behind the scenes.  If the Minister had his mind made up to go away from the section before he came in here, he should have been honest enough to put it down on the Paper and let the House see what his intentions were.  If he did that the House would be satisfied that he was playing straight.  The Minister knew before we came to this section at all what the opinion of the House was. But with all his iron will and moral courage and great leadership he does not feel convinced that he is able to command the support of the majority of his own Party to carry this section. And because he is not able to do that he wants to charge all other Parties with cowardice and unworthy motives and want of moral courage.  I think the Minister should change his tune.</P>

      <P>On a famous occasion Bismarck described his adversary, Lord Salisbury, as a lath painted to look like iron.  The admirers of the Minister for Justice&mdash;for he has admirers it seems&mdash;regard him as the real metal.  Yesterday I was foolish enough to think that he was making an honest attempt to play the part of the iron.  To-day he goes back to the despicable position he took up on the Second Reading.  He is now temporising and compromising in obedience to the pressure from within his own majority ranks.  He professed all through, even with regard to the proposal that we are now discussing, to base recommendations on the findings of the Liquor Commission.  But the alternative proposal that he puts forward to save himself from defeat upon this is in direct variance with the ideas of the Liquor Commission.  Yet he wants to have it both ways.  As Deputy Baxter pointed out, he wants to make it appear that he and he alone is the champion of temperance.  &ldquo;Alone I did it&rdquo; is to be the declaration when the historian of Ireland writes that it has become a sober country.  Now, the Minister does himself a great injustice in professing here, as he did in his last speech, to misunderstand why Deputies voted against him on the Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were to believe his account of the workings of his own mind we should think that he could contemplate no possibilities except these two&mdash; (a) temperance advocates who voted for, and (b) drunkenness or intemperance advocates who voted against the Bill. Speaking for myself, I am a temperance advocate, and the Minister knows well I have pursued that course vigorously and consistently from the first hour I had the honour to be a member here.  He will remember that when he introduced the Liquor Bill in the Provisional Parliament I was the only member who stood by his Bill, even when he was wobbling and wavering under pressure to surrender the third portion of it.  Now I voted against the Second Reading because I did not know what he was asking us to vote for.  I shall never, so long as I am a member of this House, give any Minister a <Col N="1201" /> blank cheque, and that is what the House was asked to do on the occasion of the Second Reading.  The printed Bill was before us, containing the proposal such as this, and others like it for restrictions of facilities for drinking.</P>
    <P>We knew from the Press that the meetings of the real Parliament had been held on two successive evenings, that there were ruptures threatened within the ranks of the majority, and that it was under pressure of that and to avoid disruption the Bill was to be re-handled, re-cast, and radically altered.  Here we have again a proposal at a later date, a proposal to re-cast it and to introduce further modifications.

Surely if he is in order in presenting this alternative of preferential proposals, I am in order, I submit, with all due respect to you, sir, to discuss it.  He cannot have it both ways.</P>
      <P>Although the Minister has abandoned his design of figuring as the strong man, he still clings to the reputation of being hard-hearted and firm in dealing with humanity, for, notwithstanding the pathetic appeal of Deputy Heffernan, he will not yield altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had an interesting chapter of the autobiography of Deputy Heffernan. It seems his yearnings, cravings and irresistible longings for refreshment are usually between three and five o'clock.  I should have thought that would have weighed with the Minister. There is a famous phrase of President Wilson, that his aim was to make the world safe for democracy.  Surely the Minister will make the world safe and convenient for Deputy Heffernan, no <Col N="1202" /> matter what the cost to the rest of the public and the welfare of the State.</P>
    <P>I submit it is not dealing properly with this House that at every stage of the discussion of a measure the Minister in charge of it should inform the House that if certain contingencies occur, or are likely to occur, in his estimate of them, that he will bring in something else instead.  From the first hour of the introduction of this Bill to the present moment, that has been its history.  I think the Ministers are not discharging their duty; they are certainly not considering the dignity of the House.</P>

I am certain that the members of his Party will not be influenced or aggrieved by any of the speeches delivered during the last half hour, but will go out, fairly and squarely, and act on their own opinions.  I appeal to the members of the Government Party to do their part freely when they are getting an opportunity of a free vote.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for Justice for sticking to his word.  I only hope in regard to a few more amendments that are there, that we will get a free vote of the House.  I am certain there are a great many Deputies on the right of me who are delighted to get a chance of voting freely this evening. After all, they are bound by a pledge and when they are loosed from that pledge no doubt they feel much easier in their minds.  Every one of us, from time to time, has had a pledge, every one of us as well as these men.  We are all Irishmen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure you that, unlike Deputy Heffernan, I will not be looking for a drink between three and five.  I make no boast of it.  I often looked for a drink between those hours.  I will draw the Minister's attention to the fact that there will be amendments later on just as important as this.  They are brought in by members of the Dáil to assist the <Col N="1203" /> Government in trying to regulate the licensed trade.  I think the Minister should meet us half way, and if there is any reasonable amendment I hope he will allow a free vote upon it just as he is doing in this case.  When we are getting a free vote it should not necessitate all the talk that we have had about it.</P>

      <P>I understand that perfectly well, but I want to make it clear to the House that if this amendment is defeated, it will be defeated on a specific point, simply because the Minister has made a promise that he will accept amendments on the Report Stage of the Bill.  That is why this amendment is going to be defeated now by the Government supporters. But for the Minister making this promise, this amendment would have gone through.  That is what I want to make clear.  I do not think any Deputy has the right to stand up here and indicate what he believes is going to happen on the next stage of the Bill.  This amendment is to delete the words from three to five, and I hope Deputies will recognise that if this amendment is not carried, and if this section is inserted <Col N="1205" /> in the Bill as it stands, it will mean a very large number of people will be unemployed in the four cities mentioned. I want to make that point quite clear, and, as the drafter of similar amendments, I appeal to the Dáil not to be led astray by any Government supporter in regard to this question.</P>

      <P>The position is not altogether clear at the moment. When the Minister spoke earlier in the day I understood from his statement that if the 3 to 5 portion of the section were carried he would bring in on the Report Stage an amendment changing it to a complete one-hour closing. Fortunately I was in the House when he made the second statement. I understand the position now is that if this amendment is carried he would not put forward an amendment confining the closing to one hour. Originally I considered that this closing down was not necessary, and it was a portion of the Bill with which I disagreed, but after hearing the able statement of the Minister on Second Reading and the plea which he made in regard to the long sitter and the possibility of people remaining too long in publichouses, I was converted to the idea that there ought to be split hours. Having been converted to that idea, I thought that the break of two hours would be too long, particularly in the centre of the city, and that one-hour closing would meet the case.  As a matter of fact, the Minister pointed out to-day that it would be much easier to carry out the provisions of the law if the arrangement was for a one-hour complete closing.  That being the case, I find myself in the position that whether I vote for or against this particular amendment an opportunity will be offered to change it later, if it is carried, to a one-hour complete closing.</P>

Otherwise, I submit, that what Deputy Johnson has pointed out is absolutely incontestable; that if the present printed amendment is not withdrawn the House gives a vote in favour of the Bill as drafted; and the amendment is, in fact, negatived and cannot be proposed again at a later stage.

I think, in view of the adroit manoeuvres of the Minister, the House should understand that he has violated his promise that the question of split hours be left to a free vote of the Dáil.

We were promised an open vote of the House and we are having an open vote with a tail tagged on to it. It is a different class of vote from what we were promised on the Second Reading Stage.  That may be regarded by the Minister as clever Party manoeuvring, but I do not regard it as a reasonable or even an honest way of meeting the particular crisis that has arisen in regard to that.</P>
      <P>I want to make one or two remarks regarding certain statements by the Minister.  He embarked on a platform speech in defence of his attitude, and he took advantage of the opportunity to answer certain statements I made down the country.  I would suggest to the Minister that the proper place to answer me is also in the country, and I am sure the Minister is perfectly capable of answering me in the country if he wants to.

As far as I know I would not at any time get more than ten votes from the publicans in the country, and whether I vote for or against the Bill the position would remain the same, so that I am not worried about that.  I want to be clear as to whether we can accept a Minister's word in this House.  There should be no dissembling about this matter.  I say the Minister's attitude on this matter is unworthy of him and unlike him.  We are not to have an absolutely free vote of the House.  If the Minister were to say it is a free vote, then if the House decides the hours 3 to 5 are to go out of the Bill, let them go out.  But he is not going to say that. He promised his own Party, and he told the House, that if the hours 3 to 5 were not left in the Bill he will, on the next stage, make it a matter of confidence that at least one hour will remain.  He did not say that on the Second Stage. I suggest that the Minister should think of the House as a whole as well as of his own Party.</P>

      <P>Matters are first considered and decided at a Party meeting, and then are presented to the House as accomplished facts&mdash;&ldquo;take them or leave them.&rdquo; It is not what is acceptable to the country but what is acceptable to the Minister's Party&mdash;it is a <Col N="1212" /> question of expediency.  I suggest to the Minister that if he and his Party were in a position to face the country to-morrow there would be an altogether different attitude and frame of mind with regard to this Bill.</P>

      <P>I am glad to see that there is one member of the Cumann-na-nGaedheal Party who thinks he has a good chance.  But I do say that we ought to be clear upon this matter.  The Minister has changed his ground considerably.  He has shifted his position altogether, in respect of this clause, from the position he took up on Second Reading, and it is little better than a trick to say that it is to be a free vote.  It is not to be a free vote, because his Party is told: &ldquo;If you carry this amendment we will make you vote for at least one hour, or out you go.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The attitude adopted by the Minister, as stated by the last two speakers, to say the least, is not playing fair by the House.  The Minister stated on Second Reading that he would leave the question as to whether there should be closing between the hours of 3 and 5 to a free vote of the House.  I understood, I think in common with most Deputies, that what was meant by that was that a vote, if it was to be taken, was to be final and decisive on this question.  Certainly that is the way any ordinary person would interpret his pledge.  But that is not the position we are in now.  The Minister says: &ldquo;No, if it goes one way, in the direction that I am in favour of, it shall be final, but if it goes the other way it shall not be final, and I shall bring in a further amendment on which I shall ask the members of my Party to obey the crack of the Party Whip.&rdquo; I say that that is not treating the subject or the Dáil fairly.  The understanding was&mdash;the Minister cannot get away from it&mdash;that this question of opening between these hours was to be left to a free vote.  Undoubtedly it is <Col N="1213" /> not now to be left to a free vote. &ldquo;Heads I win, tails you lose.&rdquo;  That is not my conception of a free expression of opinion.  The Minister has now very adroitly manoeuvred himself into the position that if the section as it now stands is passed he will be bound by it and by the decision of the House, but that if it is not passed he will not be bound by the decision of the House. Therefore, it comes to this, that he will not be bound by the free vote of the House in regard to this question.  I cannot see how he can get out of that.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that he does not regard a decision on this question of split hours as preventing him from coming along and making a further proposal.  That is all very well when the decision goes against him, but if the decision goes in his favour he does regard it as binding. He cannot have it both ways.  Will he say, if the decision goes against him, that he will allow the Dáil a free vote upon his suggestion for the one hour closing?  I presume he will not do so. He has already stated so.  Perhaps he will change his mind again in that respect, but he has already stated that he will not give the Dáil a free vote on the question of one complete hour closing if the decision on this question goes against him.</P>

      <P>I am very glad, indeed, to have that made clear, and I am indebted to Deputy Johnson&mdash;because I was not so sure of my ground in that respect&mdash;for pointing out that it would be possible for any Deputy, as well as the Minister, to move at a subsequent stage that the decision of the Dáil be altered by way of reducing the closing hours.  Be that as it may, the Minister cannot ride away on the quibble that he has endeavoured to put before the House to-night as the means of carrying out the solemn pledge that he gave in his Second Reading speech, that he was prepared to leave to a free vote of the Dáil this question as to whether there should be this two hours' closing or not.  I say that he is loading and has loaded the dice in the matter, and that instead of it being a free decision of the House it will be a decision which, no matter what way it goes, he will endeavour to make suit his own particular purpose.  I think that that is grossly unfair to the spirit and to the whole system of Ministerial responsibility in this House, and unfair to the House itself.  It is inconsistent with anything in the nature of government by responsible men, men who should be responsible for the natural inferences to be drawn from their public statements, and I think it is a pity, from the point of view of the Minister himself, that he has endeavoured to trick the House in this regard.  When the time comes to vote on this amendment I hope that every Deputy will realise that what he is voting on is not to decide whether there shall be these opening hours or not, but, in the first <Col N="1215" /> place, if the amendment is carried, to give the Minister a further opportunity of making a fresh proposal, and if the amendment is lost, to make the Bill an Act in its original form.</P>

      <P>It appears to me that a new point has arisen as a result of the point made by Deputy Johnson and Deputy Redmond; that is, that a private member can move an amendment to alter the decision of the House from two hours to one hour.  I am in favour of the one hour closing, and I would ask the Minister, if the two hours closing is carried now, whether there will be a free vote on any amendment by a private Deputy to change that to one hour?  I think there would be a good deal less discussion if that point was made clear now.</P>

      <P>Certainly, as far as I am concerned.  I would be rather surprised if the Dáil, having solemnly voted for a two-hour break, were to turn round on the Report Stage and vote to have that reduced to one hour. On the other hand, I would not be surprised&mdash;it is a thing I would hope&mdash; if the Dáil, having decided that there should not be a two-hours break, were to decide at a later stage of the Bill that there should be a one-hour break.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is on that point I wanted to get information, because <Col N="1216" /> there is a number of Deputies who will vote for a one-hour closing in preference to this two-hours' closing. What we are asked to do now is to close the houses from 3 to 5.  A case has been put to me that arises on that point, and we will have no opportunity of putting this point forward if this section is carried.  There is a number of licensed houses in Dublin at present doing a luncheon trade.  They make provisions and alter their premises in order to do that trade, and they ask that they should be considered in whatever closing hour is agreed upon.  It is pointed out that 3 o'clock is rather early to close down houses which have made arrangements to carry on a luncheon trade and that are competing with some of the hotels and restaurants. I think if the Minister would test the feeling of the House on the amendment as regards the two-hour closing, let the one-hour be decided on later on and not fix the closing hour now.</P>

      <P>I was absent during much of the discussion, and what I have heard is more or less befogging. I am against Deputy Heffernan's amendment, because it provides for no break, and I believe there should be a break.  I am, however, against a two-hours break, and I would like to be afforded an opportunity at some stage of this Bill, to vote for a one-hour closing.  I intend to vote against Deputy Heffernan's amendment, because I am in total disagreement with it.  I am ready to vote for an amendment at a later stage for an hour's break.  I might suggest to Deputy Heffernan that he strike a bargain with the Minister and offer to withdraw his amendment, if the Minister said he would himself bring in an amendment providing for an hour's break.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. NORTON Mr. NORTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hennessy, apparently, has a very quick and easy way of satisfying his own mind and his desires.  He says he will vote <Col N="1217" /> against Deputy Heffernan's amendment, which objects to the two-hours closing, but that he will support an hour's closing.  But the Minister, who has, no doubt, got a certain responsibility in this matter, states that if Deputy Heffernan's amendment is defeated, Deputy Hennessy is not going to have any opportunity of having a one-hour's closing; the Minister is going to regard this as a final and decisive vote.  How Deputy Hennessy, in face of that fact, can console himself, passes my comprehension.  I suggest he should put down an amendment himself, and I hope he will have more enthusiasm for it than he has now.</P>
      <P>I voted for the Second Reading of the Bill largely because of the fact that I am convinced&mdash;and nothing has happened in the meantime to change my conviction&mdash;that there are too many publichouses in the country and that a much lesser number of publichouses would satisfy legitimate public demands, but I indicated then that I was not satisfied with the Bill as it stood. I took objection to certain phases of the Bill, and this is one of them.  I intend to vote for the amendment, but in doing so I want to say that I am not in the slightest way influenced by the propaganda carried on by an interested party.  I am considering the matter from the point of view of the man in the street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to the case the Minister had to make for the 3 to 5 closing in the county boroughs.  He talked on the Second Reading of the &ldquo;long sitter,&rdquo; but we got no evidence as to what numbers of &ldquo;long sitters&rdquo; exist.  We <Col N="1218" /> got no police statistics to show that a 3 to 5 closing was absolutely desirable or that it was essential from any point of view.  The Minister proposes that this 3 to 5 closing should only take place in certain cities, but that elsewhere, where the need may be greater, there is to be no 3 to 5 closing.  In making an exception in certain cases one would expect him to prove the need for the 3 to 5 closing in those other places.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made no case as to why there should be a 3 to 5 closing in the exempted cities.  It seems to me &mdash;and I think it is the view of those engaged in the business&mdash;that a 3 to 5 closing will not only be an inconvenience to the ordinary man in the street&mdash;and I am more concerned about him than anybody else&mdash;but that in addition it will mean a certain amount of unemployment in the trade.  Such a closing does not necessarily mean that the employees will get off from 3 to 5.  It may mean that, although they are not engaged attending at the bar, they will be utilised for some other kind of work, and in that way a publican, who now employs a staff of five or six, may find that he can do with one less.  That, together with the fact that I cannot personally observe any particular abuse of publichouses between 3 and 5, induces me to declare that I intend to vote for the amendment.</P>
    <P>Question put&mdash;&ldquo;That the words &lsquo;between the hours of 3 o'clock and 5 o'clock in the afternoon&rsquo; stand part of sub-section (1) (a).&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) (a) to insert after the word &ldquo;evening,&rdquo; line 32, the words &ldquo;provided that, in the case of premises licensed only for the sale of intoxicating liquor to be consumed off the premises, nothing in this sub-section shall restrict the sale of intoxicating liquor between the hours of three o'clock and five o'clock in the afternoon on any day on which the premises are closed at or before six o'clock in the evening.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find myself in strong support of the Minister in his wish to restrict the hours of opening of licensed premises, yet I am in the position of having to propose an amendment which has the apparent purpose of going against that.  But I think a little explanation will make the discrepancy clear.  I do not think that in the wording of the Bill the position of the person who has what is called an off-licence has been fully considered.  My attention has been drawn to the fact that if the wording of the Bill were adhered to certain houses, that deal in intoxicating liquor, but have no licence for consumption on the premises, and that are only entitled to sell for consumption off the premises, and do not keep open except between the hours of 10 and 5 o'clock&mdash;seldom as late as 6 o'clock&mdash;would be very seriously affected.  In their case the restriction on an eleven-hour day is already in operation.  They are only as a rule selling for eight hours per day.  If the further restriction were to be applicable to them&mdash;namely, that they could not open between 3 and 5&mdash;it would mean that they could only carry on their business between the hours of 10 and 3&mdash;that is to say, that business would be restricted to a five-hour day. I do not think that is intended.  I have no feeling that the words I have suggested will actually be the words which will be adopted, but in all probability the Minister will be prepared to consider the case I have cited and see whether he really wished to deal with these premises in this way, so as to reside <Col N="1221" /> strict their hours to that extent.  In actual operation it would mean that these places of business would have every day in the week a half-holiday. Even if they keep open at present from 10 to 6, if they had to close down between 3 and 5, it would probably mean that they would not open for the extra hour after 5 o'clock.  Whether they could carry on with this constant half-day in the regular course of things is doubtful.  All I want to secure is to get an undertaking from the Minister that he will look into the matter very closely between this and the Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will look at line 10, page 4, of the Bill, in the definitions, he will see that &ldquo;licensed premises&rdquo; there is defined to mean, except in part 4 of the Act, &ldquo;premises in respect of which a licence for the sale, by retail, of intoxicating liquor has been granted and is in force.&rdquo;  As I said a while ago, for a long time, since 1872, there have been no particular prohibited hours prescribed for wholesalers.  The retailer, the person with the off-licence, as it is called, has been in a different position, and in the Bill it is proposed that the closing that applies to the ordinary licensed houses shall apply also to the off-licences&mdash;that drink be not sold there during these hours.  It is not unlikely that without that provision one result might be, that you would have people buying drink from the off-licence holders and drinking it round the streets or in the lanes during the hours in which other premises are closed.  If there are special cases, if there are cases in which a distinction can reasonably be drawn, that is a matter that I would be prepared to look into.  At the moment you take the three divisions&mdash;the wholesaler, the off-licence retailer, and the on-licence retailer; I would not be prepared to say that during the hours which the on-licence retailer is compelled to close, or at any rate, close the licensed portion of his premises, as in the case of a mixed trading house, under the Bill, as it stands, the off-licence holder should be free to sell drink.  Consequently the licensed premises mentioned there in line 10 are premises in <Col N="1222" /> respect of which a licence for the sale by retail of intoxicating liquor has been granted and all these premises, &ldquo;on and off,&rdquo; are covered by the provisions of Section 2.  If the Deputy can make a case against that, it is something I am prepared to consider, but that is our position under the Bill as it stands.</P>

      <P>I am not sure that the Minister has fully apprehended the purposes of this amendment.  It is intended to apply only to cases of large wine merchants who sell by retail in bulk.  I think in most cases their licences are so limited that they cannot sell less than a dozen bottles of spirits or wine.</P>
      <P>These people carry on business within strictly limited hours.  There are very few of them open after 5 p.m. It would almost mean paralysis to their business if this provision were inserted in the Bill.</P>

I have bought from them one or two dozen bottles of wine at a time. The arrangement proposed in this section will be intensely inconvenient, because they will have to keep their premises closed altogether during this time.  A great deal of their trade is done, I am sure, in the country.  They have to despatch the wine to the country. I am not a lawyer and the Minister is.  Perhaps he would tell us the position as regards delivery.  These firms deliver by motor van in the suburbs.  Is delivery part of the sale?

      <P>The point of sale is the point at which the goods are appropriated to the buyer.  If there are difficulties arising under that section, they are difficulties which eminently require investigation between this and the Report Stage.  Possibly, the most satisfactory course would be if these people or their representatives came in and discussed their position with me in the Department.  The Deputy mentioned that these people are not allowed to sell less than a particular quantity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, Deputy Thrift's amendment covers the cases of off-licence sales on a small scale.  If, in the cause of temperance, it be arranged that from 2 to 5 in the afternoon drink is not procurable for consumption on the premises, it will be open always for those who seek to have drink during those hours to have recourse to the house with the off-licence and to buy sufficient stock to drink at home or elsewhere, so that the acceptance of the amendment, precisely as it stands, will not make for the cause of temperance.  On the contrary, it will conduce to a particular form of intemperance which is very difficult to eradicate.  There is a case, undoubtedly, for the type of trader that Deputy Cooper has in mind, but, then, it requires very careful drafting, so that a door shall not be opened for a form of traffic which would be very deleterious.</P>

      <P>I am concerned about Saturday more than any other day of the week.  A number of speeches dealt with this matter of opening hours. Notwithstanding the fact that Deputy Redmond's amendment was defeated, I think there is still hope that the licensed trade in the country should be allowed to open an hour earlier on Saturdays than on the other week days.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>This trade gives a good deal of employment.  If work is not started until 10 o'clock these shops will not be able to supply their customers before 11 o'clock.  It would take an hour to get these places ready for business. If houses cannot be opened until 10 o'clock on Saturdays it will be 11 o'clock before any business is done.  I want the Minister to give some concession to people who are contributing so largely to the revenue of the country, to enable them to continue to do so.  I think it is only right that licensed premises should be allowed to open for the sale of intoxicating drink, and for the necessaries of life from 8 o'clock in the morning.  Take the case of a grocer's shop where bacon or sugar is sold, or the case of a green grocer. These premises can be opened at 7 o'clock in the morning, and there is no legislation to stop them, although they do not contribute to the revenue in anything like the same proportion as the licensed trade.  I hope the Minister will have some consideration for those in the licensed trade, so that they may be allowed to open at eight o'clock on Saturdays.  If a man is a mixed trader he will be unable to sell tea, sugar, <Col N="1226" /> wine, tobacco or bacon, until nine o'clock.  While there is provision in Section 3 for mixed trading, I am asking that the opening hour should be made 8 o'clock on Saturday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to accept the amendment, that licensed premises should be enabled to open at 8 o'clock on Saturday.  I do not see any reason why they should open any earlier on Saturdays than on other days.  The Dáil has taken the view that 10 o'clock is sufficiently early for licensed premises to open for the sale and consumption on the premises of intoxicating liquor.  In Section 3 there is a proposal to mitigate that to the extent of allowing houses that do a mixed business to open at 9 o'clock, so that between 9 and 10 a.m. the non-licensed portion only of the business may be carried on.  In Section 3, sub-section (1) (a) and (b), that provision is made for county boroughs and for urban county districts.  I will have a word to say later on Section 3, sub-section 1, and these divisions, where the 9 to 10 facility is given for mixed houses.  Dealing now only with county boroughs as covered by Section 2, sub-section 1, I see no case whatever for the Deputy's amendment that licensed premises should open at 8 o'clock on Saturdays, giving incidentally on Saturday, according to the terms of the Bill, over 12 hours of a drinking day. I oppose the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that I am not putting this amendment forward on the instructions of any traders. I put it forward because I consider, as a working man, that it is necessary to have such places open on Saturday a couple of hours earlier than on other week-days.  The Bill specifies that Saturday is not to be taken as an ordinary week-day.  Saturday is a day on which a large number of people come to the city.  Some of them arrive by the 7.30 train in the morning after having, perhaps, travelled most of the night.  They cannot get refreshments on arrival unless they can afford to go to hotels.  It is not every person can afford to do that and to pay the prices charged in hotels.  The Minister should, at least, have some consideration for the <Col N="1227" /> ordinary people who come to the cities on Saturday mornings and enable them to get refreshments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>We have now taken a decision by a great majority in favour of split hours on week-days. But the matter is not ended there.  As we have learned it is open to any Deputy to move a subsequent amendment reducing these closing hours on week-days, and I presume the same will obtain with regard to Saturdays.  We have also the assurance of the Minister for Justice that it will be left to the free vote of the House.  In view of these considerations I do not intend to advance any argument on the question of split hours on Saturdays.</P>

      <P>I am sure that the Minister for Justice will realise that 9.30 on Saturday nights is rather an unreasonable hour to close the houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not an advocate of drunkenness, and it is not from that point of view that I am moving this amendment. If I had my way I would like to see everyone in the country temperate.  In my opinion, closing publichouses on a Saturday night at 9.30 will not mean promoting temperance.  I think it will have the contrary effect, because a labouring man obliged to remain at home while his wife is out shopping will not be able to get a drink if he goes out on her return.  If the publichouses <Col N="1228" /> are closed, or on the point of closing, what he will do is to take a half gallon or a half-dozen of stout to his home and consume it there.  I think it would be far better if the publichouses were open until 10 o'clock, and let him consume his drink there rather than in his own home in the presence of his children The Minister is not preventing the capitalist from getting drunk on a Saturday night at 9.30.  He can get drink in his club.  What I complain of is that workers are prevented from getting a drink on a Saturday night by this 9.30 closing.  If the Minister ever had to live in a small house he would be aware of all the jobs that the woman of the house has to do on a Saturday night.  The husband, as a rule, goes out when she is doing her work, and where is he to go to if he has not the publichouse?  In most cases the publichouse is the drawing-room of the ordinary worker.  In these circumstances I think it would be better if the publichouses were allowed to remain open until 10 o'clock, because it would mean that men would not be taking home drink with them.  I hope the Minister will accept my amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lyons has made an admirable case for early closing.  If we are to accept his picture of life among the working classes, then we must regard him as a sort of Irish Maxim Gorki.  He has given us a lurid picture of their debased and degraded form of living.  I refuse to accept his account as a true picture, that unless we allow a working man to remain for prolonged hours in publichouses on Saturday nights the only alternative is that he should go home and be a nuisance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely considering from an outsider's point of view the situation as depicted by our novelist, Deputy Lyons.  If the working man is not allowed to remain soaking in liquor in the publichouse, then he will buy quarts or gallons&mdash;I do not know which he said&mdash;of drink to bring home with him, and he will teach the young idea how to shoot, or, rather, <Col N="1229" /> how to drink.  Could any evidence be stronger in favour of the temperance crusade than what Deputy Lyons brings forward?  Does he not conceive it possible to have temperance halls or some form of decent recreation for working class people in the county boroughs?  He has an idea also of class equality.</P>
      <P>As an upholder of democracy he believes the workman must be conceded the privilege of getting drunk because those who are wealthy have facilities for it in their clubs.  That is a most extraordinary form of reasoning.  I am afraid the Deputy is over-impressed with the old saying &ldquo;drunk as a lord,&rdquo; so that he conceives drunkenness is a privilege, and that there is class inequality unless facilities are provided for the poor as well as the rich.  He does not understand that the whole purport of this legislation is to renew the conditions of life in the country and provide for standards of decent living, to try and force those who are not willing to live a proper life to conform to the requirements of society.</P>

      <P>There are more domestic nuisances among professors than among the ordinary working men.  I did not put forward this amendment with the intention of degrading the ordinary worker, whom I represent. 9.30 on Saturday night is not at all suitable to the average working man. If Deputy Magennis is lucky enough <Col N="1230" /> to be a member of the Kildare Street Club and can get a drink up to 11 o'clock on a Saturday night, the men I represent have not the privilege of being members of such a club.  I sin cerely hope that if they could they would not become members.  I do not agree with Deputy Magennis that this amendment degrades the worker and makes him a drunkard.  It is well known to every Deputy that if liquor is taken home by anyone children in the house are going to get some of it.  I am speaking of Dublin, not of Mullingar. I want to prevent that.  I want such an individual to be able to get drink until 10 o'clock on Saturday night, and I want to prevent him taking home intoxicating liquor.  If he partakes of the beverage before his children those children will long for the taste of the particular form of alcohol that the parent is interested in.  If you do not allow the publichouse to be open till 10 o'clock then prevent the aristocrat from having a shebeen in his own house.  Furthermore, close down clubs such as the Kildare Street Club, and others, not catering for the interests of the working classes.</P>

I do not want particularly to know why Mullingar, with a population of over 5,000 is not urbanised.  It seems to me the difference as between having an urban council or town commission need not be the basis of discrimination against it in the matter of the division the town falls into.

They might not have travelled the requisite distance, and to make the hour ten in the morning instead of nine for these districts is, I submit, even a greater curtailment than in regard to county boroughs.  I presume, however, that the Minister will adopt the same attitude in regard to these.  I do not think it will be necessary for me to press the matter, except to point out with regard to towns which are not county boroughs that ten o'clock in the morning will certainly be inconvenient to some people who may have to enter the towns from distances which would not render them bona fide travellers.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment 15:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2) to delete paragraph (c) and substitute two new paragraphs as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(c) on any Sunday before the hour of 1 o'clock in the afternoon, or after the hour of 5 o'clock in the afternoon, or</P>
      <P>(d) at any time on Christmas Day, Good Friday, or St. Patrick's Day.</P>
      <P>I am asking that publichouses be opened on Sundays from one until five. That would be four hours.  If I am allowed to correct it, I would ask to have the opening hours from 1 to 3 o'clock and from 5 to 7, for the following reasons:&mdash;From 1 to 3 would suit the agricultural community coming out from last Mass.  They could go and have any refreshment they needed in the village, or do any other business they liked in the publichouse.  From 5 to 7 would suit hurling or football matches.  I am moving this amendment conditional on the 3 mile limit being defeated.</P>
      <P>If I could anticipate that the three mile limit will not be allowed to stand, then I think we are entitled to some consideration in the country.  A man who is working all the week, and who has to travel three miles to get reasonable refreshment, should be given some consideration.  I ask the Minister, if he has made up his mind not to allow us the three mile limit, to consider granting the four hours opening that I am seeking.  I understand the Minister would be disposed to give three hours, say from 2 to 5.  The difference would not be much.  The Minister, I know, is against a long sitting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>No, in the publichouse. If the publichouses are open from 1 to 3 and from 5 to 7 it will accommodate the people who may want to do business in the villages, and who may be anxious to meet one another and have an interchange of opinion.  By opening from 5 to 7 there will be no such thing as looking for special licences for football matches and other things. All these things cost money. I ask the Minister to consider whether this would not be a good substitute for the three-mile limit, the bona fide traveller difficulty, or the six-mile limit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">

      <P>A number of questions arise for decision.  The first is, shall there be an opening for any period on Sundays, and, if so, for what period?  Then again, shall there be an opening on St. Patrick's Day, and, if so, for what period?  I suggest that to get a decision on the first matter, namely, shall there be an opening at any period on Sundays, the first question put should be: &ldquo;In Section 2 (2) (c) that the words &ldquo;at any time on any Sunday&rdquo; should stand.  If these words stand, that disposes of any opening on any Sunday.  If these words are deleted, the question of what kind of opening on Sundays will be allowed, can be decided.  The same will apply with regard to St. Patrick's Day.  In order to get a decision as to whether there shall be any opening at any time on Sunday, I will simply put the question: Section 2 (2) (c) that the words &ldquo;at any time on any Sunday stand.&rdquo;  If that is decided in the affirmative, the question of whether they will open on Sundays does not arise at all.  The same will apply to St. Patrick's Day. That will dispose of not only Deputy Daly's amendment, but also of amendment 16, which raises the same point, namely, shall there be any opening on Sundays or St. Patrick's Day.</P>

      <P>The difficulty is to discuss this proposal apart from the question of the bona fide traffic, which is dealt with in another portion of the Bill.  As I said on Second Reading, Sunday is the most difficult day of all to legislate for in this matter of the sale <Col N="1236" /> and consumption of intoxicating drink. When we come to the bona fide traffic provisions, I am prepared to listen very attentively and give every consideration to the views that may be expressed from any portion of the House.  I am not entirely satisfied with the provisions of the Bill on that question.  I am not conscious of any great conviction as to the merits of the proposals, while recognising that it is very hard to find any ideal regulations for that day, and that there is great diversity of view amongst the general public on the matter.</P>
      <P>The proposal of Deputy Daly is to have a limited opening in the larger towns.  I am not prepared to consider any extension at all of the facilities that exist in the four county boroughs except on a basis of complete abolition of the bona fide traffic.  I think it is impossible to discuss the two things apart.  I do not want to be understood as saying that, conditional on a complete abolition of the bona fide traffic, I would agree to this extension throughout the State of the 2 to 5 facilities that exist in Dublin, Cork and the other two cities.  If there is a substantial volume of opinion in the Dáil in favour of that course, it is something that should be very carefully considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bona fide business is, and has been for a long time, the subject of well-merited condemnation, and the proposal to shift the distance is not really a solution in any degree at all. It has the effect, no doubt, of wiping out one set of vested interests and creating another set of vested interests further on.  In so far as it leans against anyone, it leans against the pedestrian, who is, perhaps, the most genuine traveller of the lot, and it makes no substantial difference whatever to the man who travels by train, motor car, motor bicycle, or by the popular bus, which is an increasing feature of the landscape.  Therefore, while I put down these provisions in the Bill bearing on the question of Sunday, I am receptive to any reasonable suggestion with regard to that day.  I will not consider an extension of such facilities as exist in four of the cities at present, except on the basis of the disappearance, root <Col N="1237" /> and branch, of the bona fide traffic.  I would not accept, in any ease, the hours which Deputy Daly inserts in his amendment, and my attitude on it now is simply to ask the Dáil to reject it. The entire matter of Sunday trading can be considered when we come to the portion of the Bill dealing with bona fide traffic.</P>

I would be in a better position to do so then, as I will know the fate of the bona fide traveller. Bearing in mind that I will be at liberty to bring the matter forward on the Report Stage, I ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>May I be at liberty to remind so old a Deputy as Deputy Daly that for years and years and for generations there was a long-sustained fight in Great Britain and Ireland against Sunday opening?  The Sunday closing movement was one of the most enthusiastic movements for social reform and it triumphed.  I protest, if there is no other voice but mine to protest, against undoing all that social reform and bringing in an amendment sanctioning the opening of publichouses on Sundays.</P>
