      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if prior to January 1st, 1927, county councils were permitted to make an allowance of £5 each in the tax of motor cars made before 1913; if at present no such allowance is being given by the councils or by the Finance Department and if the Minister will explain why this concession has been refused to owners of the cars specified.</P>

      <P>It is presumed that the Deputy refers to the rebate of 25 per cent. which was allowed by Registration Authorities in accordance with paragraph 6 of the Second Schedule to the Finance Act, 1920, in respect of private motor cars, the engines of which were constructed before the first day of January, 1913, Under paragraph 6 of the Third Schedule to the Finance Act, 1926, the same rebate is allowed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health with the addition that it applies to six-seater hackney vehicles as well as private cars.  All such repayments are now made by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health after due inquiry and not by the county councils as heretofore.  Repayment cannot be refused by that Minister in any case in which it is proved to his satisfaction that the statutory conditions have been fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was never, at any time, any <Col N="2472" /> general allowance of £5 as stated by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if the Committee of Inquiry into Resignations and Dismissals from the Royal Irish Constabulary reported that it considered as caused by national sympathies the withdrawals of certain members from that force in the period between the 1st April, 1916, and the 11th July, 1921, who pleaded ill-health as the reason for such withdrawal and were paid gratuities by the British Government; if it was found subsequent to the passing of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923, that these men could not legally be regarded as coming within the definition of having resigned or having been dismissed and were consequently debarred from receiving any award under its terms and if he will state what action, if any, the Government proposes to take in regard to this matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether his attention has been drawn to the claim for compensation made by Mr. Patrick Doyle, of Ballygawley House, Sandford, County Dublin, upon the British Government (as the authority responsible for the Military Hospital, Leopardstown Park, Stillorgan, County Dublin) for damages and loss caused by a dangerous lunatic, who, as alleged, was negligently allowed to be at large on February 10th, 1925; that the offender, on being charged at the Dublin Circuit Court on 28th February, 1925, on charges of robbery, assault and malicious damage, was found to be insane and incapable of pleading, and whether he (the Minister) will make representations to the British Government on behalf of Mr. Doyle for favourable consideration of his claim.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly my point.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have a little guidance on this matter before we come to a decision.  I was not able to look up the provisions of the Constitution or even Standing Orders but it strikes me that, while the carrying over of measures from one <Col N="2479" /> session to another within a single Parliament is quite justifiable, it requires more convincing argument to warrant the carrying over of Bills from one Parliament to another.  That would apply to Private Bills as well as to Public Bills.  The object of a dissolution is to get the verdict of the people on matters of legislation as well as of administration.  To ask that a Bill shall be carried over in its existing stage at the close of one Parliament to the beginning of another Parliament is, it seems to me, asking the new Parliament to confirm matters upon which they are supposed to form an entirely new judgment.  I think the matter requires more consideration than a merely formal motion of this kind would suggest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Deputy to understand that this particular motion deals only with Private Bills.  It is due to the promoters that we should re-affirm our view that a Bill should be presented to the new Parliament in the stage which it has reached on the dissolution of the old Parliament.  Expenses are very heavy in this connection and some considerable consideration should be given to promoters.  This procedure does not limit the power or authority of the new Parliament to amend, reconsider or deal as they think fit with any measure.  This arrangement safeguards, to as great an extent as possible, the unusual expense of promotors in the case of delays which were presumably unavoidable.  There is, at the moment, before the Oireachtas one Bill which was delayed through the action of this House.  It was delayed because of the immense amount of business the House had before it, and it would be harsh treatment if the body responsible for the cost were to be involved in extra expense on that account.  In this case, the promoters happen to be one body and the persons who would have to pay the costs another body.  In that case, as the body responsible for the payment had no locus standi in regard to limiting the costs it is due to us to see that no unncessary expense should be imposed on them.  The new Parliament <Col N="2480" /> will not be restricted by any action we take in this case.  The Bill will be merely presented to them with our benediction, if I may put it that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Johnson that this motion is entirely unprecedented.  I do not think a Bill has ever been carried over in this manner before, but I think the President's attitude is the right and wise one, because it was due to the action of the Dáil, or to the action of the Government, that this Bill was delayed. The promoters of the Bill complied with Standing Orders and did everything that was necessary.  It was due to the desire of the Government to examine the matter more fully and more closely than it would be possible to do otherwise that consideration of the Bill was delayed.  Under this motion the Bill will not be removed from the power of the new Parliament in any degree whatsoever. It will be open to the new Dáil to refer it to a Private Bill Committee or to reject it when it comes back to the Joint Committee, if it so desires.</P>
      <P>All these amendments mean that the promoters of the Bill will not have to pay over again the fees in respect of stages which the Bill has gone through.  The power of the Dáil and the power of the Seanad will continue. I do not think it is a reasonable proposition that the promoters of the Bill should be asked to pay twice when it was entirely through the action of the Dáil that the delay took place.  I think it is unprecedented, but I believe we can create a wise precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not against the remission of the fees.  I can appreciate that point.  I think if the resolution confined itself to that I would have no objection whatever, but there is the other point of view, that this course for a new House may involve the promoters in greater expense without any prospect of that expense being recouped. We had a discussion on the Port and Docks Bill.  I do not know what the Private Bill is that Deputy Cooper refers to, but on the Port and Docks Bill it was pointed out by the President that it was unfair to the promoters of a Bill to lead them into expense <Col N="2481" /> and then at a later stage to reject the Bill.  What is the position in regard to this proposal?  A new House is to be elected.  The proceedings up to date will be resumed by the new Private Bill Committee, and greater expenses will be involved without any previous Second Reading discussion on the Bill.  All the expenses that will be involved will be incurred by the promoters of the Bill, and then it comes into the new Dáil which is of a different composition and would not have given a Second Reading if it had an opportunity.  It may reject the Bill on the Final Stages, and all the expenses which have been incurred will have been absolutely lost.  It is on that ground I think this procedure is faulty.  You are not really avoiding double expenses, but you are leading the promoters to incur much greater expenses in the Committee Stage inquiry of a Private Bill, and then a new House with entirely different views from the old one, may say we are not having any of this Bill, and all the expenses will have to be incurred for nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>This procedure is not unprecedented; it is, in fact the procedure adopted in Great Britain.  The Standing Orders proposed to be made refer to stages in the Seanad.  When the Oireachtas reassembles it will be impossible for a Joint Committee to consider a Private Bill unless the new Dáil has taken part in the setting up of such Joint Committee. At that particular stage, the expenses that Deputy Johnson speaks of cannot be incurred unless the new Dáil assents to the setting up of a Joint Committee on the particular Private Bill.  The new Dáil is, therefore, not in any way restricted; in fact, nothing that we can do could restrict the new Dáil. Therefore, the new Dáil will have at that particular point, before the promoters of a Private Bill will have incurred any further expenses, an opportunity of declaring whether it is or is not willing to set up a Joint Committee. It has been frequently pointed out here that the setting-up of a Joint Committee is equivalent to a Second Reading of a Private Bill as far as this House is concerned.</P>

The suggestion made is this, that if the cattle trade put up a proposition for the collection of this compensation either by the market authorities, the shipping companies or some outside authority, that I would ask the Dáil to give it, if necessary, legislative effect. That was a proposal that was put up already.  An alternative proposal was that they should be paid out of public funds.

      <P>I move: That the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 7.  After sub-section (6), a new sub-section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(7)  Where a holding or part of a holding which is excluded from the operation of the Land Act, 1923, solely by reason of or on account of its potential or actual value as building ground is held by the tenant under a lease containing no provision enabling the landlord to resume possession of such land for building purposes, then notwithstanding the absence of such provision the landlord may at any time during the period of five years mentioned in the foregoing sub-section, or such extended period as the Judicial Commissioner may fix as aforesaid, resume the holding, or the part of the holding so excluded, for the purpose of building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a period of six years during which a landowner might resume ground for building purposes.  In the case of a lease, the period ran from the expiration of the lease.  When the lease contained no provision for the resumption of land for building&mdash;for instance, it was a lease for 60 years&mdash;the landlord could not resume during that period for building.  There was an amendment moved in the Seanad that this period of six years should run from the end of the lease; that at the end of a 60 years' lease the landlord should have the right for six years <Col N="2487" /> longer to resume the land for building ground, and that during the whole of the period the land should not be purchased. As a compromise, this amendment was passed.  The amendment confers the right of resumption on the landlord, a right which he would not have in the ordinary way until the expiration of the lease.  It enables him to resume in the next six years for building if he thinks it right to do so, and it puts the tenant in the position that at the end of the six years he will know where he stands.  Unless the land is resumed within that period he will have the right to purchase.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, before Section 8, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>8.  Exemption shall be granted from tax under Schedule D of the Income Tax Act, 1918, in respect of so much of the income of any body of persons established for the purpose of promoting the games of Gaelic football, hurling, and handball or any of them as the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied has been or will be applied to such purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment has been pressed for by a number of Deputies and by the Gaelic Athletic Association.  It is one which is of only trivial importance financially.  The G.A.A., in common with other associations which make profits out of the playing of their games, pays income tax on these profits.  In the case of the G.A.A. the profits are devoted solely to promoting the games.  Now, it is a fact that these particular national games have been regarded as worthy of being fostered and promoted for a very considerable time.  It was part of the programme of the movement which resulted in the setting up of this State: that these particular games should be fostered and extended as far as possible, and it is thought that while we would not be willing to make any substantial sacrifice of revenue, that where a small sum such as that of about £300 per annum <Col N="2492" /> is concerned, that a concession may reasonably be given.  So far as Schedule A tax on grounds in the possession of the Association is concerned, that tax will continue to be paid.  As a matter of fact, the policy of the body is to use all profits for the purpose of purchasing additional grounds for the playing of these games, and in consequence, while we may lose about £300 under Schedule D tax, we will, in the course of a few years, gain a more or less corresponding sum from an increase in the tax under Schedules A and B.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that this amendment in this form is quite satisfactory.  I do not know whether it will be found possible for the Revenue Commissioners to decide what is Gaelic football.  But leaving that aside, would it not be much more satisfactory to strike out the word &ldquo;Gaelic&rdquo; and apply this exemption to any society formed for the promotion of the games of football, hurling and handball or any of them, or, one might even say, for athletics, so long as they are satisfied that the profits will be applied to the purpose of promoting these games and athletics.  I think it is not reasonable, and not at all necessary, that there should be exceptional treatment applied to the association promoting one particular brand, if I may say so, of football.  Provided that there is no professional or monetary purpose on the part of associations, beyond the promotion of games, it does not seem to me to be reasonable to exempt from this provision the promoters of other games besides Gaelic football, hurling and handball.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the particularisation of Gaelic football here is not wise, and that while one wants to see hurling and handball promoted, football is a game which has different rules, and there are different associations running different classes of football.  To single out one of them for special treatment seems to me to be quite unwise and quite unnecessary.  If one wants to say that it is intended to give a financial preference to the promotion of this particular style of football, well it had better be done by a definite vote, and not re-inserted in a Finance <Col N="2493" /> Act as a special exemption.  I would very much rather have the matter discussed on an estimate proposing to make a grant of £300 to the association which is promoting Gaelic football, hurling and handball than to let this slip in in the Finance Bill and in future years there would be no question about preferential treatment.  I think it is quite undesirable to make this specific reference to a brand of football.  I would ask the Minister to wipe out the word &ldquo;Gaelic&rdquo; and let the exemption apply to any association established for the purpose of promoting the games of football, hurling and handball, so long as the Commissioners are satisfied that the income will be devoted solely to that purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree to accept the Deputy's suggestion.  I think that these distinctively national games do merit some special consideration. Undoubtedly under present circumstances national games have a difficulty in maintaining themselves against games which are international in character and which have the special publicity that their international character gives them.  I think it is desirable that these distinctively national games should be maintained.  I do not want to go further than that.  I am no believer in exclusiveness, but I think it is desirable that they should be maintained and that it is, consequently, fair that a certain preference should be given to them.  I think under the circumstances, in view of past history and the general desirability of maintaining these distinctively national features of life, that some preference should be given.  I would not agree that profits made on and devoted to any form of athletics should be exempted from tax, because if we went so far as that there are many other desirable activities on which money is spent which might be made the basis of claims for exemption from income tax as strong as the case of athletics generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We always have attempts made to extend exemptions.  There is an exceedingly wide series of exemptions in favour of income going to the promotion of charitable objects.  Attempts are always being made to extend exemptions <Col N="2494" /> in favour of income devoted to a wide range of other objects, and I feel if we exempted from tax income devoted to athletics generally it would not be possible to stop there.  The promotion of athletics, generally, is not an object that is more desirable in itself than many of the other objects for which a similar claim would be made, but when we are dealing with these distinctively national games I think it is possible to draw a line and to draw it in such a way that a very small sum of money will be involved.  So far as games are concerned, we exempt them all from entertainment tax, and I agreed with that.  Various Deputies said that we were legalising the existing position, whereby the G.A.A. did not pay entertainment tax, and when Deputies claimed that all outdoor games should be exempt from entertainment tax I agreed with them.  But exemption from income tax is a somewhat different matter.  We are allowing the Association to retain a certain small sum of money which they will devote to the promotion of these particular distinctive games.  It does not seem to me that it is necessary for us to do the same thing in respect of athletics generally or of other games.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">

      <P>I think the Minister will be throwing a job on the Revenue Commissioners which it is doubtful if they will be able to carry out&mdash;to have due regard to what are national games and what are not.  There is no doubt whatsoever that hurling is a distinctively national game, and the same applies to handball.  Hurling, beyond all question, is distinctively an old Gaelic game.  It has varied; I do not know whether the Scotch game of shinty or the Irish game of hurling is the more Gaelic, but they are similar.  In the course of generations the game developed in Scotland in a different way from its development here, with the result that you have shinty in Scotland, and hurling here.  But when you come to Gaelic football I would like to know what Gaelic football is.  I have grown up with the game.  I remember the foundation of the G.A.A.  I saw the game before the foundation of the G.A.A., and if the game then had any <Col N="2495" /> resemblance to any of the games in existence at the moment it had a distinct resemblance to Rugby football. Gaelic football to-day is not an international pastime.  There have been changes in it until it came to be what it is at present.  It has changed altogether from what it was when I was a child, when it resembled Rugby.  You took the ball under your arm and ran. If the Minister wants details as to how the game was played I can give them to him.</P>

Where it got the name of Rugby I do not know, but it is more like the old game I saw played when I was a youngster.  I think the Minister will have his work cut out for him in connection with Gaelic football if he wants to do justice.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister ought to go on the point made by Deputy Johnson.  The Dáil has voted, and will in future vote, money in the Estimates for the encouragement of plays in Irish and for the encouragement of Irish drama.  If the Minister wishes to encourage Irish games, especially handball, I do not think the Dáil would refuse him a vote in the Estimates, and that money would be properly accounted for, and it would be open to Deputies who thought it was mis-spent to criticise it.  But this means that there will be no opportunity of criticism and no opportunity of calling the account in question.  Moreover, if I am rightly informed, this situation has arisen owing to the fact that the G.A.A. has refused to pay income tax.</P>

      <P>I had understood that the attitude of that Association was that they considered that they should be placed in an exceptional position, that they had been exempted from entertainments tax by the British Government&mdash;not legally exempted, but practically exempted&mdash; and they did not see why the Minister should tax them at all.  But if that is not the case I am very glad to hear it. At the same time there is no case for making fish of one and fowl of another, at any rate where amateurs are concerned. I think a professional football club, making profits should be taxed.  But I would urge the Minister to exempt all amateur sport which spends its money solely on the promotion of that sport.  As against national games I am inclined to believe in international games, of getting to know South Africa, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and Bulgaria, better through the means of games.  I believe if the Minister would make the concession suggested by Deputy Johnson it would tend to increase that knowledge and make it easier to bring over foreign teams to play.  In any case if it is desired to help national games it should be done through the Estimates and not through the remission of income tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, before Section 8, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (2) of Section 39 of the Income Tax Act, 1918, shall be amended by the addition thereto at the end of the first paragraph of the words&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and in respect of the annual value of any building, or in the case of a building used for more than one purpose of such proportion of the annual value thereof as the Revenue Commissioners deem appropriate, which is used for the purpose of provident benefits.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment has been put down to give the Minister an opportunity of saying whether he has given consideration to the point I have already made. I pointed out that under Section 39 (2) of the Income Tax Act of 1918 a registered trade union which is precluded, by Act of Parliament or by its rules, from assuring to any person a sum exceeding £300 by way of gross sum, or £52 a year by way of annuity, shall be entitled to exemption from tax under Schedules A C and D in respect of its interest and dividends which are applicable and applied solely for the purpose of provident benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The working out of that has led to certain anomalies.  Such an organisation which has premises and which lets those premises to another organisation, is excluded from payment of income tax in respect of the sum due to the letting, but if that organisation occupies the premises for the purpose of its own provident business, it is made to pay the income tax.  I think that is quite indefensible.  The object of the amendment is to have the matter cleared, and to make it possible for the Revenue Commissioners to decide that the reading of the Act of 1918 allows exemption in the case of the portion of the annual value which is used by the institution for its provident purposes. <Col N="2498" /> I do not think there is any need to argue the matter further.  It seems to me to be a clear case of mis-reading the intentions of the Act, and I seek in this amendment to have the intention clarified and to have what I believe to be the purpose of the section made practical in its operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been given some consideration.  The Revenue Commissioners, while not absolutely clear as to the effect of the law, and advice is being sought on that, are of opinion that where premises are used solely for the purpose of dealing with paying out provident benefits and clerical work in connection with that, that income tax should not be payable in respect to that building.  As I said, it is not quite clear whether, without legislation, they can give exemption or not, but if it proves on further investigation that exemption cannot be given without legislation, the Commissioners would recommend that legislation should be enacted so that where the building is used solely for the purpose of administering provident benefits no income tax should be payable in respect of it.  But where the building is used partly for one purpose and partly for another, it seems that the position is rather difficult.  Deputy Johnson said that when the building was let there would be no income tax payable in respect of the rent received from that letting.  But that is only so if that income were applied solely to the purposes of the provident benefits. If that rent went into some general fund, or if some of it went to the fund for payment of provident benefit and some for some other purpose, tax would be payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that this exemption takes place only if the income is applicable and applied solely for the purpose of provident benefits.  To give exemption in respect of a building used for different purposes seems to be carrying it a step further than logically follows from the exemption already given, and that is a matter that would require, at any rate, further consideration before it could be agreed to.  But so far as exemption from tax in respect to a building solely used for the purpose of providing provident <Col N="2499" /> benefits is concerned the principle is admitted.  That building ought to be exempt, and if it proves necessary on further investigation to promote legislation, the Commissioners will certainly recommend that legislation to be promoted.  That, however, is as far as it seems wise at present to decide to go.  To split up the assessment in respect to a particular building is a matter which would require some further consideration, and which might have reactions which we have not had time to explore fully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to press this matter at this stage, as the subject is under examination by the Revenue Commissioners, but I would point out that when one is dealing with a registered trade union, as the Act does, it is clear that a trade union is an organisation which has provident and other purposes, and if it can be shown to the Commissioners that certain proportions of the income are used for provident work it is fairly easy for them to estimate the proportion of the cost of the building which should be allocated to the provident work of the organisation.  The very fact that the words &ldquo;trade union&rdquo; are used implies recognition that there were other purposes besides what might be called in strict legal phraseology provident purposes.  There was never any suggestion that the provident purposes could be absolutely disentangled from the other purposes of a trade union and the business conducted in two different premises.  When the words &ldquo;trade union&rdquo; are used I submit that there is an implication that its provident benefits and its other work are under one organisation and conducted in one premises.  I can only ask the Minister to give sympathetic consideration to this matter.  I will not press the amendment at this stage, but I hope it will be brought forward in a future Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 3 (a):&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 6, before Section 14, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;An entertainment provided by a society which is established solely for the purpose of promoting the interest of the industry of agriculture or some branch thereof shall not be excluded from the exemption given by Section 7 of the Finance Act, 1921, solely by reason of the inclusion in the entertainment of competitions in the knowledge of the Irish language and in step-dancing or either of them.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is moved in consequence of a promise I made to Deputy O'Shaughnessy on the Committee Stage.  It is to provide that where competitions in the Irish language and in step-dancing take place at an agricultural show, the show committee will not be liable to pay entertainment tax.  On the Committee Stage I pointed out that if these competitions were held apart from the show they would be exempt, and if the show were held without these competitions it would also be exempt, but that the position so far is that if competitions were held at the show, the show became liable for entertainment tax. Deputy O'Shaughnessy had a further section to his amendment which provided for exemption from entertainment tax of band promenades and entertainments of a like nature.  In the time at my disposal I have not been able to examine that matter sufficiently to come to any conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HENNESSY Mr. HENNESSY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HENNESSY</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the other portion of the amendment which the Minister states he has not yet investigated, on the last occasion I did not set out the case fully for the Minister. What Deputy O'Shaughnessy and I had in mind was band promenades at seaside resorts held on Bank Holidays and Sunday afternoons, with which are generally associated other entertainments, such as boat races, gymnastics, or something of that kind.  These are promoted purely for entertainment and not with the idea of making a profit. In many cases there is a big loss on them.  The Minister is anxious to exempt other classes of amusement from <Col N="2501" /> this tax, and I cannot understand why he does not undertake to exempt this particular kind of entertainment.  Having paid their income tax and other taxes, people go to the seaside resorts on a Sunday afternoon and like to feel quite free from all anxiety as to taxes. When they get a threepenny ticket on entering an enclosure where such an entertainment as this is going on, they do not like to see the word &ldquo;tax&rdquo; on the ticket.  These functions are promoted for the purpose of amusement and do not interfere with any other local entertainments, such as picture houses or theatres.  I would, therefore, ask the Minister to accept the other portion of Deputy O'Shaughnessy's amendment, if not on this Stage, on the next Stage.</P>

      <P>The Minister, I think, has taken the wording of Deputy O'Shaughnessy's amendment and refers to &ldquo;competitions in the knowledge of the Irish language and in step-dancing or in either of them.&rdquo;  I think I understand what is sought for and what the Minister's intention is, but I imagine he has not made himself acquainted with the practice of those agricultural shows.  The competitions in question are not confined to the Irish language and step-dancing.  Sometimes there are competitions in fiddling and piping, and I am not quite sure whether step-dancing would include the &ldquo;Rinnce Mor&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Fairy Reel.&rdquo;  I think it is too limited and that it is not meeting the case that the promoters of these competitions desire, which I think the Minister wishes to concede.  I put that forward, but I do not know how it can be managed unless the Minister were to use some phrasing like that in the other amendment and speak of Irish dancing and music. I think this is too narrow, and it certainly is going to confine those competitions within limits that would destroy the beauty and value of them to a very great extent.  If you are going to confine agricultural shows to competitions in the Irish language and step-dancing, you are narrowing it very much indeed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 6, before Section 14, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Sub-section (a) of Section 6 of the Third Schedule to the Finance Act, 1926, shall be amended as if there were added thereto the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Any vehicle in respect of which it is shown to the satisfaction of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health that it has been manufactured by a firm which is at present engaged in manufacturing similar vehicles in Saorstát Eireann... £16.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My object in bringing forward the amendment is to meet the point of the Minister for Finance.  His objection on a previous occasion was because the Minister for Local Government had objected. It did not affect his department so much as that of the Minister for Local Government.  I was hoping the Minister for Local Government would have been present to hear the arguments in favour of the change.  I think Deputy Good is on the right line, and if the Minister for Local Government <Col N="2503" /> were present to hear the case the Deputy made amplified, he might be convinced that there would have been an increase in the revenue if a concession of this kind were made.  I think it is undoubtedly true that the motor-driving habit, like the tobacco habit, is one that grows.  There are undoubtedly many hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people in the country who would be prepared to buy a cheap motor car second-hand if it could be brought within their means.  Once having acquired the habit, all those that I have ever heard of or spoken to always liked to have a new car.  Once the habit has been spread amongst a larger number of people, even the driving of an old car will lead in a very short time to a keenness of demand for a new car, and, as a matter of fact, the case made for Messrs. Ford will be strengthened.  Anybody who has read the philosophy of Henry Ford will know that he largely bases his business credit upon this extension of the habit of riding in motor cars, and I think that the fact that you are able to increase the number of people who own cars and drive them, is certain to increase the demand for new cars, and, consequently, to increase the gross number of cars on the road.</P>
    <P>The revenue of the Road Board would be increased if these old cars which are now lying up could be induced to come out and sun themselves during the summer months.  The absence of the Minister for Local Government gives me very little hope that we can change the Minister for Finance but, perhaps, Deputy Good, if he were to enlarge on this subject, might call the Minister for Local Government from the nether regions and he would be able to hear the end of the argument and, even, the end of the argument would convince him. Perhaps the Minister for Finance would then gracefully concede the point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that the amendment imposes limitations on me that would be difficult to get over. Deputy Johnson proposes to make this concession for only one make of car. There is practically only one type of <Col N="2504" /> car made in the Free State at present. If one could get the Minister to agree to the principle underlying this amendment and apply it generally we would achieve some useful purpose.  Since the matter was last before the Dáil it has been pointed out to me that a number of old cars, by reason of the high licence duty, are taken out only for a few months and, instead of the Minister getting, as he might get, a substantial tax for the whole period he is getting a reduced tax for a limited period.  With a much wider outlook than that which the Minister has brought to bear on this problem, I am satisfied that there would be a much improved revenue from this particular tax.  If a man sells an old car it enables him to get a new car and to pay the tax.  In that case there would be two cars running with both paying the tax instead of as at present, only one car running for a portion of the year and paying a limited tax.  If the Minister could inquire into the problem I am sure he would find that a much larger income would be derived from a relaxation of this tax on old cars.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing much to add to what I said on the matter in Committee except that, on looking further into this amendment, we found objections to the form of it and to the effects that it would have.  If it were passed it would undoubtedly lead to the importation of a considerable number of old Ford cars from across the Border which have at present to pay a tax of £23.  If they had to pay only £16 it would in many cases be advantageous to send them in here.  It is extremely likely if this amendment were adopted that everyone on the other side of the Border with an old Ford car would try and dispose of it here, and the consequence would be that the object we had in view by reducing the tax on Ford cars manufactured here to £10 would be defeated.  Even if that were not to happen, if we made certain important changes in the amendment, we would still be defeating the object which we had in view.  I would not for a moment consider the suggestion of Deputy Good, because if it were adopted, the loss to the Road Fund <Col N="2505" /> would be very heavy.  Even if it were confined to Ford cars, there would be a big loss, but there would be a much bigger loss if it were given in respect of every vehicle.  If we had not this check we would find that this country would become a dumping ground for second-hand cars, and I do not think that that would be advantageous.</P>

There are a whole lot of these second-hand cars lying idle in the country and if they could be disposed of new cars would be bought.

      <P>Sub-section (2) of Section 38 of the Finance Act, 1926, shall be amended by the deletion of the words &ldquo;less than £3 and is&rdquo; from the exemption comprised in that sub-section.</P>
      <P>This amendment is put forward in the hope of being able to persuade the Minister to go a little further than he went last year.  This question of the stamp duty imposed on men drawing weekly wages has been the subject of discussion for a couple of years back, and, as it was argued last year, a man in receipt of weekly pay of £2, £2 5s. or £2 10s. was paying a tax, if he were employed in a Government office, of 8/8 a year, which no other man in similar employment was paying.  The Minister, in response to representations, raised the sum to £3, so that at present any man in receipt of a weekly wage of £3 is paying this tax of 8/8 a year.  That, as I say, is only applicable in the case of an employee receiving that wage in a Government office.  The object of the amendment is to remove any limit in respect of wages or salary. I had hoped that the leader of the new Abstentionists would have been present to add his voice to this appeal in view of the success of his agitation in respect of the cider duty.  It is pleading for a small concession.  It is a concession that will not cost a great deal, and it will, undoubtedly, remove a sense of discrimination in the matter of this tax against public servants.  It is nominally applicable to all wage-earners, but, in practice, no other wage-earner, except those paid out of Government funds, pays it.  It is with that object I am asking the Minister to accept the amendment and remove this little irritation.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I have a certain amount of sympathy with this amendment, but I do not think that it is quite right to compare it with the remission of the <Col N="2507" /> cider duty.  By remitting that duty we only lost £80 per annum, but this particular concession on the estimate I had before me would cost between £8,000 and £10,000 or even more.  These stamps are ordinary postage stamps and are bought in post offices, and it is very difficult to frame an estimate of the revenue obtained.  Various estimates have been made on different bases, and they vary as to the loss that would follow the adoption of the amendment.  They vary from £7,000 almost up to £15,000.  I think it is quite likely that it might result in a loss of, say, £10,000, and while it is true that the great bulk of the revenue obtained by maintaining the present position comes from civil servants it is also a fact that civil servants have certain advantages over weekly wage earners in other classes of employment.  It is, consequently, less of a hardship on them to pay this twopence than it would be if we had one particular group of private employees paying it, and if other groups with a different system of payment escaped it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I undertook, on Committee Stage, to examine certain matters that were raised in connection with proceeding before the Medical Council.  The question was raised, in the first instance, as to whether it was necessary or advisable to provide expressly in the Bill that the Council might, whenever it considered it necessary, have the assistance of a qualified legal person, and, secondly, whether it was necessary to provide expressly in the Bill that a defendant-practitioner might be represented by counsel or solicitor before the Medical Council.  We have discussed these matters with the Attorney-General and staff, and it is considered unnecessary, and even unwise, to provide expressly in the Bill that the Council may have the assistance of a legal assessor.  In fact, there is nothing in the Bill to restrict the Council in getting such assistance, and we may assume that it will avail of such assistance. But if you provide expressly for such a person in the Bill, then there is the danger that you may exalt him to a status to which we do not wish to exalt him&mdash;in other words, that you may attach some responsibility to him and detract, to some extent, from the responsibility of the Council. If you mention a legal assessor of that kind in the Bill, then it becomes questionable whether the Council have the right to ignore his advice or act contrary to his advice.  Questions of <Col N="2509" /> that kind would arise.  The Parliamentary draftsman is entirely satisfied that, under the Bill as it stands, the Council can avail of such assistance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other point it is, perhaps, advisable to insert an amendment.  The Council have the power to make regulations with regard to their procedure.  It is almost inconceivable that the Council would make a regulation excluding the professional representatives of a defendant practitioner.  But there might be something to be said for putting it beyond the power of the Council to refuse to admit counsel or a solicitor representing a defendant doctor.  Therefore, I would ask the Dáil to accept an amendment at the end of Section 30.  It would take the form of an additional sub-section&mdash;sub-section (3)&mdash;as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The person whose conduct is the subject of an inquiry held under this section shall be entitled to be heard and adduce evidence and if he so desires to be represented by solicitor and counsel at such inquiry.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That places the matter beyond all doubt.  It effects that the Council may not, in their regulations, exclude a legal representative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked to look into the exact implications of sub-section (2) of Section 3, which provides that the Council may sue and be sued.  (Sub-section quoted.)  The query was raised whether, having regard to the fact that in the Bill we provide for an appeal to the High Court on the part of a practitioner whose name has been erased from the register, this section does not make it possible, in the event of such an appeal succeeding, for the Council to be sued by the successful appellant for having improperly deleted his name from the register.  We have discussed that very fully, and the position really is that the Medical Council is a quasi-judicial body and would have quasi-judicial privilege.  No action of that kind would lie against the Council unless malice were alleged, and unless <Col N="2510" /> there was, at any rate, evidence constituting a prima facie case of malice. In such circumstances it is proper there should be an action.  But, in the absence of a definite allegation of malice, no action would lie, because the quasi-judicial privilege of the Council would be sufficient to bar an action.  I do not think there need be any uneasiness on that score.</P>
    <P>As to the composition of the Council, Deputies may take it we have reached our final decision, and that we are not open to reconsider the question.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed with the last statement of the Minister.  I thought the Government would have considered the advisability of giving a nomination to the National University and to Trinity College, apart from the University.  To many of us it seems rather hard that there should be three representatives given practically to the National University and only one to the University of Dublin, when we consider the number of students attending and the number of graduates sent out by these two bodies.  However, if the Executive have made up their minds that they will not make any change, I cannot press the matter further.</P>
      <P>I am quite satisfied with regard to the other matters the Minister has referred to, but I am very disappointed that they have not made those two additional appointments.  It would have given a great deal of satisfaction to quite a number of people.  But I can do no more than I have done by calling attention to what we thought was not a fair division of representation between the two Universities.</P>

      <P>I might also express my disappointment that the number of direct representatives has not been increased.  There is a good deal in what Deputy Sir James Craig says, but that was bound to follow when teaching bodies were selected as the basis of representation.  That was bound to result in an inequality of representation, and I appreciate the difficulty to the Minister or any other body in getting over it.  On the whole, I think the Bill meets the views of the profession, while meeting the views of <Col N="2511" /> the Government.  Nobody will suffer under it, and I think we might accept it as a final solution of the difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill bears considerable resemblance to the Medical Bill. The agreement which gave rise to it follows broadly the lines of the agreement arrived at with regard to medical registration.  There are many points of resemblance, but there are some points of difference, to which attention should be drawn.  For instance, the positions of the medical and dental professions differ in this respect&mdash;that an unregistered person who practises dentistry or dental surgery commits an offence under the Dentists Act, 1921.  There is no similar provision in regard to unregistered medical practitioners.  The only disability a practitioner of that kind labours under is that he cannot recover fees.  A person practising medicine who is not registered as a medical practitioner is not given the protection of the courts in recovering fees.  That is provided by Section 32 of the Medical Act, 1858.  Registered dentists, unlike registered medical practitioners, pay an annual fee for the retention of their names on the register, in return for the prohibition of the practice of dentistry by unregistered persons.  Medical practitioners pay one fee on registration, and that ends the matter.  The Dentists Act passed in 1921, which for the first time prohibited the practice of dentistry by unregistered persons, recognised that those unregistered persons who, without any degrees or diplomas, had practised dentistry for a considerable time prior to the passing of the Act, had <Col N="2512" /> acquired a vested interest, and provision was made for protection of that interest by Section 3 of the Act of 1921, which enabled those persons to be registered within a limited time, in spite of their lack of what has now come to be considered proper qualifications. The persons who took advantage of that section of the Act of 1921 locally referred to as the &ldquo;1921 men,&rdquo; are quite a numerous body in the Saorstát. They number almost as many as the dentists whose qualification depends on diplomas and degrees.  There are two representative bodies.  The &ldquo;1921 men&rdquo; are represented by a body called the &ldquo;Incorporated Dental Society.&rdquo;  The other dentists holding degrees and diplomas are represented by a body called the &ldquo;Irish Dental Association.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the ordinary course of events the number, of course, of the 1921 men will tend to gradually diminish and finally disappear, until you have a situation in which there will be no person registered other than by virtue of degrees and diplomas.  At the moment you have a large body, but with the passage of time that body will be a diminished quantity in proportion to the whole and will finally disappear.  The representation of the new Board is that there shall be one representative of the 1921 men and four representatives of the qualified dentists&mdash;the dentists who hold professional degrees and diplomas. That is a rather rough and ready system adopted from the corresponding Act in Great Britain.  Of course, as the number of 1921 men declined, and their proportion to the whole diminished, it is not unlikely that a change will have to be made in the composition of the Council.  However, that is for the future.  The relations existing between the General Medical Council and the dentists' profession in Great Britain are important, because the arrangements made here under our Bill are rather closely corresponding. Under the Dentists Act of 1878, which set up a register of dentists, the control of the register and of dental education was vested in the Medical Council, and that situation continued until the legislation of 1921.  By the Act of 1921 a special Dental Board was established, <Col N="2513" /> and that Board was to deal with registration and with matters of the internal discipline of the profession, but administration of these matters was still, to a large extent, theoretically, subject to the Medical Council.  Registration and professional control, as I say, were dealt with largely by the Dentists' Board, but dental education still remains under the control of the General Medical Council.  It was provided that when the Medical Council exercised any of their functions under the Dentists Act that then two additional members, with special knowledge and experience of dental matters, were to be added to the Council.  It is intended, under this agreement, and under the Bill which flows from the agreement, that the relations between the Dental Board here, in the Saorstát, and the Saorstát Medical Council shall correspond to the relations between the Dental Board in Great Britain and the General Medical Council.  That arrangement is, I think, considered entirely satisfactory by the dentists' profession here, and it is the agreement envisaged by the agreement which we signed with the British Government and the General Medical Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JAMES CRAIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this Bill is eminently satisfactory, and if anyone is under the impression that I thought the Medical Practitioners Bill was not also eminently satisfactory I wish to say that I consider it extremely so.  I am not sure whether it is intended to get this Bill through before the dissolution or not, but there is no necessity for me making a speech at any length, because, as a matter of fact, agreement has been reached on nearly every point.  There are one or two little points which will have to be dealt with in the Committee Stage, one in particular, in Section 41, where there are limitations placed upon the practice of surgeons.  That will require an amendment in the Committee Stage. Under the English Act there is no limitation placed on the practice of surgeons as regards dentistry, but under this Bill there is a provision made which the medical profession are up in arms against.  The surgeons do not want any restrictions placed upon <Col N="2514" /> their practice.  Therefore, an amendment will have to be made.</P>
      <P>I am going to put the other case, the case of the dentist.  Where a registered medical practitioner is also a dentist the dentists claim that he should register as a dentist and be under the Dental Board, because it is possible for him to practise as a medical practitioner under his registration as a medical practitioner, and still practise dentistry.  Under those conditions he would not be required to pay his registration fee, which in England amounts to £5 a year.  I am quite at one with the dentists that he should be placed upon the dental register.  It is to prevent that class of thing that they have endeavoured to put into the Bill some restrictions upon the medical practitioners. I say again that I think this measure is very much needed, almost more needed, at the present time, than the Medical Practitioners Bill, because, within the last couple of years, anyone could come into the country and practise dentistry as he pleased.  There are no restrictions whatsoever.  I support the Bill very heartily, and, with a very slight amendment that will be necessary during the Committee Stage, I accept it.</P>

      <P>This Bill, containing 44 sections, was distributed in the afternoon of Wednesday.  Since that moment we have had a regular glut of Bills.  Quite a number of Bills originating in the Dáil, and a number of others which have come down with amendments from the Seanad, have been before us, and we are asked now to give a Second Reading to this new Bill.  I do not know what the Minister's intentions are in regard to it.  I may say that since the publication of the Bill I have had representations from three distinct interests in regard to it.  My answer has been that it has not been possible to express any views upon it, or even to listen to any views upon it, because it has not been possible to read the Bill with any care or, in fact, to understand anything about it, except that it is to set up some kind of a governing body over the dentists' profession.  I think it is necessary, before we examine a Bill of this kind, or even give it a Second Reading, that we <Col N="2515" /> should have some time, and that the people interested should have some time, to understand how it affects them.</P>
      <P>For instance, you have in the schedule names of certain individuals actually stated.  How are we to know whether those individuals are being dealt with fairly or unfairly?  Deputy Sir James Craig has pointed out that there is a certain conflict between the medical profession and the dentists involved in the Bill.  There is certainly the possible difference of interests as between the medical profession, the dental profession and the public.  I say it is unreasonable to ask the Dáil even to give this Second Reading at this stage.  I have no doubt that it is worth a Second Reading.  But I am reminded of the Army Bill which, at an earlier stage of our history, was brought into the House.  I think, in almost similar circumstances, at the tail end of a session, and passed without one minute's discussion, although it had, I think, some two or three hundred sections, because it was deemed to be urgent and necessary. It has never had any discussion since.  This is a Bill brought in on almost the last day of a Parliament. We have had no information as to what the intention is in regard to it.  If it is intended simply as a declaration that the principle of the Bill is approved by the Dáil, I am not going to oppose it, but if it is intended to go any further than that with the Bill, then I shall do my best to amend it to the utmost degree, and to introduce as many amendments as possible.</P>

      <P>Purely obstructionist. I make that candid confession. I think it is straining the business of an assembly of this kind, on the eve of dissolution, to introduce a Bill of 44 clauses, in respect of which there has not been even a public discussion.  The <Col N="2516" /> Medical Practitioners Bill has been, in its essence, publicly discussed for months.  Here we have an entirely different situation created&mdash;a new Bill, about which neither the Deputies nor the public could possibly have got any information.  I say if the intention is purely to give it a Second Reading and approval I am not going to make any great demur, but if it is intended to go ahead with it, then I shall do my best to have it delayed.</P>

      <P>I am simply appalled at the attitude outlined by Deputy Johnson.  This Bill is very urgent and I would expect more sympathetic consideration from him.  I know he is very busy studying sugar, and that he has very little time for the study of medicine.  Nevertheless, I submit that medicine, as provided for in this Bill, is far more important than the lengthy discussion we had yesterday, which was a repetition of previous speeches delivered in this House and a justification or falsification of a lot of prophecies.  This Bill has been delayed too long.  It has been before the public for a long time, but the public take no interest in anything that is medical. We cannot expect any interest amongst the public or even amongst the members of the Dáil.  I am sorry the Deputy has selected this one Bill simply to assert the principle that he objects to rushing legislation.  I think he might say that three months longer will not mean much.  I think it will mean a great deal to allow for even three months longer the practice of unskilled or unpractised dentistry in this country.  It means a danger to public life.  Every day we have unqualified dentists coming over to Ireland knowing that the law is such that they can set up in this country and practise as unqualified dentists.  I think that is a very serious situation and it should not be allowed to last another week.  It is bad enough that it has lasted so long, and this discussion will simply be held out as an invitation to other unqualified dentists to set up here.  I am really surprised; I am sure it was quite unintentional on the part of Deputy Johnson to do anything that would give an opportunity for the practice of <Col N="2517" /> unskilled labour.  I think if there was an examination about some dentists setting up here&mdash;unqualified men&mdash;that it might be worth while to prevent their setting up for this reason: that there are a good many rumours of their bringing drugs, such as cocaine, into this country, ostensibly for the practise of their profession, whereas the drugs are really for sale amongst those addicted to the drug habit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The point referred to by Deputy Sir James Craig can be dealt with on Committee.  I share the feeling expressed by the Deputy on behalf of registered dentists as to the difference between registered dentists and registered medical practitioners. The registered dentist has to pay a fee for the retention of his name on the register.  The registered medical practitioner also pays a certain fee, but, if practising dentistry, he has not to pay the registered dentist's fee by reason of the fact that he is a registered medical practitioner.  I would be in accord with the principle that Deputy Sir James Craig stated on that.  With regard to the objections to Section 41, it would be better, I think, to have these met by way of amendment.  We could then consider whether, in fact, there is any flaw in the section.  What I heard vaguely apprehended was that certain surgeons might be precluded from certain types of operations.  Of course, that is not the intention, and, if the flaw is there, then on Committee we can see what should be done to rectify it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson enlarged on the effect of the schedule in certain matters.  That to a certain extent means an enlargement of the number of the 1921 practitioners.  These are men who, mainly by reason of service in the war, could have taken advantage of Section 4 of the 1921 Act.  They are, to all intents and purposes, 1921 men, and the special considerations with regard to each of them might be examined, if necessary.  These are really Committee points.  The Bill comes forward founded upon an international agreement, exactly the same as that upon which the Medical Bill is based. The Medical Bill has been approved by this House, so that that side of the <Col N="2518" /> question has been definitely under consideration. This Bill proposes to set up a Council to regularise the whole situation with regard to dentistry which, as a profession, is, I think, in a state of complete anarchy at the moment.  At the moment it is doubtful if there is any law whatever applicable to dentists.  If there is any tribe from whom the public ought to get protection at the earliest possible moment, surely it is against the unlicensed quack dentists, who are responsible for a great deal of harm and, probably, many fatalities in the country.  The Bill has been brought in to regularise the dental profession here, and so that it should be in accordance with the international agreement already sanctioned with regard to the medical profession. I do not insist that the Bill should go beyond the Second Stage now, but I simply want to indicate my point of view, that it is one of the Bills I would like to see passed immediately the House meets after the dissolution. It is a Bill that, I think, should not remain over until the autumn.  Every stage that is secured now will, at any rate, be a step forward towards getting it passed into law, say, in the month of July.  That is the anxiety I have about the matter. I do not by any means insist on asking the House now, at the end of a session, to deal with the Committee Stage of the Bill, particularly if important points are going to be raised on it. If there is objection to taking the Bill beyond the Second Stage now I would not press the House to take it, but I do want to indicate to the House that the Government, in dealing with this Bill hereafter, will be urged to pass it into law at the earliest possible date, that is to say, in the month of July.</P>

As I have already said, there are at least three interests concerned in addition to the public, and what their views may be I <Col N="2519" /> do not know, but I have a notion that the professional people interested who have been in communication with the Ministry in regard to the Bill have had no time to understand what is in it.  I am not going to oppose the Second Reading, having heard the views of the Minister.  I give him my assurance for what it is worth that the Bill ought to have the earliest consideration after the resumption.</P>

      <P>3.  In Section 5, sub-section (1), after the word &ldquo;service&rdquo; in line 21, the following words inserted, &ldquo;other than a road motor service being run tentatively.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These three amendments really deal with the same point.  The net effect of them is that where the Railway Company propose a route which they describe and have approved as a service run tentatively for a period not exceeding <Col N="2520" /> twelve months, that then they may discontinue such tentative service without the specific sanction of the Minister with regard to withdrawal or discontinuance. When this was raised in the Seanad I indicated certain fears and doubts I had in the matter, I said the tendency might be to make the Railway Company introduce all services as tentative services for a period not exceeding twelve months.  The answer to that is that where such services are seen not to be in their essence experimental services, then permission can be refused to such service, and I think in that way the position is safeguarded. Although I did not receive the amendments with any great enthusiasm in the Seanad, I am now disposed to recommend them for the acceptance of the Committee.</P>

      <P>In page 8, Section 17, to delete sub-section (5), and substitute therefor a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  In this section the word &lsquo;Bank&rsquo; means a bank carrying on business in Saorstát Eireann or holding to the knowledge of the Chairman a controlling interest in a bank carrying on business in Saorstát Eireann, and references to shares in a bank shall be construed as including stock, shares, debentures, debenture stock, bonds, or other securities of such bank.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that amendments 5, 6 and 7 might be considered together.  The <Col N="2522" /> Chairman is prohibited from holding shares in any bank carrying on business in Saorstát Eireann or any bank which has to the knowledge of the Chairman a controlling interest in a bank in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed to go as far as Deputy Cooper suggested, because it is not desirable to put unnecessary restrictions on a chairman or nominated Commissioner.  You might have banks in Japan or anywhere else which would have no relation with the banks here and which could by no means interfere with the judgment of the chairman on any matter.  Further, the possession of shares is not at all likely to influence the individual unless he had an enormous holding and had some very direct interest in the way a director would have.</P>

I would suggest to him that possibly it would be desirable to define the words &ldquo;controlling interest.&rdquo; It seems to me that they might easily be capable of various interpretations in law, and when the Bill is before the Seanad, where there are persons more experienced in banking than there are in the Dáil, the Minister might get an amendment passed defining these words.</P>

      <P>This follows a suggestion made by Deputy Johnson that the chairman should not have a casting vote but that every decision of the Commission should have to be reached by an absolute majority.  I said that I did not care to go as far as that, because there were many matters which might well be decided without any harm by a casting vote, but I agreed with him that there might be certain matters which could only be decided by an absolute majority of the Commission.

    <P>This is to give effect to a promise which I made on the Committee Stage. On that stage I inserted an amendment providing that members of the Commission and their officers should make a declaration of secrecy similar to the declaration made by ordinary banking people.  This goes a stage further and provides that the Chairman or other officer of the Commission who inspects the records and books of a bank is prohibited from communicating the information he obtains in the course of his work even to an ordinary member of the Commission, so that I think the utmost degree of secrecy will be secured.  He cannot submit that information in such a way that it could be identified as relating to a particular person.</P>

      <P>When we were discussing Section 41 Deputy Thrift, I think, objected to the very wide powers given to the Commission. Sub-section (1) of the section as it stands reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Commission may in its absolute discretion on any of the grounds expressly authorised by this Act or on any other ground which appears to the Commission to be sufficient remove any Shareholding Bank from being a Shareholding Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2526" /> I agreed with Deputy Thrift that the powers were too wide, and after consideration I came to the conclusion that the best way to deal with this was to make the removal on grounds other than the grounds expressly authorised by the Bill possible only by the unanimous vote of the Commission.</P>

      <P>This is to a section which was inserted on the Committee Stage.  The section enables the Minister, with the concurrence of the Commission, to make regulations prescribing the times and intervals and the form in which Shareholding Banks shall publish their respective balance sheets.  The case was made to me since that that was a power which was perhaps capable of being used vexatiously.  There is no intention that it should be so used.  The object is to secure that the banks shall publish balance sheets at more frequent intervals than they do at present, and that in publishing these balance sheets they shall give information as to deposits and advances which will distinguish the deposits and advances dealt with in Saorstát branches from the deposits and advances dealt with in other branches.  I do not say that it is desirable or necessary that the banks should publish monthly balance sheets.  They formerly published half-yearly balance sheets, but their tendency lately has been only to publish yearly balance sheets.  I think that, as in South Africa, the reasonable thing would be to have quarterly balance sheets.  But I am now proposing to require the unanimous concurrence of the Commission. I am certain that the banks and the Commission will agree to some reasonable arrangement in regard to the publication of these matters.  If the banks do not agree, of course, the matter could be reconsidered, but I assume that a reasonable attitude will be taken up.</P>

      <P>In page 23, at the end of Section 56, to add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Any abatement under this section during the course of the initial or triennial period of the amount of consolidated bank notes which may be outstanding with such bank (otherwise than by virtue of an extraordinary issue) shall be effected only by unanimous vote of the Commission but no ordinary Commissioner shall vote on or otherwise take part in proceedings under this section in relation to a bank of which he is a director or by which he is employed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These two amendments stand together. They are to replace what was formerly Section 53.  They deal with a matter which is somewhat difficult, due to the fact that certain banks will have a right of note issue outside the Saorstát.  At present we do not know what that rate will be, and we will not know what amount will be issued or how their issue will be regulated.  It cannot be doubted that the amount of their note <Col N="2528" /> issue outside the Saorstát must be considered when allotments are made to them of Saorstát issue, and when increases or decreases are made of the amounts which they may issue in the Saorstát.  We thought at first that we might relate their total issue to something like one-tenth of their advances, or one-tenth of their assets, but the more we considered it the more impossible it appeared to arrive at a satisfactory measure.  What we propose to do now is simply to direct specifically the attention of the Commission to this matter and impose upon them an obligation to consider it.  We provide that an abatement on note issue, made because of the considerations of note issue outside the Saorstát during the initial or triennial period, shall be effected only by the unanimous vote of the Commission.  That is to ensure that a bank will not be in any way unreasonably treated.  It should be noted, of course, that apart altogether from this section, when the Commission is reviewing the allocation of note issue it will take into account the position created by any external right of note issue.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to set down the next stage before next Friday.  Representations have been made to me by certain Senators that it would be impossible to consider this Bill between now and the dissolution. I have no wish to attempt to rush this particular Bill.  I think it is a Bill for which all reasonable opportunities for consideration should be given.  At the same time it is necessary that it should be passed as soon as possible for several reasons.  It is necessary that any question of currency changes should be out of the way before we come to make an issue of a loan.  It is also necessary that there should be no delay in setting up the Commission, so that the revenue which we anticipate from the new system of note issue, and on which we calculated in the Budget, may be forthcoming.  But I have gathered that if I were to press the Seanad to pass it before the dissolution it would be regarded as somewhat unreasonable, and because of different amendments that had to be made and because of the time taken up by consultation with various interests which led to these amendments, the passage of the Bill through the Dáil has been delayed more than we anticipated. Consequently, as I say, while I feel that it is necessary that immediately the Oireachtas reassembles after the dissolution the Bill should be got through, I am not trying to-day to send it up to the Seanad in order that it might be passed before the dissolution.</P>

      <P>In accordance with Section 187 of the Income Tax Act, 1918, the income arising from a landlord's interest in lands is charged to income tax under Schedule A by reference to the poor rate valuation (or the yearly rental if less than the poor rate valuation).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The character of the charge and the amount of the legal liability for the years of assessment involved are not affected by the Land Act, 1923, under which compounded arrears of rent are paid.  Nevertheless, in cases in which the total receipts from tenanted lands (including rent and compounded arrears of rent) for the period or periods to which such receipts are appropriate are less than the amount on which tax is charged under Schedule A, the Revenue Commissioners by an extra statutory <Col N="2477" /> concession are prepared to adjust the liability by reference to the amount that will ultimately be received from the lands in question for the years of assessment affected.  The result in such cases is that tax is ultimately paid by the landowner only on the actual receipts, whether the same come wholly or partly to him in the form of rent or compounded arrears of rent.  In effecting adjustments of liability on this basis credit is given for any tax deducted by the Land Commission from compounded arrears of rent.</P>
    <P>The alternative to the concession would be the collection of the full tax charged in the Schedule A assessments.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture whether he is aware that the Kyne Estate, Tubbernadara, Shrule, County Mayo, was acquired by the Congested Districts Board nearly twenty years ago; that the untenanted lands on this estate are still let in grazing, and if he will state what steps, if any, are being taken by the Land Commission to divide the lands among the holders of uneconomic holdings in the district to relieve the acute congestion which exists there.</P>

      <P>The above estate, comprising 124 acres of tenanted land and 54 acres of untenanted land, was vested in the late Congested Districts Board on 27th January, 1913, and a further area of 102 acres, untenanted land, was acquired from the owner and vested in the Board on 5th February, 1920.</P>
      <P>The untenanted land referred to was offered to the tenants in 1922, but they refused to accept the striping arrangements. If they are now prepared to accept these arrangements, steps will be taken to have the re-sale of these lands carried out.</P>
