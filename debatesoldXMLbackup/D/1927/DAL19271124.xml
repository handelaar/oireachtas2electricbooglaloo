      <P>A report was made by the Circuit Judge under Section 15 of the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, 1923, recommending payment to Mr. Christopher Daly of £740.  It is the duty of my Department to examine recommendations of this kind, and after the fullest investigation in this case I found that the goods in respect of which the recommendation was made were not taken without the applicant's consent, and, moreover, that the case is one to which the terms of Section 9 of the Act apply.  In these circumstances I was obliged to refuse to make any payment.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that the mother of Joseph Kernan, of 40 Upper Mercer Street, who was murdered on the evening of April 3rd, 1923, was awarded £75 compensation by the Compensation (Personal Injuries) Committee, and whether in view of the fact that deceased was the sole support of his mother the award will be reviewed and an increased sum granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Compensation (Personal Injuries) Committee, by whom the claim of Mrs. Margaret Kernan was fully and carefully investigated came to the conclusion that the dependency of the claimant upon the deceased, Joseph Kernan, was very slight.  In April, 1924, they recommended payment of £75 compensation which they considered, after taking all the circumstances into account, to be a reasonable award.  In consequence of certain representations which were made to me the application was, at my request, reconsidered in September, 1924, by the Committee who reported that they were unable to recommend any increase in the amount of the grant.  In view of these facts I regret that I cannot see my way to take any further action in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the evidence at the inquest showed that this man was arrested while there was a patrol of Free State soldiers on the streets, and, therefore, was arrested with their consent, and that there was no denial of that evidence at the inquest.  In view of the fact that responsibility is involved, would he have the question re-opened, and also, in view of the fact that in an ordinary court of law, in normal times, if a case like this occurred, at least £300 would be awarded in respect of a person who was the sole support of his mother?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of dependency merely, and that was considered very carefully on two occasions by the compensation committee. At my request, after their first report was received, the matter went back to <Col N="1841" /> them and they still held that, in view of the slight degree of dependency which existed, no further award should be given.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that no compensation has been paid to Mr. Laurence Raul in respect of losses, estimated at £299, arising out of a raid on 16th December, 1920, by British military on his business premises in Exchequer Street, Dublin, where he traded under the name of Messrs. Conway; if he is further aware if these premises were used in connection with the offices of the Local Government Department under the First and Second Dáil, and whether arrangements will now be made to pay Mr. Raul the compensation claimed by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Raul lodged a claim for £299 with the Compensation (Ireland) Commission, who made an award of £22 9s. 5d. with interest and £6 6s. for costs and expenses.  The award was no doubt in respect of damage to windows, the Commission being precluded by its terms of reference from awarding compensation for loot.  A paying order for £29 2s. 6d. in Mr. Raul's favour was issued in discharge of the award by my Department to his solicitors on the 6th April, 1925, but was not presented for payment and is now out of date.  If it is returned to my Department it will be renewed. There are no funds at my disposal out of which any additional payment could be made.  I am aware that the premises were utilised by the Local Government Department of the First and Second Dáil for interviews on a few occasions, but this does not affect the applicant's claim to compensation.</P>

      <NameTxt>PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY to the MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Bourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the object of relieving unemployment in Cobh and the neighbourhood by keeping the business of the Queenstown Dry Docks Shipbuilding Company going, the payment from the Relief Schemes Vote of a contribution amounting to ten per cent. of the sums paid in wages by the Queenstown Dry Docks Shipbuilding and Engineering Company to men engaged in shipbuilding or ship-repairing work in respect of whom contributions were being paid under the Unemployment Insurance Acts was sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, for the period from the 1st October, 1924, to the 31st March, 1925.  As a result of renewed representations the continuance of the arrangement was sanctioned by the Minister for a second period of six months, and on further representations <Col N="1844" /> at the end of that period the arrangement was continued for a third period of six months, which ended on the 31st March, 1926.</P>
      <P>It was not possible to entertain applications made for a renewal of this contribution owing to the fact that no provision was made from the beginning of the last financial year until recently for financing new relief works.  In the circumstances, and with a view to facilitating the company in continuing to do business at Cobh, it was agreed to let them have the free use of three of the five oil tanks at Haulbowline and the occasional free use of the dock there.  These tanks are used by the company to store oil from the bunkers of ships requiring repairs, which if there were no storage for oil available, could not be dealt with at Cobh.  This concession can be terminated at any time on six months' notice should a decision be come to as to the future of the dockyard.  It is made entirely with a view to relieving unemployment.</P>

Kildare; if he is aware that there are a number of families whose houses are flooded with water each year; that there are one hundred and twenty-seven families who cannot get their supplies of turf saved and carted home; that a large number of these live by the cutting, saving and sale of turf and are deprived of their livelihood by the periodic flooding from this river, and whether he will give instructions to have the necessary drainage work in conjunction with the Barrow scheme carried out immediately, thereby giving much-needed employment.</P>

One serious difficulty in favourably considering such an extension has been created by the fact that although the Regulations have been in force since February of last year, the licensed traders in several areas have not given the necessary facilities to the Weights and Measures Inspectors to enable their stocks of bottles to be verified; and there is no indication that an extension of the period would effect any substantial improvement in this position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesNicholasDolan" hpid="Mr. DOLAN Mr. DOLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department has full information in the matter of materials for the manufacture of cement at Skerries and in other parts of the country, and has during the last few years persistently encouraged certain groups who examined into the possibility of opening a cement works in the Saorstát.  Unfortunately, after examination of the conditions governing possible manufacture, none of these groups was prepared, even with the financial assistance which could be given by the Department under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, to embark on the undertaking.  The Department would welcome any proposals from other parties and will examine such proposals sympathetically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not feel it desirable that I should express opinions here on details which are essentially a matter for experts, but it may be taken that there are sufficient materials in the neighbourhood of Skerries to supply cement <Col N="1853" /> works large enough to meet the full demand of the Saorstát for an indefinite period.  For a cement works of, say, 100,000 tons production the approximate capital expenditure would be from £350,000 to £400,000.  With regard to that part of the question which deals with the annual working-costs of a cement-making plant, it will be realised that the essential point in the case of such a factory is to determine what would be the cost of production per ton of cement.  On this point the various groups who have examined into the question have informed the Department that taking into account the present relevant items of cost in this country cement could not be made to compete with imported cement, and it was for this reason that the proposals under consideration did not materialise.</P>

The insurance officer was eventually satisfied in regard to this <Col N="1855" /> aspect of Mr. O'Brien's claim, but was, however, obliged to disallow the claim under Section 8 (4) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, since no contributions have been paid in respect of Mr. O'Brien during either of the insurance years 1926/1927 or 1927/1928.  It is understood that contributions are due in respect of insurable employment performed by Mr. O'Brien for some 2½ years previous to the date of his claim, and my Department has taken steps with a view to having these contributions paid.

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if a two-seater motor car, I.T. 406&mdash;the property of Mr. Wilton V. Taylor, of Mohill, County Leitrim, was commandeered by soldiers in charge of an officer from Boyle at 3 p.m. on the 4th April, 1922, and handed over to a lieutenant of the National Army; whether a claim for £23 15s. for damage, consisting of a broken radiator, hood, drive shaft universal joint, and bearing of engine was furnished on the 1st May, 1922, and again on the 28th June, 1924, to <Col N="1858" /> the Army Claims Department, and if all liability for this damage was denied on each occasion, and if this claim will now be reconsidered and payment made to Mr. Taylor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD Mr. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>A claim for £22 1s. 7d. in respect of damage and expenses in connection with the commandeering of a motor car was received from Mr. Wilton V. Taylor. From the information supplied by the claimant there was no evidence to show that the car in question had been commandeered by members of the National Army.  If the Deputy can supply further information, giving the name of the officer alleged to have taken the car, I will have it considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SamuelEHolt" hpid="Mr. HOLT Mr. HOLT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOLT</NameTxt>

      <P>Will Deputy Holt please repeat his supplementary question?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SamuelEHolt" hpid="Mr. HOLT Mr. HOLT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOLT</NameTxt>
      <P>The name of the officer was in the question when I handed it in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD Mr. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only the question as it is before me.  As far as I remember the case, it was stated that the man who commandeered the car came from the Boyle Barracks which, at that time, was not in the hands of the National Army, but in the hands of armed rebels.</P>

      <P>Complaints have not been received either that qualified persons were not included or that unqualified persons were included in the present register for the County of Westmeath.  Preparation of the new register commenced on the 15th instant. Collectors were specifically warned that neglect to discharge their duties fully would involve loss of fees and removal from office.  This warning will be strictly enforced.  Absolute accuracy cannot be guaranteed unless the public co-operate by inspecting the lists, which will be published on 29th January next, and ensuring that their names are accurately included in the lists and by making claims if their names are left off.  Claim forms can be obtained from the Registration Officer or at the Post Office, and claims can be made up to the 26th February.</P>

A scheme for the improvement of the existing supply has been under consideration by the Balrothery Rural District Council, who proposed to raise a loan of £30,000 for the financing of a joint scheme of water supply for Skerries and Balbriggan. At a public inquiry held into the Council's proposal evidence was given that there was a possibility of obtaining a supply for the town of Skerries by sinking an Artesian well. Arrangements for boring were subsequently made by the Rural District Council, and the supply is at present being tested as to quantity.

In connection with the concluding portion of the question, I may add that a loan not exceeding 75 per cent. of the cost for the erection of a creamery may be granted by the Department to a Co-operative Society affiliated to the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, provided, amongst other conditions, that the amount of share capital subscribed equals the proposed expenditure.

      <P>All possible steps were taken during that period and since by the Department to make known in County Leitrim the procedure under which loans for re-stocking purposes might be obtained by farmers through the agency of Co-operative Credit Societies, such societies, when formed, obtaining for the purpose advances from State funds for a term of at least three years (free of interest for that period in the case of societies obtaining local deposits).  As a result of this scheme, two previously existing Credit Societies and nine specially formed Credit Societies in the county have received State advances, amounting up to the present to approximately £9,000, in addition to over £2,000 in local deposits. I should hope that further societies will be set up in County Leitrim under this useful scheme, which is, as I have explained on previous occasions, in my opinion, the most satisfactory method of enabling State assistance to be given to those small farmers who have suffered through fluke disease, pending such arrangements for the making of agricultural loans of this nature as the Agricultural Credit Corporation, when it has been established, may decide to make.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Deputy commits himself to what it seems to him, I want to say that when questions are sent in, addressed to Ministers, the Ceann Comhairle, under the Standing Orders, is sole judge of order in the Dáil, and a question to appear on the Order Paper must satisfy the Ceann Comhairle.  Standing Order 30 says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Ceann Comhairle shall examine every question in order to insure that its purpose is to elicit information upon or to elucidate matters of fact or of policy, that it is as brief as possible, that it contains no argument or personal imputation.  The Ceann Comhairle, or the Clerk under his authority, may amend any Question, after consultation with the Deputy responsible for the Question, to secure its compliance with Standing Orders.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1879" /> Now the procedure actually followed and practised is that Deputies when they bring in any question, if any objection is taken to it, as a general rule come to an agreement with the Officers of the House, the Clerk or his Assistants, and if the Deputy cannot come to an agreement with them, then it is for the Deputy himself to interview the Ceann Comhairle.  And if no agreement is come to, then the question cannot appear on the Order Paper, and the question is ruled out.  The Deputy cannot in this fashion question a ruling given to the effect that a question was not in order.  What I understand he wants to do is to raise a matter on the adjournment which was ruled out as a question on the Order Paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is a matter of order.  The question has been ruled out, and it is a matter of order.  The decision of the Ceann Comhairle having been given, no question of privilege arises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>In that connection may I direct your attention to Standing Order 29, which is the one which secures to Deputies the right to ask questions, and I submit to you that it is the primary Standing Order in this matter.  It is the one which governs the whole procedure.  It states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Questions addressed to a Minister must relate to public affairs connected with his Department, or to matters of administration for which he is officially responsible.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>No, I will not hear anything from the Deputy upon the question.  I want to tell the Deputy quite plainly that the procedure generally followed is: if a Deputy cannot agree with officers of the House <Col N="1880" /> he should go to the Ceann Comhairle. The Deputy has not taken that very obvious remedy in this instance.  I am perfectly certain, although I have no knowledge of this matter, that if he disagreed with the officers of the House on the matter, he was told, as people are always told, that his remedy was to see the Ceann Comhairle.  He has not done that, and he has not given me any notice that he was going to raise the matter in any way.  Therefore, I am simply taken by surprise in this matter.</P>

      <P>I really cannot teach the Deputy elementary courtesy.  Standing Order 29 defines questions; Standing Order 30 defines the powers of the Ceann Comhairle. There has never been a case where an agreement has not been reached as to the form of a question, but there has very often been a considerable amount of difficulty as to the form of a question. In this particular instance, if the Deputy had consulted me in the matter personally, it might have been possible to reach agreement on the particular matter in the question.  He has not done that, and no question of privilege arises.  The question that arises is that the Ceann Comhairle, in pursuance of the powers given in the Standing Order, ruled that the question could not appear.  That matter cannot be raised further, nor can the Deputy, having had the question ruled out, avail of this particular occasion to ask the question. That would be obviously not in accordance with commonsense.  What the Deputy wants to do is to question a ruling of the Chair.  This is not the way to do that.  There is a way, but this is not the way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposed to an adjournment such as has been suggested.  First of all, as long as the Public Safety Act supersedes the Constitution we are going to oppose an adjournment over any extended period. Our next reason for opposing this adjournment is on account of the sum of £150,000 that has been allocated for the relief of unemployment.  Everybody who spoke on that subject admitted that that was quite inadequate, and it was accepted, I think, from every side of the House that it should be regarded only as a first instalment.  The period when unemployment tells most severely is during these winter months, and I think we would not be fulfilling our duty if we adjourned over one of the most critical periods for the poor people of the country.  A Committee has been set up to consider schemes for the relief of unemployment.  We expected that as unemployment is nothing new, and as some members of the Committee, the Labour members particularly, have been considering this question, they would be able readily to bring in some propositions for immediate relief of unemployment <Col N="1884" /> that would meet with the approval of the House.  Therefore, we think it most unfair that the House should adjourn over a period of practically three months without considering that matter.</P>
      <P>Again, there is the question of agricultural credits.  We are not at all satisfied with the Act dealing with that matter.  We are very anxious to be here to see what steps are to be taken in connection with these credits.  They are very important for the farming community, and as the farming community is suffering so much at the present time we are anxious to see in what manner these credits are going to be given, and we think it is unfair that we should be away and that we should have no opportunity of criticising the manner in which they may be given. There is also the question of tariffs. We have indicated by putting down a motion that we are not satisfied, not with the individual members of the Tariff Commission, but mainly with the fact that the members of the Commission are only part-time, and we have indicated that we think that the Commission ought to be broadened, and certainly that the members of the Commission ought to give their whole attention to the work.  One of the methods of relieving unemployment is to help on and foster as quickly as possible our own industries, and we think it most unfair that three months should be allowed to pass without having some reports from the Commission on the question of new tariffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the question of the Local Government Bill that has passed through its stages here and that has to be sent to the Seanad.  If that is not passed before January, I suppose the old Act will remain in operation and elections will be held in January, while if the Seanad chooses to insert any amendments I expect the Bill will have to come back here.  Then there are other matters, such as the great delay in dealing with the Gaeltacht Report and with the Fisheries Conference, and there are a number of other subjects which we would wish to bring forward here, such as the question of the prisoners.  We have put down a motion that an inquiry should be held into the detention of certain prisoners.  We <Col N="1885" /> think that all these questions ought not to be shelved for three months.  We have been sitting on an average only three days a week, and we have not been sitting very long.  Our case is that we could very well sit on for another fortnight or three weeks, and that an adjournment for a month over Christmas is the maximum that ought to be asked by the Executive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be well known to Deputies that the work of this House is not the only work the Government has, and that, as a matter of fact, if this House were sitting continuously throughout the year, three-fourths of its time would be wasted.  It is necessary that business should be prepared, that Bills should be considered and put into decent form before they are brought forward here.  The consideration that they can be given here is no substitute for the type of consideration they must get before introduction. There is also the question of the Estimates and the question of Departmental business and administration.  All these require time.  We are now at the period of the year when Estimates are being prepared and when the energies of Ministers and of the officials will be specially taxed if the preparation of the Estimates is to be properly done. This is a time that a reasonable adjournment is necessary, in any year. It is particularly necessary in the present year, because of the disturbance and upset to business that was caused by there being two general elections and other events which took up a great deal of time.  We have now a great deal more work thrown on the departments by reason of the extended question list.  Deputies do not realise how great an amount of work long question lists like those on the Orders of the Day involve.  That work puts a very severe strain on the staffs of the departments, at this particular time of the year.  So that the time of the House will be saved by a reasonable adjournment. Matters that are being discussed and that are proposed for discussion are important, but we would not be doing good for the country if we merely carried on a discussion of these motions and not pay sufficient attention to the preparation of Bills now in hands or <Col N="1886" /> the Estimates.  The Public Safety Act does not substitute the Constitution.  It amends the Constitution in certain respects. I need not go over that matter.</P>
      <P>With regard to the £150,000, certainly that cannot be expended before the 15th of February.  People who have experience of the expenditure of money in any sort of an economic way know that from the time the money becomes available there always elapses a certain amount of time before the actual schemes on which it is to be expended can be decided on.  Even when schemes are decided on, there is some little lapse of time before the money is required for them, and although something more than £150,000 may be expended before the end of the financial year, there is no chance of more than £150,000 being required between this and the 15th of February.  The same thing applies with regard to the Committee to consider the relief of unemployment.  If the Committee recommends immediately some smaller schemes, we have means of carrying them out.  If it recommends major schemes, even although it should within a fortnight be able to recommend some major schemes, it is extremely unlikely that a major scheme could be actually undertaken before the 15th of February.  If it is a scheme that involves large sums of money, it will have to receive consideration, and, even if approved of, some preparation and preliminary investigation has to take place.  There are staffs at the disposal of the Government, apart from the grant of funds which can be engaged immediately on the examination of any scheme that may be submitted and in making preliminary preparation.  No delay will be caused in the carrying out of any scheme recommended by the Committee on Unemployment because of an adjournment until the 15th of February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to agricultural credit, what is proposed is to set up an Agricultural Credit Corporation.  There will be no immediate work for the House in connection with agricultural credits.  As soon as the National Loan has been issued and money is available so that the Government may contribute its part and issue the prospectus of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, money will become available and the <Col N="1887" /> directors will proceed to get on with the work of the Corporation.  There would not be anything for the Dáil to do in that connection for some time. The people who are going to administer the Act, the directors, will have to settle down to their work.  When the Dáil could usefully intervene would be after some period when it was seen how the directors were dealing with it, or if Deputies thought they were not dealing with the question satisfactorily. Nothing would arise for the Dáil to do immediately.</P>
    <P>There are at present two big applications under consideration by the Tariff Commission.  One is an application for a tariff on flour, the other is an application for a tariff on woollens.  In neither of these two cases has all the evidence that is to be considered by the Tariff Commission been received by them.  I have inquired if there is any likelihood before, say, the last day of January, that a report will be received in connection with either of these matters, and I am informed there is not.  If it were received later than the last day of January, or even as late as that, no delay would be caused by an adjournment until the 15th of February.</P>
    <P>With regard to the prisoners and other matters, they have waited and they have been allowed to wait a long time.</P>

      <P>Let those who feel that the matter has been delayed too long blame themselves.  That is no case for taking up the view that the Dáil must sit continuously, that the Dáil is doing its best work by sitting continuously, and that a reasonable adjournment should not be given for the purpose of allowing the preparation of work for the Dáil, and of allowing suitable attention to be given by Ministers to the work of administration. Instead of saving time or doing better work by sitting continuously, the tendency would be for the Dáil to consider all sorts of general matters, to consider them perhaps in an inconclusive way instead of dealing with business that would be better prepared and be much more effective.  I am quite clear on this, that the work on <Col N="1888" /> the Estimates requires to be done in the interval of a fairly long adjournment, and that the House would not be doing a thing that is in the best interests of the country if an adjournment which would enable Ministers and the administrative staff to concentrate on this work were not agreed to.</P>

The motions on the Order Paper are very important, and the business put down for the consideration of the House is also important, but none of the matters which Deputy de Valera has mentioned is of more importance now than it was any time during the past five years, and if they could wait for five years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be stale, but nevertheless it is true.  So far as the motion which stands in my name is concerned, it is a matter in which our Party are deeply interested, and we would be anxious that that motion would be taken in time, but it is quite clear to us that, even if the motion were taken to-day, and if the Government were to accept it, or if they were foolish enough not to accept it and be defeated, effect could not be given to it until April next, when the Budget would be introduced.  We are just as anxious about having the Tariff Commission recast as anybody else in this House, and we have an amendment down to Deputy Lemass's motion which gives our view of what the Tariff Commission and its powers should be.  It is the view to which we gave expression when the Tariff Commission was being set up, and I would like to see that amendment carried as soon as possible, but the Tariff Commission is engaged in considering tariffs on two of the most important industries in the <Col N="1889" /> country and, even if this motion were to be passed, changes could not be made, in my opinion, before the Dáil reassembles.  There is only one question which I would like to have answered by the President, and I am sure he will forgive me asking it in view of our previous experience&mdash;that is, that he is not going to take advantage of the long adjournment to spring another election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the President will remember what happened on the last occasion when he sprang a general election, and he will probably profit by that experience.  So far as we are concerned, we feel that the real work of Deputies is not done in the House, and some of us want to do some work in our constituencies, as many of us have not been able to go to our constituencies and get in touch with our constituents, particularly this year, on account of the two elections.  During the elections, of course, we did get in touch with them.  With regard to the Unemployment Committee which was referred to by Deputy de Valera, I take it that this committee has now settled down to work, and that this House has no further control over it until it presents its report.  From that point of view, it does not matter whether the House is sitting or not. It seems to me that if that committee presents schemes, and the House approves of them, these schemes will be proceeded with, but, if not, the Government will have to answer to the House as to why they did not proceed with them.  Taking everything into consideration, and bearing in mind the fact that many Deputies have been sitting here almost continuously during the last twelve months, and that certain work must be done in the constituencies, I think the House is entitled to an adjournment, but it is a question afterwards whether the time suggested by the President is too long.</P>

      <P>I am not going to deal with that now.  The invertebrate attitude which the Labour Party are showing in this matter is one which will astonish most of their supporters in the country.  As regards the argument of the Minister for Finance, whatever strength is in his argument, that time is required for the preparation of Bills and Estimates, it does not justify the adjournment of this House before the business on the Order Paper has been dealt with.  I wonder, indeed, whether his explanation provides the real reason, or whether the Government are afraid of the business on the Order Paper, and, taking advantage of the laziness of Deputies and of the Labour Party, are running away from it.  Members may laugh at that statement, but that is what the country will believe.  There is no justification for the adjournment of the business of this House over the most critical period of the year for three months.  None has been advanced here.  If the machinery of the Government moves as slowly as, apparently, the machinery of the Tariff Commission moves, it is time that action was taken by us to speed up that machinery, and pour a little oil into it, or else get another Government.  There is also the matter of the National Loan.

      <P>Deputy Lemass expressed amazement and surprise, and stated that the vitality of the Labour Party had been sapped by their long experience in this House, but, while Deputy Lemass and some of his friends were galavanting round the country, the members of our Party were sometimes doing the donkey-work which should have been done by members of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, doing your donkey-work.  Deputy de Valera talks about the recommendations of the Unemployment Committee, but by not challenging a division in this House on the motion for the setting up of that Committee he gave his authority to its setting up, and I dare say he will give the Committee, to whose names he has not taken exception so far as I know, a reasonable amount of time and a fair chance to bring in its recommendations. The members of the Labour Party have never shirked their work, and there is no necessity for the insinuations of Deputy Lemass.  Deputy Lemass, I may say, appears to convey the impression to the public outside that the principal work of a public representative is confined to spouting here.  There are many Deputies who regard their work in connection with departments and dealing with complaints from their constituencies of much more importance than continually spouting here.  What is really put up to us is this&mdash;and speaking for myself, I am not going to give facilities in that direction&mdash;that we are asked by Deputy de Valera and his Party to review in a few weeks the history and the workings of this House for the last four or five years.  I am not prepared to do that.  Some of the things about which they complain would not have occurred if they were here during that time.</P>

      <P>It is a different question but it is a fact.  I think, and I am sure there are many Deputies in the House who share the same view, that during the discussions here it is practically <Col N="1892" /> impossible for an active member of this House to do the real Parliamentary work which his constituents expect him to do.  It is simply a question as to what would be a reasonable time for the adjournment that has been moved by the President.  I think those of us in the Dáil, who for the past five or six years have been endeavouring according to the best of our ability to do the work of Parliament according to our lights, are entitled, especially after the two general elections, to some period of adjournment to enable us to do the more important work which falls to the lot of the elected representatives of the people.</P>

      <P>We spent a good deal of time last week and the previous week discussing the pitiable conditions of the unemployed, and every Deputy considered it advisable to avail of the opportunities to give vent to his sympathy with them.  As a result, we got a grant of £150,000, which I think is in the nature of a sop, and that is supposed to be sufficient to rid us of this problem, and we are to hear no more about it until the House reassembles next February.  I am sorry to find that the Labour party has allied itself with the Government party in the attempt to have an adjournment for such a long period.</P>

      <P>For the information of the Deputies, I wish to say that I attended a meeting to-day of unemployed citizens of this city.  There were about 2,000 people at that meeting, all genuine bona fide unemployed, who have signed the register to indicate their willingness to work and their desire for employment. That meeting passed the following resolution:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That in view of the vast number of unemployed in the country, and having regard to the suffering misery and want of thousands of helpless women and children, we, the unemployed of Dublin, do hereby call on the representatives of the people composing the Free State Dáil to defer the postponement of the adjournment of that Assembly until ameliorative measures are introduced <Col N="1893" /> and adopted which will ensure against the prolonged sufferings of thousands of citizens of this country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder when the Cumann na nGaedheal and Labour Parties were going through the country a couple of months ago exploiting this question of unemployment and offering their sympathy, and some of them telling the people that it was only by their success in the election that unemployment would be solved, would they have dared to tell the unemployed that they would come in here and suggest an adjournment for three months while nothing definite had been done for these people? Would they have dared to have done that during the election campaign?  I submit that the people responsible for this prolonged adjournment, if it is carried, are deliberately sowing the seeds of social revolution in this country.  They are deliberately ignoring the honest and sincere claims of decent citizens.  These people may not have much power behind them, but they are growing numerically stronger, day after day, and they are also growing more determined in their demand for justice.  If that demand takes shape in any unconstitutional methods, the responsibility will be on the shoulders of those who vote for this adjournment to-day.  I wonder have the Ministers and the Cumann na nGaedheal Party any conception of the sufferings which these people will have to undergo during the Christmas festivities which are coming near?  The Ministers, no doubt, will not give one thought to the terrible sufferings of these people.  It is only at election times that they consider it advisable to face them in public.  Some of those Ministers and all the Dublin city and county Deputies were invited to that meeting to-day.  None of them attended.  If they had any conception of the sufferings these people are undergoing, I am sure they would not bolt and bar the doors of this Assembly and refuse to allow us the opportunity of ventilating their genuine grievances, and offering what contribution we can to a solution of the problem.  I submit that those who vote in favour of the adjournment are voting in favour of bolting and barring the doors of this <Col N="1894" /> House, and taking away any opportunity that presents itself here to let the country know of the hardships of these people.  Will the Labour Deputies go into the lobby in favour of that attitude, for that is what it amounts to?</P>

The unemployed have sent the message which I have delivered to this House to-day in their name.

Will facilities be given to that Committee for proceeding to various parts of the country, if necessary? I do not know whether the President will be able to give me this information <Col N="1895" /> or not, but in view of the fact that until the announcement was made in the Dáil yesterday as to the setting up of this Committee I was not aware of the intentions of the Government in the matter, and as I am not aware yet of their intentions in the directions I have indicated, I would be grateful if the President could give us the information I desire, especially as the Committee will not be set up now, I presume, until the Dáil is adjourned.</P>

Some of us have been here since early in June, and there has been imposed on us a task which many Deputies must feel, and I know do feel, and that is the task of listening to a great deal of what has been said here since the 16th August.

Deputy de Valera told us two or three times that it was most unfair that members of the Houses hould only at tend on an average three times a week. I wonder did he mean three times a year, because, after all, let us judge him by his own actions.  He has been a member of this Dáil for five years, and what has his average attendance been?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. AIKEN</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two motions on the Order Paper that should be discussed and approved of by the Dáil. The first motion, in the name of Deputy Lemass, deals with the machinery of the Tariff Commission.  Under it, the one industry that is supporting all the machinery of Government in this country has a chance of coming into its own&mdash;that is the agricultural industry. It is proposed now to adjourn for three months.  That means adjourning until next Spring.  The principal reason why the Fianna Fáil Party introduced this motion was to give the farming community an opportunity of doing something to relieve unemployment next Spring.  At the present time, under the machinery of the Tariff Commission as at present constituted, an industry applying for a tariff is required to put down £100.  The farming community is not organised.  We maintain that it is the duty of the Government, since it draws most of its revenue, two-thirds or three-fourths of it, from the farming community, to look after their interests.  We maintain that at the first available opportunity the Dáil should set up such machinery as would enable farmers to employ labourers and keep their sons at home in their own land.  If agriculture is protected it can give employment to at least one-fourth more people.  In addition, it can keep <Col N="1897" /> fully employed farmers who at present are only half employed.  The one little help that the agricultural community got from this Dáil during the past five years was the tariff of 2s. 6d. per cwt. on imported oatmeal.  That resulted in a big increase in corn production in this country and in increased prices to farmers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. AIKEN Mr. AIKEN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. AIKEN</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the difference all right.  Now that we are here we are going to trample on the heels of the Government, make them step out and do something for the people of this country.  We have been here only three months.  Deputies know quite well why we have not been here during the past five years.  Now that we are here we are going to see that the Government will step on or get out and make room for men who will do some work for the people.  Another reason why we oppose the adjournment is because we do not trust the powers of the Public Safety Act in the hands of a Cumann na nGaedheal Executive, and also because the Cumann na nGaedheal Executive have at the present time prisoners in jail for the same reasons that they advocated men should go to jail four or five years ago.  We are going to oppose the adjournment <Col N="1898" /> of the Dáil until an impartial Committee of the House is set up to go into the whole question of the prisoners, particularly those who claim that their cases arise out of the civil war, or that their cases have a political aspect.  We demand of this Dáil that it should not adjourn for three months without going into the cases of those prisoners.  We propose to set up a small committee consisting of members of all Parties to go into and examine these cases, with a view to the release of the prisoners if they are found to be political cases.  We do not trust the Cumann na nGaedheal Government with the powers in the Public Safety Act for three months.  We do not trust it with these powers for one day, but we cannot help it.  We are going to see at least, if we can help it, that the Dáil will not adjourn while the Cumann na nGaedheal Executive has such powers as the Public Safety Act gives at its disposal.</P>

I could meet some of the Executive Council and remedy any grievance or get concessions or anything else to meet the necessities of people who wanted anything done.

      <P>Deputies have supported this motion on the grounds that they are feeling tired and overworked. I wonder are they too tired to draw their salaries.  Are they not sent here to discuss these matters?  I daresay that the sessions of this House are shorter than the sessions of similar Assemblies anywhere else in Europe, with the exception.  perhaps, of the other Partition Parliament which has been established in Ireland, but I never heard more unsubstantial reasons for this adjournment than those advanced by the Minister for Finance.  Here we are with legislative work already in arrear, with a number of important matters to be discussed.  We are being brought back immediately after February, and then we have to rush at once to consider the question of the Budget <Col N="1900" /> and the Estimates.  The only way in which we can put the work in order in this Chamber is by dealing with the arrears and all the matters on the Order Paper before the adjournment, by having the adjournment as short as possible, and then coming back with a free hand to tackle such work as will await us, afterwards.</P>
      <P>I submit the real reason why we are asked to grant this long adjournment is not in order to allow legislation to be prepared, but because the Government is carrying on with an unreliable and small majority.  There are other important things that the Government has in view.  Geneva is calling, and they have got to go, and they cannot go as long as they stand here with a majority of seven.  Therefore, they have got to put this House in cold storage in order that they may have their winter sports abroad.</P>

      <P>Furthermore, there is one thing about the matter.  During our absence Deputy Morrissey and his party had their opportunity and how they made use of that the people showed at the last election.  As soon as it was clear that there was a party coming into this Dáil which would stand for the principles of Pearse as well as of Connolly, the people who had increased the labour representation from 11 to 24 speedily reverted to the men who would combine and guard, at once, the interests of the whole nation as well as of democracy in Ireland.</P>
      <P>As I was saying at the beginning, there was no reason which I could see as to why we should adjourn except the party necessities of the Government. They want to go to Geneva.  Their own members are becoming restive; they are refusing to attend.  They permitted the Government to be beaten on one division and we feel certain that if we had been able to give every question that would come before us the same examination and criticism of the Government's attitude as we have given during every discussion that has taken place during this session, we would speedily convert the Government majority into a minority.  That is the reason why this adjournment is proposed.</P>

Surely he must be aware of the fact that even in the Assembly in the British House of Commons many of its members&mdash;the major portion at any rate&mdash;are resident in London for the greater part of the year.  That is not so with the Deputies in this House.  Many of us have to come long distances to attend sessions here at a serious financial loss. I wonder whether or not Deputy MacEntee and those associated with him suffer that financial loss.  I do not know.</P>

      <P>In opposing this motion for the adjournment, I have in mind the 293 writs in respect of land annuities in East Cork that we have been told are in the hands of the Sheriff.  I wonder was the three months' adjournment decided on for the purpose of having 293 evictions?  We have an assurance from the Minister for Finance that the Tariff Commission spent ten months hatching out the rosary beads, and that it is now dealing with the tariffs on flour and woollens.  If there is anything in the world that would increase my anxiety to have this House continue sitting and to deal with the motion, notice of which has been given by Deputy Lemass, it is the dread of what this famous Tariff Commission will do in the matter of the <Col N="1904" /> tariffs on flour and woollens.  I say that because I do not think that that Tariff Commission is competent to judge anything whatever.  The Tariff Commission, we are told, has no power whatever. I asked a question here the other day about a tariff on or prohibition of foreign malt.  This prohibition of foreign malt would mean employment for 300 unemployed in one of our local towns; and when I asked that question I was told that the Tariff Commission had no power to go into that matter.  Are these 300 unemployed going to wait for three months longer?</P>
      <P>We had my friend Deputy Jasper Wolfe getting up here and attacking our Party.  It is only a short while since Deputy Jasper Wolfe told this House about the 50 per cent. increase he got in his votes since the June election. He did not tell the House that in the June election he went around West Cork as an opponent of the Government. He did not tell the House that he told the people of West Cork about the way the Government were blackguarding the poor republicans. In the June election he told the people that he was a half republican himself; in fact, he was &ldquo;one of the boys.&rdquo;  He came up here then and voted for coercion.  In September he went back for votes again, not to the republicans but to the Orange Lodges. He got their verdict and he came up here again, and is now carrying out their verdict here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with this matter, I wish to know are those writs going to be put in force in East Cork during the next three months?  Are we going to have, in my constituency of East Cork, 293 homeless families?  Are 300 to continue unemployed in one of our local towns until this hen of the Tariff Commission finishes out its hatching?  I think it is time, and more than time, that we should get rid of the Tariff Commission, at any rate.  I think that while there is a large amount of work here unfinished the Government should remain here and finish those arrears of work. The Minister for Finance assured us that the matter of the political prisoners was not a very urgent one.  He thinks they can wait.  They have waited for five years, and he thinks they can <Col N="1905" /> wait a bit longer.  I met the Minister for Finance before, in 1918, and it was in Belfast I met him.  I am sure that at that time he was hoping that somebody would make a move to try and get out the political prisoners.  I do not think he would have been satisfied to wait there five years longer.  I think it is now high time that this question of the political prisoners was finished and these men released.  I think any prisoner, a political prisoner in particular, who spent a Christmas in jail, will realise the feelings of these men to-day and will realise that it is time that some Commission was set up that would get these men released before Christmas.  I wonder will we get an assurance from the Minister for Justice that they will be released before Christmas.  Evidently the Minister for Justice does not understand jail.  I would like that he would get a spell there at any rate.  Then he would be more competent to judge what it is.  I strongly and definitely oppose this adjournment, and I think it is time we proceeded to get rid of the business in arrears and then adjourn afterwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the theory on which this House was founded was that it was a Sovereign Assembly, ruling the country, and that the Executive Council are the servants of this House.  I understood that this House has to say yes or no to whatever is done by the Ministers, and that even if the Appropriation Act says that the Ministers, in reference to the loan, can deal with this matter, it does not give him care blanche to act apart from his masters, namely, this House. The whole attitude to-day, to me at least, has been a surprise.  I thought <Col N="1906" /> that the fiction would be maintained that this was a Sovereign Assembly, but the attitude to-day is one glorifying the position of the Executive Council and the permanent officials and setting aside this House as an absurd talking shop.  That has been the attitude adopted from the Ministerial Benches, and I regret very much to say from some other benches also.  If this House is master of the situation, at least it should be treated with sufficient courtesy and should be allowed to finish the programme that is here.  Agreement could easily be arrived at, and some attempt could be made to meet the wishes on this side and complete the programme.  Some attempt should be made to meet the exasperated feelings of the people whom we represent.  The President has expressed more than once &mdash;other Ministers have expressed the view, too&mdash;that he was gratified that there was an appearance of an end of the quarrel by our coming in here; that there was some likelihood of a healing-up of the split in the nation.  I suggest, if the President is serious in his attitude, he should go as far as ever he can in dealing with the feelings of those whom we represent.  We are here trying an experiment.  We are here trying to do the very best we can for the things we love in the most peaceful manner in which it can be done.  We are not here simply to barge.  It is very painful to me personally to see quarrels between the Labour Party and ourselves, and even between some of those on the other side and ourselves.</P>
      <P>If there was one thing which interested me more than anything else when the Civil War came to a conclusion, it was the feeling of the shattered life of the Irish people, the shattered life of the nation.  The splendid unity we had before the Civil War was gone, and we were at the mercy of the enemies of this country.  Friends, I suggest that we should do the best we can here to meet the wishes, not merely of those in this House, but the wishes of the people in the country, the wishes of our supporters. We should do our best in order that there will be a real healing in the national fabric of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret very much that the Labour Party should have taken up the attitude <Col N="1907" /> which it has taken up, because I believe that in most of our objects we have a common cause with Labour. Most of our supporters are the very poor, the small farmers and the workers.  So far as I am concerned, nothing made me rejoice more than to feel there was a common feeling amongst the poor people in Waterford, a common feeling between the workers&mdash;the Labour people&mdash;and the Fianna Fáil Party.  I would rejoice if the position were such that we felt we were working for a common cause.</P>
    <P>I regret gibes should have been thrown at us for not coming in here before.  We may, in the views of some people, have done something that was wrong.  They may think we were mistaken, but at least they must attribute to us deep convictions in the matter, and leave it at that, with the ordinary respect one human being has for the dignity of another when that other human being has considered convictions. We do not want to go back on past history.  We merely want to go ahead and heal the wounds of the past and get the best possible results for the nation in the future.  I appeal to the President to try as best he can to meet the wishes and interests of Deputies on those benches, and their supporters, and see if in some way we cannot complete the programme and end this session in a spirit which will help to build up a new nation in this country.</P>

      <P>It has been no surprise to me to hear some members of the Labour Party getting hot under their collars against Fianna Fáil in this matter.  When they look for an adjournment for three months, for a prolonged adjournment, it is no surprise to me at all.  Deputy Anthony, who was one of those who got hot under their collars, told us that he is suffering serious financial loss by being here.  I suggest that it is a capitalist he ought to be and not a Labour man.  We were told that we have not been here for the past five years, and that we were only new in this matter of being zealous in regard to the sufferings of the unemployed. It is not a new thing at all with us, because some of us were in the position, not alone for five, but for the <Col N="1908" /> last seven or eight years, that we would not have suffered serious financial loss by being here.  As a matter of fact, most of us have been unemployed for the last eight years owing to our zeal for the unemployed; that is, those of us who have not been on hard labour in prison.  Some of us were on political treatment.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party, to my mind, is only living up to its reputation in voting for this particular adjournment.  I had no other impression about the Party than that it would do such a thing.  On these benches there are Deputies who have been so zealous in the cause of democracy in this country that for the last eight years, and the last five years in particular, those Deputies were unable to be here most of the time because they were in jail in the cause of democracy.  I think it ill becomes those who call themselves Labour representatives to attempt to bring us to boot on that matter.  You do not like history, A Chinn Comhairle, any more than I do, but I have in mind the fact that there was one particular occasion when the elected representatives could not meet, as a revolution took place before they had time to meet.  I object to this prolonged adjournment in case, as Deputy Cooney pointed out, of a possible revolution of the unemployed in this country.  That revolution might take place before this Dáil has time to reassemble.  On those grounds I oppose this prolonged adjournment.</P>

      <P>A few reasons have been put forward why this House should adjourn.  The Minister for Finance tells us that he wants time for Executive work, and it has been suggested that too much time has been spent talking.  I recollect that on another occasion the Minister for Finance used an expression with regard to time when he said: &ldquo;Ireland ceased to be an island of saints and scholars simply because her people gave too much time to their books and prayers and too little to the feats of strength and daring and the practice of sword-play.&rdquo;  Deputy Morrissey tells us that Deputies here are tired because they have been sitting here for <Col N="1909" /> the last five and a half years.  I may say that I never saw the inside of this building until I was elected, and if what I have seen since I came here has been a fair sample of what has caused the tiredness to those very strong-looking Deputies, I cannot quite understand their attitude.  I have some notes here that I took during various debates.  I find, for instance, that when the discussion was in progress with reference to the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Bill, Second Stage, ten Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies were present.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady" hpid="Mr. BRADY Mr. BRADY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BRADY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking on the reasons put forward why we should adjourn.  There were three reasons given.  The Minister for Finance wanted time for Executive work; Deputy Morrissey wanted a holiday because he was tired of being here, and Deputy Jasper Wolfe, who has since vacated his seat, said he was exhausted listening to the speeches for the last few months.  These, as far as I can find out, are the very strong reasons or arguments put forward why we should take a holiday.  The benches at present show how strong those arguments are. We know from our little experience here that Deputies seem to act merely as a voting machine.  They come into their place when the bell rings.  In the circumstances, I think that we could keep the House in session, and that the three arguments put forward could easily be met by having bells placed in the various places&mdash;first of all where the Minister for Finance and the other Ministers want to do their Executive work.  When the bell rings they can come back into their seats.  I believe&mdash; at least it is rumoured&mdash;that that method was very successfully adopted in the Shelbourne Hotel, or some place like that, during the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a good deal of talk since we came here with reference to the will of the people.  I should like to know how many Labour or Government Party Deputies have listened to the people outside and ascertained their <Col N="1910" /> opinion upon this question.  From travelling on trams and trains I have heard opinions expressed, and as far as I can make out, from mixing with the people, they are totally opposed to this early adjournment, and especially to a long adjournment.  I think that we would not be acting in the interests of the people if we adjourned at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. BRISCOE Mr. BRISCOE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BRISCOE</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two reasons why I oppose the adjournment, and I should like to state them as briefly as possible.  One is the Public Safety Act.  I believe that the fact of this Act being in existence, and of its operation being permissible during the long adjournment, would have a rather dangerous effect throughout the country.  Only yesterday, for no reason whatever, without the slightest semblance of a foundation, a man was arrested in Dublin by the C.I.D. and charged under this Act as being suspect of having concerned himself in the assassination of the late Kevin O'Higgins. There was no semblance of foundation for any such charge.  He was taken to the police station and held there for a considerable part of the day.  I know from investigation that that man was only arrested because of a bit of spite that arose, and he was threatened that they would get even with him.  If this House is not in session for any length of time, and if men are harassed as a result of the powers in the hands of the servants of the State under this Act, I fear that a serious situation will arise which could not be easily redressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance referred to the floating of a National Loan during the adjournment.  I should like to put forward a suggestion.  I believe that if this House as a whole voted a loan, or understood what loan was being negotiated and gave its approval&mdash; although the Minister has the power to borrow&mdash;the loan would be a far greater success and would be more readily supported by all sections of the community throughout the twenty-six counties.  It would do away with the danger of a certain class of people thinking that it was only the Cumann na nGaedheal Party that could float a loan&mdash;that it was a loan floated by Cumann na nGaedheal.  We have never yet suggested from these benches <Col N="1911" /> that we would oppose a loan which would be used for the benefit of the State, for the building up of our resources and the alleviation of unemployment. I should like the Minister for Finance to appreciate that a loan sanctioned by the whole House could be more readily obtained, and on better terms, once it was known that Fianna Fáil&mdash;although they are not yet the Government, but may shortly be the Government&mdash;are prepared to shoulder responsibility for the flotation of such a loan.  That is purely and simply a business proposition.  Of course, the Minister for Finance may feel that if the loan is negotiated by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party it may have a better value from a party political point of view, but I believe that people outside, irrespective of their political outlook, would be better pleased to see the loan sanctioned by the whole House, and every Party in the House having full responsibility for its negotiation. I should like the Minister to consider that, and I should also like to get some assurance that the powers under the Public Safety Act would not be abused in the event of this adjournment for a long period being carried.</P>

Some Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party talked in a vague way about the issue of the loan being one of the reasons why they objected to the adjournment.  Deputy Briscoe has suggested that there should be a formal <Col N="1912" /> sanction from the Dáil of a loan, which, of course, is rather unnecessary, seeing that the Minister for Finance is arranging with the banks for loans every day. That is part of his usual function.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooney talked about some meeting which took place to-day of 2,000 unemployed.  He apparently was invited to the meeting, but other Deputies were not.  I am sure they would have been very glad to attend to hear the opinions of the unemployed in this matter.  He did not mention who it was drew up and proposed the resolution which was unanimously passed.  I do not know who the gentleman was, and the Deputy did not mention his name.  I presume it was after consultation with the 2,000 unemployed who attended the meeting.  I agree with a lot of what the Fianna Fáil Deputies have said about the Labour Party.  In this I am speaking for myself.  Although the Labour Party did great and historic work for the State, in fact, kept this Dáil going during a very hard and difficult time, I notice, now that the Fianna Fáil Party have come in, they are getting rather pompous and self-satisfied. A lot of what the Fianna Fáil Deputies <Col N="1913" /> said about them is quite correct.  At the same time, the Fianna Fáil Deputies should be very careful of what they say about the Labour Party.  They may need them at any moment, and they should not be too extravagant in their criticism of them.  I notice that they did not denounce the Labour Party before the various votes of no confidence in the Government were proposed within the last few months.</P>

I happened to see some statistics drawn up by a foreign newspaper, not since this Dáil was elected, but about six months ago, from which it would appear that this Assembly, in the last five years, has actually been engaged in more work, and more steady work, than any legislative assembly, not only in Europe, but in the whole world.  These figures were not official, but they were compiled by very serious people.  I simply would like to know from any Deputy on the Fianna Fáil Benches if he can mention any Parliament in the world which actually did more work and sat more days than this Parliament did in the last five years.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy is not serious.  Deputy Little said we should wait until we had completed the programme.  If we had been dealing with it for the last two hours I think we would have got through a great deal of it.  There is a matter that I want to ask the Minister for Finance about in relation to relief schemes.  If the Committee on Unemployment bring in an early report on some particular question, would the Government be entitled <Col N="1914" /> to go ahead and carry out the suggestions of the Committee before the Dáil reassembles?  I understand that the matters that will be dealt with by the Committee will not be outside the £150,000.  I would like to know if the Minister would be prepared to go on with any recommendations of the Committee before the Dáil reassembles.  I should like to have an explanation on that matter.</P>

      <P>During the debate there were a number of terms used. One was that there was more important work done by the Departments in the Recess; and number two, we heard the phrase used that this House was nothing but a place for spouting, and that came from such an ardent democrat as Deputy Davin.  Then we heard from Deputy Daly about the power of the departments, and terms about the will of the people.  I never had any illusions about what the President referred to in the recent debate as the limitations on the power of the Executive. There are limitations, certainly, in certain fields where the interests of the common people of the country are concerned.  There are no limitations when the Public Safety Act would be put into operation.  We have another reason as to why we should continue in session, and that is to raise the status of this House to that of a real sovereign assembly which would voice the real will of the people.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde referred, in a very easy way, to borrowing in an ordinary fashion by the Department of Finance, the flotation of loans and that kind of thing.  One would think they had no bearing upon the life of the nation at all, and that it was not a matter for this Assembly to discuss.  We can discuss eggs, and whether they are clean, and we can discuss about butter being clean, but we cannot discuss the monetary bearing of these things.  The details are for us, the principles are for the departments.  We should not adjourn, because it is the duty of the Fianna Fáil Party anyway to see that the sovereign will of the people is expressed in this Assembly, and it has never been expressed in this Assembly. I ask Deputies on the opposite benches now that we are not on political platforms, which of the Parties regard the people as the sheep.</P>

      <P>Pardon me; before the President concludes I should like to say a word.  I heard appeals made both from the Labour Benches and from the benches opposite that this <Col N="1916" /> motion ought to pass because the adjournment was thought to be a reasonable one.  Speaking personally, and I think for those on these benches also, I would not object to a reasonable adjournment being proposed in view of the Christmas holidays.  But what we do object to is the unreasonable length of the adjournment moved.  After we have sat for twenty or twenty-one days, an adjournment of twelve weeks is proposed. That does not seem to me to be a reasonable proposition.  I say we are as reasonable as anybody else in this matter.  Speaking for myself, I would be just as happy to have a holiday as anybody in this House.  I shall be just as pleased to shake the dust of this place off myself as anybody here, in fact, more so than anybody, I think.  I am not so enamoured of this place that I want to sit here very long.  I am not so enamoured of the company I have to keep.  Some of them, I am sure, will return the compliment, but I am stating frankly what I feel.  The President knows very well the company I am referring to.  I do not want to sit here longer than is absolutely necessary, but, on the other hand, as I have come in here not very willingly, I do not want to neglect my public duty.</P>
      <P>I have sat out the debates here as regularly as any Deputy since I came into this House.  I have seldom been five minutes absent as long as the House was sitting, and I hope to continue doing so as long as the House sits.  It is a tiring operation.  I realise that as well as anyone.  One realises that very often on the way home with a headache, and I would be glad of an adjournment.  I have gone through all this, and I would be glad to have an adjournment at Christmas as a reasonable thing, but, I say that this proposition is most unreasonable from every point of view.  It is unreasonable from the point of view of men who want to do business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin, I believe, said that this was a talking shop.  I wondered that some of the Deputies opposite, who were so fond of lecturing us and talking of this place as a sovereign assembly at certain times, when it suited, did not rise up in anger when a Labour Deputy talked so slightingly of this place as a talking shop.  These were <Col N="1917" /> the Deputy's words.  Public business cannot be done without a certain amount of talk.  That has to be so. That is a kind of democratic rule, and this Assembly above all others, we are told, is super-democratic, and therefore we must have super-talkers. Anyway, talk is necessary for this kind of public work, but it is tedious.  It takes up time and delays progress sometimes, but, nevertheless, public work has been done since we came here, probably as much work in proportion as was done in any assembly of the kind having the same amount of public work to accomplish.  But I hold that we have done very little on the whole because we have not been sitting very long.  We have sat twenty-one days and we are going to have a long holiday of twelve weeks.  To my mind, that is not good enough.  I certainly object to that being called a reasonable adjournment.  If a reasonable period were proposed coming near the holiday season I think Deputies on these benches would not be unreasonable. It may be said: &ldquo;You have been here only a very brief time; you are not as tired as some of the rest of the Deputies who have been here five and a half years,&rdquo; as we were told several times some Deputies have been here.  Perhaps some of us who have not been in this House were in other places outside, working for five and a half years, or double five and a half years, and doing much more arduous work.  Although I say that sitting and listening to speeches for eight or nine hours a day is arduous and tiresome work, still, some of us on these benches have been doing work equally arduous outside, and, with all respect, I say of at least equal service to the nation, as those who have talked of the arduous work that is done here.</P>
    <P>Although it is a subject I do not like to talk about, as it has been mentioned, we have not been paid for that work and we did not expect payment; we did not look for it and we did not want it.  The less said on these matters the better.  We have done our work because we felt a public urge to do what we thought was right and proper. We would do the same again.  We are anxious to do the same here.  We are not anxious to shirk work, and I am <Col N="1918" /> really grieved that support for this proposition came from the Labour Party.  I say that sincerely, and I am surprised, because they ought not to set an example in slacking work.  To my mind, that is what it amounts to. They may disagree with that view.  It is public knowledge that the Labour Party has not, during the last year, improved its position, so far as representation in this House is concerned. Might I say, with all respect to the Labour Party, that this is not the way to improve it?  I should like to see the Labour Party well represented here.  I think it is right and proper that they should be here in good numbers, and I would say that in their best interests this is not the way to improve their position, or to increase the number they will be able to return to this House&mdash; that they should slack work.  That is what it looks like to one individual at any rate, and that is what they are proposing to do by voting for this motion. I read yesterday in the newspapers of a decrease in the number of trade unionists.  I would ask the Labour Deputies to take that lesson to heart, and to think of putting in a little more work.</P>

      <P>The Ceann Comhairle allowed the Labour Deputies to criticise us for our action, and I <Col N="1919" /> thought I was giving them some advice that might be for their good.  If the Leas-Cheann Comhairle thinks it is not, I withdraw.  I doubt if there is any more important work to be done than the work to be done here, so far as the nation's ordinary routine is concerned. There is no more important work that I know of.  I do not know what Deputy Davin has in his mind.  There is no more important work than the work done here from day to day.  It may be tiresome, but it is routine work that has to be done if the ordinary affairs of the State are to proceed.  The question of the loan has been mentioned. I am particularly interested in keeping the House in Session so that the question of the prisoners may be reached. That is one of the questions I have in mind, and it gives me some worry. Some Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches mentioned the condition of prisoners at Christmas time.  I know what that is, and the state of mind of these men, and so do Deputies on the opposite benches realise it, as I know there are men there who have been through the same conditions.  Bearing that in mind I would ask, if the adjournment is to be insisted upon, if some announcement could not be made concerning the motion regarding the prisoners that appears on the Orders of the Day.</P>
      <P>I certainly do feel that if we sit here a little while longer and arrive at that stage when we could discuss the prisoners question, we might be able to impress upon the opposite side of the House the desirability of considering the question of public feeling on the loan that is coming on.  It might help, and help materially, in getting the settled kind of public opinion that would help the nation as a whole, if a different attitude were adopted to those who are political prisoners, who are in jail for what are called purely political offences.  These are the reasons that urge me to vote against the motion, not exactly against the adjournment, but because I am against what I believe is an unreasonable proposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. MAGUIRE Mr. MAGUIRE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MAGUIRE</NameTxt>
      <P>My objection to this adjournment is in view of the economic distress of the country.  I speak mainly <Col N="1920" /> from the point of view of the small farmers and labourers in the West of Ireland.  There is no doubt at all about it that these people have been looking towards the Dáil for the last two months in the hope that some word of encouragement might be given to them in the way of a prospect of relief of the distress that they have been suffering from for some time back.  The Dáil, in proceeding as if they were dealing with conditions that were normal, are proposing to adjourn after assembling for a few weeks, and the Government are to be at full liberty for the next few months to dispose of matters affecting the people as they like.  While that might be all right, or might be a practical viewpoint under normal conditions, I maintain that the conditions are not normal; they are very abnormal, from the point of view of prevailing distress.  With the arrival of winter, these workers have been anticipating something in the way of relief work, some outcome of the big discussion that occupied the Dáil quite recently.  They look with anxiety as to the possibility of that money being diverted for immediate relief work, particularly so when it is a well-known fact all round the country that Deputies on the other side and their organisation are giving out publicly to all whom it may concern that the administration of the grant for relief work will only be secured through membership of Cumann na nGaedheal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the money voted in this House for the relief of distress is to be used again, as it has undoubtedly been in the past, for the purpose of vote-catching and for propaganda work for one political organisation, I hold that it is most unreasonable not to have the House sitting at least during the period in which that money is being disposed of, to see that it will be spent to the satisfaction of the House.  Money voted for distress purposes in the past, it is a well-known fact, has not been used to the best advantage.  The expenditure of public money in all and every circumstance and condition should be supervised to see that it is used in the most practicable way, and that its proper expenditure is always secured. It will not be secured if the methods adopted in the past and the statements <Col N="1921" /> circulated throughout the country are to apply again.  On the matter of drainage schemes, these have been promised to the farmers for a long time past, but the Drainage Bill has recently been withdrawn, and we must wait the reassembly of the Dáil before we can discuss any practical method of drainage.  The months we are passing through now are the months in which farmers could take advantage of drainage schemes.  During the slack period they could work on drainage schemes on their farms, or on drainage schemes on a large scale.  Does not this indicate to the farmer that the Dáil is merely tinkering with the question? The position of the farmer, as expressed on the platforms of all parties, has been painted pitiably, but when practical effect could be given to all this discussion here, we find ourselves at a critical moment retreating from our posts and leaving the farmer to bear his burden unassisted.</P>
    <P>Within the last few weeks, I am informed that in the constituency that I represent&mdash;Sligo-Leitrim&mdash;the courts have been busier than ever issuing decrees for the non-payment of land annuities.  Will no message of hope be sent to these farmers that their little interest in the homes that they have endeavoured to preserve will be secured to them?  There has been a great deal of propaganda used by the Government Party to the effect that they have produced a scheme of agricultural credit by which some assistance will be available for the farmers to enable them to restock their lands and to carry on over this difficult period.  But without one word of hope to the farmer, beyond what was given to him during the last two elections, the Dáil is now adjourning, and he is left to wait until the Dáil reassembles to discuss his pitiable condition.  Under these conditions, from the economic distress prevailing, if for no other reason, I say that the grounds are sufficiently strong to warrant this House sticking to its duties until something has been done to relieve the distress among the workers and the small farmers.  If it does anything short of that, this House will not be doing its duty.</P>

      <P>I want to mention a matter that I did not know about when coming in, and that is that the Executive has power to raise a loan without any further reference to the House.  The Minister for Finance referred me to the Appropriation Act.  I take it that is No. 2 of 1927?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that we ought to be very jealous of our powers over Supply.  I think it is true that, technically and legally, according to this Act, the Minister for Finance and the Executive have the right to borrow up to £15,000,000.  I think it will be treating the House with more than discourtesy if this loan is floated during the Recess.  There was plenty of time since this Act was passed, on the 29th July, 1927, and since we met here, to bring forward proposals with respect to this loan, and I think it is stretching their powers, just as they did when they dissolved the House recently without consulting it, for the Executive to float this loan when the House is not in session.  That is a reason which, I think, by itself, would be quite sufficient to give us grounds for opposing this until the question of the National Loan, its amount, the terms, the purposes for which it is going to be applied&mdash;particularly its amount&mdash;are made known. The House may feel that the amount is not sufficient, for example, to meet the needs of the country at present and, as I have said, I think it is altogether wrong for us to permit the Executive to take complete control for two and a half months without the provision of a check of any kind.</P>

      <P>As the President would say, the Deputy is a child in these matters.  It would be quite impossible to consult the House.  Whether the House is sitting or is in recess makes no difference in the matter of the loan.  It is necessary to consult with people to get the necessary promises of support and, having come to a decision, to act on it.  Once that decision is acted on, it is binding whether the House is in session or not. <Col N="1923" /> It would be quite impracticable in the public interest to have any other procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I will say it sufficiently loud for the Deputy to hear me when I come to him.  In the first place, Deputies are dissatisfied with the amount of work that has been done. Five Bills have already been passed <Col N="1924" /> through the House, and I anticipate that two others would have been passed were it not for the fact that something like three hours have been taken up to-day in answering questions and in debating this matter of the adjournment. It is for Deputies to appraise the value of the discussion that has taken place and to say whether or not the time was not, to a very large extent wasted.  Deputies repeated what had been said by others.  Some Deputies opposite were very severe.  A short time after one of them had spoken another Deputy from the same Party would get up with the oil-can and modify, to a very large extent, what had been said by his erring brother, and then a reflection would come to his mind that we were near Christmas, a time of peace and good-will, and that we were verging towards unity and love of one another&mdash;that notwithstanding all our infirmities and sins they were still prepared to love us.  The time has been wasted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that whatever business there is on the Order Paper that is still incomplete, and not likely to be completed by reason of the adjournment, is business which at this stage ought not be there.  Take the question of prisoners.  Deputies have stated that they are particularly anxious about certain people, in respect of whom there is a claim that they are political prisoners. I put it to them that if at any time in the future any of these Deputies should be in an Executive and that certain persons have been before the court, have been sentenced, and are duly serving their sentences, it is open to any lightheaded person to come into the Dáil and put down a motion to the effect that so-and-so is a political prisoner by reason of the peculiar circumstances or the time of his conviction and, therefore, there is to be a full dress debate here on a matter of this kind.  That is not a business way of approaching such a matter.  If there be a claim in respect of a prisoner, or a number of prisoners, which the Executive Council ought to consider, or rather which the Minister for Justice ought to review, that is a matter that ought not in my opinion be discussed here.  It is not good government to have a matter of that sort discussed <Col N="1925" /> here, and it does not indicate an appreciation of the responsibility of citizenship to have it discussed here. It is not a matter upon which there can be any doubt.  It is really a question of fact and on a question of fact there can be very little doubt.</P>
    <P>As regards the other matter of the Tariff Commission, I do not take it particularly seriously.  Perhaps I am wrong but I heard during the last few months that we were to have prohibition of exports except under licence. I do not quite understand the meaning of &ldquo;under licence.&rdquo;  I do not understand it yet, notwithstanding all the speeches that have been made, but now I understand that the principle of a Tariff Commission is accepted.</P>

      <P>I have not time. I am a very busy man, and I consider that the time of the Dáil that has been spent on various matters might have been devoted to business of a more important character.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>But we wasted considerable time.  Deputies opposite have been emancipated from the shackles which the electors put on them for a considerable time, and they have, of necessity, much more vim and desire to enter into the arena and discuss these matters than those of us who have been here for the last five years. Making all such allowances, however, I am not satisfied that any words of wisdom which we have heard have given much satisfaction to any of the people who sent them here.  That, however, is a matter for themselves.  The Minister for Finance has answered the six points put up by Deputy de Valera. As regards the Unemployment Committee, <Col N="1926" /> if that Committee recommended some comparatively small or isolated scheme we could advance money from the Relief Schemes Vote, as the money would be there.  I am sure that it will not be spent inside three months.  I do not anticipate any recommendations that would make it impossible for us, if we agree with the wisdom of the proposal, to finance them.  No proposal has been put forward by any member of the Government in that connection, and I think that Deputy MacEntee was probably drawing on his imagination in his references in that regard.  Deputy Redmond asked me a question in regard to the number of the Committee dealing with the position of ex-servicemen. I anticipate that it will be small.  As to whether they will be facilitated in going through the country, any facilities they would request from the Executive would be afforded.  The sittings, I think, ought to be held in private, but that would be a matter on which I would be guided by the Committee.</P>

      <P>With regard to the National Loan, the terms on which a loan is floated do not depend on what the Dáil thinks, but rather on the state of credit; and the amount depends partly on the needs of the Exchequer and partly on the terms which can be obtained.  I can quite understand an Executive bringing up a proposal that X millions should be borrowed at Y per cent., and the Dáil saying that X should be ten times X, and Y half of Y.</P>

      <P>The Oireachtas has given the Executive Council that particular authority, and we are in a <Col N="1927" /> different position to that in which we were when the previous proposal, which the Deputy has in mind, was before the Dáil.  The only other matter is that referred to by Deputy Cooney.  I think that the Fianna Fáil Party will have to recruit its membership from some better material.  We were told that there was an unemployed meeting, and the Deputy devoted fifteen minutes of his speech to that meeting, but there was not a single constructive proposal in connection with the meeting.  Any of us could have attended the meeting and said: &ldquo;I am the only person who has any sympathy for you,&rdquo; as I suppose the Deputy said.  Any of us could have said: &ldquo;All the other representatives have no interest in the unemployed,&rdquo; and not a single benefit would have accrued to the unemployed persons by that.</P>

Just now, when I am putting it, is not, in my opinion, a suitable time to talk of an amendment.  If it were intended to introduce an amendment it should have been put forward earlier, and I do not think that I can accept an amendment at this stage.

The Dun Laoghaire Blackrock Dalkey Corporation Bill has passed the First Stage in the Seanad, and the Cork Harbour Bill is in the same position.  The Dublin Port and Docks (Bridge) Bill was committed to a Joint Committee of both Houses but, inasmuch as it was not in a completed Stage, it will have to go through the same formality again, and a motion for recommittal will have to be submitted to a Committee of both Houses.

      <P>Táim ag cuidiú leis an mBille seo.  Ba mhaith liom a rá, ar an gcéad dul síos, go mba cheart an mhóid seo do bhaint amach as an Acht mar gheall ar an diobháil a rinne sí don Gheadhilg.  Gan caint ar rud ar bith eile, ba leór sin.  Cuireadh isteach ar scéimeanna ranganna Gaedhilge i gcúig no sé contaethe agus briseadh suas cuid mhaith acu&mdash;go h-áithrid i gContae Mhuigeo, i gContae na Gaillimhe agus i gContae Bhaile Atha Cliath &mdash;mar gheall ar an mhóid seo.  I gContae Mhuigheo bhi na múinteóirí ag obair ar feadh sé mí, no mar sin, nuair a cuireadh an t-Alt seo den Acht i bhfeidhm.  Dhiúltaigh na múinteóirí glaca leis an mhóid agus briseadh suas na ranganna.  Ba é an cás céanna é ag muinteóirí na Gaillimhe.  Cuireadh deire leis na ranganna nuair do dhiúltaigh na múinteóirí dul fé mhóid. Rud ba mheasa ná san, cuireadh ruaig ar Gaedhil a bhí ag obair go dúrachtach ar feadh na mbliánta ar son na tíre&mdash; daoine a rinne troid ar son na h-Eireann seachtmhain na Cásga. B'eigin dóibh dul thar sáile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1937" /> Rinne an t-Aire Tailte agus Talmhaíochta tágairt do'n cheist seo iné. Bhí sé ag caitheamh droch-mheasa ar thír-ghrádh na ndaoine agus ar na feara so atá ar thaobh nea-spléachas na h-Eireann.  Ba mhaith liom a chur i n-iúl don Aire go raibh duine amháin. ar a laighead, 'na chontae féin a thuig céard ba tír-grá ann agus b'éigean do'n fhear seo imtheacht as an tír. Colm O Gaora ab'ea an fear go raibh iachall air dul thar sáile mar gheall ar an Alt sin.  I mBaile Atha Cliath bhí cúigear múinteoirí ag obair go cruaidh agus na ranganna a bhí fén a gcúram, bhí siad ag dul ar aghaidh go maith. Bhí na ranganna san briste suas agus an t-Alt seo ba chionntach le sin. Anois níl an obair á dhéanamh chor ar bith.  Bhí na múinteóirí ag saothrú an méid airgid a bhí ag dul dóibh.  Bhí Colm O Gaora&mdash;agus na daoine eile cosúil leis&mdash;sásta leanúint den obair a bhí idir lámhaibh aca ar an méid airgid a tugadh dóibh.  Nuair a bhíonn duine sásta obair do dhéanamh, nuair a bhíonn sé ag saothrú a thuarastal, nuair a bhíonn sé i n-ann an obair do dhéanamh i gceart, nuair a bhíonn sé foghluimthe agus céim aige do réir an phuist a bhíonn aige, ní ceart aon rud eile d'iarraidh air.  Briseann rud mar sin isteach ar shíocháin aigne agus ar shaoirse aigne duine.  Is cuma má thagann an phágh as chiste Puiblí nó as chiste príomháideach&mdash;sí an t-aon cheist amháin, an bhfuil sé ábalta ar a chuid oibre do dhéanamh agus an bhfuil sé sásta í do dhéanamh.  Ní cóir don Rialtas nó do dhuine ar bith eile ceisteanna eile do chur air.</P>
    <P>Is aisteach an rud é go bhfuil dlí mar seo i bhfeidhm sna sé contaethe. Sul a bhfaigheann duine, pé Gael no Gall é, post ón Rialtas sna sé contaethe caithfidh sé móid do thabhairt no fuirm do shighniú go mbeidh sé dílis do Rialtas Craig.  Is aisteach an rud é sin agus ní aontuíonn na Teachtaí annso leis.  Támuid ag síul go dtiocfaidh an t-am nuair nach mbeidh sa tír seo ach aon rialtas amhain.  Ach má éilionn Rialtas Craig ar daoine móid do ghlaca bheith dílis dóibh agus ma fágtar an mhóid seo 'san Acht annso, ce'n chaoi a cuirfear deire le sgoilt na tíre?  Caithfidh duine a admhail nach bhfuil mórán maitheasa i Stát gur éigin dó rud mar seo do dhéanamh.  Tá seanfhocál <Col N="1938" /> ann&mdash;&ldquo;Ní feidir fuil a bhaint as turnip.&rdquo;  Muna bhfuil dílseacht do Rialtas i gcroidhe na ndaoine, ní féidir é a chur ionta le móid no le páipéar do shíghniú.  Muna bhfuil daoine fén Rialtas ullamh seirbhís dhílis do thabhairt don Rialtas ní thiocfaidh aon atharú aigne ortha mar gheall ar páipéar do shighniú.  Deirim gur fearr don Rialtas an mhóid seo do chur i leath-taoibh.  Ní árduionn sí meas na ndaoine ortha féin no ar an Stat. Déanann sé sclabhuithe desna daoine in áit saoranaí agus is feárr saoránaí saora do bheith ann ná saor-sclabhuithe.</P>
    <P>Ma tá duine sásta an obair do dhéanamh, ní ceart éileamh air móid do glaca.  Deirim-se nach ar mhaithease do'n Stát é.  Nior cuireadh isteach an mhóid sa chaoi go mbeadh meas agus ard-mheas ag na saoranaí.  Cuireadh isteach é mar rud beag, suarach, nimhneach.  Duine le aigne nimhneach nea-Ghaelach a chuir isteach i.  Gidh na bhfuil móran measa agam ar an Rialtas, is oth liom gur cuireadh isteach an airtiogol so mar is comhra é go bhfuil soisgeal Craig agus na Sasanai acu.  Sé seo an rud is mó a thaithneann le daoine cosamhail leis an Teachta J.J. Byrne, an Teachta Jasper Wolfe agus le muinntir na bPoppies.  Is chun iad do shasú a chuireadh isteach í.</P>
    <P>Ach ni hé sin an taon chuis amhain. B'fheidir go bhfuil raisiún eile ann. Tá intinn an-chumhang ag daoine airithe agus ma flúichann duine a bhróga ba mhaith leis, na daoine eile do dhéunamh amhlaidh.  Tá eagla orm ná bhfuil coinsías an Aire socair agus tá faitchíos air go dtiocfaidh an lá nuair ná bheidh morán measa ar na daoine a thug an mhóid seo isteach, mar gheall ar a ndearn sé in-aghaidh na tíre.  Ba mhaith leis na daoine seo a bheith in ann a rá, nuair a thiocfas an t-am so, go raibh gach uile duine eile có h-olc leo féin.  Ní ceart do'n Rialtas a rá gur acu san atá an ceart agus go bhfuil gach uile duine eile mí-cheart. Is rud beag suarach é seo nach féidir le duine é do chur isteach ach amhain duine ag a bhfuil intinn beag suarach. Táthar a rá gur in agaidh Tréasúin an tAlt seo.  Ní creidim é sin.  Ní tuigtear céard is Treasún ann.  Tá muinntear na tíre níos táchtaí ná an roinn seo den <Col N="1939" /> tír.  Tá daoine in Eirinn&mdash;agus beidh, le congnamh Dé&mdash;nach mbeidh sásta a bheith dílis do roinnt de'n tír.  Tá daoine in Eirann d'foghluim náisiúntacht ó shoisgéal an Phíorsaigh.  D'foghluim siad céard is tír-ghrá agus céard is saoirse ann agus chuir siad rómpa a bheith dílis don tír&mdash;don tír ar fad agus ní don dhá leath di.</P>
    <P>Iarraim ar an Aire agus ar na daoine ar an taoibh eile den Tigh&mdash;má tá siad dáiríribh in a n-abrann siad&mdash;gan an rud suarach seo do fhágail san Acht. Tá an Rialtas ag iarraidh guthanna na bhfurmóir agus d'iarrfainn ortha anois, nuair a bheidh Vótáil ar an mBille seo, cead do thabhairt do sna Teachtaí a nguthanna do thabhairt do reír a mbarúil féin.  D'iarrfainn ar an Rialtas gan iarraidh ar an Aodhaire iachall do chur ar na Teachtai dul i gcoinne an Bhille.  Beiridís cead a gcinn agus cead a gcos do sna Teachtaí agus táim cinnte go bhfuil Gaedhil ar an dtaobh eile atá sásta in a gcroidhe agus in a n-aigne nach cheart a nguthanna do thabhairt in agaidh aon dhuine atá sásta a chuid oibre do dhéanamh agus atá in-ann é do dhéanamh chó maith.</P>
    <P>Nuair do dhiúltuigh múinteoirí an mhóid do glaca, tugadh isteach in a n-áit daoine nach raibh i-nánn an obair do dhéanamh chó maith leo.  Thárla go raibh teastas dhá-theangach ag na múinteoirí a bhi ag obair agus cuireadh in a n-aiteanna daoine nach raibh acu ach an gnáth-theastas, daoine gur theip ortha teastas dhá theangach d'fháil. Act tá siad san maith go leór chó fada agus a chuaidh siad síos ar a nglúnaibh ós cóir an Rialtais.</P>
    <P>Má tá an Rialtas chó chinnte go bhfuil furmhór na ndaoine ar thaoibh na móide seo, iarraim ortha cead a thabhairt dos na Teachtaí guthanna do thabhairt mar is maith leo.  Má dhéanam siad sin, b'féidír go bhfeicfeadh siad nach bhfuil gach ball de Chumann na nGaedheal ar aon intinn lén rud beag suarach seo.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom a chur in iúl do sna Teachtaí agus do sna hAirí nach bhfuil aon mhaitheas 'sa rud seo.  Muna bhfuil dílseacht don Rialtas agus meas ortha i gcroidhe na ndaoine, ni chuirfidh páipéar do shigniú aon leigheas air. <Col N="1940" /> B'fhearr do shíocháin na tire an t-alt seo d'fhágailt amach.  Eireódh mórtas Gaedhil dá bhfeicfeadh siad aon chomhartha ón taoibh eile go raibh siad chun na sean-rudaí nimhneacha atá ag roinnt na ndaoine do chur ar leathtaoibh&mdash;da dtabharfadh an Rialtas <i>gesture</i>, mar adéarfa.  Muna ndeannann siad sin agus muna nglacann siad leis an mBille seo, ná ceapaidís nach mbeidh aon chur isteach ortha agus gur féidir leo suidhe go socair, ná ceapaidís nach dtiocfaidh an lá nuair a eireoidh na Gaedhil chun a ndicheall do dhéanamh ar son saoirse na tire.  Ní chuirfidh páipéar do shígniú cosc le sin.  'Sa bhlian 1916, do throid daoine ag a raibh páipéar sighnithe do Rí Shasama, do throid siad ar son na h-Eireann.  Níor chuir sin aon bhac ortha agus ní chuirfidh an rud beag suarach seo aon bhac ar Ghaedhil an lae iniu.  Muna scuabfar amach an rud suarach nimhneach seo déanfidh na Gaedhil féin é.</P>
    <P>I would like, for the information of very few perhaps of the Deputies who are here, to remind them that it is my belief, and that I think it is their own belief, that in enforcing this declaration on public servants and on the servants of the State, they are not in any way benefiting the State or acting in the best interests of the State.  I say that because if a person does not give allegiance voluntarily he certainly will not give it because of having been forced to sign a paper.  When a person is forced to do that, it certainly is not going to make him give the State allegiance.  Deputies on the Government benches will know that if a man is forced to sign a declaration of allegiance, as hunger has forced many an Irishman to sign such a declaration, that will not prevent these men afterwords from doing all in their power to advance this country beyond its present status.  Deputies here perhaps do not agree that everybody in Northern Ireland, in every public position, should be forced to give allegiance to the Government of the Six Counties.  If they were to agree to that then they should agree that the Six Counties should always remain under a Six County Government. I can very well understand Deputies being in favour of this declaration if they agree that this country is to remain as it is, if the Saorstát is to remain <Col N="1941" /> as it is, a Twenty-Six County Government within the British Empire.  I can very well understand Deputies who think like that being in favour of forcing public servants to sign this declaration but if they want the Gaels of this country to unite North and South and when it is feasible to make some advance nationally then, I do not see any reason for asking for such a declaration as this.</P>
    <P>Anyway if the signing of this declaration is forced on every individual in the State through stress of circumstances, that is not going to change the position as far as some of us see it.  We believe that in spite of all the declarations that may be forced on the citizens of the State the time must come when an advance must be made by this State. When I was speaking here before, the President said that we on those benches (or rather I) were rattling the sabre.  I tell the Minister now that by enforcing this declaration on the citizens of this State he and his Government are rattling the sabre.  They are throwing down a challenge which is equivalent to rattling the sabre and if through force of circumstances, people may accept that now, it may not always happen in the same way.  The Minister for Agriculture last evening tried to rally to his side the weak men on the Government benches who believe that there is no necessity for a miserable thing of this kind in any Act.  There are men on the Government benches who do not think it necessary in the case of servants who are capable of doing their work.  Very few of them who do not agree that it is sufficient to ask any servant of the State to do his work capably and well and that nothing more should be asked of him.  The Minister of Agriculture tried to rally those on other lines.  He talked about violence and treason and all that kind of thing.  He defined treason, of course, in his own way.  I remember reading at one time somebody's definition of treason.  He said: &ldquo;Treason never prospers; what is the reason?  For if it prospers none dare call it treason.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Ministers should well understand <i>that</i>, for many of the Irish people hold that they were the first men in this country, and they were the only men, to commit treason; but because their treason prospered by the <Col N="1942" /> force of English arms, their treason has turned out now not to be treason. Their definitions of treason are not going to be accepted by the Irish people in that way.  If this section were put in by the Ministers because they wanted to please Deputy Cooper or because they wanted to be more English than the English themselves, as Craig wanted from his servants, that is not the view of the Irish people.  The Ministers may take up that attitude; they may want to be more English than Craig.  We can understand that position. But the Ministers should realise that no matter what declaration they force on the Irish people, it will not prevent the people from thinking right nationally and from making an advance nationally.  If the majority of the Irish people, or at least always the good minority, think they can advance nationally, they will first think of the national advance and they will not think of any declaration of this kind that is forced on them in their hunger.</P>
    <P>It is because this declaration is no good, and because it will prevent nobody from taking up arms against the State at any time, that I think it should be removed.  It will not prevent a man from taking up arms if he thinks he ought to do so.  Does the Minister for Local Government think because a man signs this declaration it will prevent him from taking arms against the State?  I think if he believes that, he has not looked at the situation properly. I realise that it will not.  If I signed a declaration yesterday and if, to-day, I was prompted by some motive to take up arms against the State, I would do so.  I would not think of that declaration if I believed that my decision of to-day to take up arms was right.  It would not prevent me going against the State.  The only thing that this declaration will prevent is a certain unity amongst the best elements in this country.  It will make the people feel that while there are those bull-dog methods being carried on by the Government, there is no hope for Gaelicising this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government should be the last man to force a declaration of this kind in any public service.  Ministers have experienced the futility of this declaration.  They have <Col N="1943" /> talked very much about the majority will and about the freedom of the people and the great status to which we have advanced.  I would ask them to allow a free vote of the House on this matter.  Let them take off their Whips and give a chance to the men on their benches who are Gaels and who believe that the only thing to be required of a man in a position is that he is capable of doing the work and that he does the work.  I have spoken to members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party individually and I know what their views are.  If the Whips are taken off, I believe that a majority in this House would be got to vote for this Bill.</P>
    <P>On the introduction of this Bill some Government Deputies, who, I believe, have not changed their opinion, voted against it. Deputy Esmonde is one of these.  Others whom I have spoken to opposed it, because it is a mean thing to put in between Irishmen.  Of course, if they do not take off their Whips I realise that we will probably lose on the vote.  It is unfortunate that we all, on both sides of the House, have come to realise that you have on the Government Benches the same old rusty machine that you have had for the past five years.  They will all vote against this Bill if the Whips are not taken off. If a chance is given, some of them, I think, will vote differently.  But simply because somebody on their benches says that this is the right thing to do, the machine will twist its wheel automatically. It is a ridiculous thing, when men are sent here to work in the best interests of the people, that they are always going to answer to the whistle of the machine.  When the Public Safety Act was under discussion it was voted by the Government members because it was required for five years.  President Cosgrave said, &ldquo;We want this for five years,&rdquo; and they all said &ldquo;righto.&rdquo;  Shortly afterwards he said, &ldquo;We only want this for two years,&rdquo; and the machine said &ldquo;righto.&rdquo;  Only about a quarter of an hour afterwards he said, &ldquo;We only want this for one year,&rdquo; and they said, &ldquo;That is just the very thing&mdash;righto,&rdquo; and the machine voted again automatically. <Col N="1944" /> Many of these promised their constituents that they would not be part of the cogs of that machinery, that they would think freely in the best interests of the people, and I wonder what their supporters will think when they see all the wonders of that machine, the wonderful slavish authority that is being maintained by that machine. I ask the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance&mdash;they at least were supposed to have at one time, and they probably have yet, a special interest in matters of this kind&mdash;to realise the difficulties and the harm that has been caused already to the language by this thing. In opposing this Bill I ask them to remember that they are not advancing nationally; that instead of doing what they first promised, to remove when they could the obstacles in the road to full freedom, they are now putting on the road to freedom every obstacle they can.  This is not imposed by England, it is imposed by themselves.  They put this in to tie down Irishmen; to make slaves of them all; to say, &ldquo;Because you work for me you must be a slave for me.&rdquo;  We are living in the twentieth century, and the Irish people and the whole world should have advanced a little more, and be able to think more freely.  Because a man is getting a miserable salary, he should not be a slave to the big man who holds a stick over his head.  All those who were either dismissed or forced to resign because of this clause were prepared to give a declaration to work conscientiously.  They had qualifications to do the work they were appointed to do, and when a declaration of that kind can be got from any official, I think the best thing for the State is to let a man of these principles work for the State in order to prevent bitterness between people.</P>

      <P>I should like to assure the Deputy who has just spoken that he is making a very great mistake if he thinks there are any Deputies on these benches who, because they have the ideal of the Gaelicisation of Ireland, or because they believe in the fullest freedom and the fullest development of this country, have any sympathy whatever with the mover of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Party which moved the Bill.  I am opposed to this Bill precisely for the reason that I believe in the necessity for the Gaelicisation of this country, precisely for the reason that I believe there is something in this country bigger than any State formula, bigger than any State machinery.  I believe, and I think Deputies on these benches also believe, that the lives of the people of the country need not and cannot be bound down within any political formula or any system of Government.  But there is one thing that we do believe: every person in this country should give allegiance to, and that is the principle, that it is only the majority of the people of this country who have the right to rule it.  The Deputy who spoke now made reference to rattling the sabre.  We on these benches hold that the only people who have the right to rattle the sabre are the majority of the people of the country, and it is precisely because we hold that that we are against this Bill.  I personally have a great deal of sympathy with people who, through honest convictions, have lost appointments, have lost their way of living, because they refused to take this declaration.  I have known one man, who has been a friend of mine for years and years, who happens to belong to that category.  I have the greatest possible sympathy for him because I believe he is quite sincere. At the same time, I believe that he took the action he took simply because he was deceived by the propaganda of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass last night spoke about people passing milestones during the last few years. I think Deputy Lemass and his Party have passed a good many more milestones in the last three months than this Party have passed in the last five years.  There is one particular milestone they have passed to which I would recommend their attention in regard to the question at issue in this <Col N="1946" /> Bill.  I am doing this now seriously, and with no intention of making Party capital out of it.  I suggest to Deputy de Valera and his Party that, instead of coming here and talking vague and confused metaphysics about this question, they should go to the people whom they deluded into refusing to take this declaration, whom they deluded into throwing away their livelihood, and tell them, what they told the Irish people three months ago, that this declaration was an empty formula.</P>

      <P>I do not agree that it is an empty formula.  But if it is an empty formula for Deputy de Valera and his Party, it can only be an empty formula for those whom they deluded.  I do not agree that it is an empty formula.  I believe that it is a declaration, and a declaration which is not only binding on the people who are compelled to take it by the Act, but binding <i>ipso facto</i> on every law-abiding citizen of the State, whether he takes it or not.  This declaration requires no more from anybody than simply that they should bind themselves not to use force against the majority of the Irish people.  I hold that every citizen is bound not only by law, not only by political law, but by the moral law, to obey that doctrine.</P>

I have heard views expressed from the opposite side with which I cordially agree.  I quite agree that if men are determined to use violence against the country, against the Government or the State, no declaration of this kind can prevent them.

      <NameTxt>Professor TIERNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not mentioned it; it was dragged in by Deputy Aiken.  You can leave out that question of 1922 altogether if you like. I have definite views about that, but ever since 1922 the people have had half a dozen opportunities of deciding the point by open and free voting as between Deputy Aiken's views and mine.  They have decided it several times, and until the authority that decided it has decided otherwise I hold that the decision has the force of law, and that not only is it a political crime to try and change that decision by force, but that it is a moral crime also. In asking these people to take this declaration you are asking them to do nothing which the ordinary citizen is not bound to do whether he takes this declaration himself or not.  I think the whole difficulty arises from the use of the words &ldquo;loyal&rdquo; and &ldquo;loyalty.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies opposite believe that men asked to subscribe this declaration are asked to subscribe to every article of the Free State Constitution, to every article of the Treaty and to every action of the Government.  I believe that is not what is meant by the word &ldquo;loyally.&rdquo;  I believe it is possible to take that declaration and to refuse to subscribe to, if you want to, every single article of the Constitution and of the Treaty, and to hold that these things should be altered.  But I believe, whether that declaration is there or not, you are not entitled, morally, to use violence against the majority of the <Col N="1949" /> Irish people to alter one line or commoa of the Treaty or the Constitution.  I said it was open to Deputy de Valera and the leaders of the Party opposite, to go to the people they have led into this position and say, as they announced for themselves, not, if you like, that this declaration is an empty formula, but that it is a thing which binds them to nothing to which they are not bound already.  I certainly, for one, if that attitude was adopted and if that plea was made and accepted, and if that declaration was taken in that spirit, should be very glad to see every possible effort made to bring back the people who lost their livelihood through their refusal to take that declaration, and to see all possible effort made to heal whatever bitterness or trouble may have been caused by the misunderstanding of this declaration.  But until we get down to the bed-rock proposition that nobody has any right, whether Irishman or Englishman or anyone else, to use force against the majority of the people of this country, we will not be able to get anywhere upon this or any other question.</P>
    <P>Mention was made here yesterday evening, I believe, of a Deputy in the Fianna Fáil Party who, at some time, refused to take this declaration and was, at a later stage, elected a member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I suggest to the Deputies that brought forward this interesting case that it is not a case to be extraordinarily proud of at all. The Deputy in question is in the curious position of the gentleman in the apologue, who first strained at a gnat and then swallowed a camel.  Perhaps now he can look back with a certain amount of amusement to the innocence that led him a year or a year and a half ago to refuse to make a declaration not half as strong as the one he took willingly a few months ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor TIERNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe what <Col N="1950" /> is wrong in all this matter is that the Fianna Fáil Party have been confusing two things all the time.  They have been confusing political formulas and phrases and systems with a thing which is bigger and more lasting than any political formula or phrase in this country.  They are confusing the right to work for the advancement of the Irish nation with working for the advancement of the particular State which the Irish nation happens to adopt as its from of expression for the time being.  There is no reason why we should not all agree to put the nation above the State, why we should not all agree that the State is simply the accidental and momentary expression of the nation, that it is simply the expression of what the nation agrees to take from time to time, and that there is no such thing as any political formula, Republic or Empire, or anything else to which the nation is bound, or towards which the nation is compelled, by any set of political principles, to work.</P>
      <P>I saw that Deputy de Valera nodded in agreement when I said that.  But where I differ from Deputy de Valera is that Deputy de Valera apparently has at the back of his mind the notion that somehow or other this Irish nation is bound to the doctrine of the Republic, that somehow or other this nation is bound down to some one set of political principles or political formulas, that Deputy de Valera has drawn up for it.  That is where I differ from him. I hold that while we have spent the last five years fighting and wrangling about the accidental and momentary political formulas of the nation, which I say is older and greater than any political formulas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor TIERNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of us can neither talk of it nor work for it. While we have been wrangling and fighting about a political formula with which Deputy de Valera wants to bind down the Irish nation, either now or in the future, that nation has been brought almost to the point of extinction. Deputy de Valera's principle is that people have the right to work secretly and immorally against the majority of the people for the setting up of some political formula that Deputy de Valera believes in.  If that doctrine is to be broadcasted and accepted, I believe that we are coming to the extinction of the Irish nation, which, as I said, is older and greater than any political formula, whether it be Deputy de Valera's political formula or my political formula.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to Deputies, sincerely and honestly, to realise that it is time that we came to an agreement on that one point&mdash;and it is the one point that will make all the difference&mdash;that we would leave out 1922 and leave out the prospect of scoring points over one another about what happened in 1922, that we would accept the doctrine that for the time being the Irish people have accepted and have agreed to work this State, and that it is wrong and immoral for any Irishman, or for any Englishman or anyone else, to try by force to prevent the Irish people from using and working any State that they want to use and work.  That is a simple doctrine, and I can see no motive or no reason which would induce any one to refuse to accept that doctrine, except the motive or the reason that he wants to score over a political opponent, that <Col N="1952" /> he wants to prove now that he was right four years ago.</P>
    <P>We have had these poor people refusing to take that declaration.  We have had some of them sent off to other parts of the world; we have had them thrown out of employment; we have had them thrown out of employment on the belief that Deputy de Valera willed that they should be thrown out.  Having willed that, he took back what he said, and he now comes forward with a different policy and a different doctrine.  If there is anybody to whom these people should go for redress, if there is anybody whom they could accuse of being responsible for their loss, it is Deputy de Valera and the Party which now supports him.  Deputy de Valera talks about re-uniting the people.  He wants to re-unite the people on a principle which is the father of disunion; he wants to re-unite the people on the principle that any small band that likes can come along and use force against the majority of the people.  That is the only principle that he has.  That is the principle that dictates the proposal in this Bill, the principle that anyone who likes is entitled, not only to say, &ldquo;I do not agree with this particular from of State that the Irish people have at present,&rdquo; but to go further than that and to say, &ldquo;I will cut my neighbour's throat in order to prevent him from accepting this particular formula that the Irish nation has accepted.&rdquo;  I say that that doctrine is the doctrine of the father of disunion, and I say in all sincerity that if Deputy de Valera thinks he is going to re-unite this country on the principle of anarchy he is doing a thing that will bring about the extinction, not of this State, but of this nation, more surely than the bitterest enemy of this nation could succeed in doing.  I think there is a bigger principle involved in this matter than Deputies realise.  It is a matter that is well worth spending time in discussing.  Until we have thought it out and have cleared our minds as to whether we stand on the principle which I have enunciated or whether we stand for Deputy de Valera's principle of disunion and anarchy, we will not make any progress in this House, in this State, or in this nation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tierney made an attack upon the mover of this Bill, and it all turned on the one charge, the charge that this Party stood for the use of force.  That, I submit, is ignoring the history of the last few years. I am not going to make an attempt to go into the rights and the wrongs of the last few years, but I wish to point out to Deputy Tierney that the whole significance, from the time of the &ldquo;cease fire&rdquo; order, of the policy of Sinn Fein, and then of the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party, has been an attempt to get back upon the basis of a peaceful movement towards freedom, and that there is nothing in this matter of the test about violence at all.  It is a question of the deep convictions of certain individuals, certain non-conforming nationalists, who feel that they are deeply committed.  You may say, if you like, that they love the Republic not wisely but too well, but there they are; it is their psychology, and it must be allowed for and recognised in the State and in the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At any time in the past history of Ireland you will find individuals who, from the point of view of the Government of this country, may have been inconvenient to the constitutional movement&mdash;men like O'Donovan Rossa.  But will anybody who is a sincere nationalist deny that they were an asset to the nation?  Will anybody deny that the country would be in a bad condition if it had not got those people, with those uncompromising convictions of Irish nationality in them?  Every nation in the world has these extreme left-wing men with <Col N="1954" /> national principles.  Every country and every constitution allows for that, because they know that in times of national crisis these men are a tremendous asset to the state.  There are men opposite who must remember when they were in that position, when men like the President were amongst a small group of Volunteers who were taking up an attitude that was regarded as uncompromising, unpractical and dangerous, who were a lot of dangerous desperadoes, and so on.</P>
    <P>We got our chance when the time came, when other channels for the march of the nation were shut off, when it became perfectly clear to the nation that it was impossible to make any advance on the lines of Home Rule, and when it became necessary to have the episode of 1916 and so on.</P>
    <P>You find that this spirit, which, in certain individuals, is essential to the general life of the nation, spread. I submit that this particular test does not deal with the question of violence at all; that the people concerned are not necessarily people who are trying to use violence.  It is the general opinion of people of commonsense in Ireland at present that violence would be a very inexpedient way of trying to do anything for the purposes of helping on the march of the nation. But this test is definitely setting bounds to the march of the nation, and we can fall back on the old phrase of Parnell that there should be no bounds to the march of the nation.  Deputy Tierney spoke about something greater, the nation being greater, the progress towards complete freedom being greater.  Well, then, for God's sake, let us get rid of anything that is in the way of that.  These people who have taken up the attitude of conscientious objectors are debarred from position in the public service.  As a matter of fact, perhaps, the very best test of their character is the fact that they are willing to make sacrifices for the beliefs that are in them.  This thing is odious to the minds and hearts of, at least, one-third of the Irish people.  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture emphasised yesterday the importance of majority rule, and he really carried the question of majority rule too far <Col N="1955" /> Everybody admits there are times when a majority is wrong.  There are times when it is necessary to oppose majority rule.  Everybody will admit that.  The Minister and his colleagues opposed majority rule on one famous occasion.</P>

      <P>They broke the Collinsde Valera pact, which was made an Act of Parliament of the Second Dáil, which was voted for unanimously by the Ard-Fheis, and voted for by the majority of the people at the election. I am not going now into whether they were right or wrong, but they cannot stand up here and say that they stand for majority rule, having that history behind them.  On another occasion their tribute to majority rule was of a very doubtful nature indeed, and it was not so long ago when they, by some means or other, persuaded a majority of Mr. Jinks to move from one side of the House to the other, and on the strength of that went to the country.  That was not a tribute to democratic or majority rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then again on the question of the majority mandate for the retention of this particular test let us go into the figures of it.  Let us first of all distinguish between those who acquiesced in the Treaty and those who were in favour of this test.  I submit there is no majority returned to this House favoured with a mandate to retain the test.  Check the figures of the last general election.  There were 57 Fianna Fáil, 13 Labour, 2 National League, and 2 Independents, who were very definitely dissociated from the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  That gives us 74. The Cumann na nGaedheal Party of 61, and the Farmers 6, make 67, who, we will say, were whole-hog out for the Government policy, tests and all.  There were 11 Independents, who, at least, were doubtful on this question of the <Col N="1956" /> test.  Some of them may have been in favour of it, but some of them certainly did not get a mandate from their constituents. I want to go as far as I can in conceding to our opponents in this matter.  Suppose we allow them 7, and suppose we exclude 4 others as doubtful, what do we find?  We find that we have 74 on one side and 74 on the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>You must see what was their mandate from their constituents. I submit it is an extremely doubtful matter, that the mandate is equally divided, and that it is obviously a case where, if people really had regard for democracy, for the fair agreement which must be the basis of any Constitution, there would be some common goal by which that test would be treated in such a way that it would be possible for these conscientious objectors to take part in the life of the nation, just as they were taking part in it before, or as they wished, in serving it in a public position.  That is my contention, and I say that the Minister for Lands and Agriculture was not entitled to make the plea that there was a majority of the people in Ireland in favour of this test.  Further than that, he pressed the point of majority rule very far indeed. His attitude on it was undemocratic, anti-national and unjust.  He said that majority rule was the only basis of the Constitution.  I submit there is another basis of any Constitution enacted in Ireland, and that is the principle of putting Ireland first and the interests of the British Empire or any other country a long way after those interests of Ireland.  That should be the test of loyalty, and it should be the test by which citizens of this country ought to decide.  I submit there are people in Ireland who do not stand that test, men who are represented in this House, who put the interests of the British Empire first and the interests of Ireland second.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to hear Deputy Cooper committing himself to the principle that he puts the interests of Ireland first, and I hope that, on the first occasion there is a conflict between the British Empire and Ireland, Deputy Cooper will prove the strength of his commitment this evening.  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture took up the attitude, apparently, that majority rule, right or wrong, must be obeyed on all occasions.  The preamble to the Constitution says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Eireann, sitting as a constituent assembly in this Provisional Parliament, acknowledging that all lawful authority comes from God to the people, and in the confidence that the national life and unity of Ireland shall thus be restored, hereby proclaims,&rdquo; etc.</P>
      <P>The authority comes from God to the Irish people.  I submit if that is the authority, it can never be an authority to do wrong; and, further, that attitude has been condemned time after time by the Church to which the Minister for Lands and Agriculture and myself happen to belong.  It has been condemned time after time, and the claim that liberty has the right to wrong has been referred to by very wise and learned people as the cloak of malice, and that what applies to the individual applies also to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To anybody familiar with the controversies of the last fifty years it is a commonplace that in the conflict regarding the Church's attitude majority rule is very often wrong and immoral. If you want a palpable example of it to-day you have only to refer to Mexico.  The case there is very much on all fours with our situation.  Undoubtedly the Catholics of Mexico are <Col N="1958" /> in a minority and they are taking up what the Minister says is an immoral attitude by opposing the majority. They are being shot for that.  The time will come when their local government will impose tests on those who will not submit to majority rule, and the world will point to that country and say &ldquo;that is an unfair and penal law as it prevents these people getting back into the life of the Mexican nation.&rdquo;  So I say this is an unfair and penal law which continues the spirit of the civil war in this country, and it has no basis in justice or democratic principle of any sort.</P>
    <P>The same charge might be made against the Pope himself and those who followed him in refusing to recognise the King of Italy as King of Rome and in standing out as conscientious objectors against that system.  In that way it is clear that there are very marked limits to the principle of majority rule, and that we are beyond these limits. We are doing the best we can to heal the wounds of the nation.  We have gone very far in humiliating ourselves. We have gone very far in hurting the national spirit that is in us in the matter of that article in the Constitution which deals with the oath&mdash;Article 17. We have gone as far as we could, and we did not do it for personal reasons, but because we felt that the life of the nation was at stake, that the existence of the republican spirit in Ireland was at stake, and that, if we did not take up the attitude we did, grave injury would have been done to this country. That is a very different matter to the matter of putting a test to individuals, and when Deputy Tierney appeals to us to act on behalf of his Government, to enforce on our followers further humiliation, I contend that he is doing something which is very much against the spirit of Irish nationality.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands and Agriculture said that there was duress upon England as well as on Ireland in accepting the Treaty.  As he brought the matter into his speech, and was allowed to discuss it, I think I may fairly deal with the question.  He took as an example that there was duress upon him, if he brought bullocks into market, as to the particular price that would be fixed for them.  That is not <Col N="1959" /> the same kind of duress.  There is a sort of influence there, but he is not starving, and there is no man with a big stick standing behind the man who is bargaining with him.  He could take his cattle back again to his farm, and he is a free agent in the matter.  But the big stick was there in the case of the Irish nation.  There was a division of opinion in Ireland, and the people were distracted and terrorised and the element of duress was there.  I submit, from the point of view of the future, it is not wise for anybody in this House to deny that element of duress, because an opportunity might arise when it would be very much to our advantage to make the point that there was duress in connection with the settlement of 1921.  It is childish to say that there was the same kind of duress in the case of England, because in the case of England the influences bearing on her were essentially moral influences.  The English people were faced with world opinion against them, because they were opposing right with violence, they were using force of a very vile kind to put down the spirit of a small nation and the just claims of the Irish people.  That was the the biggest element, and armed action in this country was chiefly valid because of the sacrifices which it involved on the patriots of Ireland.  At any time the British, at the height of their military strength, could have destroyed this country only for the strong moral argument which paralysed their arm.  Therefore, the influence brought against them was not the same as the vile duress which was ultimately brought to bear against us and which prevented us from achieving all we wanted and were entitled to achieve.</P>
    <P>Again, there is a vital flaw in that test because it implies allegiance to a State which only represents twenty-six counties of Ireland.  That commits people to the principle of partition.  It is most odious, and, I submit, it is just as odious to those on the opposite benches as it is to us.  It is terrible to think that any citizen should be forced to make a confession of giving allegiance to a State which represents only twenty-six counties of Ireland.  I submit that we should try and get rid of <Col N="1960" /> that in the most united way possible in this House.  Those on the Government benches are divided in their opinion. You find that in all their speeches. Individuals are divided in their own minds.  At one time they want to do the best for the nation as a whole, and suddenly the old civil war mood seizes them and seems to paralyse their brains and hearts and prevent them getting on to the road by getting rid of all those tests and oaths, all those difficulties, all those binding influences, which prevent the spirit of Irish nationality from working freely in Ireland. I would go so far as to say this: If the President and his Government were to take up a courageous and generous attitude on the question of Irish nationality, they would not only bring greater peace and security to Ireland, but anybody who really serves the Irish nation, freely, generously and courageously, will become magnified by that and will gain glory by doing a thing which is really national and which will remove all bounds to the march of the nation.</P>

      <P>I understand that two Deputies in the Opposition Party in the course of this debate have stated that on a previous occasion I voted in favour of a similar motion to that embodied in the Bill, and for the removal of the oath of allegiance in regard to these particular officers.  I cannot remember the circumstances; but if it is true that on that occasion I voted in favour of such a proposal, I wish to apologise to the Dáil for doing so.  I have not had time to look up the Official Reports, but if it is true as the Deputies have stated that I voted for a similar proposal, I apologise, because it was a serious lapse on my part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion, I have nothing to apologise for as regards the attacks and criticisms I have made against members of the Executive Council during the last four years in any matter which would affect the relations of this country with England.  I have nothing to apologise for in any of the criticisms I made of the Executive Council for lack of activity in standing up for the rights of this country as against the Government of the United Kingdom. But I certainly realised all through <Col N="1961" /> that time that it was the duty of every member of the Dáil to stand by the Executive Council in the attempts they made and the measures they brought forward to secure the sovereignty of this State within its boundaries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is quite clear that this measure brought forward to-day is leaving open to question the loyalty of public servants to the State. For that reason it is a motion to weaken the authority of the State.  As I have always held, and I believe now, that the sovereignty of the State can never be recognised throughout the world if it is not recognised by its own people at home, I regret if I voted on previous occasions in favour of a motion embodying the principle of the Bill now before the House.  The last speaker referred to the oath as an oath of allegiance to the Twenty-Six Counties.  In that respect I think it is quite clear there are two policies before the House. There have been two policies before the country for the last five years.  There is the policy of the Government, which has been to establish the State and to make it a sovereign and model State which would attract towards it the other part of Ireland.  There is, on the other hand, the policy of the opposite Party, which is to degrade the State and to prove that it is not a sovereign State: to reduce it to the position of a county council or a non-sovereign body, without any prospect of improvement if that is done.  These two policies have been fairly clearly before the country for the past five years, and I do not think it is advisable to go into the whole question on this occasion.  I only rose because I have been told that two members of the opposite Party had accused me of voting for a motion similar to the proposal in the Bill.</P>

      <P>While listening to Deputy Tierney's speech it struck me there was very little dividing him from the men victimised under this formula which we are asking the Dáil to discard for ever as a piece of disciplinary legislation. He said that the nation was greater than any formula, greater than any constitution.  Certainly I should be surprised if the Irish nation were not greater than this particular formula, which only operates in respect of one particular portion of this nation.  The Deputy charged Deputy de Valera with being guilty of the crime of preventing the Irish people from using and working this State.  In that respect, what about the section of the Irish people who do not come within the ambit of this State?  What about the Nationalists of the Six Counties?  Who was it prevented them from using and working this State?  Who was it prevented those of them who were anxious to accept the Treaty and the Constitution of Ireland, <Col N="1963" /> which we were told was to be established under the Treaty?  Who was it but Professor Tierney's leader, the President, who scrapped Article 12 of the Constitution and prevented a section of the nation from using and working this State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nation is greater than any formula, greater than any Costitution. Certainly I suggest that the Irish nation is greater than this particular Constitution, which is an inconsistent and paradoxical document, a Constitution in which not only do certain Articles contradict each other, but even portions of the same Article contradict each other.  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture yesterday answered a taunt which Deputy Lemass had levelled at him concerning a declaration which he had made about the Oath, the King and the Constitution. He said that those things which he had said, those declarations which he had made, were mere words and meant nothing.  Practically every sentence in the Constitution stands forth as the achievement of men to whom declarations, are just mere words, meaning nothing.  But to our organisation, the great mass of the people whom we represent, and to the men who refused to sign the test which is embodied in the Local Government Act of 1925, the one vital, effective, binding portion of that Constitution is that part of Article 2, which declares that &ldquo;All powers of government and of authority, legislative, executive and judicial in Ireland&rdquo;&mdash;mark, Ireland, not the Twenty-Six Counties&mdash;&ldquo;are derived from the people of Ireland&rdquo;&mdash;from the whole people of Ireland, from the excluded cast-off Nationalists of the six counties, as well as the Nationalists of the twenty-six counties. That declaration expresses our fundamental conviction.  It expresses the principle for which this nation has struggled through centuries.  It expresses the deep and sincere belief of those who have not and will not subscribe to the test which the Local Government Act of 1925 imposes.  Only in so far as this assembly is the instrument which gives practical effect to that declartion under the Constitution do we recognise this assembly at all. That, I take it, is what Deputy de <Col N="1964" /> Valera meant when he said he came here and recognised the authority of the assembly and of the Deputies here as men who had mandates from the Irish people.  On that basis we are here, and on that basis, I am sure, within a short period we shall assume the Government of this country and of this State.  Yet we are told that, in the meantime, the people whom we represent, the people who will shortly be the dominating section in this nation, are to be penalised, are to suffer civic disabilities, and are to be, virtually, outlawed.  We are told that by a Government which has already been defeated in this House, and which only managed to hold one of its electoral strongholds by the few hundred votes of its mercenaries&mdash;for that is the real significant thing that emerges from the result of the Carlow-Kilkenny election.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Local Government said that the real reason why this clause had been inserted was to preserve complete confidence in Local Government throughout the country. If the last elections indicate anything they indicate this: That outside the counties which were the former Unionist strongholds in this country outside the counties which were the strongholds of the Imperialist garrison in this country, the native race in Ireland has repudiated and withdrawn any confidence or any majority it gave to Mr. Cosgrave's Executive or Government.

      <P>Into the path of unreason.  I remember when the Minister for Local Government was described as a cloudbank, and I am unable to walk through a cloudbank without seeming to lose my way.</P>
      <P>But what supreme impudence it is to say that the men who pay the local rates, who are taxpayers in this country, the men who, as I said before, really do speak and do voice the deepest and sincerest political convictions of this people, are to labour under these civic disabilities.  You do not exclude them from taxation.  You say to them, pay your rates and pay your taxes.  By what law of equity or justice do you debar them from civic emoluments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know nothing to equal the calculated impudence of the Government in this matter except, perhaps, the hypocrisy of the arguments which they have advanced to sustain it.  The Minister for Education told us that the one lesson this declaration was designed to enforce was that those who served the State, either in local bodies or in the central Government, should not use violence, intrigue, or illegal means to upset the State.  When the Minister for Education made that statement I looked to see if the Minister who led the opposition in this debate&mdash; the Minister for Local Government&mdash; were in his place.  He was not.  He was absent.  He must have had some premonition of what the Minister for Education was going to say, a premonition that must have made him, at least, feel uncomfortable, because only a little over three years ago the Minister for Local Government was engaged in just such an intrigue, an intrigue which <Col N="1966" /> almost upset the Government and nearly precipitated a war.</P>
    <P>We are told by the Minister for Local Government that the purpose of this declaration is to preserve complete confidence throughout the country.  How did he square his actions of that time with the declarations he had made, with his obligations even to his own colleagues in the Government at the time?  How did his actions in March, 1924, increase or diminish confidence throughout this country?  First, as to the declarations which he made and the obligations which, as Minister for Defence, he owed his colleagues&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Surely, I am entitled to prove that.  I am better entitled to prove it, if I can, by bringing in the personal element.  The Minister wishes to enforce this declaration for a certain public purpose, and I wish to show that he has made many declarations and that every one of them, in turn, has been valueless.  For <Col N="1967" /> instance, the declaration he made to his own colleague, the late Mr. Kevin O'Higgins, was valueless.  I submit to you, A Chinn Chomhairle, that in view of the arguments that have been advanced on the Government Benches, I am perfectly entitled to answer and to refer back to what took place, and to the declarations that were made three years ago in order to prove that case.</P>

I see the Deputy's point, that he wants to prove that declarations of a certain kind were valueless.  The trouble is that the case he proposes, unfortunately, will not be accepted.  It will be repudiated by the other side, and that will bring us to a discussion of a matter very different from this Bill, which aims at deleting Section, 71 of the Local Government Act of 1925.

      <P>I am quoting from a debate which took place in this House on the 26th June, 1924.  The quotation I have taken is from a speech of the Minister for Local Government.  Now consider the situation.  Here you had  Minister entrusted with one of the most <Col N="1969" /> important Departments in the State, a Minister well versed in declarations, oaths and tests, who had taken many and administered some, and who had associated with him officers with a like facile conscience.  For some purpose, which has never been disclosed, these officers, with the approval of the Minister, set themselves to organise a secret society within the Army.  As I have said, their purpose was never disclosed, but at any rate the then Minister for Justice thought that it was a purpose contrary to the public interest. He protested against it to the then Minister for Defence early in 1923, and, as he said himself, &ldquo;I charged to Deputy Mulcahy that officers were being summoned up from the country to sit in uniform in Portobello under the chairmanship of Lieutenant-General O Muirthuille for the purpose of reorganising the Irish Republican Brotherhood.  I charged that the staff of the Army were an inner circle or upper circle of that secret society, and these two allegations were blandly denied by the ex-Minister for Defence.&rdquo; These are not my words, but the words of the then Minister for Justice, who was Vice-President of the Executive Council of the Free State at that time.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;These two allegations were blandly denied by the ex-Minister for Defence.&rdquo; Here is a Government of which one of the Ministers has shown that his denials, his declarations and his commitments to his colleagues were worthless, and of which another member has declared that his declarations in regard to oaths in this House are mere words and mean nothing, asking this House, notwithstanding that, to enforce that test and that declaration, a test and a declaration which the actions and words of the Ministers themselves prove to be of a kind that is utterly worthless.  They ask you to enforce that upon what is now, I believe, more than one-third, and certainly within a short period will be a majority of this nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the use of it?  What value or what security will a declaration of that sort give to the members of this House?  How does it in any way help to foster or develop the economy of this State?  How does it make for a <Col N="1970" /> stable Government?  You have been told by one of the Deputies on these benches that instead of refusing, as he did, to take that declaration, had he done so and seen the day after that there was going to be a chance to win the freedom of this country by upsetting the Constitution of this State and of this House he would have disregarded his declaration and have held it to be null and void.  Is not that the position that was taken up by many British civil servants here in Ireland and by many members of the R.I.C. in Ireland, at the direct instigation of the Minister for Local Government?  Is it not because they disregarded such declarations that the Intelligence Service of the Republic was so efficient and so effective?</P>
    <P>What political value is there in such declarations that they should be imposed upon people?  That is the question that the Dáil has to ask itself. You know very well that when you do impose such declarations upon men, and when they are compelled by the force of starvation to take them unwillingly, you breed in their breasts resentment, you engender there feelings, not of loyalty, not of affection to this State, but feelings of distrust, of hate, and a desire for revenge.  If you want to make this State really representative of the aspirations of the Irish people, really deserving and worthy of their allegiance, really able to command this allegiance, then wipe out all tests, all oaths, all declarations.  Deal with all men evenly and alike.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands and Agricultude of the Minister to some of the that those who would not accept the majority rule in this country should not be permitted to live in this country.  I wonder what would have been the attitude of the Minister and some of the Deputies who sit upon the opposite benches and who follow him into the Division lobby, in the years 1912 and 1913.  What would have been his attitude to, say, the President of the Junior Branch of the Irish Unionist Alliance and those who were prepared to resist the majority will in this country?  Would he have allowed Deputy Cooper to live here?  Would he have allowed those who sit upon the same benches as Deputy Cooper, and <Col N="1971" /> who adopted the same attitude as Deputy Cooper in regard to this question, to live here?  Remember it is an old saw that what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  We want to wipe out these degrading, these unnecessary, these ineffective oaths, tests and declarations from the Constitution of the State and from the Statute Book of the State.  We want to let every man who lives in Ireland see that he has a right to enjoy any emoluments his talents fit him for in the public service.  Is not that the best way of securing stability?  Is not that the natural way of securing it&mdash;to give every Irishman an equal chance of entering into the service of the State without having to commit himself to repudiate or violate the principles he holds sacred and dear?</P>
    <P>Think of the reactions of this matter. There is a question of a coming loan. Here you have men who pay rates and taxes.  In a short time the Deputies on these benches, in common with the Deputies on other benches, will be asked to accept certain commitments in regard to the loan.  Suppose we were to take the same narrow attitude in that matter as the Government have taken; suppose we were to say, &ldquo;You are borrowing seventeen millions of money; some of that has been used to enforce the policy which is embodied in that test in the Local Government Act; some of that money is to be expended in enforcing the policy which is embodied in the Public Safety Act; some of that money, in short, is to be used to drive republicans by force of starvation either to submit or to emigrate.&rdquo; Suppose we were to say, &ldquo;Two can play your game.  Debar us from entering freely into the public service and we will not accept responsibility for this loan.  If we come into power, returned by the votes of the people who are being victimised by the legislation passed in this House, we will repudiate your loan and we will repudiate all your commitments.&rdquo; What effect would that have upon the public interest?  Would the ill-effect, would the additional burden imposed upon the ratepayers and taxpayers of Ireland, be worth the declaration which you have embodied in this Local <Col N="1972" /> Government Act?  Remove that declaration and there will be no question of such repudiation.</P>
    <P>At the present moment I, for one, may say that, and I have a perfectly open mind in the matter, that I do feel if our people are to be regarded as outlaws, then outlaws we will be.  We will not accept any responsibility for the commitments entered into by the majority in this House.  That is a plain, straightforward declaration, and, remember, though we are in the minority to-day we inevitably are going to be the majority to-morrow, because we speak the ancient voice of Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The principles for which we stand are the principles for which the Minister for Local Government stood in 1916, the principles for which the President of the Executive Council stood in 1916, and the principles which, if those people were only true to their innate instincts and traditions, they would espouse to-day.  We do not stand for a partitioned Ireland, for a Dáil which has under its control only the twenty-six counties.  We stand for a Government and an Assembly that will embrace the whole of the 32 counties.  As surely as grass grows and water runs, one day or another, and I believe very much sooner than the Government or the Ministers expect, there will be a majority in this House who will stand for those principles, who will wipe out those things. But take care whether that majority assumes responsibility for the commitments entered into by another majority which contemns the principles for which we stand, which victimises those who upheld them, which tries to deprive them of their right to live in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of common prudence and commonsense.  If it were only the mere bread and butter aspect of the question, and nothing more, would it not be far better to have the 477,000 electors whom we represent satisfied that themselves and their families would have a chance to earn their bread in this State; satisfied that if their talents fitted them to enter the public service they could enter it freely? Would it not be a prudent and a wise <Col N="1973" /> thing to make that a rule of the State, to wipe out all the things bred of the resentment and bitternesses of the Civil War period, to close that chapter, to fix our minds on the future and to enable us to say: &ldquo;We may differ as to the origin of this Assembly, but at least we will make the first part of Article 2 of the Constitution the determining factor in everything, and any Irishman who accepts that&mdash;that all the powers of government and all authority, legislative, executive and judicial in Ireland are derived from the people of Ireland&mdash;any man willing to accept that will be a fit candidate for the public service, and nothing more than his acceptance of that will be asked from him.</P>
    <P>It is accepting that, endeavouring to make that principle a reality, that we have come into this House.  In temporal affairs we acknowledge no power and no authority except the authority which Deputies derive from the votes of the people who sent them here.  We acknowledge no other power and no other authority, whether it be an Imperial throne or a Papal tiara.  We stand for the rights of the people, and we ask Deputies to stand for the rights of the people.  We ask them to wipe out that degrading declaration, and to say, as Deputy Tierney says, the nation is above any Party formula and above any Constitution, and any man who is willing to accept the Irish nation can freely enter into the services of the Irish nation.</P>

      <P>Someone asked during Question Time if I were moving over to the Farmers' benches now.  I want to assure whoever asked that, that the small farmers of Westmeath contributed in no small way to my election, and that I made this question, that I am now raising, a major issue in <Col N="1974" /> my election.  In answer to a question yesterday, the Minister for Justice informed me that there were 1,845 decrees in Westmeath in the period of 1924 to 1927, and that in these cases there were returns of nulla bona to the tune of 969.  In Longford there were 1,059 decrees.  I submit that this state of affairs is abnormal and requires the immediate attention of the Executive Council with a view to stopping this process of law until this House devises ways and means to meet a national emergency which I declare and know exists.  We will be told, probably, that the Agricultural Credits Act meets the case.  I deny that it does.  Assuming for a moment that it does, it is a case of live horse and you will get grass, if there is no assurance that it will operate in the spring, that it will be nothing but a piece-meal work, and that the constitution of its directorate will make it no more liberal or nationally sympathetic than the present credit institutions in the country. People who do not like to face certain facts and people who are timorous of their political future will adduce every reason under the sun for the present position of the farmer&mdash;from fluke to the wages of the agricultural labourers &mdash;as a reason for the plight in which that part of the community now finds itself.  When I say farmers I mean small farmers and not the respectable class of farmers who are known as graziers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNEDY</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I am not a respectable person, I assure the Minister. I use the word &ldquo;respectable&rdquo; in the sense that P.H. Pearse used it. The cause of the depression is the demand for the full repayment of advances made in the years when the gold standard was abandoned during the European War.  At that time sterling dropped to less than half its present value, and the repayment of those loans is now demanded in deflated money.  In other words, in the terms of real wealth, the farmer is expected to pay double what he was advanced, plus interest.  That, as we all know, is <Col N="1975" /> a thing that is impossible.  Whilst we have international debts amongst the nations funded and the cutting down of interest, and whilst credit institutions in England have come to the relief of such industries by composition and fresh financing, as the woollen industries in Yorkshire and the shipbuilding industries are being helped in this way, we have here in Ireland, unchecked, a system of Shylockism tolerated by an Executive which says it represents the will of the people.  There are, apparently, three parties in the case&mdash;the banker, the trader and the farmer&mdash;but in reality there are only two&mdash;the banker and the farmer.  It is the banker who urges on the shopkeeper, in order to pull down his overdraft, to proceed against the farmer, when he is not doing so himself.</P>
      <P>The peasantry in this portion of Ireland deserve better from the Ministers who in other days found shelter and succour in these homes which are now being sold very often to pensioners who chased the Executive up and down the country a few years ago.  These creations of credit are based on the power of the people to produce, and it should be a true reflection of the natural wealth of the country, not a portrayal of a state of things in which Nero fiddles while Rome burns.  We have been told that the cure for this is to produce more.  We have been told that from the Presidential bench.  But of what avail is it to produce more when the operation of one of these stone-age laws, adulated in the Dáil by Deputy J.J. Byrne and Deputy O'Hanlon, brings about a state of things whereby double production means halving the price.  Writing on this subject, Father Cahill, the distinguished Jesuit, in his notes on Caholic Sociology, says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A smiling countryside, with its waving crops and happy homesteads, may be converted in a few years into a tenantless ranch and the helpless people driven into exile or sent to swell the degraded slum population of the crowded cities.  The same anonymous influence controls the policies of state, makes and unmakes governments, sets up and pulls down dynasties, orders wars, and dictates the terms of peace.  It controls the <Col N="1976" /> press, international news agencies, the theatre, the cinema, and the book market.  It practically arranges what the public shall eat, wear, and read.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I put to the Executive Council, who profess such sympathy with the will of the people&mdash;are you going to let the majority perish so that a tiny minority in their midst may get their unjust claims?  Is the security of tenure, the principle of a contented peasantry rooted in the soil, going to perish in our time, so that we may be in the European stream?</P>

      <P>I would just like to add something or say something in the line of an appeal.  I will make that appeal directly to the Ministry of Lands and Agriculture, as I think it will be the only little consolation than can be expected for the next two or three months.  Now, if it be possible for them to do it&mdash;I do not ask them to do anything that is impossible&mdash;I ask them to be as lenient as possible for the next three months, until this Dáil meets again, in the line of issuing writs, and so forth, for land annuities that the people cannot possibly pay.  Now, there is not any use in mincing matters in this country.  Talk in the newspapers and from this Assembly that we are prosperous is false.  It is deception and it is morally wrong.  We are not a prosperous nation, and we cannot be. You have the industry that puts up 80 per cent. of the wealth of this nation &mdash;you have that industry to-day in misery.  It is completely dislocated. There are farms of land in the richest part of this island idle.  They are idle by reason of the seizures for rates, land annuities, and other things.  At present it is impossible to secure these.  Men are unemployed all over the country. We spent four whole days here talking of unemployment.  There was no remedy got, and you will not get any. There is only one remedy to be got, and that is the salvation of agriculture. But we cannot do that now.  That is impossible.  I only make one appeal, and that is an appeal to the men who control the department of the Land Commission to be a little easy and to extend as much leniency as is possible. I am not, I am sure, asking too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1977" /> The position of the farmer to-day is this&mdash;if he produces beef he may get sixpence a pound for that beef.  The butcher gets 1s. 3d., I suppose, and if the farmer after the market goes to have his dinner he pays 1s. 6d. for a little over a quarter pound of beef. That is just one little point that needs examination.  I will not delay the House going into all the question. When we meet again in three months' time we may have a few words to say on such things as the producer, the distributor, and the unfortunate consumer. I may be wrong, but I do not think I am.  I have a decided objection to the distributor.  That is the gentleman who does the harm; but, as I told you, it is not my intention to delay you any longer.  I will just conclude by making that appeal.  The agricultural population, including the small farmer, the big farmer, and the new farmer who was a labourer a few months ago, are in a very unfortunate position.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the appeal from the Fianna Fáil benches in regard to the position of small farmers.  In Tirconaill there are thousands of small farmers in a very bad way, many of them unable to provide their families with three meals per day, let alone pay land annuities.  I may point out to Deputies, who may not understand the situation as far as Tirconaill is concerned, that many of these small farmers are unable to provide for their children between the ages of 8 and 12 years, and have to send them into the market square to be herded like cattle and hired out to farmers to work from early morning until late at night.  I believe that a system of society that tolerates that sort of thing has something wrong with it.  As I said, many of these small farmers are unable to pay land annuities. Under the Court Orders Act, 1926, decrees have been given against many of them and stock has been <Col N="1978" /> seized on their farms.  Some of them who are unable to till their land let under what is known as the conacre system, but cannot do so now owing to the seizures which have taken place.  I make this charge against the Government that there have been far more seizures made in Tirconaill since the election than prior to the election.  We are adjourning for a period of almost three months, and I would appeal to the Government, as far as the putting into operation of these decrees is concerned, that they should hold their hand, exercise some pity, and take into consideration the plight of these small farmers. If they continue these evictions, I believe that it is going to counteract any good which is to be derived from the 1923 Land Act.  We hear a lot in the Dáil about the number of acres that are being divided between landless men, but while one Department is dividing lands amongst landless men, the Minister for Justice is executing decrees, evicting small farmers from their holdings, and driving them away from Tirconaill to America.</P>

      <P>I am asked to discuss the entire currency question and the question of a gold standard.  Is that a sensible suggestion to make at this hour of the night. That is a subject which might be debated at tremendous length.  It is one of the most difficult questions that financial experts could possibly have to solve&mdash;the adoption or rejection of a gold standard.  It is very easy for a Deputy flippantly to get up and say that it was a mistake to have returned to a gold standard, when it is a matter upon which banking opinion is tremendously divided, and when in a country which is supposed to know something about its own business it was decided to be the wise thing to do.  I am not going to debate, nor could I possibly debate the question of a gold standard. We wandered on then until we discovered ourselves in the field of Catholic theology&mdash;rather a big subject also to discuss at this late hour of the night.  The whole realms of Catholic theology might be discussed at very considerable length.  In fact, while the Deputy who introduced the matter was speaking, I really did not know what was his object, what he really wished to discuss, because I must frankly confess that to my mind he did not convey any meaning&mdash;that to me he did not make himself clear.  I really could not honestly discover what the Deputy wished to discuss, what views he wished to put forward, or on what particular items he was finding fault with the present administration.  I am sorry if I have failed to understand the Deputy&mdash;I am sorry if it is due to my stupidity, but I must leave it at that.

If a decree is got by any ordinary person and is put into the hands of the sheriff, the Department of Justice or any other Department has got no right to interfere with the carrying out of his statutory duties by the sheriff.  As to the question of land annuities, I am sure Deputies are aware that land annuities must be paid.  If they are not paid by the persons who occupy the land out of which they are payable, then those annuities fall upon the rates.  Are you helping a county, or the country, by allowing annuities to be paid out of the rates?  They must be paid from somewhere&mdash;the debt must be met.</P>

Is a man to say &ldquo;I am poor&rdquo; and, then, are the unfortunate ratepayers who have already paid their own annuities, and who have made ends meet by hard work, to be saddled with payment of their neighbours' annuities because the neighbour happens to say, &ldquo;I am apoor man and I cannot pay&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as this question of conacre is concerned, the Deputy says that it is impossible for these farmers now to get people to take their lands in conacre. I take it these are persons who set part of their lands in grazing and part in conacre.  I do not know at what rate ordinary conacre land lets in Donegal, but I suppose it would probably come to about £4 an Irish acre.  I know more about Mayo than I do about Donegal. Why do not these persons who take conacre see that the annuities are paid? The land annuity would be about 15s. <Col N="1982" /> to £1 the acre, whereas the rent for conacre would probably be about £4 an acre, depending, of course, upon the demand in the neighbourhood.  Why out of that conacre rent is not the annuity paid, and also poor rate?  These are the first charges upon the land, and why do not these conacre people, or people who put in grazing cattle, and have their cattle seized, see for their own self-protection, first of all, that the annuity has been paid?  A man living on land, not farming it himself but letting out part in grazing and part in conacre, is really a species of middleman, and yet we are told it is unjust, though he collects his conacre rent and grazing rent, that he should be compelled to pay his overhead charges, land annuities or rates.  I confess that is an argument I cannot follow.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which allusion is made.  That is the profit which the middleman makes.  We are told that beef sold at 6d. per lb. retails at 1/3, and that the farmer who had sold his beast in the morning would have to pay 1/6 for a quarter of a lb. of beef for a meal for himself.  I must frankly confess that when you talk of beef by the lb. I am not able to meet you because in order to enable one to argue one must be able to speak in terms of some common denominator.  When I think of cattle I think only of live animals and judge them simply by so much per cwt.  I know how much they could fetch per cwt.</P>

      <P>No, I sell them by the cwt., and I eat them at 1/6 per quarter lb. rate provided the Deputy is correct in his figures, but I must again admit that I have never yet gone into a restaurant with a scale and weighed the amount of beef I got on my plate.  I would not like to do that even in the restaurant here. I have no doubt the Deputy knows that a Food Tribunal sat and has, I think, completed its report as to middlemen's profits, so that in future if he is overcharged by his butcher or by his restaurant keeper he will be able to put in force such provisions as that report recommends.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have, however, received a petition under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, in respect of the drainage of this river, consideration of which was postponed for a time pending developments in connection with the Barrow Scheme. As it has now been decided not to include the Griese River in the Barrow Scheme the investigation of the proposal as an independent scheme under the Act of 1925 is proceeding.  Reports on it have been made by an engineer and a valuer and are under consideration, but it is not yet possible to say whether, or when, the proposed scheme of drainage work can be carried out.</P>
