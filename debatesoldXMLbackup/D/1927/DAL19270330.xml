      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether the standards which are being erected in the County Dublin and elsewhere for the purposes of carrying the electric cables will be moved free of any expense in the event of the land being required for building or purposes other than agriculture, and if he will state (a) whether any compensation or rent will be payable for the land occupied by these standards, and (b) in the event of crops being injured through access of these standards, who will bear the loss.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative.  Deviations in the line of the cables as finally laid out are not desirable, and would not in any case be practicable except within very narrow limits.  Compensation is payable for the acquisition of the right to erect and maintain poles, but as I stated in answer to a question on the 11th instant, the compensation will, following the practice in all countries, be merely nominal.  Compensation for avoidable damage to crops occasioned in the erection of the poles will be borne by the contractors; for unavoidable damage, by my Department.</P>

      <P>No.  Compensation will be awarded, in the first instance, on the basis of the land being acquired for the purpose of the poles, and I have stated that that compensation will be merely nominal.  We have tried to avoid going on land that is definitely and clearly to be used for building purposes, but we cannot have claims made afterwards that land would have been used for building purposes if the poles had not been there.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer that question until I see how far the public business will be disposed of. The motion in the Deputy's name is a motion dealing with a particular county.  Therefore it is somewhat distinct from the ordinary business of private members, because every private Deputy might ask for time for discussion of a motion dealing with his constituency and that would take up a very considerable time.

      <P>I have been asked to move the Second Reading of this Bill and I am glad to do so.  It is a very simple Bill and I do not think it is likely to meet with opposition.  It is not necessary to say much in explanation of it.  Its purpose is mainly to prevent unnecessary cruelty to birds. If wild birds have to be caught, the aim of the Bill is to see that they are caught without unnecessary cruelty. In the first two clauses, nothing more than that is aimed at.  In the third section, protection is afforded, during a certain period of the year, to the eggs of certain special birds.  I do not <Col N="502" /> think there is likely to be any opposition raised to the affording of protection to the eggs of these birds in the nesting season.  I move the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill. This Bill is a very small and unpretentious looking measure of five clauses. But it is really more important to the farmers and to the community in general than one would suppose.  Certain sections of the Bill deal with the prevention of cruelty to wild birds confined in cages.  That needs no commendation. It is not necessary to say that a bird should not be kept in a cage in which it cannot spread its wings.  I never see a wild bird in a cage without longing to set it free.  I think that feeling is general.  It is pitiable to see larks that should be soaring high in the sky confined in miserable little cages.  It goes without saying that that is cruelty.  Birds generally are supposed to have a most detrimental effect on the work of farmers.  As a matter-of fact, the good that birds do the farmer is far and away greater&mdash;I speak as a practical farmer&mdash;than the damage they do.  That is my experience over a great many years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for being out of order.  Speaking about birds generally, I only wish to point out that they do not do the damage they are supposed to do.  The most important part of this Bill is clause 3, which deals <Col N="503" /> with the eggs of the plover.  Everybody knows the two classes of plover&mdash; golden and green.  The golden are migratory.  The green may be migratory or they may not.  To use the words of Deputy Lyons, in his speech on the Railways Bill, &ldquo;they are birds of passage that are always with us.&rdquo;  I do not know whether Deputies are aware that the plover is one of the most useful birds we could possibly have, because he is specially keen on eating up the germs of fluke which are supposed to be found on snails and insects of that kind.  They are the greatest friends the farmers can possibly have, and they ought to be preserved by every means in our power.</P>
      <P>I am sorry to say that in a great many districts plovers are netted wholesale.  There is nothing to prevent that in this Bill.  I think that for our own sakes, and because of the good they do, the netting of plovers ought to be prevented.  Shooting is quite another thing.  The taking of the eggs is nothing in comparison to the wholesale netting of these birds.  I see Deputies smiling, but what I am now stating is a fact, and if Deputies choose to look up books on the subject they will see I am right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another class of bird which should be entered here.  I allude to bullfinches, also the farmers' friends. They are delightful birds, and they are an ornament to any country.  They are becoming extremely rare here.  They eat the seeds of plants that are very detrimental to the land.  For this reason they ought to get preservation just as much as plovers.  No doubt they do a certain amount of damage, and I know that successive gardeners I have had have urged me to kill bullfinches, but knowing their value I always stood out against that.  I wish very much that birds of that type would be added specially to this Bill, because these birds are undoubtedly the farmers' friends.  As a whole they may do some damage, but I believe they can be kept away by a shot being fired in the morning and also in the evening at the proper time.  They are about the best friends the farmers have because, <Col N="504" /> amongst other things, they eat the wireworm.</P>
    <P>This Bill ought to be passed.  I should like to have additions made to it in regard to these other birds which are undoubtedly of great benefit to farmers. The measure gets my wholehearted approbation, and I hope it will also receive the approbation of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure how far Deputy Wolfe was in order in introducing a bull into a discussion on a Bill concerning wild birds.  His case is made worse by the fact that the particular bull he introduced was, by some zoological freak, the off-spring of a &ldquo;lion.&rdquo;  I am sure every Deputy must have listened with great sympathy to Deputy Wolfe's plea for the caged bird, and must have appreciated his passionate feeling, whenever he saw a bird in a small cage, to liberate it.  I only hope the birds will reciprocate that feeling and, if the time ever comes when they will see Deputy Wolfe in a small cage, they will do their best to liberate Deputy Wolfe.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wolfe said the most important section in the Bill is the third one which deals with the taking of the eggs of plovers or lapwings.  As one who has a certain affection for the delicacies of the table, in my personal capacity I regret that, but my sense of public spirit overbears my sense of private grief and compels me to admit that the section is necessary.  I know that many of the eggs that have been sold in the Saorstát and elsewhere as the eggs of plovers and lapwings were nothing of the sort; they were the eggs of gulls.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, produced by gulls and consumed by gulls, as Deputy Gorey has said.  I do not know what Minister is dealing with this Bill. I am afraid it is not any of the Ministers now sitting on the Government Benches.  Possibly it is a measure for the Minister for Lands and Agriculture or the Minister for Justice.  On whoever may be in charge, however, is the onus probandi that the eggs <Col N="505" /> offered for sale as plovers' eggs were produced by plovers.  What witnesses will be necessary?  How will the fact be established?  If the dealer comes into court and says, &ldquo;This is a gull's egg and not a plover's egg,&rdquo; how does Deputy Thrift propose to convince him he is wrong?  I am afraid the only manner in which you can meet it is by adding gulls' eggs to the eggs of plovers and lapwings.  The eggs resemble one another so closely that it will be almost impossible for a member of the Gárda Síochána to distinguish between them.  The only solution I can suggest is that as we have a Criminal Investigation Department attached to the Gárdaí so also should we have a Zoological Investigation Department of the Gárdaí.  In those cities where the eggs are sold a trained zoologist. who I presume would carry the rank of sergeant, could investigate the matter. I suggest to Deputy Thrift that he might strengthen this section and make it easier of administration by adding the words &ldquo;gulls' eggs.&rdquo;  The Bill on the whole is a good Bill and I support it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephMacBride" hpid="Mr. McBRIDE Mr. McBRIDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McBRIDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this Bill is a little bit ridiculous, with the exception of the section dealing with the lapwing. What astonishes me is that the authors of the Bill did not bring in a clause prohibiting shooting.  It is in no way different.  In nine cases out of ten you maim a bird instead of shooting it. This maimed bird goes about with, perhaps, a broken wing until it dies of starvation.  Why not prohibit shooting straight away?  I object to the prohibition of what we familiarly term twigging. We all went twigging at one time or another, and where the cruelty comes in there I do not know.  The bird may be prevented from flying for about fifteen or twenty minutes, but outside of that it is not injured in any way.  I hope the Dáil will not accept this Bill unless a clause prohibiting the shooting of birds is introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Reading this little Bill one is struck by its insufficiency.  In any well-regulated agricultural country they have a very definite policy with regard to wild birds.  If you travel <Col N="506" /> England or the Continent you will not see as many rooks in a month as you will see in Ireland in an hour.  The same thing applies to wood pigeons, magpies, hawks and sparrows.  We are raising here hosts of vermin of different breeds, and we have made very little effort to breed useful and paying birds in the country.  Game has, practically speaking, got no attention whatsoever. A well-developed and intelligent Board of Agriculture would have no hesitation in eliminating as far as-possible the objectionable species I have mentioned, and they would replace them with birds of utility that would bring in a big annual income.  Since the trouble in 1919-20 rooks have become a plague in the country.  The same thing applies to wood pigeons, magpies, hawks, and even rabbits.</P>

      <P>Of course, rabbits are not birds, but they are one of the plagues that the Department of Agriculture could deal with.  The same applies to sparrows.  This Bill is of very little use.  I object to the first section. With Deputy McBride, I fail to see where the cruelty comes in in using bird lime.  Immediately the birds land on the lime they are removed and put into a cage.  Whether the traffic in goldfinches and bullfinches is right is another question, but there is no cruelty in the performance of securing them.  If you want to approach the matter, approach it from a different angle; say, for instance, you are lessening the supply of goldfinches.  But if you claim that there is cruelty in the manner in which they are caught, that is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this question of birds it would be a good thing if the whole matter were adjourned, and then the Minister for Lands and Agriculture could consider it with the assistance of a Committee. This is a big matter, and we ought to have a national campaign for the destruction of the vermin we have got. We have three, four or five bad breeds, and it would be advisable to start a campaign to replace them with birds that will bring in a national income both from the point of view of shooting <Col N="507" /> parties and the prices the birds will fetch.  Let us imitate the example of the best countries in Europe; let us imitate the example of England and the Continent.  There is a lot of mock sympathy about the poor birds.  The sooner we become men and not old maids the better; some of us are tending in the latter direction.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate until I heard the gull mentioned.  So far as gulls are concerned they are the worst enemy with regard to fishing throughout the entire country.  They have devoured the green drakes on the Westmeath lakes until they have made them almost extinct.  There are tens of thousands of them for four months of the year feeding on the natural flies that rise and they are accountable for the fact that you find it very difficult to get even two dozen flies with which to fish.  I am in agreement with Deputy Gorey when he suggests that this Bill should be deferred on the grounds that it does not deal with the really big matter at all.  There are large numbers of gulls devouring young pheasants, partridges, etc.  We have a game protection association in County Westmeath and we give sixpence per head to anyone who brings in their heads.</P>

      <P>I think the Dáil should find some better use for its time than in discussing a Bill of this type.  There are other classes of legislation that could be discussed before the General Election that would be more use to the people.  I do not see why the Dáil should waste its valuable time in discussing a measure of this kind.  A few weeks ago we had a resolution from the Seanad, where this Bill came from, asking to have representation on the Executive Council.  One realises now the object of that resolution.  It appears that the object of the promoters of this Bill was to appoint a <Col N="508" /> Minister for Game on the Executive Council and this is the first step in that direction.  I know large numbers of men who cannot get employment, but who make a little money by catching goldfinches in a manner which is prohibited by this Bill, namely, by means of a decoy.  They send a number of these birds away and get a little money for them, and by that means they get something to eat.  If this Bill is passed, these men will be prevented from catching those birds.  Deputy Gorey and Deputy Shaw explained the amount of harm that a lot of birds do. Crows, jackdaws and magpies destroy a large amount of agricultural produce. If it is a crime to catch birds and place them in cages, surely it must be a crime to shoot them in trees.  The latter is supposed to be a sport but it is not the sport of the poor man.</P>

      <P>If I catch a plover or rob its nest I am liable to a penalty, according to this Bill.  That penalty is either a fine of £25 or three months' imprisonment, but there is no penalty for shooting such birds.  This Bill was apparently introduced to destroy any bit of sport which a working man may have.  I presume that if the cage is not made as large as a piggery, the Senator who introduced the Bill would regard that as a crime.  The size of the cage is not specified.  I wonder is it to be nine by eighteen inches, or twelve by eight inches.  I hope the Dáil will reject the Bill.  It is unnecessary, and the Dáil could well spend its time in doing something more beneficial to the State than considering this Bill.</P>

      <P>I oppose the Bill. There are numbers of people in the Saorstát at present earning a part-time livelihood in catching wild birds. If the supposed humanitarians who have promoted this Bill would go to the back streets in our cities and towns they would find plenty of scope to utilise their efforts in connection with the prevention of cruelty, not alone to animals, which were made for man's use and benefit, but also to <Col N="509" /> human beings.  People talk about cruelty to birds.  There is much cruelty to game, such as partridge, that have been partly wounded and which, after suffering for two or three weeks, die as a consequence.  It is said that we have not a sufficient number of small birds in the country, but, in my opinion, there are more birds in Ireland than in any other country. Thousand of them die in April and May because there is no food for them. Anyone who knows the rural parts of Ireland will find plenty of birds dead during these months.  Humanitarians do not protect them.  This country is not able to feed the amount of vermin in it.  It is typical of the Seanad to come along now with a Bill of this kind when we know what has been the cost to the country for the last four years.</P>

      <P>I think that the Bill is altogether insufficient to meet the problem which we have to face in regard to the protection of wild birds. I approve of the Bill to some extent. I do not approve wholeheartedly of Section 1, which, in my opinion, is not very reasonable.  We all approve of the idea of preserving birds like the plover.  I support the suggestion made by Deputy Gorey to the effect that the whole question of bird and animal life in this country ought to be dealt with in a more comprehensive way. Opinions will differ as to the usefulness of birds and vermin.  Some Deputies seem to have the idea that the rook or crow is purely vermin and harmful. It becomes harmful when its numbers become disproportionate.  It performs many useful services in the way of destroying the wireworm.  When a rook or crow is supposed to be doing harm by picking at grain and young, potatoes it is really fishing for the larvae of the wireworm.  What we have to try and guard against is anything in the nature of undue disproportion of certain birds.  There seems to be an upsetting of the balance of nature occasionally, whereby one class of animal, or bird, will keep down other classes.  Sometimes the balance gets upset with the result that we have <Col N="510" /> something like a plague of rabbits which they often experience in Australia. In New Zealand there is a bird which usually eats berries but then it changes, becomes a meat eater, and attacks sheep very persistently.  The sparrow, for instance, is in some ways a useful bird, but when its numbers get disproportionate it becomes dangerous. The same remark applies to the crow.  As I have said, this problem cannot adequately be dealt with by means of a Bill of this kind.  It should be dealt with by some Department, by legislation or otherwise.  The few sections in this Bill barely touch on the whole problem of the destruction or preservation of wild birds, and I doubt whether I ought to give the Bill my support.</P>

      <P>I think the promoters of the Bill ought to consider seriously Deputy Gorey's suggestion to have it referred to a committee for investigation. What is needed is not so much an Act for the protection of birds as an Act to protect farmers against birds.  Rooks and crows have become so much of a plague they have the effect of deterring people from sowing tillage crops.  Another extremely voracious bird is the woodquest.  I ask Deputy Wolfe's opinion about these birds.</P>

      <P>The promoters of this Bill apparently know very little about the cruelty enacted in the catching of birds either by net or lime.  A bird caught by birdlime is no more than thirty seconds on the twig when it is taken, and it suffers no injury.  Whatever prompted the promoters of the Bill to prohibit the use of lime I do not know.  If a bird is caught by a properly made brace it suffers no pain. There are other ways of catching birds, such as stringing them up by thread, but if they are caught by a properly <Col N="511" /> manufactured brace they do not suffer. It is just like sitting a bird in a chair and simply lifting it up.  Its limbs are not injured.  I ask the Dáil to reject this Bill which, in my opinion, is nonsensical.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. EVERETT Mr. EVERETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. EVERETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to Section 1, which prohibits the use of birdlime. In my constituency a number of working men come from Dublin on Sundays to have a day's sport by catching such birds as goldfinches and linnets.  According to Deputy Wolfe these do not come under the Bill, but, in my opinion, they do.  If the promoters of the Bill were really interested in the protection of game and opposed to cruelty to animals, I wonder they did not bring in a Bill to prohibit cruelty to foxes. We often see twenty or thirty dogs after one fox.  Why did they not bring in a Bill&mdash;I think it would meet with objection on all sides&mdash;to prohibit coursing matches in which you generally have two dogs after one hare? This Bill, as Deputy Gorey said, was apparently brought in by people who have an idea that goldfinches and linnets should not be confined in cages. They object, apparently, to working men going out on Sundays for a day's sport by catching birds.</P>
      <P>As I believe it is an interference with the liberty of these men and that it would prevent them going out on a Sunday to enjoy the only sport available for working men, I ask the House to reject this Bill.  I am sure everyone approves of Section 3 in the Bill which deals with the preservation of the eggs of lapwing or plover, but as regards Sections 1 and 2 the people in my constituency are opposed to them, and therefore I ask the Dáil to reject this Bill.</P>

      <P>I ask Deputies who have spoken against the Bill to consider the principle that underlies it. Its intention is to prevent a certain form of cruelty.  We are not a cruel nation&mdash;certainly not to animals.  It occurs to me that in the catching of birds there is sometimes cruelty committed. I admit that when you take a bird with birdlime the bird does not <Col N="512" /> suffer very much if you get it, but what about the birds that you do not get?  I have information to the effect that birds have been limed and have been left there to die.  It is the principle that underlies the Bill that appeals to me, and I suggest that we should do something to prevent this cruelty.  We do very little in that respect at the present time.  There are certain birds that have quite disappeared from our country.  I know at least two countries&mdash;I am speaking now from personal experience&mdash;where bird life has been destroyed.  Both countries are now infested with insect vermin of all sorts, and certainly agriculture in the two countries has not been benefited by the disappearance of the birds.  I do think that we ought to do something to preserve the birds, particularly the songsters, of our country, and not leave this country a silent country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any danger of the country becoming a silent country.  The principal criticisms that we have to meet against this Bill arise from the fact that many Deputies who have spoken against it really want something better than the Bill proposes to secure.  This is a very simple Bill and only proposes to go a very small way.  I quite agree with Deputy Gorey that there are big questions involved; that it would require inquiry and a comprehensive scheme to deal with the problem, but any such inquiry, or the taking up of the matter on a large scale would involve a very considerable amount of time.  Even supposing that we were to take the matter up now there would be no hope of getting legislation through on such grounds inside of two or three years. All the Deputies who have spoken against the Bill said it contained at least one good thing, namely Section 3, which deals with the preservation of the eggs of lapwing or plover.  I want to suggest to these Deputies that, if they differ from the promoters of the <Col N="513" /> Bill on the other sections their course is quite clear.  They ought to vote for the Second Reading of this Bill in order to secure Section 3, and then if there is a substantial feeling in the House against Section 1 it would be perfectly easy to delete it on the Committee Stage and to leave Section 3 as the only valid section.  If they agree to do that, then at least they will be securing one good thing even though they aim at a better thing.  I desire to say, however, that I do not agree with the arguments of Deputies who have spoken against Section 1.  As Deputy Alton has pointed out cruelty does not arise so much in the catching of the birds as in the failure to catch them. I want to draw the attention of Deputies to another part of that section.  It proposes to deal with a matter in which, I think it will be admitted, definite and distinct cruelty is practised.  Sub-section (1) of Section 1 prohibits the use as a decoy of any live bird which is tethered or which is blind, maimed or injured.  I do not think there is a single Deputy in the House who could get up and say that the use of a decoy in that manner is not a cruel thing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. SHAW Mr. SHAW">

      <P>The Bill proposes to prohibit the use as a decoy of any bird which is blind, maimed or injured, and it is therefore only doing a thing which I am sure all Deputies approve of.  I do not believe that a single Deputy would approve of the use of such a bird as a decoy. There are some other things in the Bill which Deputies object to.  If they agree to give the Bill a Second Reading, then on the Committee Stage they will have the opportunity of moving to delete the things that they object to.  If the majority of the House is in favour of the things that they object to, then of course they will be deleted.  The principle of the Bill is against cruelty to birds, and I think that is a matter on which the House ought to agree.  I do not want to spend too much time speaking on the Bill, but I ask Deputies to give it a Second Reading, and afterwards to secure what they want on the Committee Stage: to take out such things as they object to, and leave in what we have all expressed our approval of.  Every Deputy who has spoken has expressed approval of Section 3.  I ask Deputies to give the Bill a Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>One would have imagined that at this stage in the development of road transport we would have had from the Minister for Industry and Commerce a comprehensive Bill to regulate the development of that business.  But notwithstanding the fact that it is quite evident on all sides that road motor services are in need of careful regulation, the Minister brings in a new Bill which will have no other effect than to put on the roads an additional number of motor buses for the purpose of taking part in that unregulated competition.  I should have thought that the Minister, in the interests of the public generally, would have found time to draft and introduce a Bill providing for the regulation of motor services.  But the Minister thinks that the public interest is best served by bringing in a Bill to add considerably to the bus services without even indicating that his Department proposes to do anything to regulate the existing bus services.  The Minister's whole attitude towards road motor services was rather extraordinary. He made the case that there are no restrictions whatever at present on private bus companies.</P>

      <P>And very limited, the Minister might have added.  He makes the case for the Bill that in the case of railway buses there will be a certain amount of restriction.  He takes the standpoint&mdash;as if no intervention was necessary in connection with motor buses&mdash;that the present motor transport problem, as we know it, is going along all right, regulating itself satisfactorily, and that no intervention or control by his Department is necessary. That is a rather extraordinary attitude for the Minister to take up at this stage of transport development.  I feel sure that public opinion would welcome a Bill designed to regulate motor transport more than it would welcome a Bill to put more buses on the roads to enter into this unregulated competition. Under the Bill as drafted local authorities will apparently get just as scant consideration as they get at present in connection with private buses.  At present any private bus can go just where it likes and do what damage it likes to the roads, and the local authorities are absolutely powerless to do anything in the matter.</P>

      <P>The Minister said he knew nothing about road transport, yet he introduces a transport Bill.  The point I want to make is that local authorities are absolutely powerless to prevent motor buses running on the roads in their own areas.  A bus can run where it likes, when it likes, as often as it likes, and do any damage it likes to the roads, and the local authorities are powerless in the matter. Now the Minister introduces a new Bill keeping local authorities in the position that they will apparently have no say as to what routes the buses ought to go. The section says that the Minister may do certain things after consultation with the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, and, as Deputy Davin pointed out, he need not necessarily agree with the Minister for <Col N="518" /> Local Government and Public Health. The Minister for Local Government and Public Health is not the local authority, and there is nothing in the Bill compelling him to consult with the local authorities.  I think the Bill is very loosely and unsatisfactorily drafted in that respect.  Local authorities are responsible for the maintenance of roads for which the ratepayers have to pay, and I think the ratepayers should be consulted before buses are allowed to run on the roads which they are responsible for maintaining. The public generally will take the view, and there has been a good deal of comment on it already, that nothing is being done to regulate the increase in motor transport.  One has heard from time to time statements from police authorities that there is a considerable increase in motor transport, and that is fairly obvious in a city such as this.  Notwithstanding that motor transport is growing considerably and that the need for regulating it is obvious, the Minister proposes apparently to do nothing which will serve a necessary public purpose in that connection. The real need at the moment is to have some co-ordinating authority for road transport.  This Bill does nothing to provide that.</P>

      <P>It is very much more necessary than this Bill.  At all events, a co-ordinating authority should be appointed.  Under this Bill the Minister can be absolutely autocratic. He can consult the Rates Advisory Committee, he can modify their regulations or refuse to accept them, and generally can do what he likes.  That is a very unsatisfactory condition of affairs.  It indicates that the transport problem is being dealt with in piecemeal fashion.  The Minister would have been well advised to have introduced before now a Bill to regulate motor transport, and I think that our time would have been much better <Col N="519" /> spent on such a Bill, from the public point of view, than on this Bill.  As this Bill has been introduced, the Minister should at the earliest possible date bring in a Bill to provide for the regulation of motor transport, to eliminate all unnecessary, undesirable and dangerous competition, and to make bus services in this country not rivals of each other, but supplementary to each other.  If that was done it would serve a useful public purpose and in my opinion such a Bill is as urgent as this one is.</P>

      <P>The Minister, when he said in an interjection that he had nothing to do with road transport, confirmed the idea which I had formed that this Bill should not have been introduced until we had first a Bill not alone for co-ordinating road transport, but for co-ordinating all forms of transport.  I attended a conference called by the Irish Motorists Union in 1925, when this whole question of road transport was discussed by representatives of all interests who had a thorough knowledge of the details of the subject.  A recommendation went from that conference to the President, I think, that a commission should be appointed to examine into and make recommendations on the whole question of transport services in this country. We have had a Railway Commission, a Ports and Harbours Commission and a Canal Commission.  Now we will have some kind of a tribunal to deal with this particular form of road transport.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a tribunal under this Bill to deal with rates &mdash;not a controlling tribunal.  We have four authorities dealing with four different forms of transport, whereas there ought to be one to deal with the whole matter.  To the people whom I represent this is a vital question.  We are told that work simply means the conveying of matter from one place to another.  For the agricultural community transport is life, and it is of the utmost importance that the whole question should be dealt with in a comprehensive fashion.  Instead of that, it <Col N="520" /> is being dealt with in a piecemeal manner.  The details are being dealt with rather than the general principle of transport.  It is hardly necessary to repeat statements which have been made over and over again in this Dáil and outside, that the agricultural industry has been, and is being greatly hampered by excessive freight charges.  What the high freights are due to is rather difficult, if not impossible to say.  Doubtless, they are due to a number of things.  Undoubtedly one of the things is the unrelated form of transport which exists at present and the redundant, unnecessary and useless competition.</P>
      <P>With regard to the principle of this Bill, it is one which ought to receive very deep thought from the Dáil before they sanction it.  As far as I am concerned, I am waiting to hear a definite statement from the Minister as to whether he stands on the principle that railway companies will be allowed to put transport on roads, apart from the question of feeding the railways&mdash;whether they are to be allowed to enter into direct competition with all other forms of motor transport.  Personally, I am inclined to think that that is not sound.  I am rather of the opinion that railway companies have enough to do to attend to the business of running the railways, and that the most we should do is to give them power to use road transport as feeders to their lines.  I took the line formerly in regard to this matter that there was redundancy and unnecessary competition; that we had road motor transport running side by side with railway transport; and that that was due to the fact that road transport was being provided with a permanent way almost free of charge. That point has been washed out, so to speak, since I made that statement by the increase in the motor tax.  If that increase has been sufficient to make the owners of motor transport pay their full proportion of the cost of the maintenance of the roads&mdash;and I cannot say at the moment if it has been&mdash;we may take it that the competition is free and open, that one class of transport has no advantage over the other, and that the competition is a healthy competition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the danger of a monopoly, and a monopoly by a private company in regard to transport is a very dangerous thing. I know that the Bill contains provisions to restrict and restrain the possibilities of a monopoly, but the question is whether these provisions will or will not be effective.  The Minister can forbid them to make use of a route; he can also prevent them from discontinuing the use of a particular route, but I am not sure, and I hardly believe that even the Minister's powers in that regard will have the effect of providing against a monopoly and that the railways will not, by other means, be able to use the powers they are getting to wipe out the other companies, and although they may be forced to continue a service which they have established, they might make that service so unsatisfactory in many ways that it would be unsuitable for public use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I repeat that I consider this Bill has been prematurely introduced, that we ought to face this problem in a different manner, that we ought to <Col N="522" /> face up to the whole question of the co-ordination of all transport services in the State, that that can only be done by a close examination into the whole question of transport, preferably by means of a commission of experts, and that we should not attempt to deal in detail or piecemeal with the present form of road transport.  I suggest that it would be much better that this Bill should be withdrawn for further consideration.  I do not believe it is possible for any Deputy to foresee the possibilities if this Bill is passed, but my impression is that, even with the very autocratic powers which the Minister is giving himself in it, there is a possibility that the effect of its passing will be, in the course of time, to give the railway companies a monopoly of both rail and road transport, whereas, I believe that the railways have quite enough to do to run their own services as they ought to run them, and that a certain amount of competition from independent companies would be useful rather than disadvantageous.  I realise that there is competition, but I still think that the companies, which are extremely strong financially, would, in the course of time, be able to wipe out a great many of the existing private companies.</P>
    <P>I think that the natural growth of road transport should be by means of independent companies, and that many of the companies which are now redundant will, in the natural course of events, amalgamate with larger, stronger and better financed companies. We would then have road transport controlled by companies much stronger financially, and if they were co-related with the other forms of transport, as a result of the recommendations of a commission, I think we might develop a form of transport which would be of advantage to the State.  But I think that a Bill of this kind is a dangerous experiment, and the Dáil should be very slow to give it support.  I am awaiting the Minister's statement as to where he stands on the section which allows the railway companies to enter into competition with other means of transport, apart from <Col N="523" /> acting as feeders, which they might find necessary to bring merchandise and passengers directly to their line.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as this Bill affords an opportunity for the contributions to be made that we have had on the transport problem, I think it is valuable.  Deputy Norton stressed the point that a much larger measure of general control of traffic was due, and said that this was piecemeal legislation. I am inclined to agree.  As far as the roads are concerned, the traffic problem is undoubtedly arriving at a point when a form of co-ordination by means of a board, or some other body&mdash;I see that boards are now in fashion, in connection with electricity&mdash;should be arranged. Coming to criticism of the Bill, it seems to me that its provisions are harsh, so far as the railway companies are concerned.  If they are carried out as laid down they will be not only harsh but unworkable.  The Bill seeks to lay a preventing hand on the railway companies as regards the development of road traffic by what are, in my opinion, impossible conditions. For instance, the companies can only start a service with the permission of the Minister, which is quite all right, but the Minister concerned has not himself got the control of the roads.  Therefore, you will have two Departments acting in connection with the one matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>But obviously as a permanent measure the Bill is not very workable.  Deputy Heffernan has mentioned the possibility of the railway companies starting out on a monopolistic campaign to control all the road <Col N="524" /> services.  If that were possible, I think it would be very undesirable, and as far as the Bill gives powers to the railway companies for bus traffic, I think a simple interpretation of the measure of authority that might be given would be to say that they should be able to carry on traffic in passengers or goods that originates from or is destined for carriage on the railways.  In that connection the railway companies could perform valuable services by opening up many parts of the country for tourists and for other purposes.  If the railway companies are likely to do what Deputy Heffernan visualises, then of course a very dangerous situation would be created.  When the amalgamation of the railways Bill was before the House I opposed it, and I have not changed my views on the subject very much since.  The reason I opposed it was because I considered it would mean what is developing in other directions, a nationalising tendency and the elimination of competition amongst the railways themselves.  In the course of time I think that this House has been marching in various directions rather different from those on which they started. One must follow the trend of the House, and I think that that trend is in the direction of a more sane view of the road problem than that held not so very long ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made the point that the railways complained of having to pay rates, which were used for the upkeep of the roads, while the roads were used in competition with the railways.  I do not think that is quite right, because the railways might shut down immediately if it were not for the services of the roads.  Therefore, the roads and the railways ought to be co-ordinated as far as possible, and I think it would be quite unreasonable to say that because a railway is a railway it should have no power to use the roads in connection with the railway.  In so far as this Bill proposes to give them power and authority to use the roads in developing the railways, I think it is perfectly sound, but I would hesitate to give any powers of a destructive and competitive character to bodies as strong as the railway companies.  We must, of course, recognise that in the <Col N="525" /> past&mdash;not so much in this country as on the other side of the water&mdash;the railways in their prosperous days spent many millions in the direction of eliminating competition.  There was undoubtedly excessive competition to get control.  But I say that any persons or body that think they will get a monopoly of transport in any country are making the greatest mistake in the world.  Transport consists of road, rail, sea, and, possibly, in the comparatively near future, air.  Any movement which would create, say, among the commercial community a feeling that they were being badly used or oppressed in connection with any form of transport would immediately have its reactions, as I say it has had reactions in connection with the development of road transport in this and other countries.  Therefore, you cannot arrive at a point where anyone will get a monopoly of transport.  Then the sane thing to do in connection with the whole situation is to organise the traffic.  Where I disagreed with the amalgamation of the railway companies, so far as the railway companies were concerned, was that it eliminated all competition between railway and railway.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the point of view that has been expressed, that it would have been better if we had before us a Bill dealing with the whole problem of transport.  There is general agreement, and I do not think that <Col N="526" /> the Minister himself will dispute the fact, that to-day we have a good many transport services that are uneconomic.</P>
      <P>We have men and materials engaged in the transport services.  Fewer men could do the same work and economically the State, under the present conditions, is suffering.  Legislation in piecemeal fashion is not satisfactory.  It would be better for the future of transport in this State that a more comprehensive Bill should be before us, dealing with the transport problem. At the same time, perhaps, one cannot dispute the fact that railways are entitled to develop remote parts of the country by the employment of bus services, and in doing this it will be all to the good.  If, under the present conditions, they were not at liberty to do that the loosening of these restrictions, I suppose, had to be faced up to. While accepting that, my consideration with regard to this Bill, and my attitude towards it, is going to be entirely determined by what reply the Minister gives on this point: What is to be the position with regard to the existing bus services when the railway company proposes, under Section 3, a new route and the Minister is going to determine whether or not they shall have liberty to go on that route?  What is to be the nature of the inquiry?  How is it to be determined whether that liberty shall be given to a railway company or not? Is it likely that the railway companies will be put into competition with existing bus services?  Will the inquiry be anything in the nature of a public inquiry?  Will the point of view of the local people in an area where a bus service presently exists be taken into account?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For five or six months past, we have a bus service from Cavan to the city. That service started in the first week in September.  It is interesting to see the effect of competition when you have real competition.  When the service started the first-class railway fare from Cavan to Dublin was 40/- and the third class was 27/8.  A week after the bus service started the first-class fare was reduced from 40/- to 15/- and the third-class fare from 27/8 to 10/-.  One man had the enterprise to put a considerable amount of <Col N="527" /> capital into that service, to explore that territory, and the results have been very satisfactory indeed to hundreds of people living in the area served both by rail and by this bus service.  What are the possibilities of the railway company, because of the intense competition, being given the right to run on that same route?  Will consideration be given to whether it is economic, from the point of view of the number of passengers to be carried, and the area to be served, whether there is liberty, so to speak, for a greater number of buses to go on that route than serve it at the present time or not.  I admit that it would seem a hardship that the railway company would not be at liberty to protect its interest, if its interests are being prejudiced. But we all know the great disadvantages that this country has suffered and is suffering, because of the want of enterprise on the part of the railway companies.  I think it has been a mighty good thing for this State that some men have had the enterprise to put money into these bus services and to show the country what enterprise can do, and to show the railway companies what they could do if they were as enterprising.</P>
    <P>To me it seems that this Dáil should be very careful about the steps they are taking, whether we are going to prejudice the position of men who have had enterprise to put hundreds of thousands of pounds into a few bus services here and there in different parts of the country.  I know myself that the Electricity Bill has given quite a number of enterprising people all over the country a bit of a shaking up. This is disturbing the minds of a good many other enterprising citizens.  You can march too quickly along that road, and while we are admonished time and again from the Government Benches as to what it is necessary to do to build up the State, and as to the duty of the citizen in putting his money into his own country and the necessities for new industries, we have to consider what effect the policies put forth here in green papers are going to have on enterprise in the country.  I think we must be very careful indeed that we <Col N="528" /> are not marching too fast.  It seems to me that where existing bus services are giving good service, where there is no legitimate complaint, where the fares are reasonable, where a certain territory is to be exploited, and where only a certain limited business can be done, that it is certainly going to be an uneconomic proposition to allow further services on these same routes.  It would be an uneconomic proposition to go on them and stay on them.  It can only be done for one definite purpose, and that is to knock out the existing service and to hand the business over to a monopoly if you like.  That is the kind of thing that stifles enterprise, and I think we have to take precautions to see that this Bill will not make it possible for the railway companies to get rights which would be exercised in such a manner as to wipe out their competitors.  When they have taught enterprising men a lesson, and when they will succeed in warning off others, they will have the field to themselves. That should not be done.  We do not want to be up against such a proposition. We have to-day very high charges by the railway companies for passenger services and goods services, and when we have legitimate grounds for complaint we have to be careful as to whether we are going to give these companies powers to be used to the disadvantage of the citizens.  Unless the Minister is able to clear my mind as to what is to happen with regard to the services on the existing route, I feel that I must vote against this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HOGAN (Clare)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to traverse the ground that has been already traversed as to the necessity for co-ordination of the traffic systems of the country.  There is one thing, I think, that cannot be overstressed, and that is that the Bill is drafted without any reference whatever to local authorities, without taking their advice on any matter concerning transport within their administrative areas.  The Minister may very well be said to have indicated in the definitions that he was not going to consult the local authorities.  &ldquo;The word &lsquo;rates,&rsquo;&rdquo; the definitions state, &ldquo;means rates and other charges in <Col N="529" /> connection with the carriage of merchandise.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;rates&rdquo; may also mean the amount of money that the ratepayers have to pay for local services within that administrative area.  I suggest to the Minister that a county council ought very well be called into consultation before bus services are approved of by the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Local Government.  Of course, he made the point to Deputy Norton, a moment ago, that a route can be closed for heavy motor traffic.  Does it not seem to be anomalous when the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in the first place, conferred with the Minister for Local Government and the route is approved and when the local authorities consider that the route should not be used for heavy motor services that they have to appeal to the Minister who has previously granted the use of that route. After all, there is a great deal to be said in favour of that.  One cannot imagine that two Ministers here in consultation, no matter how well intentioned they may be, would be in a position to understand the suitability of certain routes for heavy motor traffic.  You have got to consider that this is an attempt to perpetuate what to me seems something of an injustice &mdash;the making of a national service more or less a local charge.  If you perpetuate that there is nothing in the Bill, as far as I can see, to tell the local authorities what they are going to get out of the national fund for the maintenance of the routes that these heavy motor buses are going to injure. The Minister, as far as I know, has not said anything in the matter, and I cannot find anything in the Bill that would make a person clear as to what they are going to get for the use of these routes, as to what they are going to get out of the National Exchequer for the maintenance of these routes that are going to be injured by the motor services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two points I want to make are: In the first instance, why is not the local authority called into consultation? Does he not think that they may probably give some very useful advice to the two Ministers concerned?  And, <Col N="530" /> would he also make clear what will be the position in regard to the maintenance of the routes if this Bill is put into operation.</P>

      <P>I should have imagined that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, before he introduces a Bill of this kind which will, to the mind of the ordinary person, be the means of causing more accidents in the coming year than what have taken place in the past, would have considered a Bill for the control of traffic.  It would be time enough when a Bill was introduced to make it safe for the ordinary people who use the roads to introduce a Bill of this description.  Let us for a moment consider the number of accidents that occurred in the Saorstát last year.  In reply to a question of mine on the 8th February, 1927, as to the number of fatal accidents caused by motor cars from 1922 to 1926, it was shown that there had been a startling increase.  The number of fatal motor car accidents in 1922 was 44; in 1926 the number was 112.  The number of motor accidents affecting males in 1922 was 327 and in 1926, 653.  The corresponding numbers for females were 81 and 134.  The passing of this Bill will mean that accidents will become more frequent.  The Minister did not introduce a Bill to protect the lives of the people against the dangerous driving of motor cars or to regulate the running of buses on narrow roads on which there is no room to pass other vehicles.  According to this Bill, a railway company having any part of its line in the Saorstát will be in a position to provide road motor services.  Since the Railway Amalgamation Act was passed hundreds of railway employees have been dismissed.  If this Bill goes through, the effect will be the same. It seems to me to be the thin edge of the wedge in order to make way for many more dismissals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take a railway service on which there are two or three trains per day. The line may extend for 40 or 50 miles. Twelve or fourteen men will be engaged on that line.  If the railway company can handle the traffic sufficiently, they will deal with it by bus which will only call for the employment of two men.  The engine-driver, <Col N="531" /> the guard, the firemen, the porters and the signal men will not be further required.  The Government may say that this is not another employers' Bill, but it is a Bill that is going to do harm to the workers.  The railway companies will run their buses for the purpose of doing away with the train service and the result will be that railway workers will be thrown out of employment and will be told that when they reach seventy years, they can get the old age pension.  That is the only gratuity they will get. Having regard to the number of fatal accidents recently, I do not think it is right to introduce a measure of this kind.  No legislation has provided protection for life or has provided for the widening of roads and yet this additional traffic is to be carried by the roads.  The trunk road from Athlone to Dublin is not more than twelve feet wide in parts.  That is a dangerous road on which to have these buses running.  Take for example, the railway line that runs from Enfield to Edenderry, in Deputy Davin's constituency. Two trains per day run on that line.  There are engaged on it twelve men, including the men at Edenderry.  If the railway company get this Bill through, it will not be necessary to continue that line.  The buses will provide the necessary facilities and ten men will be dismissed off that line, which extends for about ten miles.  In addition, milesmen will be disemployed.  This is an attempt by the railway companies to reduce their staffs and to increase their earnings with a view to investment in foreign countries.  While many men are idle. these railway companies import 400 turned wheels, the making of which would have provided wages for the mechanics in Dublin.  Deputy Baxter has stated the position with regard to his constituency and his remarks apply to Athlone and Mullingar.  The fare from Moate by rail is 19/10 third-class. The fare by bus is 11/- return.  I speak subject to correction and contradiction but I think the railway company are running some buses under assumed names, without the sanction of legislation.  If they get this Bill through, they will run these buses <Col N="532" /> until they wipe out the private owners and when they are wiped out they will increase their rates.  It is deplorable and lamentable that the Government have not introduced legislation in view of the number of accidents that have occurred.  It is a well-known fact that farmers and farmers' wives and workers and workers' wives are not able to drive their donkey-carts on the roads owing to the buses.</P>

I will vote against this Bill, not that I disagree with the principle of giving everybody a chance of investing capital in whatever industry they please, but because the Bill will have the effect of depriving a large number of men of employment, and because the Government have introduced no legislation to provide for the safety of the people on the roads.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lyons gives one the impression that he lives his life in a constant nightmare, dreading from every measure introduced into this House a greater increase in unemployment.  Unemployment is a very popular topic at the present hour, but I would suggest to the Deputy that he will not help the cause of the unemployed by making a fantastic case.  He agrees&mdash;if one looks into the matter radically&mdash;not in a way to be wondered at with Deputy Heffernan in regard to this Bill.  He foresees, like him, the provision of a monopoly.  This wrong approach in the attack on measures is greatly to be deprecated, because it conveys the impression that the best case that can be made against a measure lies in these futilities.  So far as the Bill is described in the title, it is a Bill with which everybody ought to agree&mdash;&ldquo;an Act to enable railway companies to provide, own, maintain and run road motor services.&rdquo;  Is there any reasonable ground upon which a man might argue that that extension of powers should not be given to the railway companies, <Col N="533" /> in view of the growing development in transport with which the Saorstát is at present being enriched?  It seems to me that the Bill is, as the Minister in the course of conversation across the House, described it just now, a Railway Bill.  It is a Bill for the relief of the railway companies in regard to certain competition.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hewat expressed my view on the matter when he lauded the possibilities provided in this measure for extending a feeder system through bus transport to the railways.  Deputy Lyons, in treating the question of employment through the operation of such a Bill, overlooked that important fact, that the decadent railways might be restored to healthy vitality if they were able, through a properly-organised feeder system of bus transport, to bring in not merely passengers, but every type of traffic.</P>
      <P>But what Deputy Hewat, strange to say, overlooked, and what Deputy Lyons overlooked, is the parallel we had in this matter quite recently in the history of this city.  When electricity was in its infancy in regard to production and supply, the Gas Company was terrified, foreseeing its possibilities, and the Gas Company shareholders and others interested in the provision of gas supplies took a very strong line in attempting either to suppress the new development or to get control of it. Those who saw the advantages that lay in electricity, the convenience of it, the healthiness of it, the extraordinary flexibility of its adaptations, felt that the gas-producing industry was a lost cause; whereas we, who have lived through all this and who see it in its later days, are well aware that though electricity supply and electricity distribution have developed at an enormous rate&mdash;so as almost to be incredible&mdash;yet the gas companies are a better paying proposition at this hour than ever they were in their history.  So there is no incompatibility whatsoever, at least under proper organisation and under proper business control, and there need not be any alarm as regards future development and progress between the railway system and the road transport system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said, very properly, <Col N="534" /> that the railways have spent nearly three quarters of a million on the upkeep of a permanent way.  They have a certain amount of monopoly, it may be said, in that regard, but it is not a monopoly that anyone is going to contest with them.  Unless they get this feeder provision which they are looking for, the monopoly would be very much in the nature of a white elephant. It is not good for this State, and no one interested in its future would pretend even that it is good, that the railway system in which so much capital is sunk and which could do so much, if rightly organised, for the progress of the State should be thrown on the scrap heap through failure to take an enlightened view with regard to modern progressive methods.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides, I am satisfied at least, against a monopoly.  The provisions taken to provide against competitive devices being used by the railways running buses to crush out competitors are provisions that almost reach to harshness.  &ldquo;A railway company which has commenced to run a road motor service under this Act shall not, so long as the running of such service either with or without modification is lawful under this Act, withdraw or discontinue such service without the permission of the Minister.&rdquo;  That closes the door very effectually against the old trick of a big organisation with large capital crushing the smaller competitor by cutting prices or affording other advantages and, when the competitor is crushed out, withdrawing the services or, having secured the advantage of no competition, charging whatever rate it arbitrarily pleases.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is fair, therefore, to allege against the Bill that it does not contain provisions against monopoly. Deputy Heffernan thinks that it is defective in that regard.  Now Deputy Heffernan, in the course of that criticism, enunciated a very extraordinary definition of work.  I was so much struck by it that I took it down; I thought it was well worth committing to memory.  &ldquo;Work.&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is conveying matter from one place to another.&rdquo;  That being so, his speech was a piece of work, for he merely conveyed the matter contained in the <Col N="535" /> memorandum prepared by the Irish Motorists' Union and Transport Development Federation upon the Railways Bill of 1927 from the place in which it was to the official reports of this House.  In doing so he forgot to study the Bill with the same care, and consequently he fell inadvertently into the error of attributing to the measure a defect it does not possess.</P>
    <P>There is to my mind, one cardinal defect in the Bill.  Deputy Heffernan did refer to that without, I think, being aware that, to use a vulgar phrase, he had got hold of a good thing.  When the Provisional Government was set up here there was then in existence, as part of the going concern which was taken over, a Transport Department. What has been one of my continual subjects of denunciation is the fact that in the Ministers and Secretaries Act transport, instead of being kept as a unit State concern, has been divided throughout various departments. Now there is an attempt in this Bill at undoing the division and bringing about, not indeed unification, but some approximation to it, because the Minister&mdash;which means, of course, not a Minister for Transport, as it ought to mean, but the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;is to consult with his colleague, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health. That perpetuates to some extent the unfortunate division whereby transport facilities of one type are under the control of one Department and other transport facilities are under the control of another Department.  In the discussion this evening the Minister in charge of this Bill said very frankly, &ldquo;I have nothing to do with road transport.&rdquo;  That is perfectly true, but he does consider railways and harbours.</P>

      <P>Yes, canals &mdash;in fact, railways and waterways. But qua Minister for Railways he becomes indirectly through a measure such as this&mdash;it is really forced upon him, to some extent at least&mdash;concerned as Minister for Roads.  That is unfortunate.  I think there is agreement <Col N="536" /> in this House&mdash;it has been expressed several times&mdash;that the main arteries of traffic should be a national concern.  Now the railroads are arteries of traffic, but the ordinary highways are what I refer to.  There is in connection with these ordinary highways, under the Department of Local Government, an Advisory Board, and I take it that in the working of Section 3 when a railway company has applied to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for permission to run a road motor service on a particular specified route and when he consults with his colleague the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, that the Minister in his turn would consider the views of the Roads Advisory Committee. But when one considers the composition of the Roads Advisory Committee a flaw is revealed.  That Minister has refused to give representation on the Roads Advisory Committee to the very important interests of lorry or truck owners and motor bus owners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>There are others, but I am speaking for the moment only of one aspect of it, namely, the aspect of competition between two providers of the same service to the public.  Deputy Gorey, of course, is quite right; there are others interested.  It is because there are others interested I do not think that the whole requirements of the new situation would be met unless the tribunal in question were under, in its constitution, some sort of arrangement like, say, the Tariff Commission of Canada, that is, with an independent chairman and then other members representative of the various interests concerned, the railways, bus providers, ratepayers, and the various industries whose products such as agriculture and manufactures would be carried by these carrying companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that we are so near the dissolution of the Parliament that it would be useless to ask for what now strikes everyone as so necessary, the setting up at least of a sub-Ministry of Transport to which all these questions <Col N="537" /> would be referred, and within whose authority would lie the administration of all the matters that arise in connection with this Bill.  But in the present Bill some safeguard might be provided through arranging that the decisions of the Minister should be reached after consultation with, or after having the advice of, some such body as I describe, or he might transfer the responsibility for the decision to such a body, calling it a tribunal.  It is really hopeful to hear the Minister say in the course of the interchange of views across the House, that it will come.</P>
    <P>Though uttered casually, I believe it was not a chance utterance, but expressed the considered minds of the Minister's Department.  They must realise that this is purely a temporary measure and meant to meet an emergency that has arisen.  As the Department concerned with the amalgamated railway in the Free State, it cannot stand idly by and allow to continue the limitations on its working which would involve ultimate disaster to it, with corresponding injury, as I pointed out, to the State.  At the same time, they cannot, I suppose, in the few months that remain undertake the reconstruction of Ministries; consequently I am not making the accusation that, instead of this Bill, there should have been an amending Bill to make a Transport Ministry.  I merely suggest that, while this measure is defensible and obviously intended for reasonable purposes, it could be made very much better.  The arrangement whereby the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash; that means his Department&mdash;should have the decision is autocratic.  It will be autocratic irrespective of consultation with the Minister for Local Government inasmuch as, so far as I understand the Bill, he merely is consulted as to whether he thinks a concession to the railway in particular instances is proper.  As Deputy Heffernan sees the danger of monopoly I, perhaps, suffer from a tendency to suspicion in regard to bureaucracy. I fear the various Bills and Acts that increase the power of the Ministry to be the sole arbitrator in matters of public interest.  The vulnerable <Col N="538" /> point, therefore, in my conception of the measure, is Section 3.  Very little reasonable quarrel can be raised against the rest of the Bill.  If the Minister will see his way to re-consider the objectionable element in sub-section 2 of Section 3, I should certainly feel it necessary to vote for the Bill.</P>

I am in a position now to return the compliment because I am in complete agreement with what he has said on the subject.  I cannot see any reason why the railway companies should not get at least the same facilities as private enterprise, especially in connection with a matter in which they are vitally affected.

      <P>It is much more important, anyhow, that the railway companies should live than that the bus companies should prosper.  Deputy Lyons expressed the view that to put railway motor buses on the road would cause unemployment.  My view is quite the opposite.  The railway companies at present have the greatest difficulty in maintaining even normal services, owing to the depreciation in traffic of every kind, and if they could develop their traffic by running motor buses I cannot see any reason why there should be objection to it.  If they are able to provide further competition and to reduce rates further I believe that the public will benefit in the end.  I do not know if I would be in order at this stage in speaking about the roads, but it is very important that something should be done soon in connection with the road traffic because the county councils will not be in a position in the future, owing to the development of bus services and motor <Col N="539" /> traffic, to keep the roads in repair.  At present they are getting huge sums from the Government in connection with the national road scheme.  Between here and Mullingar, although the roads have been made in the very best fashion, they are depreciating to an extent that I do not think is fully realised owing to the huge traffic of buses and lorries.  Whether there is to be an increase in the tax that is charged or whether the Government will provide a subsidy to local councils in order that they may be able to maintain the roads in a proper way, the county councils, especially the one which I represent, have stated that they will discontinue the sum of £30,000 per annum which they are spending on the roads at present because, no sooner have they repaired or renewed a road than it becomes in as bad a condition as ever after three months' time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this Bill has been properly described as a railways Bill, and I do not take it in any sense to be an attempt to deal with the transport problem as a whole. That, in fact, is one of the minor objections which I have to the Bill.  I would have preferred a larger and more comprehensive measure, a more considered proposal, to deal with the whole system of transport but, taking the Bill as it is, and understanding it, as I do, to be practically an emergency Bill, I cannot discover anything by way of principle to which I could object.  The Bill proposes to enable railway companies to run motor services and my principal complaint is that the Bill was not introduced, at least, two years ago for this purpose because, in the meantime, since the amalgamation of the railways, there have grown up certain vested interests which may be injuriously affected by the Bill, but most of which were not even in existence at the time of the amalgamation.  Dealing with the situation as it is at present, I think there is no reason why the railway company should not have equal facilities for running services by motor cars or buses, especially for passengers and especially in view of the fact that <Col N="540" /> the railway company is composed of a large number of shareholders&mdash;the total amount of which I am not able to give the House but it must run into many thousands&mdash;and most of these shareholders have very small capital. They have been particularly badly hit within the last few years.</P>
      <P>I am not going into the reasons for that, but the fact remains that these people&mdash;many of them have very little other means of livelihood&mdash;are persons who invested their small means in order to provide something for their old age in the shares of the railway companies, and they have been receiving practically nothing.  I, for one, have been almost inundated with communications from railway shareholders throughout the country wanting to know what, if anything, is going to be done to enable them to obtain some return for the money which, when they invested it, they thought they were placing in a sound investment.  Therefore, I think it is due to these people, who in many cases are not at all a prosperous portion of the community, that the railway companies should be placed, at least, on an equal footing with other companies or individuals in the direction of providing motor services. It has, of course, been suggested that this Bill will bring about a monopoly.  I am not concerned with the methods which are proposed in the Bill to prevent that taking place and, while I agree with Deputy Magennis that the Bill seems to go a long way to prevent monopoly, I think that it might be amended in some respect to make that position more secure.  Let us take section 2, for example.  In that section, which is very wide, it is provided that the railway companies may apply their funds for the purpose of maintaining these services.  That may seem a simple statement but it is quite possible that the railway company might be able to afford to lose a considerable sum of money, even tens of thousands of pounds, by providing these motor services, whereas at the same time an individual or a company already in existence would not be able to compete with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, I think it might be desirable that the railway companies <Col N="541" /> should be asked to make their particular motor services pay for the particular routes upon which they are engaged.  Those already engaged on those services to-day have to pay their way, and if the railway companies are to be permitted to draw upon their general funds to provide for a special service in one district or another, I think in that respect it might be unfair to the existing company.  At the same time, viewing this Bill as a proposal to enable the railway companies to do something to make a return to their shareholders, and further, to feed the populations in the outlying districts of the country, and probably even to develop the tourist traffic, I welcome this Bill as far as it goes.  My only complaint is that it would have been better and easier to have introduced it at least two years ago.  Then we would not have been up against the problem of vested interests which we find ourselves up against to-day.  But as regards the principle involved in it, I am certainly in favour of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKENNA Mr. McKENNA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKENNA</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose, in the strongest terms, the second reading of this Bill.  Anyone with a knowledge of this country, and looking back at what happened in it during the last quarter of a century, must come to the conclusion that a measure like this is going to do very serious injustice to the people of this country, especially the class that Deputies on these Benches represent.  During a period of nearly thirty years I have had good experience of railway and shipping interests. At one period we had some competition on the railways.  You had opposition at certain centres where the railways met, but in time the railway companies eliminated that competition by pooling arrangements at these various centres.  That was Number 1 injury against the traders.  As a result of the Railways (Amalgamation) Act, which was passed here, competition has been further eliminated.  We all had hopes that, when private enterprise put those buses on the roads we were going to have competition revived, but the reverse has been the case.  When the canals were working the railway people got a hold of them.  Anyone who looks up <Col N="542" /> the records can see what the result of that was.  They can see what the volume of traffic was on our canals and water-ways up to the time the railways got a hold of them.  I had great hope that those buses were going to be a big benefit to this country and to motor transport in general.  I was in England recently, and witnessed the wonderful volume of live stock traffic that is dealt with by motor transport.  I have here in my hand a report of the evidence given recently before the Railway Rates Tribunal in Great Britain on behalf of three most important bodies in England: the National Farmers' Union, the Live Stock Traders' Association of Great Britain, and the National Federation of Meat Traders' Association.  I propose to call the attention of the House to some questions that were put to the witness examined on behalf of these bodies on the question of motor transport.  The questions and answers are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Now I want to ask you a few questions on the subject of motor transport. Is motor transport a feasible alternative to high railway rates?&mdash; Yes, there is no doubt about that.</P>
      <P>In regard to what distance would you say that it is a feasible alternative?&mdash;My own opinion of it is, and I have studied it rather carefully, that if the railways cannot keep the rates reasonable, when you get above 20 miles, not always up to 20 or 30 miles&mdash;we have evidence of it from the markets all over England&mdash;the motor traffic, especially with regard to sheep and pigs, is increasing rapidly.</P>
      <P>Are any calves carried?&mdash;A tremendous lot.</P>
      <P>Is there a tendency for this traffic to increase or decrease?&mdash;I am quite certain it is increasing rapidly.</P>
      <P>I think there is another alternative, competition by road?&mdash;Yes. The present railway rates are driving people, especially where the distance is nine or ten miles, to walk their cattle instead of sending them by railway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the point that I want to deal with.  The people in this country who are engaged in the production of <Col N="543" /> live stock or in farming are not able to compete with continental countries owing to the high railway rates that are charged.  The position is that traders here have every obstacle that is possible put in their way by the railway companies in the matter of giving through rates from stations in Ireland to stations in Great Britain.  The companies do not refuse to do that, but what happens is that they want their own local rate to the port of Dublin. That is one of the big obstacles that traders here have to contend against. The position is that the railway companies want their pound of flesh.</P>
    <P>Some time ago a man down at Straffan wanted to get a through rate to a station in some part of England. The company would not give it, so what has happened is that the company have lost the traffic which that man could give them and he is now walking his cattle to the port of Dublin.  I had evidence myself the other day of the benefits of motor transport.  I was in Dublin and met a friend of mine who was interested in this motor transport development.  I introduced him to a gentleman who was with me, a man who lives in Ballymahon, which is ten miles from the nearest railway station.  The railway stations nearest to it are at Athlone, Castletowngeoghegan, Streamstown and Longford.  This gentleman interested in motor transport development asked us when was the next fair in Ballymahon.  We told him.  He then asked us when was the freight from the nearest railway station to the port of Dublin.  We told him it was in or about £3 16s., and from Longford about £4 2s. 8d.  He asked us how many cattle we usually put in a waggon. We told him eight or nine.  He then said that he would send down a road train to the next fair.  He did so, and he carried the cattle at 7/9 per head, whereas by rail it worked out at about 10/-.  In the following week he got into communication with the traders in Ballymahon.  They held a meeting and discussed the question of getting their goods down from Dublin on his lorry.  He said that if he got a load in that way, that he could do the cattle <Col N="544" /> cheaper.  At the next fair, the railway company had one of their inspectors present, and at a subsequent fair they had two buses on the road, one from Castletowngeoghegan and the other from Ballymahon.  There you have evidence of what competition is capable of accomplishing.  I say that if the Government were wise they would allow this motor competition to develop, because the livestock industry of the country is being seriously injured by the existing railway and shipping companies. I see no hope for the country if these companies are allowed to pursue their present policy.  Deputies on these Benches supported the Railways (Amalgamation) Act in the hope that some good might come out of it.  What we find is that the last stage is worse than the first.  When we examine the markets in Great Britain, what do we find but that 80 per cent. of the stuff offered is continental, and we are asked here to compete against these people who are practically subsidised by their own Governments.  This is a very important and serious question for the Government and the country. In my opinion it is unwise for the Government to give such a monopoly to the railway company.</P>

      <P>I cannot help speaking on this Bill as Deputy Shaw, Deputy Redmond and Deputy Magennis have attempted to express my views on it.  In the circumstances, I had better express my own views. When speaking about this Bill we ought, I think to confine ourselves to it.  The principle involved in the Bill, as far as I can make it out, is: should one company get facilities that another company has?  I will admit that one company is bigger than another&mdash;that is the only difference that I can see&mdash; in its resources and in the number of its shareholders, but apart from that I can see no other difference between them.  This is a question of allowing railway companies to run buses where private companies are allowed to run them.  Logically, it would be just as reasonable to prevent bus companies from competing with the railways as to prevent the railway companies from competing with the bus companies. <Col N="545" /> And if you go a step further it would be just as logical to prevent one bus company competing with another bus company.  There is no use in going into side issues.  Let us decide whether that is right or wrong.</P>
      <P>The question of road transport is another one altogether.  That is a question on which I hold very definite views, which I have expressed more than once in this House during the last four years or so.  The question that is before us now is a vital one.  If we refuse the railway companies reasonable facilities it may be a question of closing down the whole railway system altogether.  The question that arises is which of the two is the greater national asset.  We have to make a choice and decide which would be the greater national loss.  For reasons already stated, the railway companies may find themselves in the position of not being able to continue.  I should say that the country would be very badly off indeed, especially with regard to cattle traffic, if the railway companies had to close down.  Viewing the question from that standpoint, I say that no matter what a company's resources may be, you cannot make a difference between one company and another.  It would not be justice or equity to do so.  I think that this Dáil would be doing a wrong thing if it were to sanction that.</P>

      <P>I wish to say a few words on this Bill.  The point that I want to refer to is the question of passenger service, which was not touched upon by Deputy McKenna.  I am conversant with the services on the branch of the Great Southern Railways running through the County Meath.  I have travelled on it on various occasions, and I have seen trains run empty for the last four or five years. The company would not, or could not, see their way to reduce fares to accommodate the public until the bus services started on the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin gave an illustration last night as to the fare charged from Cavan to Dublin by the railway company before the bus service was started and the fare after the bus service was established.  My idea is that this is a Bill introduced by the Minister <Col N="546" /> to cut out the bus services that have been a benefit to the public and that have cut down the railway rates and given cheap facilities to people to travel.  If this Bill goes through what is going to happen?  The railway companies, with the assistance of the Government, will run buses on every road that they wish, the Minister being agreeable.  They will reduce the fares and cut out the existing buses, and when they succeed in that, then up go the fares again and supremacy for the railways.</P>

      <P>Outside the ordinary formal objections there has been very little said in objection to this measure.  When I speak of formal objection I mean of the type raised by Deputy Davin, that this is not a Bill for other purposes than the purpose which it sets out to accomplish.  The same Deputy made a similar objection to the Intoxicating Liquor Bill recently, when he said that it did not deal with something about milk carriers.  He complains now that this is not a Bill dealing with the whole transport problem. It is not intended to be.  In opposition to that, the one clear thought I got from Deputy Redmond on this was, that it should have been introduced two years ago.  I wonder does Deputy Davin agree with that, that it should have been introduced two years ago, or is he in favour of holding back anything that can be usefully done in one section until you are ready to deal with everything that relates to the particular problem?</P>

      <P>The Deputy talked of amending Bills in connection with railways.  There have been four Bills, including this, dealing with railway matters since I became a member of this House.  The first one had not the Deputy's serious objection.  The second had his complete approval; so complete that he split from the rest of his Party on it&mdash;I think the solitary occasion on which the well-regimented Labour Party allowed one member of <Col N="547" /> the group to vote in opposition to the rest.  The third had his vehement opposition. The fourth now, I gather, has his approval.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Davin never gives anything but qualified approval, the qualification always being that it proceeds from somebody else than himself.  Had Deputy Davin anything serious to say about this Bill? He had two points.  One was to Section 3, as to which he asked why it could not be more plainly expressed.  He said that it contained a certain amount of verbiage&mdash;that the Minister for Industry and Commerce shall consult with the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  He said quite rightly, and that is what must be read into it, that that consultation may lead to nothing&mdash;that a headstrong Minister for Industry and Commerce may go his own way, quite irrespective of the consultations with the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  I do not know what the Deputy wants.  I did not gather from him that he wanted the Minister for Local Government and Public Health made the authority on Section 3.  If he does, that is a point we can argue about&mdash;as to just which Department ought to have control of this type of measure.  Outside that Deputy Davin made only one point, which was also referred to by Deputy Lyons&mdash;something to do with extra unemployment likely to be caused by this measure.  Deputy Davin made something of a better case&mdash;at least he tried to make a case, which Deputy Lyons did not.  Deputy Lyons simply stated things.  Deputy Davin said: &ldquo;You may get branch lines closed down as a result of motor competition; you may get men put out of employment,&rdquo; and he asked under these circumstances where was the provision in this Bill for the unemployment going to be caused by its operation.  I cannot understand the Deputy's argument in connection with that.  If it is not possible to close a branch line under the Railways Act there is no further power given with regard to the closing of a line now.  If it was possible to close <Col N="548" /> a line under the Railways Act, then there would be compensation presumally. I cannot understand the circumstances of which the Deputy speaks, but I am trying to envisage them. Presumably there would be compensation if the closing down was the result of amalgamation.  Supposing the closing down was not the result of amalgamation but was by reason of bus services put on by some enterprising owner, is there any case for compensation? If there is not any case for compensation there, is the railway employee any worse under the operation of this Bill than he is with existing conditions that hold with regard to traffic?  I do not see any case that can possibly be made for the adverse operation on the railway employee of this measure.  If it can be pointed out and the circumstances clearly detailed, we can endeavour to meet them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, I recognise that if a railway company under existing powers closes down a branch line which is a nonpaying section they are committed to certain compensation payments as a result of their action in so doing, but if subsequent to the passage of this Bill, a railway company closes down a branch line and substitutes a bus service along the same route, I do not think a railway employee who would be thrown out of employment would have the same rights to compensation as in the other case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither would he have any rights owing to a branch line being closed down by being made unremunerative through competition with road services not under the railway companies.  This Bill, which merely substitutes a railway company as a possible runner of a bus service in an area now served by a private bus owner, does not affect the employees in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the point the Minister is now deciding by his statement is a matter that might be decided by the arbitrator to whom claims would be referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely putting up the argument of Deputy Davin. <Col N="549" /> As long as the House is not going to take it that Deputy Davin's statement is what an arbitrator would have to act on, I am satisfied.  The Deputy asked where was the provision for men thrown out of employment by reason of this Bill.  I answered him by asking him to show me how this Bill can throw people out of employment.  I have not got the answer.  The Deputy, and also Deputy Redmond, asked as to the reason for delay.  There is the usual dilemma that one is put in in this House.  On the one hand, Deputy Heffernan, who is the most artful dodger of Parliamentary work that the House has, objects to the measure being brought forward.  He says this is a big question, and should be left over until the really big measure came along.  If people look back to Deputy Heffernan's record on big measures, they will find that when they did come along he was always in the gap to plead that they should be put off to a Special Committee or postponed for further consideration, or anything done except deal with them at the particular time they came forward.  We have Deputy Heffernan asking that this should not be brought forward until a larger measure is brought in, and thus give a further opportunity to postpone the whole thing, and Deputies Redmond and Davin complaining that it was not brought forward two years ago.</P>
      <P>I can justify myself to anybody who can go into the details of this matter on this question of undue delay.  It is nearly two years since it was first put to the railway companies that this was a matter they should consider&mdash;this question as to whether or not they would want to run services on the roads.  If the railway companies have taken so long to make up their minds, that does not lead immediately to the cry against them of undue delay and neglect.  They had to consider over what roads they would like to run road services, see whether it would be economic, see whether they were likely to be in a position to cope with the demands that would be made upon them in the way of these regulations in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When they are doing that it must be remembered that there has not been a solitary example of a service of buses <Col N="550" /> on the road properly run in such a way that one could get proper accounts&mdash; costings and everything done accurately, depreciation and everything allowed for&mdash;so that an undertaking like a railway company could really make up its mind whether or not it wanted to engage in this sort of undertaking. In addition to that, it should be said for the railway companies that the work of early absorption, the work of amalgamation, and the things consequential upon these, have taken up all their energies since the amalgamation period.  So far as I am concerned, it was pointed out to the railway companies long ago&mdash;I cannot even say that I took the initiative in pointing it out&mdash;but at a conference which I happened to have with railway people on other matters about two years ago, this thing was first brought forward, and it has been incubating since.  My Department had nothing to do with it.  This is a matter on which, of course, the railway companies were fettered.  If they wanted to have the fetters released, obviously the demand or the plea should have come from them first. We assisted them in every way we could.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton has raised the objection that this should have been delayed; that we should have got a more comprehensive Bill.  I think other people have either here or elsewhere committed themselves to much the same argument&mdash;that we want a very big measure of control dealing with the whole question of traffic&mdash;road traffic some people limit it to, others simply say traffic.  Undoubtedly there will have to be an approach to that, but I often wonder what the people who so glibly talk about co-ordination mean. I hardly ever get a definition.  I know myself what I would mean.  As far as I can see co-ordination ahead, it does not promise the spectacular results that co-ordination as argued down the country seems to promise to the whole community.  The question of transport will undoubtedly have to be dealt with further.  I ask any Deputy, particularly Deputy Norton, is he going to postpone this, which can be taken in a section by itself, and which is a useful piece of legislation, simply because something, <Col N="551" /> the full effect of which he has not yet been able to consider, has not been thought out and brought forward by way of legislation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is quite fair.  Will the Minister in his spare time look up the Transport and Communications Bill and the memo. attached thereto, and he will see the views that Deputy Norton and the Labour Party hold in regard to the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>

      <P>Not the postponement, but the Deputy made the text of this Bill the occasion on which to deliver a general complaint that the whole system of transport had not been dealt with in a comprehensive way.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, being so keen on transport and having, apparently, studied the matter, Deputy Norton is still unaware that local authorities have certain powers in regard to the closing of roads, and he says his ignorance in that matter is not to be used against him, because I cannot quote sections of an Act.  He has a colleague who can tell him, and there is a member of the Farmers' Party who can tell him, because both are representatives of the council to which I have referred&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;He has nothing to do&rdquo;&mdash;that is the Deputy's sweeping way of passing off what is put into a statute.  Why is the Minister for Local Government to be consulted?  For the reason that the Minister for Local Government is the authority to whom local authorities have to make application if they think that roads are being destroyed by particular types of heavy motor vehicles, and the Minister for Local Government has, and will continue to have, rights with regard to the vehicles running over roads.  It is not proposed to take these from him.  But there are two distinct things: there is the matter of the approval of routes where the approval raises the question: Is there any necessity for a bus being run there at all?  Can a railway bus be run at a remunerative rate?  If it is put on a particular road and must continue on that road, will it have any effect on railway finances?  That question having been decided by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Local Government is taken into consultation on the question of the upkeep of the roads, the safety of people using the roads, the wear and tear of roads, and the question of difficult routes by reason of bad corners.  There are specific functions that the Minister for Local Government has, and he will be expected to exercise them in consultation. Deputy Norton and Deputy Hogan raised points as to consultation with the local authorities.  I do not know what they meant.  Was that comment specially applicable to this Bill, or was it meant to apply to road transport generally?  If it was only meant to apply to this Bill I do not see that railway companies when running buses should have to apply to the local authorities for permission when their competitors and rivals can do so without making such application in the general conditions that now operate in regard to road traffic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. NORTON Mr. NORTON">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It cannot be taken out generally in this Bill.  This is a Bill dealing with services on roads to be run by the railway companies. We are not going to put an extra handicap on the railway companies.  I think they are tightly enough bound without putting on them, and on them only, the necessity of having to apply to the local authorities to get permission to run on certain routes.  We have, then, generally running through the comments a criticism with regard to the enterprise that is being shown by people who put money into buses, that one should favourably consider that and should not do anything that would react unfavourably on anybody who showed that enterprise.  On that I think Deputy Gorey made the correct comment.  If you are going to consider this logically you must go back to the beginning, not as in the matter of now permitting the railways to go into competition with those who are using the roads, but a little further.</P>
      <P>Who first showed enterprise with regard to transport, the people who put money into railways long ago, or those who put money into buses recently?  If there is going to be consideration for those who recently developed a particular line of transport, then the same consideration at least must be given to those who previously put money into railways.</P>

      <P>I cannot answer general conundrums.  It might be to let the hen cross to the other side. Deputy Redmond, although besieged by railway shareholders with letters asking when anything was going to be done, if anything was going to be done, for them, does not seem yet to realise just what the position of the <Col N="555" /> railway companies is, because he went on afterwards, in referring to Section 2, to say that the railway companies might be in a position to lose thousands of pounds by running unremunerative bus services.  If the Deputy has read the Bill he must know that the losses in that case would not stop at thousands of pounds, because once a bus service is started on or within the maximum rate it cannot be withdrawn or discontinued or, as we hope to accept the point that Deputy Thrift raised, even any reductions made in the service without approval.  Neither can the rate, once established, be raised without approval.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in a dilemma again as between those who hold that the restrictions put in in this Bill do not prevent a monopoly and those who would like fewer restrictions on the grounds that I have tied the railways too tightly.  We have tried to strike the best balance.  We think that the railways should not be allowed to beat competitors already there and then themselves withdraw, and we think that if the railway put on bus services at particular rates, they take a risk, having considered everything, of that route turning out to be unremunerative, and only for very serious considerations would a change be allowed.  Deputy Hewat has stated that he thinks the restrictions are unworkable. That may prove to be the case, but we can discuss that on the Committee Stage.  But the aim of the Bill is to allow the railway people, who are at present prohibited from using the roads, to go into competition with those who are at present killing them.</P>

      <P>Our aim in bringing in the Bill was that the railway companies should be allowed to use the roads, but that they should be prevented from setting up thereby a monopoly, a monopoly which would be detrimental to the public.  Personally if I thought that by throwing the whole of the transport into the hands of the company and giving them a monopoly one could get sufficient safeguards that would not be detrimental to the public, I would have very little hesitation in going for that monopoly.  But a monopoly that would be detrimental to the public is what we have tried to guard against in this Bill.  I am not sure what the objectionable part to which Deputy Magennis referred in Section 3 is.  If it is that there is no provision for consultation with the Roads Advisory Committee, that is a point we can debate on the Committee Stage.  It rather goes to the root of this general question of a Ministry of Transport and that services are distributed, as they are said to be distributed, amongst several Ministries. One must remember that as long as the expenditure on roads is financed out of the rates there must be some liaison between the Ministers who are in touch with local authorities and with road transport.  The idea in Section 3 is that where this is really a transport matter, where it is really a question of whether a route should be opened, and should the railways be allowed to run on that road, the consideration against that being that there was a bus already running there, and that, in fact, the railway revenue would be diminished, if it went on&mdash;that, and like matters, are for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to determine.  But the matter of the upkeep of the roads or the matter of the wear and tear of the roads, dangerous corners on routes unsuitable for bus traffic, and a number of such matters, are naturally questions for the Minister for Local Government.  If, keeping these distinctions as they have to be kept for the moment, as long as local authorities contribute from the rates to road upkeep, there is any point that can be met by a Roads Advisory Committee, we could have that dealt with on the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="557" /> Deputy Magennis and Deputy Mulvany both objected to the killing of competition, and again I think Deputy Gorey met them.  If the present situation were allowed to develop, the country might be brought to the choice as between the disappearance of railways or the disappearance of buses.  Now, if that were to be the alternative presented some time or other to the public I doubt if there would be much hesitation. And those who are afraid of a monopoly on the part of the railways company and who feel that the fact that the railways company, now getting power to run buses on roads, might, despite all these safeguards, simply use the power to kill a competitor and then remove their own service, should also cast a suspicious eye on the other side of the picture. Supposing the bus services operating along the Cavan route, say, meant that in the end the railway service was closed on the Cavan section of its line, what safeguard would there be against the buses which would then have control amalgamating, and having the community at their mercy in that particular section, raising the rate far above what any railway rate had been?  If there is a suspicion about the railways company in connection with the safeguards that are here, there should be much more a suspicion of a bus owner who could, by amalgamating with people who may be rivals to him, overcharge the community in a particular area from which the railways have been driven out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a question of chances.  Have the chances occurred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the situation that people should look to is just what happened here, before the eyes of the Dublin people, at any rate in Lucan, where there was a Lucan tramway service and where the service was defeated by the operations of certain buses, and when the tramway had been put out of use then the rates were raised by the buses, and eventually the community in any circumstances would not use the buses.  We had a clamour to get the <Col N="558" /> Dublin Tramways Company to extend their services to Lucan in order to give the people the services that they had themselves neglected and allowed to be beaten by rival bus owners.  That was a small case.  It was not very serious because it only had relation to a particular district, but that is a situation that might develop all over the country.  Because we have one big company here at the moment and we have them facing a series of small unorganised bus owners one should not assume that that is always going to last.  Developments are even proceeding at the moment with regard to the vehicles on the road; they are amalgamating, they are forming themselves into companies, and before very long the natural tendencies of things will be to have only two or three companies operating and these could easily overcome the individual bus owner.  Having destroyed the railway companies, we might find other companies much stronger financially, having their permanent way kept to something like ten-seventeenths of the cost by the rural ratepayers and having then power to raise the rates without any regulations such as the railway companies are at present under.</P>
    <P>Deputy Baxter has asked me what is to be the reaction to an application under Sestion 3, if it is shown that the railway company is going to run a road service in circumstances where it could not be considered feeding into the railway system.  I could hardly imagine any route in the country so completely far away that it could not be considered a feeder, in some way or other, to the railway system.  But I can say this, that ordinarily speaking, in considering applications one would have primarily the idea of feeding into the railway system.  I do not know that people should object, on the other hand, to an application for a particular area not now served by the railway, fairly remote from any railway system at the moment&mdash;if the railway company can show that they can give a road service better than the existing road service and that they are pledged to continue that road service once started I do not see why they should be prevented. Taking it from the point of view of service to the community, if <Col N="559" /> under all these restrictions the railway company is able to show that they can give a better service&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to answer the Deputy in detail on that point.  I think he said he would vote against this Bill unless he was assured that applications for the running of road services other than those which come to be considered as feeding into railway systems would be rejected. I cannot give him any such undertaking. Each application will have to stand on its own legs.  While primarily one would like to see all the services running into the railway system, I cannot bind myself at this moment by saying that I would prevent other services being run, not especially feeder services. He asked would it be a public inquiry, would the people of the neighbourhood have a right to appear.  I would hope not, decidedly.  They might make representations if there was a particular case.  I do not know what situation we are going to get to if every time a railway company decides to run a bus service it will have to take the point of view of little communities along the whole route as to whether that bus service should be allowed to run.  That does not apply at the moment to the private bus owner.  He has not to come before anybody; he simply holds out to carry people by a certain route and at certain rates.  The railway company would have to do the same thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

    <P>That for the purpose of any Act of the present Session to make provision for the reorganisation and regulation of the generation, transmission, distribution and supply of Electricity throughout Saorstát Eireann and in particular to make provision for the generation of Electricity in the works constructed by the State under the Shannon Electricity Act, 1925, and for the transmission, distribution and supply of such electricity and for that purpose to make provision for the management, administration and control of the said works with a view to the efficient and economic operation thereof, and for other matters incidental to or arising in the course of the matters aforesaid or in connection therewith and to amend the said Shannon Electricity Act, 1925, it is expedient to authorise&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  payment out of the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof of advances made under such Act not exceeding in the aggregate the sum of Three Millions One Hundred Thousand Pounds, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the charge upon the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof of the principal and interest of any securities issued for the purpose of borrowing under such Act.</P>
    <P>It is proposed by this Money Resolution <Col N="565" /> to provide £3,100,000, that £3,100,000 to cover two separate purposes. As far as £600,000 of it is concerned, it is to enable the Electricity Supply Board to pay interest and arrears of interest on the money expended on the works constructed under the Shannon Electricity Act, 1925, and handed over to the Board by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It is also to meet the expenses of operation, repairs, maintenance, etc., during the early years when the undertaking is still unremunerative.  The time limit fixed is up to 31st December, 1932.</P>
    <P>The other portion of the £3,100,000&mdash; £2,500,000&mdash;is provided to enable the Board to carry out its functions of promoting the distribution of current, wiring of houses, purchase of electrical equipment, loans to undertakers and so forth.  Deputies will remember that the Shannon Act, 1925, provided a sum of £5,210,000 for the constructional works and also for the meeting of interest and interest charges and losses in the early years of the undertaking. This sum of £600,000, which is being provided again, is not in addition to the sum that was provided for interest and losses in the early years of the undertaking in the first Act.  It is, in a sense, a re-vote of that money, and in no circumstances will the cost of construction, plus the interest charges and losses in the early years, exceed the £5,210,000 provided for in the original Act.  This £600,000, or so much of it as may be available, will be paid to the Board.  There will be a division of liability between the Board and the Minister, because the responsibility of the Board for interest and arrears of interest will only begin when the undertaking, or part of the undertaking, is handed over to the Board.</P>

Would the Minister also give us more detailed particulars of what that sum of £2,500,000 is intended to cover?  Is it purely a sum to be given the Board for the purpose of private installations, or what part of <Col N="566" /> the main system is going to be paid for out of that sum by the Board? The Bill does not give us any information on these points.  The proper time to ask for this information is, I think, now when the Minister is asking the House to authorise the handing over of a sum of £2,500,000 without practically any explanation of what it is to be ear-marked for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan) Patrick McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The sum of £2,500,000 is being ear-marked as the financial resolution indicates. The Shannon Electricity Supply Bill, 1927, gives the Board power to buy out existing statutory private undertakings and to pay compensation therefor. Part of its duty will also be to pay compensation for such of the unauthorised privately-owned concerns as may seem hereafter to be fit subjects for compensation.  In addition to that, the Board may provide&mdash;in the ordinary course of events it will have to provide &mdash;moneys for the wiring of houses.  The Board will also have to get in stocks of electrical appliances, and it will have to institute showrooms and salerooms. The Board will have to pay the expenses of the working of the Shannon plant and the expenses of the distribution of the electricity in so far as the Board has control of electricity in the country at various dates hereafter.  For those purposes the sum of £2,500,000 is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sum of £600,000 is, as the Minister for Finance explained, really a re-vote, the position being that under the Shannon Act of 1925 the sum of £5,210,000 was voted; the experts' calculation was that the works should be built for a sum which we are taking at £4,600,000 but which really was about £4,525,000.  A sum of about £675,000 was set apart to meet interest-charges on the moneys expended on the plant and for losses of working during the unremunerative years which, they state, should be up to the end of the year 1932.  It is not possible to apportion that sum of £600,000, in round figures, because one cannot foresee how much of the charges for interest will have to be met by me in my capacity as constructor of the works and how much will have to be met by <Col N="567" /> the Board which, at different times, will take over portions of the Shannon plant as completed and will become liable for the interest on the moneys expended on the portions of the plant taken over.  One cannot estimate how much of that £600,000 will be paid by my Department and how much will fall to be paid by the Board.  Deputies will notice that there is an amendment to Section 11. sub-section (2), indicating that the sum of £600,000 is the maximum under this particular second sub-section and that it is phrased in this way: &ldquo;such sums as with the said sums advanced... amounts to the sum of five millions two hundred and ten thousand pounds...&rdquo;  We would describe it more accurately if we could describe it more accurately but it is not possible to say what portions of the plant will be handed over and what interest-charges will be met by advances made to the Shannon Fund and operated on by me and on the other hand what moneys will have to be paid by the Board when the Board takes over.  The sum of £600,000 is the nearest approximation we can get to the figure required for interest and for losses on working, and that sum cannot further be apportioned as to moneys that will be paid out under the auspices of the Department of Industry and Commerce and the moneys that will be paid out afterwards under the auspices of the Board.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance made a statement which might be wrongly interpreted&mdash;that under no circumstances would the moneys come to more than £5,210,000.  Nobody can, at this time, state what unanticipated underground difficulties may be encountered&mdash;difficulties as regards excavation and troubles of that sort.  What we are keeping to definitely is this: it was estimated that the works could be built for a certain sum, to which there had to be added interest and allowance for losses on working in the early years. I am still binding myself to that.  If that sum is to be increased, it will have to be done by coming to this House and making a case for it.  I am not trying to get extra moneys under this Bill to cover a deficiency that I had not foreseen in the moneys already supplied. <Col N="568" /> The original sum of £5,210,000 is being kept to.  I consider it would be my duty as soon as it became clear to me that that sum was going to be increased to come to the Dáil and ask for further moneys.  That stage has not been reached.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the matter has been rather complicated. The manner in which it has been dealt with has contributed to the complication.  Perhaps it is necessary to deal with it in that way.  But the apportionment as between the original sum of £5,000,000 odd that was voted and the £610,000 is merely, according to the explanation of the Minister, a departmental transfer.  It would strike one that there was no necessity for voting twice this £600,000 under the circumstances.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in supplementing what the Minister for Finance stated, gave us an explanation of the £2,500,000 which is to be placed at the disposal of the new Board.  But he dealt with the question in a very general way.  I should like to ask if the sum of £2,500,000 is a haphazard guess at what will be required or is there an estimate of what the various things under this section are going to cost.  There is, we are told, provision for private wiring and various other operations, but no definite amounts are set down.  Surely the Minister does not come to the Dáil at this stage to ask for a vote of £2,500,000 to a Board, to administer a service which is to be handed over to it, without having more definite details.</P>

That amount would be absorbed immediately. There would be a meeting to divide the spoils.</P>

      <P>Would it not be desirable that we should be given an estimate of the total cost of transmission when the scheme is established. I think it was not the intention to transmit power to towns of less than 500 population.  Has any estimate been made of the cost of transmission? As regards wiring, will all the cost of distribution and wiring be borne by the Board, in the first place?  Will the individual householder, in getting in the electricity, be expected to put up the capital sum or will there be a system of gradual payments spread over a period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer the last question first, the Board has power to provide lines, wiring apparatus and all the rest, and to make such terms and conditions as may seem to them proper.  That section is specially designed to cover the wiring of houses and the spreading of payments over a number of years.  Of course that facility will not be given to everybody. The circumstances of the individual will be looked into when the Board proceeds to the wiring of houses.  And, remember, the Board has also power to allow that particular facility to undertakers operating under it.</P>
      <P>As to the point regarding transmission, there can be no estimate of the cost of transmission until one knows what transmission lines are going to be built.  One will not be able to determine the transmission system to be built until there is a clearer calculation as to the demand.  Obviously, lines are not going to be extended to districts which would clearly prove to be unremunerative. There can be no clear cut statement on this question of the cost of transmission.  I stated on the Second Reading of this Bill that about a year hence I could give a fairly accurate statement as to the areas to which the transmission system would run and the cost of erecting that system.  But I am not, obviously, in a position to do that now, when we have only embarked on the building of one circuit out of the four circuits.</P>

      <P>The conclusion we <Col N="570" /> must come to is that, after a period of two years, the Minister comes to us and asks for a vote of £2,500,000, which is purely a hotch-potch sum.  It might as well be £5,000,000 or £10,000,000, so far as any allocation of the amount is concerned.</P>

      <P>That is a complete misunderstanding of what I said. I said I had a pretty good idea of the amounts.  I am assisted in that idea by the fact that people who were looking for the concession made estimates of what it would cost.  I am not going to give that calculation to the Dáil, and I think it would be quite unfair to ask me.  I ask the Dáil to consider the effect of stating the amount of money allocated to the Board for compensation purposes.  It is clear what would happen the moment that was stated. You would have a definite meeting of those likely to be compensated, as the phrase goes, in order to divide the spoils.  We are not going to give them any indication of that type.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert before sub-section (4), a new sub-section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Three of the members of the Board at least shall be selected for their practical knowledge of electrical supply and shall have been engaged in electricity supply undertakings. The additional members (if any) shall be selected persons of practical experience in the administration of commercial concerns.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with the constitution of the Board that is proposed to be set up.  When the Minister was making a statement on Second Reading he did not seem to be very clear or emphatic as to the constitution of the Board.  I think the Minister will admit that the Board is a very important factor, and its constitution will be a matter of considerable importance for the Dáil to consider.  The Minister does not define in the Bill the qualifications that should be possessed by members of the Board.  In putting forward this amendment I am endeavouring to concentrate your minds on the Board as it is going to be formed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Bill passes in anything like its present form, the Board is going to be an all-powerful factor in connection with the whole management and control, not only of the generating end of <Col N="575" /> the scheme, but of the distribution end; it will have practically the entire control of the industry.  I have endeavoured, in this amendment, to suggest to the Minister that various qualifications are necessary.  Such qualifications, at all events for a section of the Board, will include a knowledge of the generating and distributing end of electricity, but more particularly a knowledge of all the factors which will go to make the scheme a success.  I do not wish to labour the amendment at this stage.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to labour this amendment at the present stage, but I would like the House to understand that the Minister has not given us much insight into his mind on this subject.  It is.  I think, a suitable opportunity to ask him to unburden himself on this matter.  I would like to hear his criticism of the constitution of the Board, as suggested in this amendment, and when I have heard what he has to say, I may have something further to add.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I could describe this amendment concisely as being a very liberal one, very liberal to Deputy Hewat and those whom he is supposed to represent here.  There is to be a Board consisting of a Chairman with a number of members not less than two or more than six.  At the maximum, there is to be a Board of seven, consisting of a Chairman and six others and Deputy Hewat coolly proposes that three of these at least, &ldquo;shall be selected for their practical knowledge of electrical supply and shall have been engaged in electricity supply undertakings. The additional members (if any) shall be selected persons of practical experience in the administration of commercial concerns.&rdquo;  That is to say, excepting the Chairman, they are all to be in this grand circle of what is known as business men, either specialised electricity business men, or general business men.  I do not know that there is very much more clarification contained in this amendment than in sub-section 3 of Section 2 of the Bill.  That sub-section is, at least, fair in this, that I do not want to have imposed on me any hindrance with regard to the conditions of appointment <Col N="576" /> of these men, that I was to be free to decide in the circumstances that faced me.  When I come to appoint the Board, in the first instance or afterwards, Deputy Hewat wants me to appoint &ldquo;three selected persons of practical experience in the administration of commercial concerns.&rdquo; We will have to go further surely and define what is a commercial concern.  I would like to be in opposition on this point and query Deputy Hewat as to what he means by &ldquo;practical experience&rdquo; and how much &ldquo;practical experience in the administration of commercial concerns.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Heffernan raised a question on Second Reading as to whether there would be on the Board anyone who would be able to talk to farmers.  I do not know whether the &ldquo;selected persons of practical experience&rdquo; believe themselves capable of talking to farmers. That, at any rate, was a requirement put to me by Deputy Heffernan.  I do not think that there is any half-way house between leaving the section as it is and deciding on the qualifications of each individual member of the Board. If the Dáil starts to decide who are likely to be the people appointed and to decide on their qualifications, as well as the priority to be given to certain qualifications, we are going to have an unending discussion.  I believe that there will have to be on the Board one person who would have a knowledge of accounting matters.  It will be most desirable to have on the Board also a man who would have a proper outlook in regard to the handling of public money.  I think there will have to be someone who has the agricultural interests of the country clearly and throughly before him.  I could go through a list of people whom I would desire to see on the Board, but in the end, owing to the small number of members required, there would have to be an elimination on special qualifications residing in particular individuals. One would have to look for an all-round man with special knowledge. Essentially a man who should be on the Board, when the plant is fully working, would be the engineer in charge of the station.  Also, I think, the engineer in charge of transmission would eventually <Col N="577" /> have to be on it.  There will, undoubtedly, have to be someone, possibly he will have to be the chairman, with a knowledge of salesmanship as applied to electricity concerns.</P>
    <P>I do not see any half-way house between leaving the situation as it is so that the best men will be got hold of without any impediment such as there would be by saying that the members &ldquo;shall be selected persons of practical experience in the administration of commercial concerns.&rdquo;  I do not know whether a qualified accountant, running an accountant's business, and running it properly, could be considered as a person with &ldquo;practical experience in the administration of commercial concerns.&rdquo; Most accountants have that experience, but it is mostly obtained when they are brought in from outside to wind up commercial concerns.  I do not know that that would be considered the experience required in this case. If we get into the question of qualifications, segregate certain individuals, and impose certain tests on each of them, there is the other point that arises, namely, that the Board immediately on formation would simply become a Board consisting of the representatives of interests which are, more or less, in hostility to each other.</P>
    <P>You do not want a relatively small Board, managing a huge undertaking, right from the beginning split into representations of different interests. One does not want to see, for instance, a farmers' representative lining up against a business representative, and the farmers' representative trying to get hold of the accountant, with the business representative trying to get hold of some other person, while the two engineers try to get the station running and the load properly looked after.  As there is to be a certain amount of trust with regard to appointments generally, there should be the fullest trust here.  The best way to get the Board to work efficiently and harmoniously&mdash;and harmony is, probably, more to be sought for than efficiency&mdash;is to leave the selection of the Board without qualifications stated. There will, of course, be qualifications looked to, but the matter should be left to the good judgment of those who <Col N="578" /> will have to appoint the Board, so that they will appoint the proper men to deal with the situation in the best way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not extracted much from the Minister.  I think he is a bit of an oyster to-night.  Let us examine the position a little.  The Minister seems to think that my amendment dictates as regards the persons whom he should appoint.  It does not. It tries to get a recognition for representatives of existing undertakings in connection with which this Board is going to be constituted on the basis of the Bill.  The Minister, in effect, says that we had better leave this an open question.  The open question, of course, reacts on the discussion during Second Reading in this way, namely, the Minister did not like the reference to the fact that there was political significance in connection with the whole linking up of the scheme with the Minister for Industry and Commerce. It is to relieve that position that we propose the amendment.  It is not that the Minister has not ideas on the subject, at all events, he is not going to disclose them, but he wishes it to be left an open question as to the person to be appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree it is difficult to lay down qualifications in connection with the formation of a Board of this sort, but here we have organisations whose interests are dealt with in the Bill.  The Bill as it stands contains very confiscatory proposals.  I hope the Minister will concede at least some of the points I have indicated.  I would like to have had from the Minister a recognition that as regards the undertakings that have been built up in the State it is right and proper they should have representatives on the Board.  I put forward that claim.  They would be valuable representatives, would have a knowledge of what they are talking about, as far as electricity is concerned, and a more intimate knowledge of the surrounding circumstances on which the success of the whole scheme depends. The Minister says &ldquo;leave it an open question.&rdquo;  To-morrow or the next day we are going to appoint the Board, and the Minister says &ldquo;Leave it in the air.&rdquo;  I think the time has <Col N="579" /> come when he ought to be in the position to submit to the House something in a practical way regarding the Board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House would desire some clarification as to what Deputy Hewat means.  This Bill is described as confiscatory.  I deny that.  There is no confiscation in it. Deputy Hewat ran along with that idea in his mind, and he proposed that three members should get representation who would look after the existing electricity undertakings.  Once you get into that it is a matter of getting on the Board three other members who will balance the vested interests which these people will have before them when appointed on the Board.  That is clearing the air about this hitherto innocent-looking proposal.  People who are afraid of something described as &ldquo;confiscation&rdquo; in this measure are going to be given representation on that Board to the extent of three, so that they may see to it that the proposals in the Bill with regard to the Board's powers are not to be used after the House has done its best, on the plea of Deputy Hewat, to whittle down whatever powers may be attributed to the Board.  I protest stronger than ever against Deputy Hewat's proposal that we are to put three people on the Board representing vested interests, for if that is the case we will have to look to it that another three who will have the opposition view are appointed.  Then we get to the position that we have the Chairman, a single individual, who is to be the arbitrator with regard to everything that falls for consideration by the Board. There is likely to be a place for people who can show that they have experience in the efficient running of an electricity supply business, but that place is not on the Board.  There is going to be a supply department under the control of the Board, and there is going to be a special sales department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesSprouleMyles" hpid="Major MYLES Major MYLES">
      <NameTxt>Major MYLES</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is wrong in his statement that it was intended to give representation to vested interests.  My idea regarding the amendment was to select people with a practical knowledge of electrical <Col N="580" /> supply, and who have been engaged in electricity supply undertakings. There should have been added to that &ldquo;at some period.&rdquo;  I do not think it was in our mind, in the way the Minister put it, that these men should be selected, shall we say, by the Electricity Supply Association of Ireland, to represent the interests of their members, but it was to give a feeling of security where so much money is at stake that the men on that Board should be men with practical experience of the job they are going to take on, and that job is a similar one, on a large scale, to those on which they have been engaged.  I think the Minister should not have taken the line he did with regard to Deputy Hewat's argument. I quite agree with the Minister that it would be very fatal to have fights going on and the Board divided into two sections.  That would be creating an impossible situation.  I think it was not the intention of those who put down the amendment to give vested interests representation.  The intention was rather that the Minister would have the opportunity of stating the class of men he would put on the Board.  The Minister invited amendments, and we have put forward an amendment which is really a valuable suggestion as to the type of men who ought to be on the Board.</P>

      <P>I think it is desirable we should have some qualification attached to membership of this Board.  As the proposal stands, no qualifications whatever are attached to these appointments, and we are proceeding to legislate for a Board that will have continuous existence.  Let me point out what may happen under a future <Col N="581" /> Ministry.  None of us expects that the present Ministers will always continue in office, desirable as that may be, and much as we would like to see some of them here for a further period.  We must always bear in mind, in legislation, that Ministers are changeable, and we may have in the future on the Ministerial benches the good-looking Deputies who occupy the Opposition benches at present.  We may not be inclined to say about them, until we have had experience of their administration, the things we say of the Ministers of whom we have had some experience. But may I point out that these members of this Board are to occupy office for five years?</P>

      <P>Yes, or possibly more, but that they are to occupy office for five years.  Now we have had recently brought in legislation to this House that extends the life of the Government to five years.  I do not know whether that is just an accident but it may be open to a very much wider reading of this kind, that each Government, as it comes into office, will look upon this as one of the very desirable opportunities for rewarding the services of some of those who have helped them.  Deputy O'Connell smiles. Whether that smile is the smile of assent or dissent I do not know at the moment.  Possibly, it opens vistas to him that he had not seen before&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a thing which we should consider&mdash;as to whether we should not have some protection in this Bill that would prevent the appointments to this Board being political appointments.  Now I do not think any member of this House wants, and certainly no member of the Government wants, this Board to provide simply an opportunity for the Government administration to put in persons who will have served them well.  I do not think any section of the House will accept that.  Is it not desirable&mdash;I go further and say is it not necessary&mdash; that there should be protection in this Bill that will prevent that?  If the <Col N="582" /> qualifications put forward by Deputy Hewat and others supporting him are not desirable, then let us put into the section qualifications that will stop this Board from degenerating into political jobbery.  I think all the Deputies will agree that that is very desirable. As I say, we may be prepared to leave this matter to the present Government to make a selection, relying on them that they will appoint men who are fully qualified to discharge the duties of this important office, but I would urge we are legislating now for posterity&mdash; we are legislating for all time for a Board that will be in continuous existence and while it may be possible to leave that appointment untrammelled in any way to this Government, I do not think it wise to leave it to any future Ministry to put in persons, as I said, who have served them and to make political appointments.  If we are going to do it in that way, I am afraid that we are going to strike at the confidence which should attach to this Board.  Some of us have heard, I am afraid with alarm, of the powers that it is proposed to give to this Board.  It has been pointed out by the Minister, in view of the functions they have to discharge, that these wide powers may be desirable, but if we are going to give to that Board all these wide powers, surely it is essential in the discharge of that duty that we should ensure for the future that the Board who will possess those wide powers will be composed of men who will understand the duties and have qualifications fitting them to discharge those duties.  If we are going to appoint men who have not got qualifications, I see nothing in the future but alarm for what we have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>None of us would attempt, in our ordinary business, to appoint men to positions involving wide responsibilities such as these men would be called upon to discharge if we were not satisfied that they had the qualifications.  It is the very first thing we would satisfy ourselves on, that these men had the qualifications.  On that matter, this amendment proposes that nobody should be appointed to these positions in the future who has not got the qualifications <Col N="583" /> to discharge the duties that will devolve on him.  I say it is absolutely essential that we should tie up this clause in some way.  If the proposal put forward by Deputy Hewat is not acceptable, then let us see how we can ensure for the future that these men put into this position will be qualified to discharge the duties attaching to the office.  I think that that is the thing to do.</P>

      <P>As far as I can understand this amendment, it is to make sure that the members of this Board should have some qualifications. According to the Minister, he wants a blank cheque from the Dáil.  He says: &ldquo;Leave it to me, everything will be all right&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so.  I am not suggesting that it may not turn out as he suggests it will, but at the same time are we here in this House to allow this Bill to go through, which will provide for the appointment of gentlemen on it, at the pleasure of the Minister or his successor, on no basis whatsoever?  He has not even definitely laid down upon what basis all his appointments shall rest.  If he were to go so far as to tell the Dáil what qualifications he would consider it desirable or necessary, and that he would act on those, there might be something for giving to him this free hand.  But he has not gone even as far as that.  He says: &ldquo;Leave it to me, everything will be all right.&rdquo;  I do not think that that is the way to treat seriously a measure such as this, or a Board which shall have such duties and powers to put these duties into force.</P>
      <P>On the Second Reading I took the opportunity of suggesting that it was the opinion of the Experts who made their report on the Shannon scheme that this Board should consist of those who had certain qualifications, and I submitted that there was ground for that suggestion.  On page 91 of the report the Experts, in dealing with the constitution of this Board, which they called in this regard &ldquo;the new organisation,&rdquo; say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="584" />&ldquo;Because of the fact that this new organisation will not itself carry out the construction work, but mainly supervise it, the layman may easily underestimate its duties.  The Experts, therefore, emphasise that each individual part of the work, the civil engineering part, the mechanical part, the electrical part, the sale of current, the handling of the landowners, requires a specialist who, in his turn needs, according to circumstances, a smaller or greater number of assistants.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Well, I say that certainly it is not an extravagant construction to place upon that carefully considered paragraph of the Experts' report, that what they meant to convey was that this Board should not consist of very estimable gentlemen who might be useful in every other walk of life; who might have the best and most honest intentions, but who were not particularly conversant with the class of business which their duty on this Board would call upon them to perform.</P>
    <P>I suggest that that portion of the Experts' report positively lays it down that this Board should consist of individuals who would be able by their knowledge to supervise both the engineering and mechanical part as well as the electrical part of their work, and also the sale of current and the handling of landowners.  On the other hand, the Experts, in making that suggestion, had the very position, in which we find ourselves now, in view.  They came to the conclusion that the Minister to-day or to-morrow might possibly appoint a Board, consisting, as I say, of very estimable people in the realms of industry and commerce who would have no previous knowledge or experience of the technical subjects with which they would be asked to deal in a very important and serious manner, in the conduct of a concern so great as this, and involving such huge financial sums as well as involving such serious consequences to the whole community.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, strongly urge the Minister not only in the interests of the proper working of this scheme, not only from the point of view that this Board should be above board and also that it should be appointed upon some reasonable basis beyond the lines which <Col N="585" /> the Minister has chosen to give us, which are practically nil, but that it should be appointed strictly in accordance with the well-considered and thought-out advice of the Experts themselves.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, urge the Minister, in the interests of the proper working of the scheme, that he should take the Experts' advice in this matter, and, that though he need not necessarily adopt the actual wording of Deputy Hewat's amendment&mdash; which the Deputy, I do not think, went so far as to suggest&mdash;that he should give an assurance and that he should go further than giving an assurance, that he should embody that assurance in some way in this Bill before it leaves this House&mdash;that the people who are to be appointed shall not be merely good all-round business men, but that they shall be people who in the particular respect mentioned in the Experts' report shall have a particular and technical knowledge of the great work which their duties will necessitate their undertaking.</P>

      <P>There is one phrase that has been used in the Dáil that seems to have gone to people's heads.  The phrase is that we are legislating for all time.  People have set out with that idea, apparently, believing that no Dáil after this one is going to be sovereign.  The idea is that no Dáil is going to have the power to change legislation that this Dáil makes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other Deputies besides Deputy Redmond who have spoken, and surely I am entitled to allude to them, although not so important as he in his estimation.  Deputy Good said, and it is to him I am referring, that we are legislating for all time.  We are not doing anything of the sort.  We are legislating in a way that we hope will last, but we are not precluding anyone from amending this later, and if amendment is required later on and qualifications put in by the Government succeeding the one which has abused the wide powers now given under this Bill, then I am sure that amendment can be moved.  Apparently <Col N="586" /> it has not penetrated certain people's heads that if you have a Government with a majority behind it that wants to do certain things, the mere putting in of certain stipulations in the piece of legislation that we are passing now is not going to prevent the Government doing the thing it desires.  If Deputy Good, sitting here later, wanted to do the most unreasonable thing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be exceedingly unlikely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite unlikely, and for that reason I named the Deputy.  But if one's imagination could stretch to the belief that Deputy Good would do anything unreasonable: that he sat here and wanted to do it and had a party behind him, merely having certain qualifications in the Bill would not prevent him from doing it.  But if Deputy Good did stand here he could not really want anything more from the strictly party point of view than what he is now seeking to obtain.  He is asking under this amendment that the Board shall consist of three business men with a practical knowledge of electrical supply, and three general business men.  These gentlemen are to compose the Board of six, and after that you are to have a Chairman.  Let us imagine Deputy Good with the idea of the capacity and importance of the business community strong in him standing here and dealing with a Bill of this sort.  Could he, I ask him, put in a better Board from the business party point of view than the Board that would be set up under this?  At least he would give himself permission to put in a business Board.  On the other hand, if Deputy Good wanted to turn away from his business instincts and wanted to put in a completely unsound Board, he could still do it if this amendment of Deputy Hewat's were carried. Look at the qualifications that are required&mdash;three men with a practical knowledge of electrical supply who shall have been engaged in electricity supply undertakings, and three persons of practical experience in the administration of commercial concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does anybody deny that if I set out to get a completely hopeless Board that I could not get it within the terms of this amendment?  I could get a Board <Col N="587" /> under it that would make every electric bulb in this State turn pale and grow dim with alarm.  There would be nothing to prevent me picking out six of the most undesirable people that I could get, except that I am strictly limited to two classes of people.  I think it is the negative arguments that one has to attend to here.  There is to be no one on the Board, as Deputy Heffernan said, who will be competent to talk to farmers; there is to be no accountant, no engineers unless the engineers are people who have been engaged in electricity supply undertakings. As to the man in charge of the Shannon power house, or the man in charge of the whole Shannon network, neither of these could go on unless they previously had experience in electricity supply undertakings.  Deputy Redmond then came to the aid of Deputy Hewat. I am not clear whether or not Deputy Redmond is really supporting Deputy Hewat's amendment.  I gather that he is not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Redmond argued that there should be a Board consisting of an expert in civil engineering work, in mechanical engineering, in electrical engineering, and that there should be a sales current specialist, and a specialist in the handling of land owners.  I do not know whether this latter would be the man that Deputy Heffernan would regard as competent to talk to farmers.  I wonder is that the Board which Deputy Redmond thinks is the Board we are talking of at this moment and the Board that the Experts have, in fact, given me advice on?  If the Deputy thinks that, then all I can say is that he has misread the document.  He can contradict me if I am not estimating his thoughts correctly, but I take it that he does believe that the Board referred to by the Experts and the Board that we are now dealing with are one and the same, and that therefore this Board should consist of the particular people I have mentioned.  I rather gathered on the last day, when Deputy Redmond interrupted me and when he seemed to have a difficulty in finding the place in <Col N="588" /> the Experts' report in which this question of organisation is dealt with, that he had not read or thought a great deal about what the Experts said.  What he said to-night justifies me in that belief.  The Deputy read out certain words in the preamble, but he has not adverted apparently to their special application. He did not refer to the fact that the organisation will not itself carry out the construction work but will mainly supervise it.  The Experts, when dealing with the Board, were dealing with that section of the Board's activities which had to do with the construction of the Shannon works, and not the Board that we are talking of now.  If the Deputy still believes that, then it is open to him to bring in an amendment asking me to appoint this Board of electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, civil engineers, a specialist in the sale of current, and a specialist in the handling of landowners.  By doing so he would certainly not be backing up this amendment of Deputy Hewat's which would preclude every one of these people except one from going on to this present Board. I think that Deputy Redmond ought to read the Experts' report, or at least the three pages of it which deal with organisation. If he were to do that, I think he would review his opinion of the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Redmond also says that I have not given any idea of the type of men who would go on the Board.  I went through a series of people here.  I took two types of engineers that may not go on the Board immediately.  One cannot go on immediately, because there will be nobody in charge of the transmission system until the system is built out.  But that engineer would undoubtedly have the right to be considered for a place on the Board eventually. So would the engineer in charge of the Ardnacrusha station.  I spoke of a variety of people, such as accountants, men with a proper conscientious point of view about the handling of public money, a sales specialist, and a man who would be capable of dealing with landowners.  I could go through a variety of other people.  My difficulty is to get them all narrowed down to fit into a Board of six&mdash;the <Col N="589" /> number of specialists I should like to see on the Board.  But I am not going to get any help from this amendment. If I were going to be so completely unsound as to pick a Board hopeless for this purpose, I could do it under the terms of the amendment.  The only thing the amendment will prevent my doing is picking effective or ineffective people, say, from those interested in farming or farming interests, from those who are interested in accountancy and accounting practice and experience and various other types. Eventually it may be found there is a necessity to put a lawyer on the Board and I would be prohibited from putting him on if the amendment were carried. The amendment means nothing except in a negative way.  It says that there are a considerable number of people whom you shall not consider, and as to what you can consider, really, if I or any Minister is likely to put hopeless or ineffective people on the Board he can do it under the terms of the amendment, which is useless.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a believer in such restrictions as are sought to be imposed by the amendment.  I agree with the Minister that if he or the Government wished they could drive a coach-and-four through any such amendment.  I gather from what has been said that the proposers of the amendment are not very keen on putting it forward in this form, and I rise to make a suggestion.  I think the idea at the back of their minds would be met possibly by the inserting of some such words as these in sub-section (4) &mdash;I do not press the suggestion strongly for the reason I have mentioned, but I think it is worthy of consideration by the Minister:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The members of the Board shall be appointed by the Executive Council, having due regard to their expert knowledge, engineering qualifications, or practical experience.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If some such words were put in, I think they would be a help to the Minister, as I do not envy him his job of selecting this Board.  I do not think the words give any great strength to the sub-section, but I do not think they <Col N="590" /> are open to objection, and I think they would, to a certain extent, meet the idea at the back of the minds of the proposers of the amendment.</P>

      <P>As far as I can gather, Section 18 shows what are the general duties of the Board.  Among those duties will be to produce and generate electricity; to control manage and maintain in good repair and condition and working order every part of the Shannon works; to distribute, utilise and sell electricity; to control, co-ordinate, and improve it, and generally to perform and exercise the duties and powers which are imposed on the Board by this Act.  I presume that this Board which is now being set up is the Board of Directors referred to by the Experts in their report.</P>

That there shall be some qualification, other than ordinary general business qualification, for members of the Board, I take it is the general purport of the amendment, and if the Minister would signify his willingness to consider that, I do not know what attitude Deputy Hewat would adopt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me be quite clear about this Board.  The Experts talked of a Board to consider two different problems; the direction of the constructional works during the building period and the permanent administration of the plant and power supply, including successive extensions.  I came before the House in 1925 with a Bill which allowed me to set up an organisation within my own Department to construct the Shannon works, and Deputy Redmond voted for it.  If there was anything made quite clear then it was that the House was determined that in no way would there slip into that construction Bill anything dealing with supply.  Deputy Thrift moved a long amendment, and I think Deputy Cooper supported him, which I finally met him on.  I think Deputy Johnson also supported him on that point.  Eventually one section was reconstructed so that nothing in the way of supply was dealt with under the first Bill.  But quite clearly there was dealt with in the first Bill the whole idea of construction, and the words Deputy Redmond quoted from page 91 had reference to the construction activities of the Board, which the Experts had thought might be one and the same Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister say that there is no reference to supply?  What about the words &ldquo;the sale of current&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy again has not understood.  Will the Deputy take this from me&mdash;that the Experts have clearly stated that they saw two different problems, and they thought that from the very beginning one and the same organisation might be given charge of both those duties. Having said that, they went on to point out certain things with regard to the Board thus organised for the two different duties, and they say that having regard to the fact that the organisation will not itself carry out the construction work (thus emphasising that side of it) but mainly supervise it, the layman may easily underestimate its duties.  Then they laid down certain things.  Will the Deputy try to make <Col N="592" /> out that the engineering part, the mechanical part, and the electrical part have reference mainly to construction, and will the Deputy also remember that this House assisted me unanimously&mdash;there was a division on one section of the Bill, only on a small point&mdash;in the main principle of the Bill, to set up a Board to deal with construction and to deal with it as it has dealt with it for the last couple of years. We are now only dealing with the supply side, and nothing contained in Section 18 has in any way countered what I said.</P>
      <P>Deputy Thrift has made a suggestion that we might insert a provision to have regard to certain qualifications that he stated.  I do not mind that being put in as long as the points to which the Executive Council are to have regard are set out in a long series. It is not that the Deputy has forgotten it, as he did not pretend to exhaust it, but he did not deal with the item that I think is most essential.  I might take many Deputies here, but I will take Deputy Johnson as an example, because he happens to be absent.  If I could get someone with Deputy Johnson's particular outlook on the handling of public money&mdash;if he was not so useful a man to have here&mdash;I would put him as the first man on the Board, simply by reason of the fact that he has a particular outlook and a conscientious point of view as to how public money should be handled.  There are many other members that I might mention, but I take Deputy Johnson simply because he happens to be absent.  That is one of the points that Deputy Thrift has not put in.  One will have to have regard to that particular kind of thing. I am afraid that when Deputy Thrift sits down to determine the number of things to which regard may be had in appointing this Board, he will find in the end that they are so numerous that it really does not amount to anything. If he can have such a list prepared, I will consider it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has dealt very exhaustively with his subject and presented his difficulties, which we all recognise.  When these difficulties are boiled down they disclose an unsatisfactory state of affairs. Whether at a later stage the suggestion of Deputy Thrift can be embodied in an amendment and accepted by the Minister remains to be seen.  At all events, I do not think it is satisfactory to anybody to have a Bill of this importance going through the House which is indefinite even as regards an expression of opinion by the Minister as to who is to be appointed to the Board. I put forward the amendment in the honest belief that the Board should have on it a certain number of men with certain definite experience.  I have a hesitation of course, in the matter, recognising as I do that the Minister is an eminently capable man, and that the House might look with the greatest confidence to the appointments he would make.  But the Minister is only dragging a red herring across the track when he analyses the qualifications I have put down in my amendment.  He does not get over the difficulty by brushing away my suggestion, because he has no suggestion of his own to meet the case.  I ask the House to recognise that in appointing the Board there should be some general outlook as to what class of people are to constitute it.  I think it has been manifested in this House on various occasions and you, sir, even have said it on one occasion, that if the Government <Col N="594" /> is strong enough they can do anything they like.  I think you, sir, at one time said that even if they were out of order they could over-rule the Ceann Comhairle.  I would not like that sort of spirit to grow up in this House.  It might be a dangerous spirit in view of the coming elections and the general outlook for the future.  Of course, there would be no use in pressing my amendment after the discussion that has taken place, but I would ask the Minister on some stage of the Bill to give us the inner working of his mind.  I can hardly believe that the Minister has not formulated some ideas as to this Board.  At all events, if he has not done so up to the present, I hope it will be done before the Bill leaves this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a point which was under discussion, and so far as one can say there has been a decision in a matter so fluid as this is, the decision was rather in favour of having fixed salaries.  There was an idea of having, say, for the member of the Board who would be in charge of sales, payment by a bonus on sales rising year by year, but the difficulty there would be to determine on what line one would start at the beginning, it being essential that a very big increase in consumption is necessary in order to make the scheme remunerative.  In the end there was no decision at all in the direction of paying fixed salaries.  As to the amount of the salaries, obviously that cannot be determined until one has made a prior determination as to the number to go on the Board, because if there are going to be, say, three fulltime members these will have to be paid at a higher rate, seeing the responsibility that will be imposed on them, than if there was a Board of seven.  Also you might have certain full-time and certain part-time members. It will really be determined by the consideration of the personnel.  But I think that has to be left rather fluid. I am afraid I am not in a position to give that information to the Deputy at this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Will there be any opportunity of discussing this at a later stage?  It is rather an important matter because, though the Minister found fault with me for saying that we were setting up a Board for all time, I think <Col N="597" /> we ought not to overlook the point in Section 2: &ldquo;The Board shall be a body corporate having perpetual succession.&rdquo; That looks very much as if we are setting up a Board for all time. In view of the fact that we are setting up a Board that will, at all events, have existence for a considerable number of years, it is desirable that the question of the salaries attaching to the members of that Board should be discussed at some stage.  If the Minister has not crystallised his views in order to give us any information at this stage, I think it should be done at a later stage. seeing that whatever is fixed by the Minister will probably have to continue for an indefinite period.</P>

      <P>Obviously I cannot proceed even to think of individuals for the Board until such time as this section shall pass the Committee Stage in the Seanad.  That is a good way off.  There would be no question of trying to decide as between two and seven, that is, the minimum and the maximum that may be appointed, until then.  One might say that the smaller the Board the better paid they should be.  But it will depend on the particular persons we decide on in connection with the Board.  And when one has thought of names and has decided that three or four, say, can handle this particular matter successfully, then the salaries will have to be fixed accordingly.  If there were six and the duties divided <Col N="598" /> relative to each of them, necessarily the salaries would be smaller.  Also one will have to take into consideration definite individuals, the kind of posts they are in at the moment, and what you will be asking them to give up for a five years post of this kind, from which they will be liable to be thrown out after a year or two, on a motion made in this House.  All these things will have to be taken into consideration, and they will be under consideration actually until at least this section has passed the Seanad.</P>

      <P>What I wanted to be sure of was that the matter would be discussed on some stage.  We will not be appointing a temporary Board, but a Board that will have a permanent existence, and we will be establishing a precedent that will have to be followed by our successors in making appointments. Therefore, it is desirable that we should discuss this precedent. Of course, the Minister is quite right in what he says with regard to the difficulty of fixing salaries at the moment. There is a way in which the difficulty which is present to his mind is met in other cases, which he may be aware of.  In the case of a Board of Directors, sometimes a sum paid to the Board as a whole is fixed, and the individual division of it is left to the Board itself.  Even in that way we could in some manner fix the salaries in this case, and in fixing them, of course, we could discuss it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">

      <P>The members of the Board will not be paid out of public funds directly, but out of funds at the disposal of the Board. Therefore the salaries will not appear on the Estimates, and the only way in which the matter will arise when this Bill has been passed into law, is when the Executive Council has made the appointments and has fixed the salaries. The question might then arise, by way of criticism of an act of the Executive Council, but the appointments will then have been made and the salaries fixed. If Deputy Good is seeking for an opportunity to discuss the salaries before they have been fixed I do not see how that would arise under normal circumstances.</P>

      <P>There was another point on Section 2 about which we had a discussion on Second Reading, and about which I do not think the Minister was then very strong.  I certainly was not.  I have been thinking a good deal about it in the interval, but I came to the conclusion that I would not put down an amendment. It is with reference to whether the appointment was to be for five years or was to be permanent.  As the Minister said, there is a great deal to be said for either point of view.  I would like to know if he has crystallised his point of view, or if he is still somewhat uncertain.  It occurred to me that the best alternative would, perhaps, be seven years, with power of reappointment. Five years would be, perhaps, too short.  I am inclined to think that a temporary appointment, <Col N="600" /> with power of reappointment, is the best solution, and therefore I did not put down an amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difficulty about setting down any term at all.  The difficulty is this, that this Board is likely to be appointed in June of this year if the measure passes. That would mean that its five years' period would end in 1932, which is the year in which the scheme should begin to pay its way.  The difficulty then would be that the Board, which would have done all the hard work and must have done it successfully, might be left to go out at a very critical period and might be succeeded by others.  There was an idea at one time of setting the term of the first Board at least two years beyond the date at which the scheme should become remunerative; in other words, not merely to give them the spade work of the difficult years but to give them two years beyond that.  But on the whole we decided that it was best to have five years, with the right of reappointment after five years, and, obviously, any Government facing a change of personnel on the question of reappointment, will have to take into consideration the tremendous difficulties that will have confronted the first Board. If an amendment were set down on the next stage so that we could have a discussion and have different periods of appointment criticised, I would not mind.  I think that there should be a longer term for the first Board, which will have peculiar and special circumstances to deal with and that thereafter they should be for five years, subject to the right of reappointment. There is something to be said for giving this Board a longer term than five years, because that period happens to coincide with the end of the period in which it is agreed that the Shannon will not be remunerative.</P>

      <P>It is an extremely wide provision.  It will exclude a large number of people from membership of the Oireachtas.  Is any ordinary workman engaged in the service of the Board excluded from membership of the Oireachtas because he happens to be in such service?  If so it seems an extraordinarily wide disqualification and will cover a very large number of persons.  There does not seem to be to my mind the same necessity for this extension as in the case of civil servants or the case of servants of local authorities because the Board is more or less in the position of a railway company.  One might as well propose to exclude railwaymen as to exclude all the servants of the Board no matter what grade they are.  I agree to members of the Board being excluded but to go to the extent of disqualifying all servants of the Board is to go too far with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Connell on the necessity for <Col N="602" /> some definition.  I anticipated that he would raise this objection because it raised itself in my own mind when I was drafting the amendment.  I think there is general agreement in all quarters of the House that this Board should be kept out of politics.  When I came to look at it, there did not seem to be very much difference between the position of a member of the Board and say the general manager or chief engineer.  It would be equally impossible to keep the Board out of politics if the general manager or the chief engineer had a seat in the Dáil and I found it impossible to frame a definition that would exclude the general manager or the chief engineer and at the same time not exclude the more humble employees of the Board.  I am inclined to agree with Deputy O'Connell that there is no objection in principle to any servant of the Board who is going about for the Board canvassing people to take electric light, or a man who is working as a linesman from becoming a member of the Dáil. If it is possible to frame a definition I should be happy to do it but I do not think there is any specific distinction between an officer and a servant.  I, for one, should shrink from the invidious task of attempting to do so.</P>
      <P>If the Minister adopts, as he has undertaken, this section in principle, I would not oppose the introduction of a differentiation if he is able to make it, that would enable the more humble employees of the Board to be eligible for membership of the Oireachtas.  I would point out, however, that even if we take this provision as it now stands in my amendment, there is nobody in the employment of the Board at present, and everybody who undertakes this employment does so with his eyes open, knowing the disqualification which attaches to it.  If he wishes to stand for election he can always resign his employment if he thinks he has a sufficient chance of getting in and if he has sufficient faith in its prospect. However, I am not stressing that point.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture if he is aware that the R.A. Knox estate, in the Parish of Aghamore, County Mayo, was purchased by the Irish Land Commission over twenty-one years ago; that the lands are not yet <Col N="499" /> vested, and that the tenants are still paying interest in lieu of rent instead of annuities; if he will state when the lands will be vested, and if a refund will be made to the tenants of the moneys paid in excess of annuities during the past twenty-one years, and what steps, if any, are being taken to provide economic holdings for the tenants whose valuations are from £1 10s. to £6 on that estate.</P>

      <P>The estate was purchased by the (late) Congested Districts Board in 1908.  There are some fifty unsold tenants on the Aghamore section with holdings mostly intermixed and all, except six, under £6 Poor Law Valuation.  Up to the present neither the Board nor the Land Commission have been able to provide enlargements for them, but every effort will be made to do so when the opportunity offers.  All these tenants are now getting reduction of 25 per cent. off their rents and were allowed the usual abatements by the late Board.  The Land Commission are not prepared to make any refunds.</P>
