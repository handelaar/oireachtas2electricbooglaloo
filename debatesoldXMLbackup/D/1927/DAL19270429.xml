      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state what is the cause of the delay in paying unemployment insurance benefit to Mr. Victor McConnell, 76 Mount Pleasant Buildings, Ranelagh, Dublin, who has been attending at the local employment exchange for the past six weeks, but has received no benefit.</P>

      <P>On a claim to unemployment insurance benefit made on the 21st March last by Victor McConnell, of 76 Mount Pleasant Buildings, Ranelagh, a question arose as to whether certain contributions paid for the applicant were properly payable under the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  The necessary inquiries having been completed, the claim has been authorised for 26 weeks' benefit, the maximum amount payable in the benefit year, and payment of all benefit due so far is being made to-day.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he is aware that the following ex-members of the Railway Protection, Repair and Maintenance Corps (Class 1), namely:&mdash;Edward Farrell, James Brennan, Patrick O'Neill, Patrick Murphy, and Thomas Nolan, all of Inchicore, Dublin, claim that, before attesting, they agreed to work on the trade union conditions of milesmen, namely, 8/4 per day, this agreement being made by the Commanding Officer and an official of the <Col N="1876" /> N.U.R.; that their discharges show them to have been paid at a daily rate; and if, in view of these circumstances, he will reconsider their applications for arrears of pay in respect of Sunday work.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for DEFENCE (Mr. Hughes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the claim of the men referred to by the Deputy.  As indicated in my reply to Deputy Doyle on the 25th February last, their agreement provided for a weekly rate of pay. In arriving at this weekly rate, account was taken of Sunday duty and of overtime rates and, on the other side, of the value of rations and accommodation supplied as well as clothing.</P>
      <P>On discharge such members of the Corps as were entitled to a gratuity received a payment calculated on the basis of four weeks' pay and, in addition, 28 days' ration allowance.  As far as pay was concerned, there was no question of awarding the gratuity on the basis of a daily rate.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances their applications for arrears of pay in respect of Sunday work, where performed, cannot be considered.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the discharge papers of these men show they were entitled to so many days' service and so many days' pay? Their papers distinctly state they were employed on a daily rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>The discharge paper that was then in existence was found to contain an error and it was scrapped. The result was that these men, some of them, did get paid at the daily rate of 8/4, but when it was found they were paid in error the money was recovered from them in all cases, and it was paid back by any of them who got it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. NAGLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware there was a misstatement in his reply to Deputy Doyle on the 25th February when he mentioned that payment was not discontinued?  The fact that the Minister has admitted they were paid <Col N="1877" /> at a daily rate, that an error was found, and the matter was then corrected proves that payment was discontinued. They were paid for seven days during the first two weeks.  The Minister's answer to Deputy Doyle was that payment was not discontinued.  You have now stated it was discontinued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>These men were taken on as soldiers, and no soldier is paid for six days; he is paid for seven days each week.  If the contention is that these men were not soldiers, then the case might be different; but they were soldiers, and there is no doubt about the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>Colonel Russell was in charge of the Corps when the change was made.  If a mistake had been made in the first instance it was, not, apparently, noticed, because the men continued to be paid on a daily rate.  The men have actually paid back any money they were not entitled to.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture whether his attention has been called to complaints that creamery staffs made redundant by the creamery purchase scheme have already been dismissed or are under notice, whether he has made any arrangement for their re-employment in neighbouring creameries, or, failing re-employment, that compensation for loss of employment shall be awarded.</P>

      <P>None of the staff of the redundant creameries has been disemployed.  As a necessary consequence of the going into liquidation of the Condensed Milk Company of Ireland (1924), Ltd., on the 16th instant the entire staff had to be notified of the termination of their employment, but the liquidators propose to re-engage the entire staff, at all events for the present.  Every-effort will be made to secure employment for those of the staff whose services will ultimately not be required, <Col N="1879" /> but of course a guarantee cannot be given.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3), line 48, to delete the word &ldquo;eight&rdquo; and substitute therefor the word &ldquo;nine.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not think I need detain the House with any very long arguments in favour of this alteration, which was referred to on the occasion of the Second Reading.  The general feeling amongst those who have any experience of electioneering is that eight o'clock at night is a very unsuitable hour for the closing of the poll and a good many people have been deprived of the opportunity of recording their votes owing to their occupations during the day.  I believe that the addition of this hour in the evening will have the effect, in a good many cases, of increasing the number who will poll.</P>

    <Col N="1880" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I had an amendment down to the same effect.  I say frankly I would prefer that the hour during the summer period should be ten o'clock rather than nine o'clock. We know, as a matter of fact, and of practice, that while the official hour may be ten o'clock the nominal hour is nine o'clock.  The actual time in the public mind in many parts of the country still is the normal time.  While I hope the Minister will agree to this amendment to make nine o'clock the hour of closing all over the country, I would like him to consider, before the Bill becomes law, the advisability of making the hour ten o'clock in rural areas if the election takes place during the period of summer time.  It is well known, I think, to those who have had experience of electioneering in the country, especially in the summer months and more especially in the time of the hay harvest, that there will be large numbers of men unable to get into town or to get any distance away from their work before nightfall.  During the June period, the official hour of nine o'clock is too early to allow of the work to be finished and the votes to be cast. While I am strongly supporting the amendment in favour of nine as against eight for the country as a whole, I make the plea that it should be normal time of nine o'clock when the election occurs during the summer period and for the official purposes in the summer time period in the country, at least, the hour should be altered to ten.  I think if the desire is, as has been expressed, that there should be the largest possible poll then we ought to make this provision, which would more likely ensure a more heavy poll than would be the case if the work prevents men exercising the franchise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting this amendment, I want to say that I think when we consider conditions in this country, and agricultural conditions particularly, and when one knows the outlook of the ordinary farmer in the matter of going to vote, we must recognise that the case for having the hour extended to nine o'clock is very <Col N="1881" /> strong, and that, in fact the closing hour of the poll should not be earlier the than nine o'clock.  If it were eight o'clock, the question arises whether very many of the people in the country areas will go to vote at all.  They are at present carrying on their work according to sun time, and because of their conditions they have no alternative.  They cannot make hay according to the clock, but rather the way the sun moves.  If the farmer does not go to vote before he starts his day's work he is reluctant to break up his day and go to the polling station.  If he visits the polling booth early in the day he is rather loth to go back to the fields then.  On that account, undoubtedly, if we want to have the biggest possible vote recorded, we must do everything that is sensible to facilitate the people in going to the poll.  I hope there will not be any reason for the Minister's refusal to accept this amendment.  It is absolutely essential in justice to the people who are to select those who are to represent them for the coming five years.  In our legislation we should do all we can to facilitate the electors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson has suggested that we should have two hours&mdash;one the hour of ten o'clock for the rural districts, and nine o'clock for the municipal areas.  If we take his own constituency, it comprises both municipal and rural districts, and I do not know what his solution for that problem would be.  But I can see very considerable difficulty all over the country if such a proposal were adopted.  Whatever hour we fix on should be a uniform hour all over the country.  When speaking on this question on the Second Reading of this Bill, I was rather anxious that instead of starting at nine o'clock, for the reasons I then put forward, we should revert to the old arrangement of eight o'clock to eight o'clock.  If the Dáil in its wisdom thinks it is better to open at nine o'clock and close at nine o'clock I would not object to that.  but I would object to any later hour than nine o'clock.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <Col N="1882" /> As regards Deputy Good's queries, our reason for changing the hour to nine o'clock in the morning is that our experience has been that there is no voting before nine o'clock, and we did not feel justified in keeping the booths open during a period when there is practically no voting done.  I think that Deputy Good has answered Deputy Johnson's point about making a different hour for polling in country and in urban areas.  No doubt, under the new time the farmer is at a disadvantage in having the booths closed at an early hour.  On the other hand, we must remember that in the country districts there are not the same facilities for collecting the ballot boxes.  Often you have only one car for collecting the boxes in quite a wide area, and, accordingly, it may take several hours to bring in all the boxes from all over the country.  It is very desirable that the boxes should be brought in as soon as possible after the voting.  It should be done, if at all possible, during daylight. In any case.  it is hardly fair to the presiding officers to keep them several hours in the night waiting for their boxes to be collected.  I think, however, there is a good case for extending the hour from eight to nine, and, accordingly, I accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 5, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;On each nomination paper shall be provided a space in which shall be inserted any further designation or description of the nominated person, which shall be considered by the Returning Officer as necessary for the purpose of facilitating identification. by the voters and it shall be the duty of the Returning Officer to see that each nominated person has some such designation or description on his nomination paper and that such designation or description is placed on the <Col N="1883" /> ballot paper following the name of each candidate for election.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment arises out of the statement I made the other day on the Second Reading of this Bill.  I am not sure that the amendment is so drafted that it covers my intentions, but it will give an opportunity of discussing the idea I have in mind. As the Dáil knows, the government of this country is conducted through means of parties.  The fiction is that it is not so conducted, and that this Parliament is a collection of individuals, each of whom gives his own ideas regarding any question which comes before the Dáil.  That is not so.</P>
    <P>I think we should have in our electoral laws recognition of the fact that the government of this country is by parties, and not by individuals.  The intention of the amendment is to make a beginning in some way in that direction. It is also intended to fulfil another purpose.  Nowadays, under the system of proportional representation, we will always have an election, as it is not possible for a candidate to be returned at a general election without a contest.  It seems probable that in many of the elections which are about to take place there will be a large number of candidates.  Very often there is considerable confusion in regard to candidates.  You find a duplication of names, and the voters are often much confused when they come to record their votes.</P>
    <P>Many old and elderly people, who are not accustomed to deal with names or figures, get confused, especially in places where they are hustled about, and frequently do not record their votes in accordance with their ideas. That fact is evident to anyone who is present at the counting of votes.  One often notices a curious combination of votes.  One could not believe that voters have any consistency in their political ideas, judging by the combination of their preferences.  The intention of this amendment is that after each name will be marked distinctly the name of the party to which the candidate belongs.  The voters will then be sure that they are voting for, at least, the party, if not for the man, <Col N="1884" /> they want to support.  I cannot see any great obstacle to the acceptance of the amendment, which appears to me to be a sensible one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major BRYAN COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been deceived in Deputy Heffernan for four years.  I was always under the impression that he was speaking his own ideas&mdash;some of them very remark able.  Now I am afraid he has been speaking the collective wisdom of the Farmers' Party and that Deputy Conlan, Deputy Baxter, Deputy Wilson, Deputy Gorey and other Farmer Deputies have all been skinned to provide speeches for Deputy Heffernan.  I do not think that the proposal contained in the amendment is practicable and I do not see any advantage in it.  I do not think that voters are as weak-minded as Deputy Heffernan thinks.  If they cannot distinguish candidates by their names they will have their occupations and addresses given on the nomination paper.  There may, for instance, be two candidates, say, James Kelly of Market Street and James Kelly of Knockmee Hall.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I think it would be better to persuade the other James Kelly to withdraw.  Deputy Heffernan suggests that the name of the party should be given after the candidate's name.  Who is going to say what party a man belongs to?  I know of one case in which there are two Labour candidates and both say that they are orthodox Labour candidates, but who is to decide?</P>

      <P>If we follow on those lines we would be adopting the system of the United States, where the various candidates are grouped under the name of their party and you simply put a cross to mark the party you are voting for.  I believe that voters have every opportunity of ascertaining who they are voting for, and I do not think that the amendment is necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the idea. behind the amendment has something to recommend it, but I am afraid that the proposition is not practicable.  If I could imagine a particular constituency where I was certain that the Farmers' Party, for instance, were sure of a majority, and if I were going forward as a candidate, I might designate myself as belonging to the Farmers' Party.  I could not imagine such a constituency, but, if I could, I might choose that method.  There is no machinery for officially recognising a party, so that I am afraid the returning officer would have to take the word of the candidate.  There is, however, a difficulty.  Notwithstanding Deputy Cooper's suggestion that the electors are fully equipped in discrimination, they may have to take a list of twenty names in a constituency returning, say, eight members, and they see two or three identical surnames, and, perhaps, Christian names; in some cases the candidates live in the same street or barony.  There is, for instance, talk of two Morrisseys going up for Tipperary and one Heffernan, and there is also some talk of two James Burkes going forward.  There are possibilities of duplicating names such as Byrne, Johnson, or Corish, but I am speaking of things announced and more or less publicly known, namely, that there are two Morrisseys in Tipperary and two James Burkes.  That fact is going to confuse many electors, and there is something behind the idea in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I do not think the amendment is sufficient to remedy the evil, I urge the Minister to give consideration to the proposition and see whether some means could not be devised, even in regard to the coming elections, whereby some distinctive emphasis may be placed upon whatever differentiates one candidate from another with the same name.  Let us say there are two candidates of the same name living in different towns of the county or in different streets of a town. If there is that difference it should be emphasised in the printed ballot paper.  That is going a very small way to meet the point of Deputy Heffernan, <Col N="1886" /> but I do not think the amendment in its present form is practicable, and it would require a very much bigger alteration in the electoral law than this amendment foresees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment if not exactly in words, at least, in principle.  If Deputy Johnson could draft something that would cover the situation more satisfactorily than Deputy Heffernan's suggestion, we would consider it, but undoubtedly something has to be done.  If we have any duty to the electorate it is to afford voters all possible facilities for recording their votes for the people for whom they want to vote.  Already we have had instances in many constituencies in which voters have gone to the poll and recorded their votes for candidates other than those they wanted to support.  We had in my constituency during the last general election the very unusual situation of having two Coles as candidates.  Their Christian names were different, but; without saying anything derogatory of either of the candidates, many electors were puzzled about the Christian names, and they did not know one from the other.  I have no doubt that numbers, perhaps running into a couple of hundreds, of illiterate voters in that constituency recorded their votes incorrectly, and not in accordance with their intentions.  I have reason to know it.  I met voters who made this mistake, and I heard both candidates claiming that the other fellow got votes that should not have been his.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a by-election in the same constituency since then we had the position of having a farmer candidate, who was supported by me, and we had the voters declaring that they were going to vote for Baxter.  The peculiar position was that the Republican candidate on that occasion was also named Baxter, and the voters who wanted to vote for the farmers' candidate did the other thing when they declared that they wanted to vote for Baxter.  Where confusion of that kind can exist, it is necessary that we should do something to enable voters to discriminate between the candidates where they are in the position of not knowing the Christian names of such candidates. <Col N="1887" /> I am sure that there arc many voters who would not be able to tell the Christian names of Deputies here, even where such Deputies have been a good deal in the public eye.</P>
    <P>I think we are not fair to the electorate if we produce a ballot paper which is not sufficient to enable voters to identify candidates.  Whether Deputy Heffernan's amendment meets the position or not is more than I can say, but I maintain that it is not sufficient for the ballot paper merely to contain the names of the candidates.  These names are often read out by the returning officer rather indistinctly and in a manner not conducive to enable the voter to ascertain clearly who the candidates are.  Knowing that that is the position, I think it is our duty to rectify the mistakes that have been occurring up to the present.  If Deputy Heffernan's suggestion does not meet the case, I think the Minister, if he is prepared to accept the principle of the amendment, should say that he will put forward something that will meet it.</P>

      <P>As regards the printing of the names on the ballot paper, I just want to say that in the case referred to by Deputy Johnson it is only by the address that you can distinguish between candidates of similar names.  I think there should be some other way of making the position clear, especially to illiterate voters.  One thing struck me which, I think, deserves a little attention, and it is in connection with the display of a ballot paper in a case where the number of candidates may, perhaps, reach twenty.  In some cases leaded type is used and there is a good display, but in most cases more attention should be given to that matter.  If the surnames and Christian names were displayed in larger type I think it would be a great advantage, especially when it is remembered that in many polling booths the light is very bad, a fact which adds to the difficulty of. ascertaining the names of the candidates whom voters wish to support.</P>

      <P>So far as Deputy Heffernan's amendment is directed towards having the party to which the candidate belongs designated on the <Col N="1888" /> ballot paper, I think he has been effectively answered by Deputy Cooper and Deputy Johnson.  It would be absolutely impossible to put the proposal into effect in practice.  You might draft some form of words that would look all right on paper, but when you come to work it out it would be impracticable. So far as the proposal is directed towards eliminating any possibility of confusion, which would be likely to result from similarity of names, that has been covered in the Electoral Act. It is only a question of administering the Act properly to get over that difficulty. I might call Deputy Heffernan's attention to Rule 4 in the Fifth Schedule to the Electoral Act, 1923, which is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Each candidate shall be described in the nomination paper in such manner as in the opinion of the returning officer is calculated to identify such candidate.  The description shall include his name, his abode and his rank, profession or calling.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Rule 20 in the same schedule provides that every ballot paper shall contain a list of the candidates described as in their respective nomination papers.  The specified directions given as to printing ballot papers are as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;When the surnames and the first of the Christian names of two or more candidates are the same there shall also be printed in large characters so much of the description of each of such candidates as appearing in their nomination papers, whether rank.  profession, occupation or abode, as will, in the opinion of the returning officer, effectively distinguish such candidates. Of course where there are no identical names the surname is printed in large characters, and the full name, address and description are printed in small characters.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly I think Deputy Heffernan will sec that his amendment is already included in the present electoral law.  It is open to the returning officer to decide whether the abode of the candidate or his profession or calling would be the best means of designating him.  In some parts of the country a man is better known by his trade or calling.  He may be an auctioneer or solicitor, and he may be better <Col N="1889" /> known as such.  In other cases he is better known by his residence.  It is for the returning officer to see to that and where the names are similar the calling, occupation or trade, or whatever is likely to describe each candidate properly to the average voter that description will appear in large type after his name on the paper, so I think the amendment is already covered in the electoral law.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise a point with regard to the specimen ballot paper.  A specimen ballot paper was provided in which the name of Wilson was taken in vain, but I would not object if the figure No. 1 appeared opposite it.  Over each polling booth there was a specimen ballot paper with the name of Wilson marked No. 6.  I think that the Minister for Local Government ought to remove my name or else change the figure appearing beside it to No. 1.  A specimen ballot paper printed by the Government for the guidance of the electorate should not contain the name of a candidate for that constituency.</P>

      <P>I will not press the amendment at this stage, as I recognise that in its present format does not quite fulfil the intention I had in mind, but there is an idea inherent in it which is not properly carried out in practice in the electoral law the Minister quoted.  I hope the effect of the amendment will be that the returning officers will take special pains to have some form of specific identification on the ballot paper.  I am not surprised that Deputy Cooper took the line he did, for he may safely assume that there will not be a second Bryan Cooper on the paper.  In my constituency I am not at all sure that there will not be another Heffernan or two, and, judging by the number of those who ambition to become candidates, I would not be surprised if every principal name in the constituency were not <Col N="1890" /> represented on the ballot paper.  I would suggest to the Minister, although perhaps in my case it is a two-edged weapon, that candidates should be required to designate themselves by their customary designation.  We find that men who are prominently known as O'Briens become anglicised when their names appear on the ballot paper and they become plain Briens, without the O.  I suggest that the candidate be required to use his customary designation, the one by which he is known in the country.  I ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</P>

The indication of the townlands in which they live will be of no use because not five per cent. of the people going to the poll will know the townlands.  That, undoubtedly, is a factor that will present some difficulty, and unless the Minister does something in the way of giving instructions to the returning officers to have the names appear on the ballot paper in such a way that the voters will, without difficulty, be able to identify the candidates, justice, I am afraid, will not be done to some of them.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 6 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Principal Act, it shall be the duty of the Minister through the local authorities or otherwise in each Parliamentary division to send to each elector on the register of electors for members of the Dáil in that Division, his or her number on the register with particulars of the place where he or she will record his or her vote; such information shall be forwarded. so as to reach each elector at least two days before any election.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the amendment is that the Minister will supply to each elector in each parliamentary division his or her number on the register.  The reason I put forward the amendment now is that, owing to the very short period that will intervene between the publication of the new register and the date of the elections, there is bound to be a good deal of confusion.  I understand that the new register will be issued on the 1st June.  The practice has been fairly universally adopted by candidates to send poll cards to each elector.  The preparation of these cards, in some constituencies, is a matter of some difficulty; for instance, take my own constituency, where you have something like 100,000 electors.  The preparation of the poll cards, including the numbers, will probably take four or five days, and these will be posted two days before the elections.  When you multiply the one hundred thousand electors by the eighteen or twenty candidates going forward you can realise the magnitude of the obligation imposed on the postal authorities.  It is necessary and desirable that these poll cards should reach the electors before the election.  I do not know whether it would be desirable that this provision <Col N="1892" /> should remain permanently, but for the coming election I think it is very desirable.  The difficulty in connection with the postal arrangements could be got over by the Minister sending out one card.  If the Minister were to undertake to do that, I am sure that the candidates in all the constituencies would leave the furnishing of the numbers to him.  The result would be that all this congestion that I have spoken of would be avoided.</P>

      <P>I suggest that the point raised by the President might be got over by two or three lines of a clause inserted in the Bill providing that each candidate should be directed to deposit a sum of £5 towards the cost of distributing the official numbers.  I am quite satisfied that any candidate who has had experience of elections, particularly in big constituencies, would be glad to deposit that sum in order to ensure that the electors would get their proper numbers in good time. That is the suggestion I make, and I am sure every member of the House will agree with it.</P>

      <P>A point of order has been raised that this amendment imposes a charge on the public funds and is therefore out of order.  There is no Money Resolution in connection with this Bill, and therefore it is not possible by way of the Bill to impose a charge of any kind. Deputy Good's point that he has allowed a loophole is.  I think, a sound one.  The amendment says: &ldquo;It shall be the duty of the Minister, through the local authorities ... to send to each elector on the register of electors ... his or her number on the register.&rdquo; The result of that would appear <Col N="1893" /> to be that if the amendment were carried the Minister would be obliged to do that without putting any charge on the public funds.  My own view, in connection with the amendments to this Bill, is that they should be treated with the greatest leniency because of the situation we are in.  I understand they were put down from the point of view of enabling the matter to be discussed rather than as an effort to amend the Bill.  I will, therefore, allow the discussion to proceed.</P>

We would be actually passing an amendment asking the local authority to spend a certain amount of money which it has no power to spend.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>This question of poll cards is really a very old question. They were introduced when constituencies were very much smaller than they are now, when a constitunecy had only 11,000 or 12,000 electors and when Kilkenny, as the President knows, had only about 2,000 electors.  They still exist and I am afraid they are necessary. I think it was suggested on Second Reading that all one had to do was to go to the polling booth and ask the presiding officer for one's number. That might be done during the quiet periods of the day, but I should be sorry on going to a polling booth at a late hour to see a long queue of electors waiting while the presiding officer looks up a particular name and number. As it is worked at present the system is very expensive and very inconvenient. It is expensive because you have got to approach such large numbers of people and also because the law lays down the form of the card.  You cannot merely send out a card with your own name.  You have to print on <Col N="1894" /> the card the name of every candidate who is nominated.  It is inconvenient, because at any election the time allowed is comparatively short and it requires a considerable organisation to prepare and distribute these cards.  It is wasteful and expensive not only to candidates but to the country as a whole.  The last time I received six or eight cards&mdash;one from the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, one from the Labour Party, and several from the Independent candidates.</P>
      <P>What is the use of having cards addressed by each candidate to the electors? It involves posting to the same individual seven or eight cards, and it inflicts on the postal authorities a large amount of unnecessary work.  They have not time to do that work; the delivery on some occasions extends over two or three days.  It gives rise to a large amount of unnecessary work to everybody.  If the Government would take the responsibility of informing the individual voter where he is to vote, I believe it would be welcomed by everybody. I would be in favour of Deputy Byrne's suggestion&mdash;though I would not bind myself to a sum of £5; I would be in favour of contributing even a little more&mdash;that a certain amount of the candidates' deposits should be deducted in order to pay for this service. I make that suggestion with hesitation. I do not know how it would affect the Labour Party.  I do not know whether they are in the habit of sending out cards, and if they are not we do not want to make the thing more expensive for them.  If they really do send out these cards they would have to pay only a proportion of the cost instead of paying all the cost.  They would only have to pay their share in proportion to the number of candidates.  I think the matter is one that might well be considered by the Minister in the interval between now and the Report Stage with a view to bringing in a Government amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I might inform Deputy Cooper that it is not as a matter of habit that the Labour Party does these things; it is a deliberate choice and after careful calculation.  The question is, I think, important, and I believe <Col N="1895" /> it is sound to say that there should be an official notification to the individual voter of his number on the register and the place where he should poll, but merely to send out a notification on a poll card I do not think is enough. As a matter of fact, I think there is a certain danger implicit in it, if it is confined to the poll card.  In other countries the candidates are allowed a certain number of words to be printed by the State in the way of an election address.  That is sent with the notification, and I think if that were coupled with this proposition it would be quite acceptable, and the risk I fear, which I will touch upon, would not exist.  The risk I am referring to is this: If the poll cards are to be sent out officially merely as poll cards, then I am pretty certain there is going to be a further change to prevent the free distribution of the one postal packet.  If that were to be the immediate consequence I think we would be worse off than better off, but I do urge that there should be a reconsideration of this position regarding the free distribution by the State of the requirements of the voter.  The effect of it will be really to facilitate the working of the electoral machinery, and consequently it should be part of the official charge. I do not think it is possible to amend the law in this Bill or for this coming election.  It is possible, if there was the will, but it is not, I am afraid, possible to do it by the insertion of this amendment in this form without some further procedure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>The statements of the President and Deputy Johnson have more or less disposed of the amendments for this election at all events, because it is quite obvious that local authorities are not in a position to finance such a scheme at the present moment, and it would require a Money Resolution if it were to become a charge on the public funds.  This proposal, as a matter of fact, was debated for quite a long time on the Electoral Bill of 1923, and it was turned down.  We should be rather slow to reverse the considered opinion of the House on that particular occasion. I think this proposal is unnecessary. <Col N="1896" /> No matter what steps the State takes in this matter the candidates will supply this information to the electors in any case, and it would be only so much public money thrown away.  The information that it is desired to convey in this matter, as a result of this amendment, can be found in the Gárda Síochána Barracks and the Post Offices. Very elaborate precautions are taken in the way of putting up posters to inform electors where they are to vote.</P>
      <P>This question of the number is, I think, unduly stressed.  The number is not really a vital matter in elections at all.  The name and address arc very much more important.  In fact, the official instructions to presiding officers read as follows: &ldquo;It is not sufficient for you to be told the elector's number on the register.  That is how personation is carried on.  As each elector applies to you for a ballot paper, ask him his name and address.&rdquo;  As a matter of fact, I am afraid these cards would lead to personation.  The tendency would be to regard the possession of these cards as <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the person who had one was the person described on the card. I am afraid that would lead to very great abuses.  It would also be very expensive on the State, the local authority, or whoever would be charged with the responsibility of supplying these cards.  Before 1918, candidates paid the full cost of the election.  Section 2 of the Parliamentary Expenses Act, 1875, reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The returning officer shall be entitled to his reasonable charges, not exceeding the sum set out in the Act, in respect of services rendered and expenses incurred.  The amount of such charges shall be paid by the candidates at the election in equal separate shares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the State is shouldering this burden, and the cost of this election, apart from the register altogether, will be over £60,000.  I think it is unreasonable to expect the State to go any further in the way of footing the bill for candidates at the election.  If we were to agree to this proposal, probably the next proposal would be one to foot the bill for the transport of voters, for printing election literature for candidates <Col N="1897" /> and covering all expenses in connection with the election.</P>

      <P>Would it be possible to expedite delivery of the new register? I pointed out that my reason for putting down this amendment was to try to avoid confusion.  It seems certain that that will arise for the reasons I have given&mdash;the short time that elapses between the issue of the register and the day of the election.  If the Minister could give consideration to the question that I have raised, possibly the result might be that the register would be issued a week earlier.  Possibly some portions of the register might be issued more than a week earlier.  If that could be done, it would tend to prevent the congestion that is bound to arise if this pressure is put on the postal authorities.  I would be satisfied if some consideration could be given to that aspect of the question, and thus try to anticipate the difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Every possible effort is being made to meet that situation and considerable expense has been incurred in order to secure the earliest possible delivery of the register.  This recommendation is one that it would be very unwise to adopt just now.  It should be a matter for consideration after an election&mdash;not immediately before it.  It should be considered in the light of all the circumstances. It is quite apparent that the expense of contesting a very large constituency is very different from the expense of contesting a small constituency. A candidate may have to distribute 100,000 poll cards in one constituency as against 3,000 or 4,000 in another constituency like that which the Minister for Industry and Commerce represents.  Certainly, this is not the best time to consider the question and it ought not to be considered alone.  The £60,000 which the election will cost, apart from the printing of the register, is a very big item.  If Deputy Good, or any other Deputy supporting this proposal, could reasonably say that the cost to the Post Office of distributing candidates packets for the election is much greater than this would be there might be some argument, but we are <Col N="1898" /> not escaping that by adopting this. We are still leaving them the right to distribute the packets but, at the same time, we are putting upon the State this particular cost.  The Minister has certainly drawn attention to one possible abuse that might arise from this&mdash;personation.  I think there is general agreement amongst the more responsible parties in the country that personation is undesirable.  There was a genuine attempt, when the Electoral Act was introduced, to make it difficult, if not impossible, to have personation. There is no doubt there has been personation even since that law was passed.  The best means of dealing with a matter of that sort is to get a public opinion against any such wrong practice&mdash;a practice which is defeating the electorate, no matter what party it favours.  It is unquestionably a fraud on the electorate itself.  I would certainly like that greater safeguards than are provided in this amendment should be provided, in the event of such a proposal being acceptable, in order to prevent any such abuse.  After the General Election, if we have any responsibility for the administration, that will be one of the matters which will receive very careful consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Good might have strengthened his argument for an earlier publication of the register by reminding the Minister that, if the dates published in the Press are correct, the Whitsuntide holiday will intervene between the date the new register comes into force and polling day.  The register will be available on Wednesday and all the literature will have to be posted by Friday, unless special postal arrangements are made. That would involve very considerable cost, and one would require a very large staff for addressing envelopes. If the register can be made available a week or ten days earlier, the same difficulty will not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the general question, I was very glad to hear the President's concluding words, that the matter is to be dealt with after the elections.  My quarrel with the Government is that it was not dealt with immediately after the last election, when it was fresh in <Col N="1899" /> our minds.  I take it we are now to understand that if the present Government resume office, they propose to deal with the amendment of the Electoral Act and that it will be open then to Deputies to bring forward amendments based on their more recent experience.</P>

Amendment 57, which was before the Dáil yesterday, was phrased as follows: &ldquo;In page 32, lines 58 and 59, Section 62 (2) after the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to insert in each case the words &ldquo;after consultation with an authorised undertaker,&rdquo; and in lines 59 and 61 to delete the word &ldquo;an&rdquo; and substitute therefor in each case the word &ldquo;such.&rdquo; That amendment was passed without any change.  The word &ldquo;an&rdquo; appeared three times in these two lines.  In the amended Bill, it was only changed twice.  The intention was to change &ldquo;an&rdquo; in each case in which it occurred. That was not specifically mentioned. It does not make a great deal of difference even if the Bill is left, as it is, with one &ldquo;an.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In Section 39, line 48, the word &ldquo;orders&rdquo; is printed where the word should be &ldquo;order.&rdquo;  There is authority to change that, because the word in the amendment as carried was, in fact, &ldquo;order.&rdquo;  The error is, therefore, a printing or clerical error.  No amendment is required for that.</P>
      <P>On page 34, line 67, there was some ambiguity about the amendment, and, apparently, the word &ldquo;an&rdquo; was only changed in two places.  I think we would need an amendment to alter that, but it would be a purely verbal amendment.</P>
      <P>On page 40, line 24, the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; is to be inserted after the word &ldquo;for.&rdquo; An amendment will be required to make that change, because the words as they are have appeared in the Bill all the time.  Those two amendments are.  I think, both verbal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Bill ought to be allowed to pass without the Dáil being made aware, if it is possible to make it aware, of what is being done by the measure.  I propose to make a slight attempt to point out two or three of the characteristics of the Bill which, in my opinion, merit its rejection.  First of all, I want to point out that in this Bill we have refused to impose any conditions on the Board in respect to its employees.  We have refused to impose upon the Board a responsibility for paying them wages or giving them conditions of service which are in conformity with any public service standards and we have deliberately and, shall I say, of malice, imposed upon the future employees of this Board whether new employees or employees of existing undertakings to use their powers of combination to fight the Board when any case of dispute arises. We are putting no obligation upon the Board and we are making no legal limitations on any downward trend in respect to wages, salaries, or conditions of service which the Board itself may desire to impose.  That is a very grave fault in the Bill as it is passing out from the Dáil.</P>
      <P>A further fault in the Bill lies here. We have declined to consider any of the servants of the Board as civil servants and the only obligation in respect to the conditions of service in the Bill is one which is a prohibition of ordinary civic rights.  A citizen employed by any other public undertaking is not debarred by law from being nominated or being elected a member of either House of the Oireachtas, and it is with regret and surprise I notice that both of these propositions had the support of one whom I always endeavoured to class as one of the Disraelian Tory democrats, but who shows himself in this matter as having been more of a Cobdenite, anti-statist than I had ever thought before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1903" /> There is a further grave defect that I call attention to, and that is, we are passing this Bill which may become law in 270 days in the form in which it leaves this House without any prohibition against a member of the Board being an agent for commission of a supply contractor.  He may not be a shareholder.  He may not have an interest in the shares of, say, the British Thomson Houston or Siemens or any of the other big manufacturing concerns of world-wide fame, but he may be in the position of an agent for such a firm.  There is nothing in the Bill to prevent him, and the Minister has no right in the Bill to interfere.</P>
    <P>Now, on the matter of what I consider the fundamental defect, and the one which leads me to oppose the Bill strenuously, that there is no parliamentary check, the Minister has defended his position because he said he has provided for publicity and the power of the Executive Council to dismiss the Board.  That, he considered, is the effective control that the public has over the workings of this wonderful and extraordinary Board.  The publicity is to be secured by the section which provides for the keeping of the usual accounts and such accounts as may be called for by the Minister which are to be published and laid upon the Table, and certain reports in such form as the Minister may prescribe are to be made to the Minister and laid upon the Table of the Dáil and the Seanad. On the strength of that amount of publicity we are supposed to have sufficient control over the administration of this electricity monopoly to the Board.  Deputies will realise the amount of public criticism that is likely to be available.</P>
    <P>I draw attention to the position of the Great Southern Railways, and I ask Deputies to make a comparison between the position of the railway monopoly and the electricity monopoly. The railway monopoly is required to publish statistics which are to be laid upon the Table of the House, and to make returns in the form required by the Minister.  Deputies receive periodically railway statistics regarding passenger and freight traffic.  They <Col N="1904" /> are laid upon the Table, and here in this volume is the &ldquo;Annual Returns of the Railway Company&rdquo; containing the accounts of capital and revenue and receipts and expenditure, persons employed, and the general report of their operations.  These are laid upon the Table.  That is to say, the returns for 1925 are laid upon the Table in February, 1927, and public criticism of the policy of the Railways Company is to be based upon the returns submitted in this manner.  We may endeavour to raise a question in this House as to the policy of the Railways Company in respect to certain matters, but the Minister will tell us that he can only ask questions of the Railways Company, and inform the House of the reply he receives, if they deign to reply.  No criticism is possible in this House except a criticism based upon a vote of no confidence in the Ministry as a whole, which, if passed, would entail the resignation of the Ministry.  I think it is a reversal of Parliamentary practice, as we have known it, that we should, of necessity, endeavour to upset the Ministry and, consequently, the whole governmental scheme for the time being.  All the departments of industry are to be affected because we want to draw attention to a particular item of administration. That is the resource that the Minister offers to us in this Bill as an exchange for parliamentary responsibility, but the Railways Company, which provides, by statute, the returns equivalent to those required under the Bill in respect to electricity, is in a position of very much less independence than this Board will be.</P>
    <P>The Railways Company, before it raises its scale of charges, must get the permission of a Railway Tribunal. It is not free to do these things which the Electricity Board is free to do, and I would like Deputies, in the leisure hours between now and the elections, to examine this Bill, and wherever the word &ldquo;Board&rdquo; appears to read &ldquo;directors of the Railways Company.&rdquo;  They will then begin to understand the kind of power that they are handing over to the Board. For instance, take the section to which I referred last night, Section 33 <Col N="1905" /> in the new Bill&mdash;&ldquo;The directors of the Company may by order make such general regulations as they think proper relating to all or any of the following matters or things: that is to say, the making of special orders by the Board and the application to the Board for such orders.&rdquo;  It may make orders relating to the making of orders by the Board.  This board of directors of the Railways Company, if we were applying this scheme to the railway service, may make orders for the protection and safety of the Shannon works or of all transmission or distribution systems, including the imposition of penalties for the breach of such regulations and the recovery of such penalties by summary proceedings. This railway directorate may make orders for the protection of the public safety, including penalties for the breach of such regulations and the recovery of such penalties by summary proceedings.  The Minister has nothing to do with these orders; no responsible person, responsible in the sense that I have used the word, has anything to do with these orders.  The orders that have been made by this board of directors are to be laid on the Table and may be, as is admitted, revoked by a vote of each House, but anything done in the meantime by that board of directors, by this Company, by this trust, under the powers given here, shall be valid.</P>
    <P>I lay stress upon the fact that the Minister cannot defend, from the point of view of the Board, these orders, no matter what criticism may be applied. Under this scheme he is in the position exactly of the individual member of the House and may discuss the purport of the regulations of this directorate. But he has no power to go to these directors and ask them to explain why and wherefore; he has no power to investigate and to require them to report to him as to the reasons why they should do this, that, and the other.  In practice they may defer to his authority for fear that he may use his power of dismissal, but that is not enough.  It is entirely unsatisfactory. If Deputies will look through the Railways Amalgamation Act.  they will see how the Railways Company has been <Col N="1906" /> bound to have regard to the public interest in many respects.  It is not possible for the directors to extend the Company's operations in new directions without at least giving an opportunity to the public to object.  It is possible for this Board to extend its powers and authority anywhere and in any direction, without seeking the support or the assent of the public.  There is no public inquiry, and there is no reference to a Minister as representing the public; the Board may do these things without any direct responsibility.</P>
    <P>There is another example which, by way of illustration, would help Deputies to realise the position of this Board.  The Minister referred to the Post Office, and to his intention to prevent the affairs of this Board from being the subject of discussion and criticism in this House.  I think if the Minister would inquire he would find that, so far as the Post Office, or any trading or semi-trading department of State, whether in this country or in Great Britain, has fretted under the restriction of initiative, under the Governmental system, as distinct from the business system, as it is called, it is a fretting under the control of the Minister for Finance.  I do not think there has ever been an objection by any public-spirited spokesman for the Post Office service to criticism and discussion of the affairs of the Department. There has been, I know, not only in the Post Office but in other Departments' administration of business affairs, a fretting against the trend of the restriction of initiative which has been imposed by constant and necessary, as has been thought, reference to the Minister for Finance for sanction.  If we were dealing with a small thing as compared with a great, dealing with the position, let us say, of the Minister for Posts, treating him as having the powers and non-responsibility of this Board, and consider his policy in respect of broadcasting, let us say; if the Minister for Posts were to decide that the broadcasting scheme under his control was to be confined to crystal users, that he would not allow a valve set to be operated in Ireland and that his object in confining the receipt of broadcasting <Col N="1907" /> messages to crystal users was to ensure that nothing but the Gaelic language would be heard over the radio, what a cry there would be.  There is a matter of decision on policy, policy in respect of broadcasting.  There may be public criticism but it will have no effect.  All that he is required to do is produce a balance sheet at the end of the year to show that income has met expenditure.  Policy is in the hands of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs under these new conditions.  But, of course, the Executive Council might dismiss him.  This is the control that the House has in such a matter.  The House might dismiss the Executive Council for refusing to dismiss him.  The House, after weighing up the balance of advantage, may say: &ldquo;We had better maintain the Executive Council as a collective body, because we want to see a certain agricultural policy, a certain defence policy, or a certain policy in respect to trade and commerce put into effect, and we cannot afford to break up the Executive Council because of these things; therefore we are prepared to abide by this decision of policy of the Minister in respect to broadcasting.&rdquo;  That is the analogy.</P>
    <P>Let us take it a little further.  The House may say: &ldquo;Taking it as a whole, the Executive Council should be maintained; while very critical of a particular policy of a particular department, we will suffer that for the sake of the greater advantage, so we will refrain from dismissing the Executive Council.&rdquo;  I emphasise the point that we have no power under the scheme to discuss the policy of the Board except on a motion which, if accepted, means the defeat of the Executive Council.  The Executive is being put in the same position in regard to the Board of this new undertaking. The Board is a collective body having collective responsibility, and though the Ministry may think the Board is not doing exactly as it would like it to do, though it may not be running the business to their entire satisfaction from the public policy standpoint, the Ministers cannot say to one member of the Board, who, perhaps, has been deputed to look after one particular section of the work, that <Col N="1908" /> they will dismiss him, because the other members of the Board would stand by him&mdash;they are going to stand or fall together.</P>
    <P>Let us consider this question.  The Board at the beginning is being presented with this charter.  The government of the realm of electricity in Ireland is being handed to the Board. They are, let us say, experts in different departments, and they will allocate to themselves certain sections of the work. They are only guaranteed a tenure of five years.  There is no assurance of pension rights, no assurance of continued employment.  The Minister has almost specifically debarred himself from transferring the redundant civil servants that can be found to work under this Board, or become members of it.  So that the Board, having this charter, begins to make itself indispensable</P>
    <P>They retain the strings in their hands, and they say: &ldquo;We stand or fall together.&rdquo;  At the end of five years the option is put to the Minister to continue them as a collective body, or to dismiss them as a collective body.  As I say, they have the strings in their hands, and to dismiss them holus bolus means the risk of upsetting the whole scheme of the undertaking.  Ministers will hesitate long&mdash;they will do exactly as the Dáil does&mdash;before dismissing the whole of the Board for the fault of one, because the other four, if there are five, may be quite serviceable members and would desire to do the work in a fashion that the Ministers of the time might think would be the most serviceable for the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I was on the point of explaining the probable result of handing to a Board of unnamed persons this charter of government in the realm of electricity.  I was pointing out that the position of four or five men who will constitute the Board would be such as would tempt them &ldquo;to dig themselves in,&rdquo; to retain, in their own hands, the strings and, in fact, to make themselves indispensable, so that when the five years are expired it would be too delicate, and too risky, an undertaking for the Ministry of the time to exercise the power, under Section 5, to remove the Board. It may be said, &ldquo;We are just now at the critical point when we may make, or mar, the success of the undertaking if we make any change at this stage, and as this Board will stand or fall together, we cannot find five other men who will immediately take their places; they have been canny enough not to delegate their powers, and not to allow the officials to do the work that they are able to do while acting as the Board.&rdquo;  The Minister may say that this is mere imagination and the result of a suspicious mind.  It is not.  It is one of the possible results of this scheme of organisation which dissociates the Minister and the Dáil from any responsibility for the undertaking, except responsibility to make income and expenditure balance.</P>
      <P>I want to repeat what I touched upon last night regarding the control of policy.  There is no determining influence to be brought upon the Board as to what its policy in regard to electrical development shall be, except the fear that they may be dismissed by the Executive Council, if the Executive Council is satisfied that it is necessary in the interests of the effective and economic performance of the functions of the Board.  In the first place, the economic performance of the functions of the Board will be to ensure the consumption of the total potential production of the Shannon works.  If it can do that, and get an income that will cover charges, then, from the point of view of this Bill, the economic requirements are satisfied.  And the policy of this Board may be directed towards extending the number of householders who are using electricity, or it may be used towards extending the consumption of electricity for industrial purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1911" /> I can see no provision in the Bill which will prevent the Board giving special consideration to one particular industry in one particular area.  It may be a very desirable thing that such an industry should be encouraged in a particular area, but that should not be a decision of the Board.  It is not the Board that should have that decision in respect of electrical policy. But under this Bill it is the Board that has the determining voice in the matter.  I very recently had the privilege of seeing a miracle performed.  I saw two separate powders, white and brown, in large quantities mixed together and by the application of electric current I saw these two powders turned into a block of what appeared to be silver, but what was in reality aluminium.  I can conceive of the Board determining that the advantage to the enterprise might be best served by diverting the consumption of electricity into such channels as that, to the detriment perhaps of an extension of a lighting policy in a town.</P>
    <P>There may be many directions, perhaps, in which this Board will exercise its authority.  The members may be very wise and discreet in their determination of what that policy should be.  But is it sure that the Board, which shall consist of, say, four or five people, some of whom will be experts in their particular line, will be necessarily qualified to determine what will be best in the economic and social interests of the country? It is not by any means right or sensible that such a Board shall have the final say in what should be the electrical policy of the country.  Yet this Bill hands over that power to the Board and denies to the House, and denies the Minister the power to change that policy except at the price of dismissal.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, I come back to what I consider the unsatisfactory provisions respecting the audit, having in mind particularly the powers of the Board, the authority over the employees of the Board, the relation between the employees of the Board and the Board.  I consider that <Col N="1912" /> the obligation respecting accounts and the audit of accounts does not conserve the public interest in a satisfactory manner.  I cannot help but relate the Minister's attitude on this discussion respecting audit to his attitude in other matters respecting the position of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
    <P>I fear, and I am very sorry to say it, that the attitude of the Ministry as a whole in respect to financial control and financial check is not in keeping with the traditions of the public service as has been bequeathed to this State.  I think the Ministry as a whole, as is evidenced by matters that have been made public and as is evidenced by their attitude in respect of this section regarding the audit, is disquieting and should make us more rigid in the conditions we impose than would otherwise be necessary.  Taken as a whole, therefore, notwithstanding my support of the purpose and intentions of this Bill, and notwithstanding my support of the general scheme of the Bill in respect of the objects sought, and the means by which the Board is empowered to achieve the end of a widespread supply at a cheap rate of electrical power, I think that the scheme of administration giving this Board these autocratic powers in respect of the making of orders&mdash;in effect the issuing of decrees&mdash;and in respect to the audit of accounts, makes the Bill quite unacceptable, and I hope it will not be passed into law in its present form.  I hope, too, if by chance it does pass into law in its present form, that an early opportunity will be taken to alter the foundations of the scheme and to make the Board, or whoever administers it, responsible to a Minister who shall be responsible to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Some things have been said about socialism and nationalisation.  Well, the most effective argument, to my mind, that has ever been used against socialism or nationalisation lies in the case made against bureaucracy, the denial of public rights, the power to interfere unduly with the liberties of the individual and of the public, and against powers being placed in the hands of people who are not responsible. <Col N="1913" /> That is what is done in this Bill. They are great powers, powers that might justly be handed over to a responsible authority, but they are powers which should never be handed over to a Viceroy or a military governor, or an electrical supply board.  I shall, therefore, ask the House to support me in opposing the last stage of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. BYRNE Mr. A. BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have exhausted practically all the arguments I could put up against this Bill.  My arguments were mainly devoted against the Government interfering with the property of the citizens of Dublin.  No doubt, I will have no further opportunity of doing so after to-day, and therefore I desire now to enter my most emphatic protest against the action of the Government in interfering and taking from the citizens of Dublin their right to control the great electricity station, which is their property, at Pigeonhouse Road.  They have been asked to exchange that great undertaking, which has been so successful, for something the success of which we have no assurance about.</P>
      <P>After to-day, under the terms of this Bill, the citizens of Dublin will have no right whatsoever to have any say in the management of their own undertaking. It will be transferred to a Board which will not be accountable to any public representative for its actions. It takes from the citizens of Dublin what it took very many years to secure, and in regard to which many Acts of Parliament were passed that safeguarded the interests of the citizens and protected their property.  By this measure all those Acts of Parliament are being blotted out.  Under the vesting clauses of this Bill the Board may take over the undertaking, all its assets and all its funds, to manage as they think proper.  I hope&mdash;I can express the belief&mdash;that it will be managed well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my criticism of this measure I do not wish to be taken as being in any way hostile to the Shannon scheme.  I hope it will be a success.  I thought from the beginning that all that was intended by the Shannon scheme was to obtain power to supply electricity in bulk and that we would use our waterways <Col N="1914" /> and our water-power in order to save big undertakings purchasing coal, and thereby keep the money at home. That is a proposal that I am still prepared to support.  But to prevent others from making electricity or to put aside anyone who may be your opponent in the generation of electricity is not, in my opinion, reasonable.  It might be said that the Corporation electricity plant could generate and supply to the public at a cheaper rate than what you propose to charge under the Shannon scheme.  We have no guarantee that you will supply at a cheaper rate, or give as adequate a supply as the citizens of Dublin have to-day.</P>
    <P>I am tempted to repeat my case because of what I know occurred during the discussions on the Railways Act, and as a result of that Act.  Very many employees of municipal undertakings and other authorised undertakings who are engaged in generating electricity will be affected by this measure.  Power is given to dismiss them, to terminate their appointments on payment of probably very small gratuities, in some cases gratuities that will not be sufficient to cover their passage money to America.  Having got rid of these men who are at present engaged generating electricity, and are receiving fair wages, you will then, perhaps, take in new hands.  I can well imagine, knowing the conditions of unemployment in the country, and knowing how our labour exchanges are registering men in their thousands for employment, that a wage will be offered bearing some proportion to the number of men idle, and that wage will not be anything like the present wage paid for generating electricity.  By that means you may secure some form of reduction.</P>
    <P>I suggested to the Minister that he ought to make a recommendation to the Board.  He says he has no power and he will not interfere, but I think the Minister ought to make a recommendation that where men are being dismissed they ought to have priority of employment if there is similar work going under the Shannon Board.  That would obviate something similar happening to what happened on the railways. In that case, when one workshop attached to the railways closed down, <Col N="1915" /> men with reasonably long service were dismissed and their work was transferred to other departments.  They lost their employment, and some of them complained that new men were taken in afterwards to do their work. I think that is a matter that ought to get attention, and that any man who is disemployed as a result of this proposal ought to get some offer of employment from the new Board.  Again, I do not like the idea that your electricity stock should have priority over the Dublin Corporation stock, which has always been looked on as a good investment because of the value of the rates and of the property which the Corporation owns.  You are taking from it its electricity supply.  I also desire to state that I am satisfied, as a result of the profits made by the Dublin electricity undertaking for the last two years, a very substantial reduction in the price of electricity should have taken place, or should take place immediately, so that when prices are being fixed in the near future citizens cannot be told that the charges are being based on those that were being paid on 29th April, when the Bill was passed.</P>
    <P>I am informed that this year the profits, instead of being, as they were last year, £64,000, are now something nearer to £100,000.  The ratepayers of Dublin are entitled to that money by way of cheaper electricity.  It ought not be withheld from them any longer. It is their money.  I see, according to one section, that you have power to use all the assets of an undertaking that you control.  I do not like to suggest that this £100,000 will be put in reserve for other purposes.  I think it belongs to the citizens, and they are entitled to get it back.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamSears" hpid="Mr. SEARS Mr. SEARS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express the general admiration of the country for this great scheme, and I would like, also, to say that that admiration is not confined to the provinces.  It is shared very wholeheartedly by the citizens of Dublin and by the townships.  The citizens of Dublin are very sensible people, and they know very well that the great Shannon scheme, by which <Col N="1916" /> power is to be developed from water, has all the probability, if not the certainty, of supplying cheaper current than that hitherto available.  The proposition, as it presents itself to the citizens of Dublin and to the residents in the townships, may be put in this way, &ldquo;Are you willing to get your current in future with the rest of Ireland from water-developed electricity, knowing that you would, at least, get it cheaper, and probably much cheaper, or would you prefer a more restricted supply developed from imported coal?&rdquo; Dublin people would be willing to cooperate with their fellow-countrymen in the rest of Ireland, even if it meant a small sacrifice for the good of the State.</P>
      <P>Having examined the proposition, and knowing that it would be a good thing for Dublin, Rathmines and Pembroke to participate in this scheme, they are willing to do so.  If it were proposed to leave Rathmines and Pembroke out of this great scheme you would not have one meeting of protest in Rathmines and Pembroke, but you would have several such meetings night after night, demanding the reason why the citizens were omitted from this great scheme.  Undoubtedly, the one million pounds' worth of coal now imported annually need not be imported in future because of this scheme.  We need not weep over that.  Deputy A. Byrne said that there could be reductions made in the price.  Every element that makes for reduction will still remain. The present scheme will take none of those elements away.  The users of electricity in Dublin have no dread of the Shannon scheme.  They have no aversion to cheaper current.  They have no tremendous faith in the people who are making mythical profits, but, if there were such profits, why was not the sum of £22,000 owing to the ratepayers paid back?  How could any objection to the scheme be built up on the question of staff?  Every man in the Pigeonhouse fort is to be taken over. Is that a grievance?  Under this big scheme hundreds of towns that have no light will be lighted.  There is to be wiring in every town, and there will be hundreds of men employed who are now idle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1917" /> The Dublin artisan knows these facts, and he is not deluded by any false representation.  He knows that the bigger the scheme the greater employment there will be, and the user of electric light knows that where there is such a tremendous supply the price will be cheaper, and accordingly, he has no objection to the scheme.  Above all, the citizens of Dublin and the residents of Pembroke and Rathmines realise what this scheme signifies.  They see that they are going to benefit by it, and that the nation is also going to benefit.  They are not deluded by the word &ldquo;confiscation.&rdquo;  If ever there was a word misapplied, if ever a word was used in a more indefensible, more unwarranted, more unjust, more shameful, and more hypocritical way than that word &ldquo;confiscation&rdquo; in connection with this scheme, I have never heard it.  Whose rights are confiscated? Not the rights of the users of electricity, not the rights of the workmen, certainly not the rights of the nation. There has been a considerable amount of humbug and hypocrisy spoken about this Bill, but the people are not deluded by it.  They see that this scheme makes for the building up of the nation, and they are ready to support it.  If there is any scheme more than another which has given courage to the country it is this scheme.  Only men who have faith in the country could have framed it, and the people, as a whole, pay no attention to the dishonest attacks upon it and to the attempts made to belittle it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>That is possible.  I was not dealing with the motion which was carried.  The one which was carried was not adopted at my suggestion, but it is a fact that people who were never found in agreement on anything before were there and spoke in condemnation of the Bill, and they were all elected popularly by the ratepayers of Rathmines.  When Deputy Sears assumes the function of speaking for the ratepayers of Rathmines he assumes a function that does not belong to him, and he is contradicted by the facts.  We will leave it at that.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Sears gives us his own opinion we will value it and accept it as his personal opinion, but the facts I have stated are correct.  I should not have intervened in this debate, I should have been satisfied with a great deal of Deputy Johnson's statement and some of the statements by Deputy Byrne, were it not for the fact that I gather the Minister has a grievance in that I have spoken elsewhere and not given him an opportunity to reply.  I have examined my conscience as to any statement that might cause the Minister a moment's uneasiness.  I propose to repeat now the statements I made, and give the Minister the opportunity of having the last word upon them.  I could not make a fairer proposition. The first statement he may have objected to was that when he informed the meeting he had an amendment in his pocket that he thought would dispose of all opposition but could not read it, for the draughtsman had not seen it.  I advised the meeting not to buy a pig in a poke.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  That might be the Minister's grievance, that I did not ask him to read it.  What use was there in reading an amendment to people, most of whom did not possess a copy of the Bill, and were not familiar with parliamentary procedure? I saw at the meeting Deputy Good, Deputy McCullough and Deputy Leonard, but I do not think that meeting was in a proper position to judge the amendment.  I suggested that it should wait until it had received its final form, and was tabled and discussed in the Dáil, to see whether it met the views of those who object to certain provisions of the Bill.  The Minister's second grievance was founded on my statement that his speech contained certain omissions. Really, I think every speech I ever heard might have that criticism made against it, except possibly some of the speeches of Deputy Magennis.  It is a self-evident fact that there are omissions, and when I made that remark with reference to the Minister's speech I immediately followed it up. The Minister brushed the ratepayers aside.  He said: &ldquo;I am not concerned with the ratepayers.  I am only concerned with the electricity consumers.&rdquo; Surely someone should be concerned with the ratepayers as distinct from the electricity consumers?  Sometimes they are identical, but there are cases where they are not.  It is the small ratepayer, the man living in a small house who cannot afford wiring for current, who is extremely glad to get relief in rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose the natural guardian of the ratepayers in this House is the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  It is significant that though the Minister for Public Health voted that the Bill be received for final consideration he did not vote on any <Col N="1920" /> crucial amendment affecting the ratepayers. He is an extern Minister and shares no collective responsibility for the Bill, and I cannot help regretting that we had not his opinion on the subject of using an electricity undertaking for the relief of the rates.  The Minister made great play with the number of houses in Dublin&mdash;I think he said 60 per cent.&mdash;that were not consuming electric light.  Where are they?  Are they in Grafton Street, Fitzwilliam Square or Merrion Square, or are they in the poorer districts on the Northern side?  The Minister knows as well as I do that they are in the poorer districts. The Minister may believe that by reducing the price of current and allowing the Board to do the wiring and supply lamps he might bring it within the reach of these people.  Many of these people are living from hand to mouth, and they cannot afford any other light but that of a candle.  They do not want current so much as help towards the rates, a help that will keep them going.</P>
    <P>That is an angle of the Bill that has not been sufficiently considered.  It will be very beneficial to the man with a big shop who wants to keep light day and night as an advertisement, and a great advantage to the proprietors of hotels and restaurants, and in places where a constant glitter of light is necessary as an attraction to the public, but I do not believe the gain of cheaper current would benefit the man who lives in a four-roomed house by more than a few pounds a year, and if he was asked he would rather have the benefit of these few pounds in reduced rates rather than reduced light.  I am not now going into the power question. The Minister could make a stronger case on that.  If by cheap power we can establish industries, no one would be more pleased than I.  I would like, in conclusion, to assure Deputy Sears that there is no hostility to this Shannon scheme.  It does not mean hostility to the Shannon scheme, which we cordially desire to be a success, when we question some of the methods employed by the Minister in this Bill which we think will not tend to increase confidence in the Shannon scheme.</P>

      <P>I do not think so.  It might be justification for Deputy Byrne's constituents asking him why he was not in his place in the House at certain times.  He asked a further question about £100,000 being withheld from the electricity consumer. I certainly join with Deputy Byrne and ask him, where is this £100,000? If there is the sum of £100,000 and it can be given in relief to the electricity consumers, why should it not be and why is it not given at once?  I am glad to be in an alliance with Deputy Byrne on one point, that the consumer is entitled, if there has been a surplus, on the very good statements made by the Chief Electrical Engineer and by Mr. Murphy, the Town Clerk, to have it given back to him, and if it is not being given back to the electricity consumer he is being defrauded of his just rights.</P>

      <P>If the £100,000 is there, is it likely that the present rates for electricity in the city will stand as they are?  If the £100,000 is there, will it ultimately be possible to lower the rates?  Taking the flat rate to-day, can we assume that it is a higher rate than we can anticipate in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what all that means.  Deputy Byrne says that there is the sum of £100,000. If that surplus is there, then it is being withheld by someone.  I agree that it should not be held but that it should go back in cheapening the rate of electricity to the consumer.  If there is any idea that I am in any way trying to hold the money up so that the Board can come along later and find a nest egg of £100,000, I say it is not wanted. The Dublin consumer ought to get the benefits of the moneys derived here. If there is a surplus in any one year it should go back in the succeeding year.</P>
      <P>I have a grievance against Deputy Cooper.  Deputy Cooper was present at two meetings at which this matter was discussed.  I was present at one, and now he says, with regard to Deputy Sears, that Deputy Sears could have attended and spoken.  I interjected and said that he could have, after the resolution was passed.  Deputy Cooper says he is not responsible for that procedure.  I do not say that he is, but I did not hear any objection from him to that procedure on any occasion, nor did I hear any objection from him to the point of view that seemed to be in the minds of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, that they should pass a resolution without hearing the Minister responsible for the measure speaking on it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is quite sound, and, relating that back to the Rathmines resolution, it has no weight.  At any rate, there was a certain procedure adopted, and I was present at the particular meeting.  I said that speeches had been made the day before in my absence, and that I thought the best procedure to follow would be along either of two lines, (1) that I should take every statement made, go through it and make my comments on it; or (2) deal with the general points, and leave the things which seemed to me to be minor, but which might seem important to the people who made them, to be raised when it came to the questioning afterwards. I then dealt at some length with what I might call the general matters.  I remained for a certain amount of questioning.  In fact, I remained as long as the meeting remained. The meeting resumed on the next day, and the first thing I saw in the papers was that Deputy Cooper said my speech was remarkable for its omissions.  Now, if it was remarkable for its omissions, surely the Deputy had time enough to call my attention to the omissions.  I now hear the omissions referred to&mdash;that I said something about ratepayers.  As the Deputy is quoted in the papers, &ldquo;I had no care for the ratepayers.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>But surely I had prefaced that by this: that I had gone along a certain line of argument, that once the bond holders were paid off whatever money was outstanding <Col N="1924" /> that I was finished with the bond holders; that once the moneys that were given to the electricity undertaking as a subvention from the rates were paid back that I was done with the ratepayers.  That was the line of my argument, and that is the argument that I put forward here and that has been accepted here as a sound position to take up with regard to the ratepayers.  With regard to the amendment, I spoke to an amendment which, by the way, is described in the papers as Deputy Thrift's amendment&mdash;Deputy Thrift's amendment put into his hands by me with the definite request from me that he should put it down so that I might be enabled to put down another amendment with a slightly different note, and so that the matter could be looked at in the relation of one to the other.  I invited the terms of it to be read out, and nobody thought it important.  Deputy Cooper now says that no one could relate it to the Bill.  There were quite a number of people at this meeting who could not have related very much to the Bill, because quite a number of them had not read the Bill.  All they had read were the newspaper editorials on the Bill, and had their minds formed by these.</P>
      <P>The Deputy made another remark that I wish to comment upon.  He said that I had not told the whole truth.  Now if I had been guilty of telling half-truths or these definite omissions which amount to the same thing surely there was time enough to hold me up on that.  There was only one Deputy of the House who interrupted me and that was Deputy Hewat, and I sent a statement to him verifying what I had said.  I have not yet heard whether Deputy Hewat accepts that verification or not, or whether he still believes in his own contradiction.  There was a very deliberate contradiction made, in answer to which I submitted clear and definite proof as to the accuracy of my own statement.  I do not know what happened with regard to that, but that is the type of proceeding that was adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cooper has made a statement <Col N="1925" /> as to Deputy Sears intervening in this debate, and said how welcome it was to hear any views from the Government benches in support of this measure or any other.  Even though he did not agree with it, the Deputy welcomed the intervention.  That is one thing that possibly may have to be looked after better in the future. There has been considerable comment as to the absence of views from the Government benches on any measure. With regard to the procedure here we are now on the Fifth Stage of this Bill. I do not know how much time has been spent on it, but I should say that at least 50 per cent. of the time has been occupied by Deputy Johnson.  If we were to take, over the whole course of the debates in this House, the amount of time that Deputy Johnson takes to himself for comments on the different measures and the time occupied by members of other opposition parties to whom it has been thought desirable to give as much freedom as possible for the discussion of measures here, one might be able to get some indication as to what the length of the debates would be if Government Deputies were to intervene. I have the feeling, and I have held it from the time when for a short period I was a back bencher in support of the Government, that there was very little opportunity given to members of the Government Party not on the Ministerial benches to speak.</P>

      <P>I do, and I considered it a waste of time.  This is a matter that should be considered in the future.  There has been a definite procedure with regard to allowing the fullest freedom of discussion possible, and there is a certain amount of time that people would say ought to be the normal period for any discussion required. The Government Party has not got a proper proportion of that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Who stops them? They are stopped because there has to be some consideration on this side of the House as to when measures should be allowed through, and what is the proper time for their discussion.  I will ask anybody to go back over the volumes of debates in this House, and to see the amount of time taken up by four or five people in this House, and see whether all the time these people have used in discussing measures has been profitable to the discussion of the measure.  There will be then some indication or some appreciation of why people like Deputy Sears cannot speak oftener, and why there cannot be any comments from this side of the House as well as from others on this or any other Bill.  I am not going to follow Deputy Johnson in all he went through.  He went through all we got from him yesterday, with about <Col N="1928" /> two new points, and the two new points were incorrect.  One point was about &ldquo;interest&rdquo;&mdash;could a member of the Board become a commission agent for the British firm of Thompson, Houston and Co., or some other firm?  Definitely I set out to prevent that.  If the Deputy was not satisfied he would have moved to amend it.  He did put down an amendment, but it was so badly drawn that he withdrew it.  Is that my fault?  Despite the fact that it was withdrawn, I still hold that, in the provision at the end of Section 10, the word &ldquo;interest&rdquo; covers that point. There was another point with regard to minor matters that was stressed at great length in Deputy Johnson's long oration to-day, but there has been sufficient argument on these points, and I am not going into them again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Interest&rdquo; refers to shares.  That is my point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The interest does not refer to shares.  We are told that the expression &ldquo;shares in any electrical undertaking&rdquo; means and includes... &ldquo;any share or interest in any unincorporated undertaking similarly engaged.&rdquo; They are not identical.  If they were identical the two words would not be there&mdash;&ldquo;interest and share.&rdquo;  Where is the Deputy's point?</P>

      <P>Go n-aontuíonn Dáil Eireann le daingniú do dhéanamh i gcóir Shaorstáit Eireann ar an gConvensiún i dtaobh Cúitimh do Lucht Oibre i nGalair Chéirde agus le glaca leis an Mola i dtaobh Cúitimh do Lucht Oibre i nGalair Chéirde le n-ar glacadh an 10adh Meitheamh, 1925, ag an Seachtú Siosón a bhí ag Códháil Idirnáisiúnta an Oibreachais i nGeneva.</P>
      <P>That Dáil Eireann approves of the ratification in respect of Saorstát Eireann of the Convention concerning Workmen's Compensation for Occupational Diseases and of the acceptance of the Recommendation concerning Workmen's Compensation for Occupational Diseases adopted on the 10th June, 1925, at the Seventh Session of the International Labour Conference held in Geneva.</P>
      <P>This Convention and this recommendation have both been circulated.  I want to call attention to the fact, with regard to the Convention, that it provides that compensation shall be payable to workmen incapacitated by certain occupational diseases detailed in the Schedule to the Convention.  These diseases are already included in the list of diseases in respect of which compensation is payable under the existing legislation.  The Convention therefore can be ratified at once.  The same type of remark would apply to the recommendation. The recommendation simply asks that provision should be made for revising the list of diseases classified as occupational in national legislation. That recommendation is covered by Section 8 of the Workmen's Compensation Act of 1906.  The recommendation can be accepted without necessitating any change in existing legislation.</P>

      <P>I agree that the resolution should be passed.  The Convention makes no change in the law already in force.  It is rather a matter of record for the League International Labour Office that we have definitely adhered to the Convention.  I would have liked to have had a motion ratifying the Convention on compensation for industrial accidents, which is in advance of the present British law, and also the Convention on equality of treatment for foreign workers and nationals.  There is need for a reciprocal arrangement between Great Britain and the Free State, and it would be possible under that Convention for such to be negotiated.  I think the House would do well to ratify the present Convention for the purpose of formally recording in the League that we do adhere to this International Convention.</P>
