      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if his attention has been drawn to the report of the Engineer of the Lough Erne Drainage Board on a proposed scheme for the drainage of Lough and River Erne; if he is aware that the drainage of this district affects the problem of drainage over a wide area in Counties Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim, Longford and Tirconaill and whether he will take the necessary action, legislative and otherwise, as will enable the carrying out of this scheme at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>There has been no undue delay so far as the inquiry is concerned.  It is a complicated matter.  It is possible that teachers approaching the age of 65 may think of retiring.  They will be the people affected by any delay.  That is, assuming that the scheme will be accepted by the Dáil, it may be possible to make some kind of provision so that teachers about the age of 65, who may retire, with the sanction of the Minister for Education, after that date could get any benefits that might accrue under this scheme.  I put forward that so that no delay might prejudice any people in connection with that decision.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture if the <Col N="131" /> rents fixed under the Land Law Ireland Act, 1896, on the estate of the then Hon. T.A. Brassey, now Lord Egerton, townland of Inch Level (Lough Swilly Sloblands), parish of Fahan, Burt, and Inch, late Derry No. 2 Rural District Council, Donegal, was on the basis that the landlord would keep clear as heretofore the two main arterial rivers, viz.:&mdash;the Skeog and another unnamed river; also sluices and flood gates in the embankment; and if the Minister is aware that, it is stated, that through the neglect to put these conditions into operation since the Land Commission assumed the management of the said estate under the provisions of the Land Act, 1923, large areas of several farms have become derelict and valueless.</P>

      <P>The estate referred to comprises 16 holdings on the Coast of Donegal, and the landlord has lodged particulars thereof with the Land Commission to enable the estate to be dealt with under the Land Act, 1923, but the lands have not been vested in the Land Commission.  Five of the holdings are subject to judicial rents fixed by judicial orders, one in the year 1903, three in 1907, and one in 1908; the rents of three of these holdings were fixed on the basis of the landlord keeping clear the main arterial rivers, and in the fourth case, on the basis of the landlord keeping the sluices in the embankment in order. (The tenant in one of the cases was to keep the external drains in order himself.) The Land Commission have received complaints on behalf of the tenants on the estate with regard to the drainage thereon, and have replied that at the present stage of the proceedings they are not in a position to deal with the matter, but that when the estate is being inspected the question of repairs and future maintenance of the embankment and other drainage works will be considered with reference to the provisions of Section 44 of the Act, and that meanwhile it would be advisable for the tenant to approach the landlord with a view to having an existing defect remedied.</P>

      <P>It has been for some time the custom of the British Government to keep the other Governments of the Commonwealth informed of the general trend of foreign affairs as they directly affect the interests of Great Britain.  Communications of this character do not, of themselves, create any responsibility in respect of the Governments receiving them.  Responsibility arises only when the interest of a particular government is at once apparent from the nature of the subject matter of the communication, or when a particular government declares itself interested and formally accepts responsibility.  As neither hypothesis has been realised in the case of China I do not feel under any obligation either to disclaim responsibility or to give information to the Chinese Government, who, we must presume, are well aware that the only government competent to act on behalf of the Irish Free State is the Government of the Irish Free State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Vote for funds to advance to farmers to erect new creameries in districts where no creameries at present exist.  The amount mentioned is £23,500.  That will be available and will be sufficient up to 31st March.  Only a small proportion of the total liabilities will be incurred by that date.  The supplementary amount which will be necessary to be found in the new Financial Year in order to complete the work to be done under this Vote will be £70,000 or £80,000, making a round total of about £100,000.  The method adopted is to take a token vote of £10. Under sub-head Q in last year's Estimates a sum of £52,600 was voted for University College, Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We expect that there will be £23,500 of that available, perhaps more.  There will be an amount required in any case, and the amount required will be £23,500 by the end of the financial year.  That need not in any way disconcert the people who are interested in the Dairy Faculty in University College, Cork; the money is there for them.  They have not got ahead as quickly as we thought they would.  Our business was to provide the money; the money is there and there is no hitch whatever on this side.  They have some difficulty over the site.  There are three possible sites for the new creamery, and they have not been able to come to a decision yet as to which they will fix on. When this estimate was introduced last year they had practically made up their minds on one site, but since then they have changed their minds.  There is an alternative site and they have not yet been able to decide between these <Col N="136" /> two on account of difficulties of their own with which we are not concerned. If they had, this money would have been used.  As it is, and having regard to the date which we have reached and to the fact that we have only three months to go to the end of the financial year, there is no likelihood that they will have drawn the whole of this, but it is quite certain that this £23,500 will be available.  With regard to the new creameries the position is that there has been a considerable demand for the last three months for new creameries and for credits for the establishment of new creameries.  That demand has coincided with the considerable difficulty experienced by the suppliers in finding money through the ordinary joint stock banks.  I do not want to go into these difficulties.  They are there. Money is getting tighter, not only money for the purpose of developing the creamery industry but money for every other purpose, and that particular tendency has come at the same time as a demand for credits for new creameries.  In that state of affairs we decided that we would step into the gap, especially in view of the fact that the Agricultural Credit Bill will be passed this Session and that the Agricultural Credit Corporation will be set up as soon as possible after the passing of the Bill.  That corporation will be asked to take over these loans.  These are loans, not subsidies.  I need not argue the advantages of providing that money.  It is another step in our backward career of endeavouring to put a premium on mixed farming instead of specialised farming.  We are asking the farmer to go in more for tilling and dairying rather than for livestock and pigs.  It is frankly a policy to encourage mixed farming as against grain-growing for sale as such.</P>
    <P>There is another important consideration that we took into account when we came to this decision, and that was that as a result of the Dairy Produce Act, which is not yet fully in operation, the price of home-made butter has absolutely collapsed.  There is no market for it now except the butter factories; farmers' rough lumps cannot be exported, and rightly so.  We will not allow it.  It very often contains <Col N="137" /> more than 16 per cent. of water, and there are other good reasons for preventing its export.  That has limited the market considerably, and the result has been that farmers' butter sold from 6d. to 11d. a lb., or from 2½d. to 4½d. a gallon for the milk, during the last year.  That particular factor was more eloquent than any plea to convince the Department, the farmers or anyone in the Dáil, that there was no money in that, and that they should turn to the creameries.  There are districts which gave up the idea of home butter-making with a great many pangs and that are still rather sorry for themselves, but the general opinion is that the people in these counties have changed their minds quickly as a result of these prices obtained during the last six months.  They are ready, and the time is ripe for meeting their demands for creameries.</P>
    <P>I do not want to indicate the number of creameries that may be erected from this fund.  There are certain applications. These applications may be granted or amended.  I do not want to indicate the counties either.  There are various counties all over the South, and there are some applications from Northern counties.  They will all be considered. Claims that have been put in for central creameries may be changed to auxiliaries.  Other applications for creameries may be refused on the ground that there are auxiliaries close by, so that I am not in a position at the moment to say what proposals put up under this fund will be centralised creameries and what proportion will be auxiliaries.  Each proposal will be examined on its merits, and the consent of the Department of Lands and Agriculture will have to be obtained.  In other words, the loan will only be given if we are satisfied that the particular proposition is economically sound.  To be satisfied about that we must not only be satisfied that the creamery will not be redundant but satisfied that an auxiliary would not suffice instead of a central creamery.  There are too many centrals and too few auxiliaries. We will have to be satisfied also that there is an economic milk supply.  We will give those loans on certain conditions specified, and I will indicate to <Col N="138" /> the Dáil specifically what these conditions are.  The society must, of course, be affiliated to the I.A.O.S.  You can take it that a number of these conditions are conditions that will be embodied afterwards in the Bill.  There must be in these cases a half-yearly audit by a competent auditor.  Before the society is registered prospective suppliers must take shares in proportion to the number of their cows, and these shares must cover the whole purchase money of the creamery.  They will be asked to pay up a reasonable proportion, namely, a quarter of these shares, and that payment will be made by a half-crown before registration and a half-crown after registration and just when operations are about to begin.  That will leave for every pound a balance of 15/-, and that will be collected by deductions from the price of milk over a period of, say, six or eight years.  It will amount to a deduction of 6d. per share per month in the season of five months during which there is a flush milk supply.  That will mean a half-crown per share per season.</P>

That is a rather important question that will have to be decided on discussion.  They will be financed in that way, and repayment of the loan will be in that way for six or eight years.  That, I think, will give the farmers concerned a reasonable way of financing these creameries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state what he is charging for these loans?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that. First of all, no creamery can be established on a sound basis, no creamery has security for any credit, unless the suppliers take shares.  I am not speaking at the moment of paying up shares.  What used to happen was that an enthusiastic minority decided to erect a creamery, found the money, so far as the money was found by the suppliers themselves, borrowed the <Col N="139" /> rest, on the joint and several security of a few big men in the district, from the local banks, and started working it.  That is utterly uneconomic.  Only a minority in that case are affected by the fate of the creamery.  There is no realisation generally that everybody is interested in it, and the majority are free.  Moreover, it is unsound from the point of view of the banks.  If everybody who was interested in it is encouraged to do his best by taking shares then the particular organisation for which the money is required, over and above the money that is subscribed, has a sound security for the working capital and for the difference between what is subscribed and what is required to build the creamery. We will insist that the full purchase money be covered by shares, with a reasonable proportion paid up, and we will find the balance by way of loans. The money can be borrowed roughly at 5½ per cent.  We will make a further condition, which I think is right to mention, and that is, that new creameries, when established, work in with the federation that is at present being arranged for the sale of Irish creamery butter.  At present the I.A.O.S. and the creameries are meeting and preparing a scheme for the sale of butter.  I need not now go into the question of the sale of Irish butter and indicate the weakness which was inherent in past methods by which every creamery sold its own small lot to its own customers in England. Again, it was rather hard to change that, but factors which have operated for the last three or four years have convinced the creameries that that must go, and arrangements between the creameries and the I.A.O.S., outside the Government altogether, are being made for the federated sales to English salesmen on the other side. Before any new creamery gets the benefit of these credits it must agree to come into that federation and join up with the rest of the creameries in selling its butter in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think in view of the state of credits in the country and in view of the fact that the particular agencies through which trade should <Col N="140" /> get credit, the joint stock banks, have refused to come to the aid of the farmers, it is very wise on the part of the Government to provide the funds in this way, and while it is not my duty to extol the merits of the Government, in this particular case I agree that the step is timely and well placed and that it deserves the support of the farmers.  The setting up of this Agricultural Credit Corporation, will, I hope, remove the necessity for the State to become a loan bank, so to speak.  This is the first attempt in that direction, and I hope it will be the last.  I do not believe in State credit. I believe that if industry is to live it must be on its own merits and that it should finance itself, and while I appreciate this action at this particular stage, when things are so difficult in farming, I believe the proper course would be the use of this corporation when it is established, and not to be going to the State for doles or for help when we can obtain it by our own endeavours.</P>

I think it is timely that the State should enter actively into the promotion of organised agriculture, that the organisation of agriculture should be pressed forward by positive State action, and that every encouragement, even insistence, as is to be proposed in the Bill, should be forthcoming.  I think it is valuable, too, to have it made clear to societies that are entitled to this that they are in the main to capitalise themselves, that they are not to be pretending to be co-operative while not having the slightest notion of what is behind the idea of co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a few people to get together and go to the bank to borrow money and be bound for years to pay a big interest out of the sales of milk, is damaging to the idea of co-operative agriculture. It is well that this new condition should be imposed upon the projected societies.  There may be good reason why the Minister should not give us any indication of where the <Col N="141" /> new societies are likely to spring up&mdash; we can guess&mdash;but I think it would have been very interesting, and I cannot see any disadvantage in being told what parts of the country are more likely to be served by this proposed loan.</P>

      <P>It is also quite satisfactory to have a condition imposed upon societies that are to participate in these loans that they must work in with the projected federation.  Again, we find that ideas which have been preached for quite a considerable time by people who sit on the Labour Benches, and which have been denounced, are being accepted by farmers and Ministers, whether farmers or not, with joy and all kinds of commendation. It is most satisfactory to find that these ideas of collective action, stimulated and assisted positively by the State, are finding acceptance generally.</P>

I was also interested to <Col N="142" /> hear from the Minister that it is intended to give a premium to the system of mixed farming.  The State is coming forward to give a premium to those farmers who indulge in mixed farming&mdash;again a most desirable development, and, I may say, a warning against the policy which is sometimes preached by the same Minister that they must buy in the cheapest market. Even if these feeders of cattle find it possible to buy imported grain at a lower price, they are not to follow the market and do what the merchants and manufacturers are advised to do&mdash;they are to use their own labour on their own land, and produce food for their own stock; even though it may cost a little more than the imported stuff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister making a reservation there.  I should like to understand clearly what is his intention&mdash;what his meaning is?  Is mixed farming only to be engaged in when farm produce cannot be bought cheaper than it can be produced on the home farm?  Is that the position?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be very glad.  This is not merely a matter of debating.  It is important, because it affects national policy both in agriculture and in industry generally.  I have here a recommendation by the same Minister to some farmers in the West, when he told them that he wanted to see ten million pounds' worth of butter produced, and that he did not care where they sold it.  The important point was to produce more and sell it in the best market, and then, if they liked to buy Siberian butter, why not? He applied the same argument to bacon.  The stimulus is going to be cheapness.</P>

      <P>Dearness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>If the stimulus is going to be cheapness or mere liking, without regard to the producer in this country, then this policy of mixed farming is going to fail.  I have sufficient acquaintance with farmers to know hundreds who have told me after <Col N="143" /> long experience that they can buy fodder and grain cheaper than they can grow it.  If a man comes forward with that argument, is the Minister going to say to him: &ldquo;Go and purchase where you can buy cheapest?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>If not, then follow up mixed farming.  If the Minister is going to qualify his statement and tell them only to follow mixed farming when they are satisfied that the produce from their own farm is going to be cheaper for their stock than if they purchased it, then let us have that qualification.  On the other hand, if he says it is going to be an advantage, even though it may cost a few more pounds in the year, then I hope he will take note of that when giving advice to farmers in future.  I anticipate that when the Minister really considers this matter at close quarters, if he has not yet done so, he will blurt out the truth &mdash;that what he has in mind is the man who is working his own farm with his own labour as against the man who is working his farm with wage labour. He will tell the farmer who employs wage labour that it is no use trying to grow food for his own stock, because it will cost him more to grow than he could purchase it for.  To the farmer who is working his own land he will say: &ldquo;You can grow cheaper than you can buy.&rdquo;  I believe that the outline of policy that we have had from the Minister regarding these co-operative creameries is right and sound and should be extended.  I believe it is in conflict with his argument and advocacy in other directions, and it would be well if he would learn something of the virtue of a reasonable amount of consistency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I should also like to ask the Minister whether he received an application from the Westmeath Agriculture Committee for the establishment of a co-operative creamery in Mullingar.  In November last a resolution was adopted by that body, when there were 16 members present, suggesting the setting up of such a creamery.  There are no creameries in that county, and the farmers there would take shares and do everything in their power to see that the creamery would be a success.  At present the farmers have to depend on the local market for butter.  I regretted to hear the Minister say that there is no market for home-made butter, and I should like to know what he meant when he used the words &ldquo;rightly so.&rdquo; In that county we find that the butter made by the farmers' wives and daughters is better than any other butter that can be purchased.  I should also like to know whether it is intended when making these loans to impose any condition that the workers employed in the creameries will receive an adequate wage for the support of themselves and their families.  It is necessary for us to see that what took place in connection with the Shannon Scheme, where they only paid a wage of 32/-, should not again occur.  If the Government are going to subsidise an industry, it is the duty of labour representatives to see that an adequate wage will be paid to those employed in it, and not have the workers brought back to the slavery of pre-war days. If these creameries are to be set up, and are to get a loan at 5½ per cent., to whom will the profits go?  All the profits will go to the shareholders, and the man who produces the butter will have to work for a wage that will not be sufficient to keep himself and his family.  The producer should be the first to be provided for.  I do not want to elaborate this point, as there are a number of Labour Deputies here, but I do maintain that when a subsidy is given by the State, or a long term loan at low interest, the least we should expect is that the people engaged in the industry established should get a decent share of the profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know, too, whether it <Col N="145" /> is the intention of those who control the creameries to make some class of condensed milk that can be sold in this country.  As a result of my own experience in several very large shops I have found that Irish condensed milk has been returned as it is not at all up to the standard of the foreign condensed milk.  If you serve these creameries in a manner whereby they will be enabled to manufacture condensed milk that will be acceptable to the people of Ireland, you will certainly be doing a great deal to relieve unemployment.  I appreciate the Minister's attitude and I sincerely hope that he will introduce some provision whereby the worker will receive an adequate wage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not awfully keen on the State aiding the farmers or anybody else, but I believe the State ought to aid the farmers to help themselves. That is what the Minister is doing on this occasion.  The necessities of the situation make it necessary that the State should step in at the present juncture.  With regard to methods of administering this loan, I quite understand it is rather difficult for the Minister to make a very comprehensive statement at this stage.  Possibly he has not got very definite plans yet outlined in his Department.  I am sure, however, the Minister and his Department are not stepping blindly into this work of organising creameries, and I daresay they have had some definite scheme under consideration.  I understand from the Minister they are going to help the establishment of creameries in counties in which they are not already organised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have said areas or districts.  The Minister is, no doubt, well aware of the tendency in the organisation of creameries.  I am sure he knows that the creamery industry is developing very much in the direction of a central creamery with branch auxiliaries surrounding it.  I would like to know from him if he has this idea definitely in mind with regard to the creameries that are to be assisted by this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The small isolated creamery is not a <Col N="146" /> success; the creamery with the small supply or the creamery that is not connected with other creameries has not been a success.  The creameries are amalgamating and that tendency is on the increase.  Modern systems of transport allow for the changed system of work in regard to creameries.  It is essential, if the Minister is going to stimulate the establishment of new creameries, that he should bear that in mind and base his definite plan of action accordingly.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will give consideration to the experiment made by his Department in regard to the one-man auxiliary type of creamery.  I know the experiment was tried in my county and I believe it proved a success. It seems to me that in dealing with counties, like Clare, Offaly and Kildare, in which there are few, if any, creameries, the development of the butter and milk trade will have to be along somewhat new lines, such as those adumbrated in connection with the one-man auxiliary creamery.  These counties are not capable of carrying a sufficient number of dairy cattle in a restricted area necessary to supply a large creamery that carries out the ordinary manufacturing processes of a creamery.</P>
    <P>I quite approve of the safeguards the Minister intends to introduce in cases where it is decided to make advances under this scheme.  Every one of those safeguards is absolutely necessary. There was one point that the Minister did not deal with.  You may have all those stipulations which the Minister has mentioned, but at the same time, you must have a security of supply. It is time some law was brought into force which would make it obligatory on the supplier, or the member of the co-operative creamery, to continue supplies to the creamery of which he is associated.  As the law stands at present that is not the case.  A man may enter into a contract or may be a member of an auxiliary creamery, but he can break away, if he gets a higher price in a neighbouring creamery. That is constantly happening.</P>
    <P>The real difficulty in regard to many creameries is the securing of competent <Col N="147" /> managers.  The success of a creamery depends almost altogether on the competence of the manager.  Unless we can be sure of a scheme which will provide for dispensing with the services of incompetent managers, we are bound to have trouble.  In almost all the cases I have known the lack of success in a creamery has been due to the incompetence, negligence or culpability of the manager.  Of course, the half-yearly audit would be a check, and the examination to be carried out under the Dairy Produce Act will be a check, but I think there is a necessity for a still further check by a superior authority which will ensure that an incompetent manager cannot continue to be in charge of a creamery.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson seems to be anxious to know what <Col N="148" /> everybody has in mind to-day.  I must confess that I did not know very well what Deputy Johnson had in mind when he was making his statement.  I got some idea of a nebulous State socialism in the country&mdash;the State controlling the farmers and creameries. I do not think Deputy Johnson outlined very clearly his idea of what the policy of the farmers should be.  The only remark I will make in regard to Deputy Johnson's statement is that if he expects the farmer, by any State control, to lose anything because any particular article grown on the farm is dearer than a similar product, imported from other countries, which he can buy, he is asking the farmer to go contrary to the ordinary economic law which controls everybody else in this country. The farmer will not go contrary to the ordinary economic law, and Deputy Johnson knows that.</P>

      <P>On the whole I appreciate the attitude that has been adopted.  The Minister has asked Deputies to deal with this matter at the right time.  He has filled the gap between this period and the time when a credit corporation will be established. He is giving an opportunity to have these creameries established this year and put in working order, perhaps during the coming summer.  If he did not take this action now I do not suppose they would be established before next year.  I think, on the whole, that this Vote should have approval.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. RODDY</NameTxt>
      <P>The passing of this Vote will certainly give a stimulus to the dairying industry and, incidentally, it will be an inducement to farmers in those areas where creameries do not exist already to get to work immediately. I assume that provision will be made in the Estimates for 1927-28 for a similar loan; at least I hope so.  At the present moment in three different areas of the constituency which I represent the farmers are already arranging to start the erection of creameries.  I assume that as a natural consequence of this Vote some generous provision will be made for similar loans in the Estimates for 1927-28.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="149" /> I was very glad to hear the Minister stating his intention to spread the responsibility for the repayment of the loans over all the shareholders in the different societies.  Hitherto, loans were advanced by the banks or the Government, only to certain members of societies, invariably the best and most progressive farmers in the area. In some instances of which I am personally aware, these farmers were heavily mulcted in consequence of the failure of the concern.  It always seemed to me contrary to the spirit of true co-operation that a few men should be asked to assume responsibility for the inevitable risks entailed in the repayment of loans, which should be borne by all the members of the society&mdash;at least by the shareholders of the society.</P>
    <P>I would be glad if the Minister would make the different shareholders responsible for the payment of these loans. I would also like to know whether any provision has been made for existing societies.  The Minister is aware that under the operations of the Dairy Produce Act certain creameries have incurred expenditure for the purpose of installing machinery to fulfil the requirements of that Act.  Many of these societies are in a shaky financial position at the moment, and their activities are restricted and hampered owing to the want of adequate capital.  I hope it will be feasible for the Minister to make provision whereby it would be possible for him to assist societies of that kind.  I wish to compliment the Minister on the production of this Vote, and I am sure it will be appreciated by the farmers, particularly of the Western area.</P>

That would be of benefit not only to the locality but to the nation. These people proclaim that in their judgment Moore Park was the best land they had met in their travels.  Even if it is not suitable for the present purposes it should be borne in mind that such a place is there, and that it is the property of the Government, so that there is no need for purchasing or bargaining with regard to it.  I was going to say, &ldquo;This is my own, my native land,&rdquo; but I will say this is our land and we can build on it for whatever purpose we like.</P>

      <P>The trustee at present is the Minister for Defence.  When you are subsidising, or giving a loan, to the co-operative creameries I think you should go to the root of the thing and give a loan to the poorer class of farmers for the building of home dairies. At present these poor people cannot build them, and they cannot comply with the laws that are being imposed upon them.  It is a gross hardship to some of these poor people to bring them before the courts and fine then when it is impossible for them to comply with the laws.  These poor people are told they must change their way of living and their way of bringing butter to the markets.  I think they should be assisted and not have impossible conditions imposed upon them.  A number of these people as a consequence of being compelled to comply with the laws will have to sell their cows.</P>

      <P>But if they take butter into the market and it is unclean, or if an Inspector goes out and finds that the cow-house is unclean, will not a fine be imposed?  The people cannot afford at present to keep the cow-houses properly clean.  They require to be assisted by means of a loan.  They should be given a house to live in, for <Col N="151" /> a number of them are worse off than the labourers.  I suppose they did not organise in time, but now that we are imposing a duty upon them to change their methods, I think it is up to the Minister for Agriculture that he should provide a loan for these poor people so as to put them into a position to comply with the laws he is inflicting on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the Minister in making this loan available for the erection of creameries is taking a step in the right direction.  Owing to the fact that the feeding of dry stock has been very unprofitable for some years back, farmers are casting about for some method by which a profit can be made.  The prospects are not altogether so rosy as some people imagine, as butter is selling at a low price, due possibly to foreign competition. In my districts meetings have been held recently with the object of seeing whether it is possible to start a creamery and work it at a profit.  This action was taken before anybody got wind of the loan for buildings.  With regard to what is called farmers' butter, or home-made butter, I have it from shopkeepers who are constrained more or less to take this butter in exchange for goods, that they often sell it in Dublin at a loss of 4d. or 5d. per lb.  It is practically unsaleable except as car grease.  It is a very unprofitable system to be producing an article of this sort for which there is no market.</P>

      <P>I do not because I have had experience of some very good butter at home, but I say that a great percentage of it is unfit for consumption, especially having regard to the fact that people's tastes have changed. In the large cities especially, people do not care to buy anything but creamery butter.  I am not a very enthusiastic advocate of co-operation.  I have had the unpleasant experience of having to foot a very big bill along with fellow-guarantors for an overdraft in a co-operative <Col N="152" /> society.  It was what is called a trading society.  I think it would be well when the creameries are established that they should not go in for shop-keeping.</P>

      <P>Like many of the previous speakers I am quite pleased with the Minister's scheme.  Coming as I do from a county where there are practically no creameries, I must say that we have not degenerated to the level mentioned by Deputy Conlan. Our butter is not so despicable as to be compared with car grease.  I maintain that we produce a fairly good article still for which there is a fairly good demand all round.  The old ways, however, I suppose will have to go, and, as the Minister has stated, many of the things that were in operation in the past are of no use to-day.  I hope the Minister will give all the help possible to the organisation of societies in counties such as ours where nothing whatever is known of creameries, their management, organisation and development. If it is going to be of any benefit I am sure the county of Wexford will grasp at it immediately.  Our other industries, such as barley-growing, have been a failure for the past three years and we must devise ways and means of trying to make up for that.  I presume from the Minister's statement that this new system will help us, and, as I have said before, I am sure that the people of Wexford will be eager to adopt any method that will improve their position in any way.</P>

      <P>At an early stage I think I was invited to take some part in the discussion.  I am sorry that in doing so I have perhaps to utter a discordant note in a very unanimous House regarding the very popular chance of participating in a Government loan.  The Minister brings forward a supplementary estimate whereby he makes use of a sum which was granted on the last occasion on which we came to consider the Budget for a certain purpose.  That sum not being utilised the Minister now proposes to use the money in connection with the granting of loans to creameries to be established in many parts of the country.  I imagine that that is a large <Col N="153" /> question which would involve a question of policy, and, generally speaking, the recognition of a state of affairs as a consequence of which the Government was going to pass legislation on certain lines.  But that is not so.  The Minister for Agriculture says: &ldquo;I am going to take this sum and throw it out as a feeler to the country,&rdquo; and no doubt we will see the reflection in connection with the coming elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>At all events, a feeler is thrown out, and it has been wonderfully successful in catching the fish of the Dáil.  I have no objection whatsoever to the statement of the Minister as to how this money is going to be used.  But why is it necessary to use it even to a limited extent?  The operations of the Government in this matter are operations which have been in practice, and there is no reason why they should not be, in connection with the organising of creameries throughout the country.  The Government now come along and say they will advance the money to a certain creamery under certain conditions.</P>
      <P>If those conditions were complied with, irrespective of the Government's interference in the matter at all, I venture to say that the money would be available, and ought to be available from private sources.  Be that as it may, let us take, say, a creamery in a certain district in Clare, which is established upon the lines that the Government lays down in connection with this particular loan.  How far is that going to go?  The Minister mentioned the sum of £23,000.  Is it to be taken as the definite policy of the Government that they will make available an unlimited amount of money for whatever is required in connection with the starting of creameries in any part of the country?  If that is so, well and good.  But once you start that principle in connection with a small creamcry in any part of the country, how can you resist a similar demand from any other part of the country.  In other words, are you going to have piece-meal legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle that is involved in this <Col N="154" /> should be the principle involved in the legislation of this House.  It should be on definite lines, and we should not have preferential treatment.  What I contend is, that whatever area of creameries is going to be covered by this supplementary vote, that will make an irresistible claim for all the creameries that are in the Saorstát or that are going to be in it, and not only that, but it involves the Government in the settled policy of subsidising co-operation to the extent, at all events, of financing it out of the country's resources. I am not here to say that that is not a right policy, but I do say that it is a perfectly wrong system to bring in a policy of that sort on a supplementary vote for £10.  I say that the thing is absurd.  The money that was voted originally was voted for a specific purpose.  Is it the policy of this House or of the Minister for Agriture or anybody else to take money voted for a certain purpose, and because it suits their convenience to come again before the House with a supplementary vote for £10, and put that money to a use for which it was never voted, and never contemplated when voted.  That is the broad issue that I put before the House.</P>
    <P>In connection with the discussion that has taken place it has of course naturally led up to the farmers' idea of mixed farming, and to a hundred and one other aspects of the case that I have no concern with.  I take it that the farmer is going to farm his land to the best advantage for himself, and is not going to consider anyone but himself in the matter, and I think rightly so.  But how far, I ask, is it really an attractive proposition for the farmers.  The Government steps in and makes it easy for a certain body of men to get a certain sum of money on loan.  I take it that the Government is prepared to provide for adequate security for the money they have advanced, but I would like to say to the farmers that it would be very much wiser for them to get together and do that class of business on their own.  There is nothing involved in the Government's proposal, if carried out, that is going to be of any particular advantage to the farmer.  The amount <Col N="155" /> of interest that they are going to pay for the money is not going to be so very attractive as to compensate them for all the supervision and control that the Government will be entitled to put into operation in connection with the advance of the money.  I say to the farmers that it would be a simpler proposition for them to do all that themselves and to have thereby a greater freedom in the matter.  The main argument that I am putting before the House is that this is not a supplementary vote; that the foundation of this whole supplementary vote involves a question of principle and policy which has never been adumbrated by the Government and never decided by the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Up to four or five years ago the banks were reasonable and did not ask for unreasonable securities or an unreasonable amount of interest, but within the last few years they have been asking for unreasonable security. There was one time when they did not ask for much security.  In fact it is not so many years since they were asking people to take money to buy land. They went to one extreme in madness at one time, but now they appear to have gone mad in the other direction, with the result that the agricultural community and others identified with agriculture cannot at the present time <Col N="156" /> do business with the banks of the country. The reasonable facilities afforded heretofore by the banks to the farmers have now been withdrawn by them. They are not prepared to accept reasonable security from farmers at the present time, and in that condition of affairs who are the farmers to look to except to the State, and all that the State is doing in this case is offering money at a reasonable rate of interest and on a certain gilt-edged security?</P>

      <P>Deputy Hewat made a serious contribution to this debate.  He says that this is raising a big question of policy.  The mistake he makes is in thinking that it has been raised for the first time.

      <P>That may be, but I want to assure the Deputy that we have not come to the Dáil on a question like this without having given it very serious consideration.  This is no casual estimate introduced without any realisation of its significance.  It is a rather significant estimate undoubtedly, but it is not to-day or yesterday that we began to examine this question.  We have been discussing it in the Dáil one way or another during <Col N="157" /> the last two or three years.  More than a year ago, since the Banking Commission was set up, and almost six or seven months ago since they reported&mdash;during all that time the Department of Agriculture and the Government generally have had to consider their attitude on this whole question.  On every issue that the Deputy has raised, the decisions they have come to were, I can assure him, arrived at after great deliberation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We have debated this question for the last three or four years, and have come to our conclusions after serious deliberation and after considerable examination by ourselves and by the Commission set up for that purpose. I agree with regard to the point that this is a token vote for £10.  There is no point whatever in the suggestion made by the Deputy that we are really converting money to another use than that for which it was voted.  It is merely a question of procedure.  I could have come here with a vote for £100,000, but I know that a sum like that is not got in by the end of March. I know that I can probably find about £23,000.  That is the sum that is wanted by March, but I think it right to indicate that spending £23,000 means incurring liabilities for about £100,000. I could also have come with a supplementary vote for £23,000, but obviously the right thing to do is to take it out of savings.  There is no question of converting the money to a wrong use. As long as the Dáil knows what is happening and approves there is nothing wrong about it.  As I have said, we have not come to conclusions on the matter casually.  This whole question has been considered at great length for the last two years.  I agree with the Deputy that it is just not entirely satisfactory that one portion of our agricultural policy has to be revealed and discussed without any advertence to the whole policy in regard to creameries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="158" /> As I stated in the beginning, we are proposing to set up an Agricultural Credit Corporation.  That Corporation will exist to finance the needs of farmers, in particular to finance the needs of farmers' organisations, and, more particularly, to finance the creamery industry which is the foundation of our farming.  That is being done deliberately, and will be done through a Bill to be introduced.  This is simply following the example of a number of other countries, particularly countries competing with us in the British market. There is nothing new or revolutionary in this solution.  It is, in fact, the policy outlined and adopted in Australia, New Zealand, Denmark and other countries competing with us in the British market.</P>
    <P>I think that the comments concerning the joint stock banks' attitude are beside the point.  The fact is that such banks were never intended for business of this sort, but for an entirely different purpose.  Their organisation is not suitable for business of this kind. I make all allowance for the fact that these banks must have money at call, and that it does not suit them to make long term loans.  There is no question at all that the loans which the farmers' organisations want are loans for fairly long terms.  The joint stock banks are not suitable, either here or anywhere else, to deal with agricultural needs, and it was the realisation of that fact that led us to set up the Banking Commission and to agree to adopt their report. I think that that is the real reason that these banks are unable to deal adequately with this particular service, especially in times of shortage of money.  When we discuss this question it should be stated that the attitude of certain farmers in the country is doing as much as anything else to make it difficult to give farmers credit. The attitude of farmers in various counties in small meetings&mdash;I am glad to say they are small meetings&mdash;is that they are not going to pay their debts, and to be put out of their houses and homes.  That is all very fine, but it means that it is going to raise the rate of interest, no matter where the money comes from, and I think farmers should realise that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said that in discussing this question of agricultural credit we have to take into account as one factor the attitude of certain farmers.  I read these statements which I say mean nothing else than that they are not going to pay all their debts.  They talk about the sheriff and the bailiff and what they are going to do if anyone comes to liquidate a mortgage on their land.  We know what that means.  They are trying to injure the credit of the country.  I do not believe that they will have that effect, but so far as I am concerned and, I think, so far as the Minister for Justice is concerned, we will do what we can to see that they will not injure the credit of the country.  If those statements have any effect at all&mdash;I do not believe they will because there are too many sensible people in the country&mdash;it will be only to injure the credit of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use in going over the past.  The man, be he shopkeeper or farmer, who borrowed in 1920, was unfortunate, and if these people come now and say &ldquo;times have changed and we are not going to pay our debts&rdquo; we know that there will be the grossest abuses and that, apart from genuine hard cases, everyone who is afraid of work will crowd into these organisations. That is one factor of the situation.  This bank has been set up and luckily we are able to borrow <Col N="160" /> money as well as the English or any other Government in the world.  It will be set up under the best auspices. Meantime there is need for temporary credit.  There is need to fill the gap. This is an attempt to fill the gap. Deputy Hewat is wrong when he says that this is legislation in favour of particular districts.  It is not.  We come here and state the amount.  It will be our business to examine applications, not from the point of view of the district, and not to give advantage to one district over another, but to see where there is the greatest need in any part of the country for a creamery to replace home butter making.</P>

      <P>You can have it that way if you like.  That is a comment I do not understand.  I am standing over the estimate as it is in its setting. When this money is lent on these terms it must be taken over by the Agricultural Credit Corporation and we are finished with it.  That puts a definite end to this sort of transaction.  I realise that it would be a serious thing if we were doing this casually with no policy and with no idea where it is going to stop.  We have a policy in our mind.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation is there and we will ask the Dáil to sanction its setting up.  We propose that these loans will be taken over by it and that in future the transactions will be between the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the creameries.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>We need not discuss that now.  First of all, the issue of the Credit Corporation is to be made to the public and, if they do not respond, we give the guarantee for the loan. In future the transactions will be between the Credit Corporation and the creamery.  When we have cleared the <Col N="161" /> ground it will be a matter between the Corporation and the creamery.  No one should come to the conclusion that we are going to give out this money casually.  It would be wrong for districts in which there is no real need for it, from the home butter making point of view, to think that we are going to give credit.  We will examine each application with the microscope and we will try to give money to each district where it is most urgently needed.  When the Credit Corporation is set up other needs can be considered, but meantime this money will go to districts where there is most urgent need for setting up creameries.  Moreover, the money should only be expended on creameries that will be in operation during most part of the next butter season.  Once that season passes over there is no great point in setting up creameries in November or December, as the country ought to be nearer the Agricultural Credit Corporation then, and that Corporation will be dealing with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not our aim to control internally the administration of co-operative societies.  That is unsound.  That is a matter for farmers themselves.  We will not take responsibility for the actual day-to-day administration of the working of creameries but we will require a general standard.  We will make general regulations in regard to affiliation, in regard to share capital, in regard to audit, and in regard to suppliers being shareholders, and the Credit Corporation will give no advantage in the way of credit to creameries which do not comply with these regulations.  After that it is their responsibility, and what you want here more than anything else is to throw responsibility on people.  At the same time, the co-operative movement has to be guided in every country.  We hear criticisms about the co-operative system and we hear more about the societies that fail than we do about those which succeed.  As I have stated, there is a very disordered state of affairs throughout the country with regard to organised co-operative creameries but that is inevitable.  This is the only country in the world where co-operative creameries were allowed <Col N="162" /> to develop without State direction.  It was not in the past a question of finding the money but of State direction. You have actually redundant auxiliaries here and the business is carrying twice the overhead expenses which it should.  Do not blame the farmers, for if you do you blame the farmers in every country in the world, because it has been found by experience that, having so many people and so many interests involved, it is essential that while the State should not do the farmers' work it should direct it in certain ways.</P>
    <P>In future it will be impossible to set up redundant creameries, to set them up without having them affiliated, without having a half-yearly audit, and without having them properly covered by share capital.  I am not saying that there is a fortune in the creamery industry. I do not believe that there is I do not say that there is a fortune in any business, even in normal times, and certainly not in agriculture, but there is a living in fair times for hard-working farmers.  People need not be wise after the event if there is not a good butter season next year.  I make the case that the creamery industry is vital to farming and is the foundation really of stock-rearing.  It is the soundest method in normal times, and especially in times that are not quite good.  With regard to Deputy Johnson's point I think it is not quite relevant, but I suppose I asked for it in my opening statement. He changed his ground a little bit, as the last time he criticised me he was advocating mixed farming instead of tillage.</P>

I take it that what the Deputy wants is to increase production and, in addition, to see that as many people as possible share in the benefits of increased production. His programme, so far as I see it, is that the farmers should till and give employment in that way, but he seems to object strongly to them feeding their own stock from their own tillage.  If I can read his statement at all, that is what he means.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difficulty about arguing this question.  Every farmer knows that he ought to produce some of his grain and some of his meal, and that he must buy others.  Denmark, which has 99 per cent. tillage, imports two and a half times its production in the way of tillage.  There are some foods that you might grow here in a glass-house, palmnut meal and cotton cake, highly protein foods.  It would be impossible to produce here all the foods that we need, even if 100 per cent. of the land were tilled.  There are some foods we must import.  But the real point is that by mixed farming, properly carried out, the industrious farmer will do far more tillage, produce far more of the food he can produce, and consequently produce more wealth and give more employment than either the farmer who goes in for cattle alone or for raising barley for sale as a cash crop.  All that is irrelevant, and I will leave it.</P>

That is a point that ought not to be allowed to go.  It is a very important point.  I am quite in agreement with the Minister in his view that people ought not to repudiate their debts, and I think it would be wrong and be bad for agricultural credit to allow it to go out from this House that farmers are repudiating <Col N="164" /> their debts.  As I know the facts, they are not actually repudiating their debts, but you will get at meetings, including meetings often attended by Ministers, men who make extreme statements, but these statements are not the feelings of men&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will have to come to that in rather a round-about way.  We have had a good deal of talk about the banks.  The banks, taking the report of the Banking Commission into account, are not to blame for the state of affairs now existing.  I could protest strongly against the attitude of the banks towards agricultural credit in the past three or four years.  The banks have not justified their existence towards agriculture.  I know something about the theory of banking.  But in regard to these men that the Minister has referred to, the banks have been dealing with them on a policy of &ldquo;heads I win and tails you lose.&rdquo;  The banks could not lose under any circumstances, but these men had to take any chance there was of losing.  I know case after case where money was lent to men where the principal man was not a responsible party, was not a mark for the money, and where decent, respectable farmers, who have always paid their debts and who have always intended to pay the debts they incurred, are being practically threatened with bankruptcy if the banks enforce their claims.  Naturally, these farmers are trying to safeguard themselves in some way.  The report of the Banking Commission offers an outlet, as the Minister knows.</P>

      <P>The Minister, when this Bill was previously before the Dáil, gave expression to the hope that some Deputy would test the feeling of the House, after a discussion had taken place, as to whether it was desirable that such a Bill should be inserted in the Constitution, and I am very glad indeed to respond to that request. Whether he had put it forward or not I would have endeavoured to ask the House to hesitate and to declare its will on the matter by a vote.  I think it is a very regrettable procedure that we should seek to assert in the Constitution, the fundamental law of the country, a measure of this kind, that is clearly, as I think, intended to meet a temporary situation and that is not required as the result of faults that have been exhibited in the present system. It is not remedying any fault that has been experienced, but is to meet what might appear to some to be a risk that a person who might be elected Ceann Comhairle in Dáil Eireann in the future will not be qualified by his previous experience to carry on the work satisfactorily, and in the making of that provision in the Constitution it is intended to alter the character of the representative assembly, Dáil Eireann. As has already been argued, the effect of passing this measure will be to introduce as one of the Deputies of Dáil Eireann in the future a person who has not been elected, is not responsible to any electorate, has a different standing in the House from every other Deputy, and yet has all the privileges of every other Deputy, if, perchance, he were <Col N="168" /> not elected by the House as its Chairman. Under such a provision in the Constitution it would be possible for a member of the House who has not been elected and is not responsible to any electorate, to hold office in the Executive Council.  It would even be possible for such a person to be President. While one might say it is an unlikely eventuality, still, we are dealing with constitutional forms, and we ought not to allow such a thing, which is obviously undesirable, to be possible.</P>
      <P>The effect of the introduction of this provision into the Constitution is to alter the character of something less than 1 per cent. of this House.  It is making that radical alteration without any real cause shown.  There is no necessity for it; there has not been the experience which imposes the obligation to make the change.  It is to meet what I think is a temporary desire, and may have to be altered if there are new changes, as there might well be, in the general electoral system. We are not merely dealing with an alteration of the electoral law; we are dealing with a change in the Constitution, and I am forced to object to making a change in the Constitution unless there is a necessity arising out of experience; unless there is need shown arising out of experience.  We are not in this Bill dealing with changes which are shown to be necessary by experience in the working out of the practical details of the Constitution, but we are introducing something entirely new and, as I think, quite uncalled for.  I therefore intend to ask the Dáil to vote against the motion for the passing of this Bill, and I hope all those who are conservative-minded in regard to changes of the Constitution, and those who have some regard for maintaining the representative character of the House, will support the rejection of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Throughout the stages of this Bill the Deputy, with what I might refer to as damnable iteration, stressed that this Bill was not based on any permanent factor, that it was simply an expression of a passing desire.  On the Second Stage and in Committee on the Bill, I endeavoured to rid his mind of that obsession  <Col N="169" /> and to show that it was based on a recognition of the permanent facts, on a recognition of the position in which the Ceann Comhairle is placed politically, as from the date of his election; based on the fact that, owing to the existence here of a Proportional Representation system of election, that peculiar form of special provision which is made to meet the circumstances of the case in Great Britain cannot be made here, even supposing it were desirable.  The question of whether it is desirable or not is one that could be discussed at great length. In Great Britain the constituency is in effect, in the result, disfranchised over a long period of years, because the heads of Parties agree between themselves not to contest what is called the Speaker's Seat.  The Speaker, from the nature of his position, cannot adequately represent in the Parliament that constituency, and the net result is that that constituency is not in fact represented. That is the provision there to meet the fact that when a man is called from the Assembly to preside over the Assembly, he is in fact divorced from politics, in the ordinary acceptance of that term; he is called from the service of his constituency to the service of the Parliament.  The Parliament becomes, so to speak, his constituency, his charge and his interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Owing to the existence here of Proportional. Representation, the special provision that is made in Great Britain to meet that case cannot be put into operation.  Where you have a constituency returning four or five members, you can make no provision by agreement between the heads of Parties or the Whips of Parties that would ensure the return of the Speaker in the way in which it is ensured in Great Britain.  What then is the position of the Speaker, who has presided, let us <Col N="170" /> say, over Parliament for five years? He has to face a constituency in competition with people who have throughout that period been free to nurse the constituency, as the phrase goes; to attend to its requirements, to voice its wishes in the Dáil, to make controversial political speeches before the electorate, and so on.  Is that a proper position?  You want as the presiding Chairman of your Assembly a person who will hold the scales fairly impartially between the political Parties represented here.  Is that consistent with active participation in cut-and-thrust party politics?  If it is not, should not that fact be recognised and provision made to meet it?  We cannot make the provision that is made in Great Britain because of certain circumstances here, because of the existence of Proportional Representation here.  Consequently, we have to devise our own provision to meet it, and the provision embodied in this Bill is not based on anything transitory, on anything nonpermanent. It is based on a recognition of the fundamental permanent aspects of the question.  I am quite sure I have not convinced the Deputy&mdash;I did not expect to&mdash;I am not of that over-sanguine disposition.  I have not made myself any clearer on this Stage than I tried to do on Second Reading and in Committee.  I do not think I have been able to invent anything new to say on the merits of the issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the Second Reading of the Town Tenants Bill, 1926, which stands in my name and in the name of Deputy Cosgrave.  In April 1924, I introduced a Bill in this House to improve the existing condition of tenants in towns and villages throughout the Saorstát. The Second Reading debate on that proposal took place on the 23rd May, 1924, and it was rejected by this House <Col N="173" /> on the 4th June of that year by a very small majority, amounting only to six. I do not desire to conceal from the House that the number of Deputies who supported that proposal was largely due to the fact that they supported the principles that it embodied more than the details which it contained. I was so impressed with that fact that, following a suggestion made by Deputy Magennis, I offered to withdraw that Bill if I received an assurance from the President that he would introduce a measure on behalf of the Government embodying similar terms at an early stage.</P>
      <P>I think it might be well to recall to the House what exactly took place at the concluding stage of the Second Reading of that measure.  I stated if the President could see his way to give an undertaking that a Bill embodying the principles, but not necessarily the actual terms, of this Bill would be introduced by the Government at the earliest possible date, I would certainly, in accordance with Deputy Magennis's suggestion, withdraw the Bill.  The President replied:</P>
      <P>I have given notice of something like forty Bills to come before the Dáil.  There are ten, and possibly more, in the incubation stage.  I am informed by the heads of the various Ministries that these are important measures.  That is the position in which I am, and in answer to the question, I am afraid I would have to say that, owing to the very large number of important measures that have got to be considered, I am not in a position to make a promise.  As a matter of fact, I have not brought it before the Executive Council.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Then he went on to show that the House would be occupied until the adjournment, also after the assembly in October up to the Christmas recess. That was in June, 1924, and, when asked would he introduce a measure such as this, the only reason given by the President for not doing so was that <Col N="174" /> he had not Parliamentary time at his disposal.  Well, over two and a half years have gone by since the President made that statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>What the President did say was:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;From what I know of the needs of the Government and of the various Ministries, there is legislation sufficient to occupy the whole of the time until the adjournment, also after the assembly in October up to the Christmas recess, and for some time after that.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If that is not Parliamentary time, I do not know the English language. That was two and a half years ago, and I waited during those two and a half years along with others to see some earnest of the Government's intention even to consider this question.  The time has been occupied in passing very many necessary measures, but I submit it has also been occupied in the introduction and passage of measures that have never been demanded or asked for, or, up to the time of their introduction, were even considered by the electorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I make no apology for coming now, two and a half years later, to propose a measure embodying similar principles to those which were contained in my first Bill.  But there has been delay even in regard to this measure. It has been postponed on no less than two occasions already, and it was not upon the occasion of its postponement that an announcement was made that the Commission was to be set up to deal with the question; it was within the space of only a few days afterwards that the announcement was made to a meeting in the country.  I say, with full <Col N="175" /> responsibility, that there has been deliberate delay on the part of the Government in dealing with the grievances of the town tenants.  Do the Government admit that they have any grievances? If they do not they must at least admit that these people think they have grievances.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal from the Government benches and also from Government spokesmen in the country of the phrase &ldquo;facing-up to it.&rdquo;  We have been called upon to face-up to facts.  In this regard I suggest that the Government have not faced-up to this question of town tenants, but have deliberately run away from it.  The whole policy is one of persistent procrastination, culminating in the constitution, at the eleventh hour, of a camouflage Commission to cover the conduct of the Government and to carry it over the General Election.  I have said a camouflage Commission.  This Commission was set up after I introduced my Bill, and we have no assurance when its report will be issued.</P>
    <P>On the contrary we have a definite statement from the President, made yesterday in this House, that he cannot give any assurance that the report will be issued during the lifetime of this Parliament, and we have not even got the further assurance that when that report is made there will be any legislation whatever based on it. It has not even been suggested in the terms of reference that this report is to be with a view to future legislation. I say that the institution of this Commission was nothing but a mere pis aller to shirk the issue, and possibly to provide the Government candidates at the coming election with an answer to the demands that will be made upon them by the townspeople of the Saorstát. If the Government had been serious in regard to this question during the last two and a half years surely they could have called together a conference, or they could have suggested it, even if it were not feasible?  There are in existence organisations both on behalf of the houseowners on the one side and the tenants on the other. Would it have been unreasonable for the Government to have suggested, <Col N="176" /> even if they could not have carried out that suggestion, that these people might possibly meet and discuss their differences?  No, such a thing was never dreamt of.  A Commission could have been set up during that period, but it was never even suggested. Furthermore, there would have been ample time to have had a conference or Commission.  We know we have had plenty of them on other subjects, but there would have been room for at least one more, and also for legislation by the Government on this question.</P>
    <P>I wonder before they set up this Commission did they consult anybody at all?  Are there representatives of the tenants on the Commission?  Are there representatives of the householders there?  I know there are representatives of the Rotary Club, but apart from the learned judge who is to preside over it, and who, I am sure, will devote his usual meticulous and painstaking care to the conduct of it, I fail to see what any of these gentlemen have in the nature of special recommendations for being placed upon a Commission to deal with the subject of the tenants in the towns of the Saorstát. I have been accused of raising this matter for election purposes as a vote-catching issue.</P>

      <P>I have not by the Minister, but I have been accused of raising this matter as a vote-catching question.  Well, I think, with respect, that the boot is upon the other foot.  I introduced the original Bill within the first seven months I was in this Dáil, and I did it on my own responsibility in redemption of a pledge I gave to the people who elected me to the Dáil.  But the Government did not even set up a Commission until within seven months of the coming general election.  I, therefore, submit that instead of my being accused of introducing this subject for electioneering purposes that it is all the other way about. The setting up of this Commission is, to my mind, nothing but pure political playacting on the eve of the election&mdash; playacting with a serious subject that should have demanded, and whose spokesmen did demand, immediate <Col N="177" /> attention when the Government took office.</P>
      <P>In view of the President's reply to me yesterday, which I must confess even I was rather surprised at, I feel bound to ask the House to proceed with the Second Reading of this Bill to-day.  This Bill proposes to do something&mdash;I do not say that it proposes to do everything&mdash;to meet, and to a certain extent ameliorate, the hardships, anomalies and grievances that exist in regard to the law relating to the tenants in the towns and villages of this country.  I do not seek to force the details of this Bill down either the throats of the Dáil or the country.  I take the same attitude I did in regard to my previous Bill.  What I am anxious about is that the principles embodied in the Bill should be recognised by this House just as they have been recognised with regard to agricultural tenants. I am not going to weary the House by again going into the details as to the history of the Land Acts, or the Town Tenants Act, because they must be familiar to Deputies, but I would impress upon them the fact that the Land Act of 1870, which at that time was a measure of considerable revolution in land legislation, provided for compensation and for disturbance for agricultural tenants, and that the principles of that Act were actually applied to the towns by the Town Tenants Act of 1906.  To say that because certain principles are applicable to land therefore they are inapplicable to other species of property is untenable.  These principles are well known: fixity of tenure, fair rent and a right to sale.</P>
      <P>These principles have been embodied in this Bill to deal with the existing conditions, and I want to impress that especially upon the House and the town dwellers in the Saorstát, because I surmise it will be argued here, as it was previously, that this measure is going to stop all house building in the Saorstát.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want at the outset, before I explain or enter into any details, to emphasise the fact that this measure proposes only to deal with existing conditions, and it goes so far as to propose that no house built in 1919 or subsequently shall come <Col N="178" /> under the purview of its provisions. The general application of this Act is very simple.  It applies to all holdings whether dwelling houses, business premises, or those used partly for dwelling houses and partly for business purposes, but there are certain exclusions, and they can be readily divided into what I term general exclusions and particular exclusions.  By general exclusions I mean exclusions from the whole Act. They number six.  In the first place the Act does not apply to furnished dwelling houses at all.  I will, perhaps, deal later with what I mean by furnished dwelling houses.  The other exclusions are ones that are made in the previous Bill, such as holdings let for temporary convenience, premises let to caretakers upon an agreement, holdings let to persons in the employment of the landlord, if the landlord requires the holdings for a future employee, houses erected under the Labourers Acts or the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, and houses erected after or in course of erection on the 2nd of April, 1919. These are the general exclusions.  The particular exclusions relate to the question of sale and the question of fair rent.</P>
    <P>On the question of sale it is proposed in this Bill that all dwelling houses be excluded so far as the tenants' right to sale goes, which means that the tenant shall have a right to sell if the premises he occupies are business premises, or partly business and partly dwelling ones, but in no other case, and also where the landlord desires to sell his interest, whether he be an immediate landlord or a ground or superior landlord, that in those cases the tenants shall be excluded.  In regard to the fair rent principles I have, as I did previously, excluded existing lease-holders&mdash;leaseholds for life or for a period of years until the expiry of that period.  Therefore, the Bill applies generally to all holdings with the exceptions I have mentioned.  Perhaps the House will bear with me while I very briefly go through the main heads of the measure.</P>
    <P>Section 1 deals with fixity of tenure, and is identical with the clause in my original Bill.  I may say that the same applies to Section 2, with the exception <Col N="179" /> that in Section 2 it is proposed in subsection 7 that during the currency of the statutory term which is proposed to be ten years the tenant may, if new or altered circumstances arise, apply to the Court for leave to have a fair rent fixed.  As to the liability of the landlord for repairs, that also remains the same.  Now I come to the question of sales.  This was really the pivot of the whole discussion on the last occasion. In many essential respects this Bill differs from the last one on the question of sale.  Here, as I have said, no tenant shall have the right to sell his interest unless he occupies business or partly business premises.  I would like especially to draw the attention of certain Deputies to this restriction.  I was particularly impressed on the last occasion by Deputy Johnson's argument, that if there was a right for every tenant to sell his interest in, say, his dwelling-house that there would possibly be created what is called a competition or a demand for key money.  That, by this proposal, is entirely eliminated.  In regard to a tenant's right to purchase, first of all, let me say, and it is well that Deputies should realise this, that the tenant will have no right whatever to purchase unless the landlord desires to sell.  If the landlord desires to sell, then what is proposed in this Bill is that the tenant should have the first option: that he should have the first right to purchase.  That is the whole proposal contained in Sections 5 and 6. That shall not apply to tenements.</P>
    <P>In regard to all the sections dealing with sale and with the prices to be fixed by the Court, I draw particular attention to this clause which I have inserted in all these sections.  It reads as follows: &ldquo;The Court, in fixing the price, shall have regard to the state of the premises, the interest of the landlord and tenant respectively therein, and all the circumstances of the case.&rdquo; That applies to the occasion when the tenant desires to sell his interest and to the occasion when he desires to purchase, the landlord having intimated his intention to sell.  That being so, I think that the landlord is amply safeguarded, because, as is proposed in this Bill, these questions of price shall be <Col N="180" /> fixed by the Circuit Court judge, and this clause shall govern and guide him in the fixing of these prices.  There is no suggestion here, as there was in a previous Bill, of any fixed price, such as ten to fifteen years' purchase.  It shall be entirely at the discretion of the Circuit Court judge, having regard to the nature of the holding, the interests of both parties, and all the circumstances of the case.  For instance, if a tenant was only a short time in a business premises and he desired to sell it, no Circuit Court judge in his commonsense or discretion would give him the same price as if he had been there for a long term of years, and had built up a most successful business.  Now, so much in regard to the main principles of the Bill proposed now and the principles similar to the ones which the previous Bill embodied, but there are two entirely new proposals contained in Section 8 and 9.  In Section 8 it is proposed that the landlord should be liable for rates where the valuation does not exceed £5.  I do not think that is a very excessive demand.</P>
    <P>In regard to Section 9, I admit that this is an entirely new proposal, but I have put it in.  I throw it out for the serious consideration of the House.  Up to this no ground landlord has been liable for rates.  The intermediate landlord has been to a certain extent sometimes, but not always, but the tenant always has been.  I think that it is only fair and equitable that a man who derives rent from ground upon which houses have been built and other people occupy and have to pay a heavy burden of rates on, that that person should contribute something to the rates, because this property certainly has not been deteriorating by its occupation. In very many cases indeed it has been increasing in value.  In many cases, too, the ground landlord is an absentee. We know cases&mdash;I could mention them if I so desired&mdash;not very far from Dublin where there are ground landlords who scarcely ever put a foot upon the ground from which they draw their rents and who contribute nothing to the rates of the district.  Take, for instance, the large estates in the suburbs of Dublin.  Take the case of <Col N="181" /> Dun Laoghaire, where there are ground rents payable and where there is no contribution made to the rates by the ground landlord.  I put forward this suggestion in this Bill as part of a measure to ameliorate and improve the lot of existing tenants in the towns in these districts.  Now I have suggested that the Circuit Court should be the proper court to decide the matters contained in this Bill, such as fixing rents and prices for the purposes of sale.  It may be said that the Circuit Courts are already overburdened with work.  With that statement I am in entire agreement.</P>
    <P>That, after all, is purely a question of machinery, and, being a private member, I thought it better on this occasion to take advantage of the existing courts than to suggest the expenditure of more money upon the creation of new ones.  However, if it is so desired, it could be done, and that, of course, is not a vital matter to the principles contained in the Bill.  There will, of course, be objections to the Bill. There would be objections to any Town Tenants Bill introduced here, and, possibly, from the same quarters, but there are a few outstanding features in the Bill of which we must not lose sight. There is nothing in the nature of compulsory purchase in the first instance. There is no State purchase.  There is no question of the compounding of arrears. There is no interference with existing leaseholders and no interference with proposed or existing housing schemes, and there is nothing whatever in the Bill to thwart, hinder, prevent, or frighten anyone in this country from putting his money into house property in the future.</P>
    <P>The basic principles that I will endeavour to go upon are really ones of mere justice to the dwellers in the towns.  We have had Acts passed innumerable dealing with the unfortunate conditions of farmers in the past, with the conditions of agricultural labourers, and even with the conditions of certain classes of artisans, but nothing has been done for a class of people who have been clamouring to have their grievances remedied, certainly for the last twenty-five or thirty <Col N="182" /> years.  Something must be done for them, and in the proposal that I make I submit that by helping them I am injuring nobody, that the landlord gets fair treatment, that the tenant's position is improved, that no harm is done to the prospective building of houses, that there will be no such competition as was mentioned on the last occasion for key money, and neither will there be what has been suggested, the creation of dual ownership.  The only instance where there is to be anything in the nature of dual ownership, which should exist I submit, is that, as provided for in Section 4, where a man is in occupation of a business premises and built up a successful business, he should have the right to sell the goodwill of that business.  That is the only instance where anything in the nature of dual ownership is recognised.  All other cases really seek to abolish dual ownership, because they give the right to the tenant to purchase and to the landlord to sell.  I do not intend to detain the House by going into further details, but I would ask members, especially those who voted on the last occasion, to vote in favour of this measure upon this occasion also.  If anything, this Bill errs on the side of moderation. It does not set out to do everything that has been demanded by the town tenants in the Saorstát, but it seeks to mete out justice all round, and any member who votes for the Second Reading will be showing that he is serious in his endeavour to do something for this class of people in the country and that he is not satisfied to leave their case to a vague, nebulous, camouflaged Commission, the report of which we do not know will ever be published or ever acted upon.</P>

      <P>I beg to second the motion.  I consider it my duty as a public representative to support this Bill.  The present conditions in towns and urban areas in Ireland are known to us all and call for immediate legislative action.  The principles embodied in this Bill are plain and simple.  They are principles of fixity of tenure, free sale, and fair rent, which should, in my opinion at all events, be acceptable to any Government. Deputies should remember with <Col N="183" /> gratitude the services rendered by town tenants to every national movement since the days of O'Connell.  They were most liberal with their subscriptions at all times to every national cause.  They were active workers in the Land League days by assisting the tenant farmers to get rid of landlordism. In fact, they worked with might and main in every movement that was organised for the betterment of their fellow-citizens.  Are they now to be told that their grievances are not going to be redressed?  I have confidence that the majority of the Deputies in the Dáil will support this Bill, which, if passed, will bring joy and happiness into the homes and families of one of the most deserving classes of the community.</P>

      <P>Deputy Redmond explained that he made no apologies for the introduction of this Bill, and then he gave, not an apology, but an explanation, as to why he introduced this Bill and its predecessor.  The explanation was perfectly simple and, so far as I am concerned, perfectly satisfactory. Deputy Redmond wished to get into Parliament, a most legitimate and laudable ambition, and certain people said that they would put him into Parliament if he would introduce a Bill of this kind.  He did, and they did, and we have this Bill.  Deputy Redmond gave an undertaking, and in a perfectly straightforward way is attempting now, for the second time, to fulfil that undertaking.

      <P>I cannot hear the Deputy.  I make no complaint about the introduction of this Bill, or its predecessor, by the Deputy in these circumstances. If I put an interrogation mark anywhere it is, perhaps, to raise the question whether the undertaking represents the Deputy's or, to be more accurate, the prospective Deputy's considered views on the merits of the case, or whether it is an expression of the extent of his desire to secure election? Something would, of course, depend on <Col N="184" /> that.  If the Deputy feels convinced that this Bill and its predecessor embody a fair and equitable adjustment of the relation between house owners on one hand and house occupiers on the other, he was frankly entitled to give the undertaking he gave and <i>a fortiori</i> entitled to keep that undertaking.  Personally, I do not feel any such conviction about the Bill.  I am not satisfied, in the absence of a very full examination, that the principles embodied in the Bill are the principles that ought to govern the relationship between those who build and own, or those who build or own, houses on the one hand and those who rent and occupy them on the other.  The Deputy explained that he was not insisting on details. He is not insisting on details in this Bill, but takes up with regard to it the same pretty tolerant attitude which he took up in regard to the previous Bill. He is in no way rigid on details, but on such details as fixity of tenure, free rent and fair sale, I take it, the Deputy is insisting.  Would the Deputy correct me if I am wrong?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite right.  We have heard talk of what the Deputy chose to refer to as a camouflage Commission. We heard quite a lot about the history of this Bill and his original Bill. I will trouble the Dáil with some little history on this matter also.  In 1923 we passed an Act bearing on the question of the relationship between houseowners and tenants, the Rent Restriction Act.  We recognised that a rather special situation existed with regard to housing in the country, arising out of the six or seven years' complete cessation of housing activities, and we felt that it was necessary in the interests of the community to continue legislation, to continue with some modifying legislation, what had been enacted to deal with that particular problem by the British Parliament.  We passed our first Act on the matter in 1923.  It had a lifetime of three years, and in 1926 the problem came to be considered again in the light of the circumstances then existing.  The decision that was taken <Col N="185" /> at that time was that the policy to be adopted should be one of gradual decontrol, and on the 24th June an Act was passed entitled &ldquo;an Act to continue and amend the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Restriction Act, 1923.&rdquo; I might summarise the provisions of that Act.  Outside Dublin, the limit of protection was to fall immediately from £40 to £30 a year, should fall again in June, 1927, from £30 to £25, and again in June, 1929, from £25 to £20.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there are three periods.  We are at present in the first period, and on the 24th June, 1929, control was to expire in the absence of further legislation.  I take the view in 1926 as in 1923 that a three-year period was as much as we should try to legislate for in that particular matter, that we are entitled to say to the Parliament which may be in existence in 1929 that it should reconsider the situation de novo in the light of the circumstances with regard to the supply of houses in 1929.  That was the view of the <Col N="186" /> Oireachtas six months ago on the extent of State interference between landlord and tenant.  The interference was to become less and less for the next three years and then, in the absence of further legislation, to disappear.  It is within five or six months of a Bill of that nature that this Bill is introduced, and one might expect that if a Bill bearing on the relations between landlord and tenant were to be introduced so soon after the Increase of Rent Restriction Act, 1926, it would be a Bill correcting and modifying that Bill in some matter of detail.  This Bill is not such a Bill.  It is a Bill of the most far-reaching kind, not temporary in its nature, purporting to govern, and to govern, so far as the Deputy can achieve it at any rate, for all time the relations between landlord and tenant in every city, town and village in the Free State.  Whether the rent is 10/- a week for a cottage or £12 a week for a shop in the heart of Dublin, the Bill deals with all.  There is no discrimination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, but the difference is this, that the Rent Restrictions Act was professedly and on the face of it confined to a three years' period.  The effect of this Bill is, whether the tenant be the occupant of a cottage in a back street in a provincial town or the occupant of a shop in Grafton Street, that he shall hold against the owner for all time so long as he pays the rent.  The provisions of this Bill mean that the effective ownership passes from him who is now the owner to him who is now the occupier, and the previous owner becomes an annuitant, the annuity to be charged on a house which was previously his property, and the extent of that annuity to be fixed by the Circuit Court.  That is the proposal; that is the principle of a Bill which, according to the Deputy introducing it, errs on the side of moderation.  I wonder what the Deputy's conception of extreme measures would be in the matter of dealing with property.  It must be one of the many joys of an Independent Deputy who, incidentally, is in opposition, <Col N="187" /> to be able to deal frivolously with grave matters without doing any great harm to anybody.</P>

He made it clear on Second Reading that he was unaware of many of its most important provisions.  It struck me very forcibly that he had not read the Bill, and, as I say, I feel quite sure that the Deputy never for a moment contemplated that the Bill would become law.  I submit that the position is substantially the same with regard to the present Bill, that the Deputy knows that it will not become law, and does not, in the solitude of his own mind, wish it to become law.  Up to 1929 the relationship between landlord and tenant is governed by the Act which we passed six months ago.  Within that time there can be full and fair and scientific examination of the merits of this issue.</P>

I am not prepared to introduce on my own initiative, or to accept on the Deputy's initiative, a Bill governing this matter, without having a much fuller examination than has yet been given to it.  I am in this difficulty with regard to the Bill: that I do not want to prejudice <Col N="188" /> the Commission that has been set up. I want the fairest hearing to be given by it to everything that can be urged on one side or the other.  Let the case for fixity of tenure, fair rent and free sale be made before that Commission. Let the case for the application to house property of the principles underlying land legislation be made there.  Personally, at the moment I do not see it. I am open to a conviction on the matter, but I know that a house is the product of labour and capital, just as my coat or my boots, and I know that, in looking into a shop and seeing a pair of boots which I would like to possess, I do not haul the owner into the Circuit Court to have the price fixed.</P>

I can see, and I am sure the Deputy can see, the difference between that kind of property, property created by a combination of labour and capital, and land that was not created by the landlord nor by anyone from whom he inherited.  But we are to apply in the most reckless way the principles to the one that it was considered wise to apply to the other.  We are to accept the same ideas with regard to house property&mdash;dual ownership, and so on&mdash;that evolved with regard to land.  I want to hear the case, and I want to know what the reactions would be in a variety of directions to the acceptance of those principles in a question of that kind.  On the question of the reactions on house property the Deputy was very careful. He said: &ldquo;I guarded against that; I fortified myself against any argument of that kind.  My Bill errs, if it errs at all, on the side of moderation, and applies only to houses that were built prior to 1919.&rdquo;  So that the principles that were sound and wise with regard to all the houses in the State built prior to 1919 would be unsound, unwise, and wrong to apply to all the <Col N="189" /> houses in the State built subsequent to 1919.</P>

      <P>Somebody other than Deputy Redmond can see that the gap is jumped, that the principle shall be applied all round, as, of course, if it was a right and sound principle it ought to be.  There is very little in that argument.  The Deputy foresaw&mdash;it was not very wonderful that he should foresee&mdash;that people would query the reactions of this Bill on housing activity and enterprise, and he said that that argument must be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that that section is taken completely out of the Rent Restriction Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I will deal with that.  But Deputy Redmond and Deputy Cosgrave, in grave consultation, said: &ldquo;Now, that would be a very serious argument, if we were told that we were going to prevent housing activities, that we were going to divert capital that is now beginning to flow in the direction of that form of enterprise to some other form of enterprise it would be a serious charge against the Bill,&rdquo; and Deputy Redmond said: &ldquo;I see what I will do.  I will make this Bill applicable only to houses built prior to 1919, and if there is any comment about that I will say that I have copied the Rent Restrictions Act in that respect.&rdquo;  But there is some difference, after all, between a Bill that is to last for ever and a Bill with a lifetime of three years, a Bill that purports frankly, on the face of it, to be purely occasional, temporary in its character, in its period of operation, most rigidly defined and confined, to a Bill that proposes to provide a basis for all time for the relationship between the house owner and the house occupant.  The reactions of this Bill on <Col N="190" /> private enterprise in the matter of housing, or for that matter, on the enterprise of public authorities in the matter of housing, must be most carefully examined.  If these proposals for the application to house property of the principle of land legislation are to be adopted they must be adopted after the case has been made and very fully examined by competent persons.  If these proposals are to be incorporated in the law we must be sure, surer than Deputy Redmond can make us, that we are doing what is sound and wise and what will not react disastrously on the interests of the community.  The Commission to examine this question on be half of the Executive Council has been constituted; its terms of reference have been published.  The President was asked yesterday if he could guarantee that the report of the Commission would come in the lifetime of the present Parliament.  It would be an extraordinary thing, having asked a High Court judge and four other laymen to perform this work in a purely honorary way, to proceed to set a period to their deliberations.  Could one do it? Could one say at the beginning of any Commission: &ldquo;This Commission will take X days or Y weeks&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to 1929 there is not, in any real sense of the word, any urgency in this problem, such as it is, whatever its dimensions may be found to be on examination.  The Commission will give due consideration to whatever case can be made on one side or the other, and if its report is to be a valuable report these men who are doing that work in a purely honorary way <Col N="191" /> cannot be driven at their work, either in the actual process of investigation&mdash; the collection of evidence&mdash;or in the preparation of their report.  It would have been, I think, wrong and unfair to the Commission if the President had given such a guarantee as was asked for yesterday.  The Commission may report within the lifetime of the present Parliament, but if it does report within the lifetime of the present Parliament, it would be too much to expect that a Bill based broadly on its report would be introduced within the lifetime of the present Parliament.  I should think that its report will almost certainly be ready early in the period of the next Parliament for whatever Government it falls to be considered by then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Redmond said he had no apologies for his Bill.  Very good.  He gave the explanation of the Bill's introduction, and I accepted it.  I have no apologies for such delay as there has been in the setting up of this Commission. We find ourselves in this position, that we are compelled from day to day and week to week to endeavour to deal with matters according to our conception of their relative importance, their relative urgency.  This was not an urgent matter.  The Commission will commence its sittings inside of the next week or so, and I hope that whatever case there is for the principles that are embodied in Deputy Redmond's Bill will be made fully, skilfully and clearly before that Commission.  I hope also that those who have conflicting interests will make their case.  I am entirely confident that Judge Meredith and his colleagues on the Commission will give all due consideration to the representations that are made before them.  I feel quite confident that persons will vote for this Bill who, if they formed the Executive Council of this State, would not introduce it.  If Deputy Redmond sat here in these benches with the responsibility that rests on the men who sit in these benches, he would not introduce it.  He certainly would not introduce it without the matter having been investigated by a public Commission, and without being reinforced by the report of such Commission.  And because the matter <Col N="192" /> has not yet been investigated by such Commission, is only about to be investigated by such Commission, we will not accept the Bill, and we ask the Dáil to reject it.</P>

      <P>It is to be hoped, in the interests of a very large section of the people of this country, that the members of this Commission will not approach this matter, when they come to examine it, in the same frame of mind as the Minister has dealt with it. He started off by dealing with Deputy Redmond's motives for introducing the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister then went on to denounce the Bill and all that it contained, and when he had concluded his denunciation he told us that he wanted to hear the case for it made.  He had sufficient case made to denounce the Bill, and he wanted to have a case made for the Bill after denouncing it.  He told us in passing, of course, that he did not want to do anything that might prejudice the minds of the members of the Commission.  I should like to know if it would be possible for the Minister to say anything more likely to prejudice the minds of the Commission than he has said.  The Minister talked about taking action which might have disastrous effects on the community.  Has the Minister any regard for the interests of that great section of the community which this Bill deals with?  I do not believe he has.  He has tried to frighten&mdash;if I might use the word&mdash;the members of the Dáil who are not members of his own Party by implying that if this Bill were passed there would be an end to all ownership of houses, there would be an end to building, and so on.  Of course there was no necessity to use any arguments as far as the members of his own Party were concerned, because we all know that his own Party decided long before they heard one word spoken about the Bill to vote against it.</P>

I am sorry the Minister for Justice has left the House, because I do not want to be unfair to him, and I should like to know what he meant exactly when he said that he was not satisfied that the principles contained in this Bill were the principles which should govern the relationship between landlord and tenant.  Leaving out the details of the Bill altogether, would the Minister for Justice or the President tell us whether the Government are prepared to accept the principles of fixity of tenure and fair rent?  In other words, will the President tell us whether the Government are prepared to accept the principle that a man should not be evicted from his house so long as he pays what had been decided by the courts of the country to be a fair rent to his landlord?  Will the President give us any information on that?</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has not answered my question about a fair rent.  I was for a long time a member of the Dublin Corporation, and I had some experience in connection with what is called the fixing of a fair rent in connection with property owned by the city.  I have a knowledge of what it means, but I have not heard it explained by Deputy Morrissey or Deputy Redmond, and I hesitate to think they know nothing about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might be allowed to explain.  It is explained in three sections of this Bill&mdash; Sections 4, 5 and 6.  There is a governing clause in each section which states:</P>
      <P>Whereupon the court shall fix the price, and the court in fixing the price shall have regard to the holding, the interests of the owner and the tenant in actual occupation respectively, and all the circumstances of the case.</P>
      <P>That is what I propose to be the basis of a fair rent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I put a very straight question to the President.  As we cannot get an answer from the President, perhaps the Minister for Justice will give us an answer, as he dealt with the matter.  Does the Government accept the principle that tenants have the right to be left in the house that they occupy so long as they pay a fair rent to the landlord?  If the <Col N="195" /> President thinks that that is too fine for him, will he say if the landlord should not be entitled to exact the highest rent that he can get for the house in the present shortage of houses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked a question dealing with rents as if a house in Grafton Street were the same as a house in Nenagh.  There is not the same agreement as to value.  A house in Grafton Street is valued according to what it would let at if put up to public auction.  In the case of the Dublin Corporation, a valuation was always obtained.  If the person in occupation objected to that valuation, he procured one from another valuer.  If there was a difference between them, an effort was made to come to an accommodation.  In the event of no accommodation being come to, the premises were put up to public auction. That was the rule, and that rule was subscribed to by the then leaders and supporters of the Labour Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission is set up with a view to inquiring into what amendments of the law, if any, are necessary, and to probe the question and hear the evidence given by Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Redmond, if they have any to give, pointing out what the weaknesses of the law are at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>The President has answered a question which I did not <Col N="196" /> ask him.  Perhaps somebody from the Government benches will answer the question I did ask.  I do not want to go so far as Deputy Redmond has gone in connection with this Commission which has been set up, but certainly, by the very evasive way that the President is dealing with this matter, I shall be compelled to say it is the merest eyewash and that the Government have no intention whatever of acting upon any report that will be brought in by the Commission&mdash;certainly not if the report is in the interests of the tenants.  In view of the attitude taken up on the questions I have asked, I think it is not unfair to say that.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice told us he was not satisfied that the principles embodied in the Bill should be the principles which should govern the relationship between landlord and tenant.  He was not satisfied, in other words, that there should be any such thing as fixity of tenure or fair rents in this country.  What we are told, in effect, is unless the landlords of houses in this country are allowed to exact the highest rents which they can get, particularly in the existing circumstances when there is a great shortage of houses, there will be no house-building. I want to know if what was implied in the statement made by the Minister for Justice, that he is not satisfied that there should be any such thing as fixity of tenure or fair rents, represents the Government's view as a whole.  The tenants want to know where they stand in this matter.</P>
      <P>I would like the President to tell the House what he meant in Waterford a few months ago when he asked the people to return his Government to power again so that they might be in a position to do something for the town tenants.  If the President did not mean to give them security in their homes so long as they paid their rents, and if he did not mean to provide machinery to have fair rents fixed, what did he mean when he asked that his Government be returned to power so that they might be able to do something for the town tenants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What did the Minister for Finance mean when, on his Western tour with the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, <Col N="197" /> he said he would be prepared to vote for a reasonable Town Tenants Bill?  I suppose it would all depend on his view of what a reasonable Town Tenants Bill would be.</P>

      <P>I think the principles of the Bill are reasonable.  I am prepared to admit that if the Bill got a Second Reading it would require to be amended, and amended very considerably. But we can take it, I suppose, that the Government do not believe in the principles of security of tenure and fair rents.  If the President and the Government Party have any desire to do anything for the town tenants, they are in the position now to do it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>The President has power now to deal with the question of the town tenants.  He has full power now to have a Bill passed dealing with town tenants. The President and his party are well aware of that.  There is no use in saying: &ldquo;We can do nothing until we get information.&rdquo;  I suggest to the Minister for Justice that all the information he is likely to get from this Commission was given before a Committee of Inquiry which sat in 1923. The evidence given there, so far as I could learn, by numbers of people representing the different interests affected should certainly be sufficient, and I think there should be enough evidence at the Minister's disposal to enable him to bring in a Bill which would secure, at least, that a man would be safe in his own house and that he would not be flung out on the side of the road so long as he paid his rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="198" /> The great point, or what is considered to be the great point, made against a Bill of this sort&mdash;it is a point which would hold equally against any Town Tenants Bill&mdash;is that it is going to affect housing.  I suggest to the President and to the House that the agitation for legislation is more likely to injure or retard the building of houses than actual legislation itself, because the house owners are pretending to picture in their minds&mdash;I must say they are helped in that direction by some of the Ministers&mdash;that a Bill introduced to safeguard the interests of town tenants is going to mean confiscation of property; that the landlord might as well get out, and that there is no use in building any more houses.  That is not so.  I suggest there is a greater sense of insecurity and uncertainty in a continued agitation for legislation than if the legislation were actually passed&mdash;reasonable and fair legislation.</P>
    <P>The House can take it from me, from my knowledge of the position in the country, that if this Bill or some similar Bill&mdash;I do not care by what Party it is introduced&mdash;is not passed, that agitation will certainly grow, will become more strong, and eventually either this or some other Government will be forced to recognise and act upon it. Those who oppose this Bill or its principles will certainly find, when they go to the country, that there is a far greater demand for legislation of this nature than they appear to think at the moment.  I cannot see why there should not be security for a man who is a good tenant and who is prepared to pay his rent regularly and to take reasonable care of the landlord's house; I cannot see why such a tenant should not have security in his home.</P>
    <P>We are told by Ministers, and by the spokesmen of the landlords and the House Owners' Association, that if this Bill were passed it would destroy the security of the country.  What security is there in the country for any tenant if he is not secure in his home, or if he is not secure in the business-house where he is making his living?  The Minister talks about having security under the Rent Restrictions Act.  The position under the Rent Restrictions <Col N="199" /> Act is this: next June houses of a certain valuation come out from under control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I will let the Minister name that when I am finished. Houses come out from under control next June and the landlords will then be entitled to charge any rent they please for these houses.  If they do not get that rent they are entitled to go into the court, get a decree, and evict the tenant.  I will skip the next year and go on to 1929, when control goes altogether and landlords will be entitled in respect of every house, whether it is three pence or three pounds per week, to claim any rent which they can exact from tenants.  If tenants refuse to pay&mdash;many of them will have to refuse because they will be unable to pay&mdash;then out they go.</P>
      <P>We talk about security in the country. Security for what and for whom? Surely, if a man is not secure in his home, if he has not a roof over his head and over the heads of his family, it does not matter very much to him what other sort of security there is in the country.  Does the Minister or anybody else think that that sense of insecurity, that sense of injustice, felt by perhaps one-fourth of the population of the country, is going to lead to the welfare of the State or help the stability of the country?  If the Minister thinks that, he is living in a fool's paradise.  Does he think that those people are going to have great regard for this House?  What stake have they in the country?  Why, they have not any assurance in regard to the houses they live in.  Even with the rent paid they are not sure that they are going to be left there.  A tenant in that position has not very much of a stake in the country, and he is not very much concerned about the stability or so-called credit that people refer to.</P>
      <P>We are told by the Chairman of the House Owners' Association, Senator Sir John Keane, that this measure is out to confiscate the property of the house owners.  I want to quote a case for the House here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="200" /> There is a lady in Cappoquin, Co. Waterford, who had a lease for 66 years from the Chairman of the House Owners' Association.  The lease expired in 1922.  The landlord, a couple of years afterwards, demanded an increase of 50 per cent. in the rent, that £200 should be spent in repairs on the houses, and that a new lease be taken out.  Now, seeing the three houses concerned were built by the tenant's grandfather, and seeing Sir John Keane or his predecessors never put as much as a slate on those houses, the tenant naturally refuses to pay a 50 per cent. increase.  What happened? The tenant has been served with notice to quit from the houses that were built by her grandfather and has been served with a civil bill for £50 for over-holding. I wonder is the confiscation on the side of the house-owner or the tenant in that case.  Here is the Chairman of the House Owners' Association and he wants to confiscate the three houses if he does not get 50 per cent increase on the ground rent.  He wants to confiscate three houses upon which he never paid one halfpenny and never put one slate.  That is just one case, but it shows how much there is in this talk about confiscation.</P>
    <P>So far as I am personally concerned, I do not stand for any confiscation of anybody's property.  I want to be just as fair to the landlord as to the tenant. So far as I know, the vast majority of the tenants of this country do not want to grab landlords' property.  Even if you put a purchase clause in the Bill it is not going to be very much use to the vast majority of the tenants.  They will not take advantage of it because they will not be in a position to purchase. They are certainly entitled, if there is to be any security at all, to be able to say this: &ldquo;I cannot be shifted out of the home I have built up for myself and my family so long as I pay my just obligation&mdash;a fair rent set up by a Court of this State.&rdquo;  If there is anything unreasonable or unjust in that proposition, I cannot see it.  There has been talk about confiscation, but I know and can speak for a good many tenants not only in my own constituency but for tenants in a good many parts of the country, and I say that <Col N="201" /> they have no desire to confiscate any landlord's property or do any injustice to any landlord, but they certainly do not want the present conditions to continue. When the Minister or other members of the House, or people outside the House, talk about the laws which govern the relationship between landlord and tenant, we ought to remember that all the laws which have been made in that respect were made by the landlords and in the interest of landlords.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Captain Redmond introduced the Bill, I understood it was really in the interest of the town tenants.  I did not think we were going to get a measure dealing with the question in a half-hearted way such as this Bill does.  Mild, however, as the Bill is, I am compelled as a tenant to support it.  This Government must exist, and to my mind it is the opinion of the Government that the town tenants are not citizens of the Saorstát at all, that they are simply nonentities who have no say whatever in election times, and that they have nothing to pay for administration in the way of taxes.  Consequently the Government supports the landlords all the time.  We heard a good deal about the Rents Restrictions Act this afternoon.  I admit that there are clauses in that Act which protect the tenant.  I do not see what harm this Bill, if accepted, would do the State.  It is very mild.  It specifies that the landlord of every holding to which the Act applies where the poor law valuation does not exceed £5 shall be liable for the rate on such holding. That one clause alone will be of great advantage to poor tenants living in towns.  Even since the Rent Restriction Act was introduced landlords have increased the tenants rents and compelled them to pay the poor rate.  This Bill gives the landlord the right to increase <Col N="202" /> the rent.  I do not think that in any Town Tenants Bill the landlord should have a right to increase the rent.  If a house was built before 1914, and purchased by the landlord for a very small sum, I do not see why he should have the right to increase the rent in 1927. I hold that the members of the Government, and all the candidates going forward on behalf of the Government in the 1923 election, promised that if returned they would see justice done to the people in the towns.</P>
      <P>Captain Redmond appealed this afternoon to Deputies who voted for the last Bill to vote for this, but I appeal to Deputies who voted against that Bill to vote now for this one, and keep the promises they made to the people who elected them to this House. The question of the town tenants has been before the Dáil on several occasions, and when dealing with it Ministers have said that the town tenants need no legislation, and that this is not a question of urgency.  Is it not a question of urgency if you take the case of a house that was let in 1917 or 1918 at 1/6 per week and for which 5/- per week is paid now, and I know dozens of cases of this kind?  I may be told that these tenants have the Rent Restriction Act to protect them, but ordinary working men and women do not want to disgrace themselves by going into the court, even against the landlords, and they prefer to be victimised by paying the additional 3/6.  We have been told this Commission has been set up to see what could be done on behalf of town tenants, or to see whether there are any real grounds for complaint. I ask the Minister for Justice if Deputy Redmond had not introduced this Bill, would the Commission have been set up?</P>

      <P>For the last three <Col N="203" /> months, but a Bill was introduced in 1924 on behalf of the town tenants, and since that Bill was defeated until this Bill was introduced a Commission was not appointed.  I do not believe that it is the intention of the Government supporters, Deputies selected on the Cumann na nGaedheal ticket, to vote against this Bill.  I believe they have not the heart to do it.  I feel confident these Deputies will stand by their constituents and will, like men, adhere to the promises they gave and say &ldquo;Tá&rdquo; when it come to a division.  We are to have the report of the Commission brought before the next Dáil by whatever Government may be here.

Will the report of the Commission be like the report of the Old Age Pension Commission, which, after two years, has not been yet circulated?  The reports of these Commissions, to my mind, are the same as a bottle of smoke.  When a puff of air comes along it takes away the report, which evaporates into the elements and is seen no more.  The question has been asked in connection with this Bill: &ldquo;What is a fair rent&rdquo;?  Deputy Redmond has explained what he means by a fair rent, but in my opinion it is the rent that a worker, trader, official or any other person can pay either on his wages, salary, income or profits.  I want to see justice done to the landlord as well as to the tenant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if it gets a second reading; but I certainly do not agree to pay a landlord 50 per cent. or 60 per cent. increase on a house built in prewar <Col N="204" /> days.  When a lease expires you cannot in some cases get a renewal except you pay 50 per cent. increase.  Deputy Morrissey gave the case of the chairman of the Householders' Association and one of his tenants.  There are other cases to be put forward.  In Mullingar, Moate, Longford and Granard there are several traders whose lease expired within the past eighteen months.  In one particular case a house was let for £40 a year.  Those people now cannot get their leases renewed unless they pay £64 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same thing applies in the towns that I have mentioned, and if necessary I could give the names of the tenants and the landlords to the Minister for Justice.  The Rent Restriction Act certainly helps the tenant who has the pluck to take his landlord to court, but in the case of a workman who has a house from his employer he is not going to take him to court supposing the employer increases his rent, because he knows very well that if he did so he would lose his job.  There are dozens of cases of that description in the country and they are an argument for the Bill that Deputy Redmond has brought forward.  I am sure the Minister for Justice, as well as other Ministers and their supporters, appreciate the efforts of the Deputy in putting forward this Bill.  I am convinced that they will allow a free vote for its Second Reading.  If the Minister for Justice were to say &ldquo;I am as much in favour of the people in the towns as I am of the people of the country, and I feel rather jealous of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture passing a Land Act which enables uneconomic landholders to reach an economic position, and I am going to do the same for tenants in the towns in order to prove that I am as good a man as he is.&rdquo; We might light a spark between these two Ministers that would create friction in the interests of the town tenants.  I sincerely hope that every Deputy in the House will vote in favour of this Bill.  I believe it is a Bill that will do a lot to help on the movement for the erection of more houses.  I do not agree with the letters that have appeared in the Press from the Householders' Association stating <Col N="205" /> that this Bill will prevent the erection of houses.  I do not believe it will have that effect.  If this Bill is not passed, then in the year 1929, when the Rent Restrictions Act will go off the Statute Book, you will have people being turned out of their houses as the farmers were in the old Land League days.  If the people rise up against action of that kind, are you going to shoot them down?  I daresay it might happen.  You cannot tell what is going to happen in the interests of the capitalists.  The people in the towns want to get some fixity in their holdings, and they are appealing to the Government to assist them in that.  In conclusion I hope every Deputy in the House will support this Bill.</P>

      <P>I am not quite sure how far Deputy Lyons has succeeded in making converts amongst Ministers. He has almost succeeded in convincing me of one thing, and that is the utter futility of any kind of legislation. What is the use of trying to pass a Town Tenants Bill, a Rent Restriction Act or anything else if people are too shy to go into court to claim their rights?  This Bill would be of no use to those modest tenants referred to by Deputy Lyons.  They have rights under the Rent Restrictions Act, but they do not exercise them.  If this Bill were passed they would also have rights under it, but I presume they would be too shy to exercise them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that one of my employees did that on one occasion, and his father is still in my employment. I now come to the general question. I regret that I missed the opening part of Deputy Redmond's remarks, but listening to him later, I did not hear any general justification for the necessity for this Bill.  We heard a great deal about grievances.  Deputy Morrissey gave one specific case, but apart from that we did not hear any broad general justification for the bringing in of such a sweeping Bill as this is, affecting, according to Deputy <Col N="206" /> Morrissey, a quarter of a million people in the State.  Is it alleged that the rents charged for houses in the towns and villages in the Saorstát are in general too high?  Is that the contention put forward by the promoters of the Bill, and, if so, can they justify it by a comparison of any kind?  How do the rents charged for houses in the Saorstát compare with the rents charged, say, in England or Scotland, or, to get a closer parallel, with houses in Northern Ireland? If Deputy Lyons can give me some comparison between the rents in Granard and Mullingar and the rents in Ballymena or Coleraine, and can show that the rents in the former towns are higher than in Northern Ireland, then there would be some substantial case for the Bill, but I have not heard any such case made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at the cost of living figure, the increase in rents is far lower proportionately than the increase in prices recorded for the necessaries of life.  I acknowledge that that is partly due to the Rent Restrictions Act.  The increase in rents is measured by a decimal point, whereas the increase in every other commodity is measured by 10, 20 or 50 per cent. Landlords, in fact, have not increased rents on anything like the same scale that other people have made increases since 1914.  Deputy Lyons spoke about a business house in Granard, where, on the falling in of a lease, the new rent was about 60 per cent. higher than the previous rent asked for. I think if the Deputy went to inquire the prices at which the gentleman in this business house was selling his goods he would find that they were not higher by 60 per cent. but by 80 or 100 per cent.  I have not heard a case made yet for the Bill.  I daresay Deputy Johnson will be able to make a case as to why you should regard a house as different from any other form of merchandise. We are told that the person who owns goods or supplies goods or labour is entitled to ask far more now than he got in 1914.  The house owner alone is to be limited and restricted.  A case may be made for the Bill, but it has not yet been made.  Some people, of course, say that there is the question of the land; that the principle has been adopted in regard to land, and ought <Col N="207" /> to be adopted in regard to houses. There is a great difference between land and houses.  If you let land to a good careful tenant he improves it by good farming, but I have never heard of anyone who improved a house by living in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Deputy LYONS Deputy LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Deputy LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind the Deputy that there are many tenants who have spent as much as £100 on improving their houses, and now the landlord comes along and increases their rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Tenants always get some allowance for improvements from the landlord.  In the case quoted by the Deputy, the tenant must have consulted a very bad lawyer.  What the Deputy has stated tends to confirm me in the belief that I have long held, that Deputy Lyons is too innocent for this world.  I am sure that Deputy Redmond would be able to give him the name of a solicitor who will advise him in future.  I come now to the strongest point that I have heard made by the supporters of the Bill, not by the introducer, and that was Deputy Morrissey's plea for security.  The section dealing with fixity of tenure was the one to which Deputy Morrissey seemed to attach most importance.  That is a point with which one would naturally sympathise, but we have got to recognise that the existing system works both ways.  If it is possible for a landlord, at short notice, to turn out a tenant, it is equally possible for a tenant, if he wishes to do so, to throw the tenancy on the landlord's hands at short notice, but, as Deputy Redmond reminded me, it is not good for a house to be unoccupied.  I am not quite sure how the Bill will work if it becomes law in the case, say, of railway employees. They are liable to be transferred at very short notice from one town to another. In many cases, of course, the railway companies provide houses for their employees, but that is not done in every case.  Is a railway employee under this Bill to be tied down to ten years to pay a rent for a house that he cannot live in?  That is the provision in the Bill as it stands.  A railway man may be removed to another district, <Col N="208" /> and presumably under the Bill he will be liable as tenant for the rent.  In a case like that he will be obliged either to sub-let the house or to adopt some other method to get rid of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might enlighten the Deputy on that point.  Under Section 13, sub-section (c) among one of the general exclusions in the Bill is a holding let to any person in the employment of the landlord&mdash;in this case the railway company, I presume.  The dwellinghouse is let to him in consequence of that employment. In Deputy Cooper's case the railway company would let the house to the railway employee, and in consequence the house would not come under the terms of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy imagine that every railway employee lives in a house provided by the railway company?  I should say that not 50 per cent. of them do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>They live in houses provided by private landlords, and that, I hold, would be a transaction within the scope of the Bill.  The result would be that if the railway employee takes the landlord into court he will endeavour, as Deputy Davin has said, to sell his interest in the house.  Sometimes it is an advantage to a tenant that he can go out of a house at a week's notice.  It is also sometimes an advantage to the landlord.  The thing cuts both ways.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I really do not know.  I agree there is a good deal in the point made by Deputy Morrissey, and I am going to deal with it at the end of my speech.  It was a substantial point.  Deputy Redmond said that in this Bill he wanted to injure nobody by helping the town tenants.  Other Deputies were more profuse with goodwill towards the landlords.  &ldquo;They are the mildest mannered men that ever <Col N="209" /> scuttled a ship,&rdquo; because what will happen as a consequence of the passage of this Bill is that the bulk of the tenants will probably take the landlords into court to have fair rents fixed.  That opens up a prospect of immense litigation which, perhaps, is less terrifying to Deputy Redmond than it is to me. I have a considerable number of dwellings let at 2/- a week.  My tenants may possibly take me into court in the hope of getting a reduction of 6d. or 3d.  In order to deal with these cases I should have to instruct a solicitor to brief counsel to appear before the Circuit Judge.  I shall not be able to do so at a cost of less than £5 5s.&mdash;that is to say, two years' rent of each of these cottages. Every single case would have to be fought separately.  While that may not be injurious to me it certainly will not be advantageous to me.</P>
      <P>Again, Deputy Redmond spoke of the Circuit Court as a court in which proceedings should be taken under the Bill.  He quite fairly said that he was not tied to that, but that a Government amendment would have to be introduced to enable another court to be set up.  If the Bill were taken as it stands I would say that the Circuit Court Judge is not a judge of value but a judge of law.  When it comes to fixing the purchase price he has not been trained for work of that kind, and it would be better, if you are going to have a court at all, to have something in the nature of an arbitration court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Personally, I do not admire that procedure.  What I want to say is that whatever machinery is adopted, whether it be a Circuit Court or an Arbitration Court, it will be adopted at some cost to the public.  Additional Circuit Court Judges will have to be appointed if they are to deal with this large rush of business which we are told exists, and if you set up an Arbitration Court it will require assessors and so forth, and that also will mean additional expense to the public.  It is for Deputies to say whether the circumstances are sufficient to justify the necessary expenditure.  Another point in the Bill is that a landlord cannot get his own house for his own occupation.  Once the tenant is in, the landlord is practically compelled to buy him out.  Take the case of a man in the public service who lives in Dublin because it is most convenient.  When he retires, or, if he is a Deputy when he is retired, he goes back to the country and is anxious to live in his own home.  He may find, however, that he will have to buy out the tenant at the tenant's own price. That, however, is a Committee point with which, possibly, Deputy Redmond may deal.  Deputy Redmond told us about the exclusions from the Bill.  I am afraid that one of the exclusions, that of furnished houses, might have the effect of both parties agreeing and almost upsetting the Bill.  There is one exclusion which I wish we had not made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, so far as I can see, does not deal with sub-letting.  It appears to me that under this Bill, if it became law, a tenant could go into court and have his rent fixed at half-a-crown a week. If he had four rooms he could sub-let three of them, each to different families, at a rent of half-a-crown per room.  Even if he did not wish to do that, he could put in a few tables and chairs and sub-let the whole house at, possibly, a rent of 10/-.  I know that there are hard cases in connection with this problem, but the hardest cases with which I have come into contact are sub-letting cases, where tenants sub-let and get twice or three times the rent fixed under the Act.  So far as I see, <Col N="211" /> the Bill does not deal with that evil. There are undoubtedly hard cases, and I think Deputy Redmond will rememher the old maxim: &ldquo;Hard cases make bad law.&rdquo;  If you deal with the comparatively small number of hard cases you may inflict a grave injury on a larger number of people than those whom you are anxious to benefit.  I believe that there are other ways of meeting these hard cases.  My personal opinion is that that difficulty would be met by a wide extension of the leasehold system, and I suggest particularly that as the practice of exacting fines for the renewal of leases is becoming obsolete, it might be prohibited by law.  That, however, and other points might well engage the attention of the Committee which has been appointed, but until these points are considered I must vote against the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. DALY Mr. DALY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the Bill, first, on the ground that the provisions made for the building industry are not in danger, and, secondly, that the Circuit Court Judge is surely going to be the medium of fair dealing between a good tenant and a bad landlord.  During the war, rents were increased when money was plentiful and easily got.  A great many workmen were getting from £2 to £4 a week, but they are idle now, and those of them who are working have had their wages reduced.  Why, therefore, should not rents be reduced?  A great many landlords are keeping to the old rents.  That would be a matter for the consideration of the Circuit Court Judge, and I believe that no fair-minded body could object to such procedure. A great many people are compelled to live in insanitary dwellings, and while the landlord draws his rent he does not care about the people who are compelled to live there.  With them it is a case of &ldquo;Pay your rent, or get out.&rdquo;  We had a Bill here two years ago which had a very tight shave, and I am sorry we had not a Commission a few months after that.  I do not know what we want a Commission for, seeing that we have the ablest Executive Council in the world, and, if they only <Col N="212" /> put their heads together for three hours, they would hammer out a better Town Tenants Bill than all the judges on the bench.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cooper said that houses were not different to any other class of merchandise.  That is not the way in which people down my part of the country look at it.  A great many of these people were born in these houses, as were their fathers and grandfathers before them, and they have more respect for these houses than for merchandise. I think the time has come when we should remember the people who have lived in these houses all along the line and who have made it possible for us to be sitting here to-day.  Why should the tenant or landlord be afraid to go before a judge appointed by the Executive Council?  The tenants are asking only simple justice.  All they want is fair rent and fixity of tenure for a good tenant.  I would not impose a bad tenant on any landlord.  He is a disagreeable man, just as disagreeable as a bad landlord.  It would tend to provide better accommodation if the tenants had more control of their houses.  In my district there are a lot of carpenters who hate to improve their houses because, while they may make nice furniture and put up shelves inside, the landlord will allow the rain to come in through the roof.  These things could be brought before the Circuit Court Judge, a gentleman appointed, because of his ability, by the Executive Council who will not appoint anyone but the best.  I would appeal to the Minister for Justice to set aside this Commission and to give it a long holiday.  Let him take his courage in his own hands and let him and the President co-operate with other Deputies and hammer out a suitable Bill.  I confidently appeal to the Minister to do the right thing this evening and dispense with the services of this Commission.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am one of those who do not care for tinkering with matters.  I think that when a thing has got to be done it <Col N="213" /> should be done in the best possible manner and finished up properly.  I contend that this Bill is nothing but tinkering with a most important and far-reaching matter.  It is founded on the Land Act of 1881, and it could not have been founded on a more unfortunate model, in my opinion.  I remember quite well the time when that Act was in the making.  Everybody then thought that finality was about to be reached, that there would be peace for ever between the landlords and the tenants, and that when it became law everything would be in the best possible state.  It professed to give fixity of tenure, fair rents and free sale, but did it work out in that way?  It all sounded very well, and nearly everybody approved of these principles and thought that peace, prosperity and everything else would come from these three F's.  Did that happen? It was from that very time that all the litigation began that made necessary the numerous Land Bills, rent revisions, and all sorts of things that took place during a space of 40 years until 1923.</P>

      <P>The outcome of the whole thing was that the Ashbourne Acts became a necessity, and it is from the Ashbourne Acts and their successors that the land question is in process of settlement, and not from the three F's.  I contend that history repeats itself, and that the very same thing would occur in regard to the town tenants as has happened in the case of the land.  I see no reason why it would not.  I am of opinion that it would be very foolish, in view of our past experience in dealing with land, to enter again upon that kind of thing.  If we are going to deal with it we should settle it finally and not begin tinkering with it by Bill after Bill.  To reach a satisfactory solution you must have the best expert evidence and hear all cases.  This is not a thing <Col N="214" /> that can be settled in a moment.  If we rush a short Bill like this through, a Bill containing quite few sections, to deal with one of the most important matters that has been brought before us, I consider that we would be laying up trouble and that we would have no idea what the consequences would be.</P>

    <P>I sympathise to the full with the position of long-term tenants and leaseholders whose leases are falling out, who have done all the improvements themselves and may have had their rents very greatly increased, or perhaps had their places confiscated when the leases terminated, and I think that that is one of the matters that should be brought to the attention of the Commission. These are the hardest cases of all.  I am also most desirous of seeing that every man, as far as possible, should be the owner of the house in which he lives, but no financial arrangements whatever are made in the Bill for this. The tenant would have to find the money in any way he could, by going to a money-lender or to anybody else. I think some arrangement might be made by the Government of the day, whatever Government it may be, to provide money in some way, as in the case of the land, so that the occupiers might buy their houses, but as regards this fixity of tenure, fair rent and free sale, I do not think it will work out any better in the case of the towns than it did in the case of the country.  Deputy Cooper drew attention, very rightly, to the danger of sub-letting, and to the expense that they would be, as far as we can see, in the adjudication of these rents.  The courts would be crowded with applications for rent reductions, and with the present state of the courts I should say that that could not be done without the appointment of a number of extra judges.  That is one of the things that will have to be gone into by this Commission of independent people.  I think the appointment of that Commission is the right principle and that everybody will agree that the Government is taking the right course in appointing fully qualified people to hear all sides and all complaints, so that in this most important matter the best evidence may be available for the <Col N="215" /> Government of the day to enable them to put forward a Bill that will finally settle and dispose of this question, so that there will be no more tinkering with it.  That is what I hope will be done.  I hope that as far as it can be done it will be done as quickly as possible, and that the first thing that will be done by whatever Government comes into power after the election will be this.</P>
