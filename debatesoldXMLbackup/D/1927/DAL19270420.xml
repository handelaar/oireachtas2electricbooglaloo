      <P>asked the President whether it is a fact that the date of the General Election has been fixed to take place about the first week in June; if so, whether nominations will be from the new or old Register; whether the new Register will be ready from the printers for the use of Candidates' Agents; whether there will be time for candidates to get cards printed, giving each elector his number on the Register and his particular polling place; and whether the question of closing down schools for four or five days, three weeks before holiday time, has been seriously considered, with regard to teachers and scholars.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The date of the General Election can only be considered in relation to the legislative programme, and after making due allowance for ample consideration of that programme it is hoped that it may be possible to arrange for the election to be held in the second week of June. Administrative arrangements are proceeding on that basis.  We have no reason to doubt that the new Register will be ready in sufficient time to enable candidates to make due preparations for the election.  A Bill which will be introduced on to-morrow to amend the electoral law contains amongst other matters provision that so long as a person is registered as an elector in a register of electors in force for any portion of the period for the receipt of nominations such a person shall be considered a registered elector for the purposes of nomination.  The answer to <Col N="1208" /> the last portion of the question is in the affirmative.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he has granted any licence under Section 24 (1) of the Betting Act, 1926, to set up, maintain, and work a totalisator; and, if he has not granted any such licence, whether he has come to a decision as to what body is suitable to be so licensed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative.  It is the intention of the Government to grant a licence to some association or body representing racing interests.  If no such association or body can be found to take over the working of the totalisator on satisfactory conditions consideration will then be given to the question of having the scheme worked directly by the Revenue Commissioners.  At the moment negotiations are proceeding with the Turf Club and the National Hunt Steeplechase Committee, but so far there is no definite decision.</P>

      <P>The Sixmilebridge drainage district was inspected by an engineer from the Commissioners of Public Works in 1925, and on consideration of his report it was decided that the works required to restore it would be too extensive to undertake under the Drainage Maintenance Act, 1924, and their cost would impose too great a burden on the occupiers of the lands benefited.  This decision was communicated to the Secretary of the Drainage Board, the Clare County Council and others interested.  Recently a petition for a scheme under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, in respect of the area embraced in the existing drainage district was received from the Clare County Council, and at present an investigation is being made as to the merits of the proposed scheme.  At this stage it is not possible to state whether or not the scheme will be proceeded with.</P>

      <P>No reports have reached me which would indicate that the number of complaints of damage to parcels containing eggs or other agricultural produce is abnormal.  Eggs sent through the post are exceptionally liable to damage, and every effort is made to ensure that parcels containing them are properly treated.  The principal cause of damage is imperfect packing, and with a view to removing this cause as far as possible notices have been circulated through the Press advising the public of the best method of packing.  The use of a wooden or other rigid box with suitable partitions and with a well-fitting lid is particularly recommended.  In view of the fragile nature of the contents it is not proposed to sanction any departure from the published regulations under which compensation is not paid for damage to parcels containing eggs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The information at my disposal indicates that there is no serious shortage of bulls in Creeslough district.  There are at present standing in the neighbourhood of Creeslough three bulls supplied by the Department on special reduced terms. In addition, six bulls supplied on similar terms or as extra premium bulls are located with persons residing in the adjoining districts of Dunfanaghy and Falcarragh.  Only five bulls have been presented at the four inspections held in Creeslough under the Live Stock Breeding Act since its inception in 1925, and of these only three were suitable for licensing.  In the other districts mentioned sixteen bulls were examined in the same period, seven of which were licensed.  At the inspection held last February three bulls were shown at Dunfanaghy, two of which were licensed, and two at Falcarragh, one of which was licensed, while none were shown at Creeslough.  It will thus be seen that practically half the bulls in the whole area have been supplied <Col N="1216" /> by the Department, while the farmers, particularly in Creeslough, in view of the very few bull calves retained by them for breeding purposes, appear to be satisfied that the bulls available are suitable and sufficient for their requirements.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture whether he is aware that contagious abortion in cattle is prevalent in the district of Creeslough, Tirconaill, and that the introduction of the disease into the district, which was free from it until three years ago, is attributed to the bulls supplied by his Department, and whether he will make inquiries into the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the existence of contagious abortion in County Donegal has been recently investigated by the Department.  Some sterility exists in the district referred to, but this is due more to the fact that occasionally bulls are allowed to serve too many cows than that the cows are affected with contagious abortion.  This year the Department have given special attention to the question of the number of bulls in Co. Donegal.  An unusually large number have recently been sent there and it is believed that these measures will meet the situation.  The statement that the Department's bulls introduced abortion into the district is untrue as practically all the bulls supplied are yearlings.</P>

      <P>The point I wanted to raise was this: The President is, doubtless, aware that at a meeting which took place at the Chamber of Commerce last Thursday a matter was referred to the Council of that body for consideration. Owing to the holidays the Council could not meet before yesterday, and they drew up certain proposals which they are anxious to put before the Minister for Industry and Commerce in connection with the Electricity Supply Bill.  I understand that the Minister has been out of town, but every effort has been made to get in touch with him so that an opportunity might be afforded for discussing these proposals with him before the Report Stage of the Bill is proceeded with.  I am anxious, if possible, that that opportunity should be afforded to that particular body.</P>

I do not know whether I am in order in referring to <Col N="1225" /> the Chamber of Commerce proceedings, or whether Deputy Cooper will think it necessary to leave the House if I do, for fear that anything might be said to change his point of view while he is here.  Nothing said at the Chamber of Commerce meeting has made me change my point of view about the Bill.  I gave no guarantees to the Chamber of Commerce&mdash;indeed, I would have felt precluded from giving any guarantee to such a body&mdash;and the amendments down in my name cover every guarantee that I gave with regard to the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did give one guarantee.  When he was asked a question he said: &ldquo;I will do that if the Dáil asks me.&rdquo; It is surely desirable that an opportunity should be given to the Dáil to ask the Minister. However, I want to pursue the way of peace and make a suggestion.  If the President intends to get through the programme before the Dáil in the time he has indicated in his answer to Deputy Redmond's question, he would need the co-operation of every section of the Dáil, and I believe he will obtain that co-operation if he makes it clear that he is not trying to force an issue.  The contentious questions referred to by Deputy Good all arise on Part II of the Bill.  Might I suggest to the President that he should take Part I of the Bill to-day on Report, and <Col N="1226" /> postpone consideration of Part II. until next week.  There are 21 amendments down to Part I, and they will take a considerable time to discuss.  The fact that seven of them stand in the name of Deputy Johnson is sufficient proof that they are substantial amendments which will require adequate discussion. They will occupy our time sufficiently to-day.  It may be necessary to sit late to consider these.  I would suggest that it would be a reasonable compromise if we could agree to take up to and including amendment 21&mdash;that is to say, Section 33, which is the last section in Part I&mdash;and that we should then take the remainder of the Bill next week.  That would offer sufficient time for the discussion of which Deputy Good has spoken.  I think that that is a fair suggestion&mdash;fair to the Government and to the Opposition&mdash; and I make it in that spirit.  I do not want to retort to the sarcasm of the Minister.</P>

In the opposition to me on the questions supposed to be contentious in the Bill there were four Deputies, and these four Deputies got plenty of time in which to give their ideas full play.

      <P>&ldquo;The expression &lsquo;Railway Company&rsquo; includes any tramway the dividends on any part of the paid up capital of which are guaranteed under the Tramway and Public Companies (Ireland) Act, 1883 or any other Act or any Order in Council made under any such Act, and any tramway or railway conducted or managed by a county surveyor or by any person or persons on behalf of any county council or other local authority.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one aspect of this which strikes me.  The Act recently passed for the amalgamation of railways included a considerable number of light railways which were, in fact tramways.  By that precedent such a line as the Blessington line might well be defined as a railway. Consequently.  I think the amendment is in order owing to that precedent, and I think that there is good reason <Col N="1229" /> for supporting it in view of the opposition to the taking over of that particular line by the amalgamated company&mdash;that this company should be allowed to save itself and the ratepayers of Wicklow and Dublin by taking part in motor omnibus competition with, say, the Dublin Tramways Company.

      <P>&ldquo;(3)  Whenever a route submitted to the Minister under this section by a railway company as a route for a road motor service for the conveyance of passengers is in the opinion of the Minister substantially the same in whole or in part as the route on which a road motor service for passengers is at the time of such submission run regularly by some person other than such railway company, the Minister shall not approve under this section of such first-mentioned route until he has given to such person notice of such submission and has considered such (if any) representations as may be made in regard thereto by such person.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is in furtherance of an <Col N="1230" /> undertaking given on the Committee Stage.  Where an application to run a service over a particular route is made, before approving the route the Minister must be satisfied that notice is given to people who are running a service over substantially the same route so that they may make representations and the representations may be heard.</P>

      <P>I desire to move the following amendment&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 2, before section 3 (3), line 51, to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) When considering whether he will or will not approve under this section of a proposed route, the Minister shall have regard to the extent to which the vehicles to be used for the purposes of the proposed road motor service on such route will be manufactured in whole or in part in Saorstát Eireann and the desirability of promoting such manufacture so far as may be reasonably practicable.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is a revised form of an amendment that I moved on the Committee Stage.  It provides that the motor bus companies will manufacture their vehicles as far as possible in the Saorstát.  I think the amendment meets the views suggested by the Minister and Deputies who spoke on the subject before.</P>

      <P>This amendment is definitely in line with the suggestions made in Committee where an amendment was moved that vehicles <Col N="1231" /> provided by a railway company shall, so far as practicable, be equipped with bodies manufactured in the Saorstát. To that amendment I raised certain objection and I pointed out that it meant nothing more than a pious aspiration.  I suggested if an amendment of a similar type was put into Section 3 it would give the Minister concerned power not merely to inquire into the building of the bodies of the new vehicles, but also the vehicles of the competitive service already in existence and it would have its effect on the competitive buses as well as on the new services to be established.  I am in entire agreement with the amendment.</P>

      <P>Amendments 4 and 5 are the result of a discussion in Committee.  They are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 6, to add at the end of Section 3 a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  In the case of a road motor service which is run for a particular part only of every year, the approval of the Minister under this section of the route on which such service is run shall (until the withdrawal and subject to any modification thereof under this section) continue in force so long as such service is run for the same or substantially the same part of every consecutive year.</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 6, to add at the end of Section 5, a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  A road motor service which is run for a particular part of every year shall not be deemed to be withdrawn or discontinued within the meaning of this section so long as it is run for the same or substantially the same part of every consecutive year.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no amendment down which gave rise to this point, but during the discussion I think Deputy Davin raised a question as to a service which could be described as seasonal only, and pointed out that where such a service may be only for the summer months, or for a brief period, it could be withdrawn without a breach of the terms of <Col N="1232" /> the Act.  I said that such seasonal services might be applied for and authorised and the withdrawal at the end of the specified period would not be a withdrawal such as is precluded by the terms of the Bill.  I pointed out that the better course would be definitely to assert by way of amendment what was then asserted more or less by inference. Amendments 4 and 5 are put down for that purpose, and I accordingly move them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it possible for a railway company to make application to run a service on a particular route where already a service exists, and, having got that right, withdraw after continuing over a period during which the traffic would be heaviest?  I think it is necessary to add something like this at the end:&mdash;&ldquo;Provided always that all the year's service is being run on the same route.&rdquo;  Perhaps the wording may not be exactly correct, but I think without some such thing as that it would leave it open to the railway company to make application and get a concession to run over a period of the year, thus leaving the owner of the bus service, who would be running a service all the year, in the position of having competition during a period when the traffic would be heaviest.  The railway company could then remove its service when the traffic would not be heavy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a slight danger in what the Deputy says.  It is a danger that I called attention to in Committee.  I think the danger is narrowed down to a very fine point. If the two amendments in my name are taken, an application will have to be made for the running of a service of a particular type over a particular portion of the year.  All that would be taken into consideration is: Do the circumstances seem to warrant the running of a service for a limited portion of the year?  If the circumstances did warrant it, then approval would be given.  The service would run over a limited number of months and then its withdrawal would not be such as is forbidden by the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the danger the Deputy has in mind is a real one, there is this to be <Col N="1233" /> said: If there is a service running on a particular route during the year and there is a particular traffic over that route in the summer months, there may be a greater demand during the summer months which the railways would be able to supply under this Bill.  They would not interfere with the ordinary all-the-year service; in other words, they would take the tourist end.  I think that is what should be allowed to the railway company and there is no danger in that regard. There would be an interference with the service running the whole year round, but if there was a special traffic for a particular period, that should be taken into consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's interpretation of the section makes it rather more serious from my point of view. Undoubtedly you get cases in which during part of the year the owner may for a number of months lose on the service. He may make good this loss in the tourist season.  The service during the whole year is a convenience to the public.  During part of the year it is maintained perhaps at a loss, the owner hoping that in another period that loss will be made good.  Now, if you are going to give the railway companies the right to step in and take that extra traffic for two or three months the effect will be to cripple the owner who is maintaining the existing services, and thus put him off the road; the travelling public will lose the convenience that that bus service has been giving them in the other parts of the year.  It seems to me that the matter could be met by the owner of the existing bus service, catering for the public, putting on perhaps an additional bus on the road.  If the Minister's interpretation of the section is to be accepted I believe there is grave danger that the existing service will be hampered by further keen competition from the railways for a short period of the year when traffic is best, and to be left then through the lean months to carry on.  The Minister can appreciate the effects of such an eventuality on the bus service to a particular district.</P>

      <P>These circumstances <Col N="1234" /> would arise in particular cases, and particular cases will always be dealt with under the second amendment on the sheet to-day.  Those would be matters put to me by way of representation from the owners of services already in existence, when permission to run new services would be applied for by the railway company.  I suggest that where there is already a satisfactory service in existence that question would be taken into consideration when application to run a service is made. The fact that an all-the-year-round service was already in existence would be considered by my Department.</P>

      <P>I would not like to press that point.  I would not like to confine the railway company to that, because I can see where it would be right that they should get permission to run.  But I should like an understanding from the Minister as to what the interpretation of the section would be&mdash;that we are not going to have existing routes put out of existence or done away with, or that we are not going to permit such competition with the existing services as would probably render them incapable of maintaining the service which they have given up to the present.  If we think that the competition that we are going to have will have that result, then it is going to be bad for the travelling public.  We want to guard against that, and we want from the Minister an interpretation of the section, so that it is not likely to have that result.</P>

      <P>The main consideration is not going to be&mdash;is this likely, in the sense of looking for something that is likely, to wipe out and destroy already existing services.  On the other hand, seeing that the railway company are giving the public a service, they will not be stopped from setting up a new service through the fact that a service is already there.  The <Col N="1235" /> main consideration is the service that is to be given to the public.  After that, however, is the special consideration that I would have to give to the application of the railway company. They are not to be allowed to enter into injudicious competition that would affect the railway revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us put the thesis the other way.  A railway company undertakes to run a bus service for the whole year and it is obvious that for a considerable portion of the year that is not a paying service.  Will the Minister have any powers to prevent another bus company from entering into what might be called unfair competition with the bus service belonging to the railway company during the remunerative portion of the year? That is the reverse of the case that is being put up by Deputy Baxter.  It is portion of the case that should be considered and the reason why it ought to be considered is that before a railway company can put a bus on a particular road it has got to get the leave of the Minister's Department.  It cannot withdraw that bus without getting the sanction of the Minister's Department. In the working out of this it would happen that the railway company would be compelled to run a bus on certain roads during certain periods of the year, when, as I say, that service would be unremunerative.  Surely it would be only reasonable if we compel the railway company to accept these somewhat onerous terms that there should be some prerogative in the Department of the Minister to prevent unfair and unreasonable competition being brought in during the period of the year when the service is remunerative.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment No. 3 standing in Deputy Hewat's name.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 7, Section 2, to insert before sub-section (4) a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Three of the members of the Board at least shall be selected for their practical knowledge of electrical supply and shall have been engaged in electricity supply undertakings.  The additional members (if any) shall be selected persons of practical experience in the administration of commercial concerns.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister promised at the last Stage that he would look further into this matter.  He has not done so.</P>
      <P>Deputy Thrift suggested, and I think the House looked upon it as an admirable suggestion, that the members of the Board should be appointed, having regard to their expert knowledge, engineering qualifications or practical experience, by the Executive Council This question of the constitution of the Board is really at the foundation of the whole success of the scheme.  The Shannon scheme has gone so far now that for the credit of the State it must be worked, and worked by co-operation. I would like to hear from the Minister why he is not prepared to consider the suggestions made on the last day, and why he completely ignored them.  The Minister asked that the amendment should be withdrawn. He asked time to look into it and fit it into the practical scheme of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is the business of Deputies to put down amendments for the Minister.  The Minister certainly gave me the impression that he would look into this matter, in view of the suggestions made by Deputy Thrift.  Why should Deputies be asked to make the Bill and make suggestions?  If the Minister admits there is anything in the point and promises to look into it, why does he not draft the amendments himself?  The reason that I go back on this at this stage is, that the constitution of the Board is going either to make or mar the whole scheme.  We are all interested and we are all anxious that the Shannon scheme, now that it is coming into being, should be a success. We are also anxious to know on what basis we are going to give a blank cheque to the Board to carry on.  We are going to give them an absolutely free hand to deal as they like with people's property, and with the property of municipal undertakings.  In every part of the country people will be found whose interests are affected in some way or another.  I think the Dáil should not give a free hand, particularly when there is not a word in the Bill defining the constitution of the Board.  I thought we had gone into this question very fully on the last day, and that the Minister would now have come to the assistance of the House.  He has not seen fit to do so.  I feel that it is necessary that the matter should be brought to the notice of the House again.  It should be asked not to give a free hand and pass a Bill of this nature before it knows into whose hands the enormous sum of money involved is going to be put.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I might point out that sub-section (4) of Section 2 states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The members of the Board shall be appointed by the Executive Council and every person so appointed to be a member of the Board shall hold office for such period not exceeding <Col N="1239" /> five years as shall be fixed by the Executive Council when appointing him and every such person shall on the expiration of his term of office be eligible for re-appointment.</P>
    <P>What this amendment purports to do is to ensure that at least three of these members shall have a knowledge of the particular work they are appointed to discharge.  To me that seems to be an almost primary qualification, and almost unnecessary to embody in an amendment.  One would have expected to find that to be almost one of the first provisions in the Bill, in connection with these appointments, as these individuals are given very wide control, with the object of developing a very large electricity undertaking.  In the ordinary business way it would be thought that these men would have some knowledge of the particular duties they are going to discharge; in other words, that they would have some knowledge of the many ramifications of electricity undertakings. There are no such provisions in the Bill.  These men are to be appointed to discharge these exceedingly wide duties without qualifications of any kind.  On the face of it that appears to me to be an exceedingly unbusiness-like proposal.</P>
    <P>When this amendment appeared I thought the Minister would have readily accepted it.  The very fact that the Minister does not appear to attach any importance to the amendment adds another element of alarm to the many alarms felt in connection with this Bill.  I would suggest, in order to get some security that the work which is performed by this Board shall be done efficiently, that the whole policy should be based on experience of work of a similar character.  If business men were making such an appointment, the first question that would be put to an applicant would be: &ldquo;What is your special knowledge, and what qualifications have you to discharge these duties?&rdquo;  If the man's reply was that he had no such qualifications they would be very slow about appointing him.  As far as I know, the object of the amendment is <Col N="1240" /> to endeavour to secure that the people who form this Board shall have some knowledge of the duties, and some experience of the work to enable them to act successfully.  If I were drafting this Bill that is a condition I would like to see in it, and even at this late stage I hope the Minister will see his way to incorporate it.</P>

      <P>On the Committee Stage, when dealing with this sub-section, I made a suggestion because it seemed then from the debate that the matter was largely one as to how far the Executive Council should be tied up by the Bill&mdash;rather a matter of words than anything else.  I do not suppose the Minister is likely to say that there is the smallest chance of anyone being appointed unless he has special qualifications for the post.  I put forward a form of words which I thought might be of some advantage. The Minister asked me to amplify them for the Report Stage, or to let him have some form which he could perhaps amplify or modify.  Accordingly I sent him two forms, and I would like to ask him if he has considered either of them, and if he thinks either would form a working basis to make quite clear what the general character of the Board is expected to be.  The forms indicated that those chosen should be chosen either for their expert knowledge in connection with electricity supply and the special needs of the country in that respect, or for engineering qualifications, or for practical experience. That gave the Executive Council a considerable choice, as &ldquo;expert knowledge&rdquo; is a very wide term, while indicating at the same time clearly in the Bill the kind of people the Dáil would expect to form membership of the initial Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why Deputy Good should have thought that this amendment had only to be put down to be accepted, seeing that there were something like eight or nine columns of matter spoken on it the last time, and most of it in objection to it.  I am afraid we are getting into a bad way with regard to what was said on Committee Stage if Deputy Myles misreads what I have said on amendment 8 and makes it applicable to <Col N="1241" /> amendment 7, as this was on the last stage.  Deputy Good has gone to this extreme, that because the Bill says: &ldquo;Every person so appointed to be a member of the Board shall hold office for such period not exceeding five years as shall be fixed by the Executive Council,&rdquo; and so on, and because no qualifications are stated, he assumes immediately the Executive Council are going to appoint people without qualifications. It is not stated either that the people shall be sane, but I do not think he can take the omission of a reference to sanity as a sign that the Executive Council will immediately appoint insane people.  One could follow that line of argument for a long time and not get very much further.  There is no intention to appoint people without qualifications.  I was asked by Deputy Thrift to consider a suggestion he had thrown out&mdash;that the members of the Board shall be appointed by the Executive Council, &ldquo;having due regard to their expert knowledge, engineering qualifications or practical experience,&rdquo; and I put it to him by way of warning that to bear in mind all the different types of individuals of whom I spoke the last day as possibly being fit to be members of the Board, he might have to enlarge the series and that it would mean nothing.  I do not intend to repeat what I said about the particular types of individuals who might be considered suitable for this Board, because obviously I spoke of so many that they could not all be fitted on to a board consisting of a chairman and six as a maximum.  I would have all the possibilities of getting an individual who might have two of the qualifications that I spoke of the last day.  I might get another man who would have one of these a little bit more emphasised and have some little additional point, and I might be able to make up a team of five who would form an efficient Board, and the defection of one of these might throw the whole selection again into confusion and it would be necessary to have a series of definite qualifications of which I spoke at some length the last day&mdash;knowledge of finance, the capacity to deal with public money in a conscientious way, engineering qualifications and&mdash;this matter <Col N="1242" /> of sales having been introduced&mdash;a knowledge of salesmanship, and I went through a list of about a dozen things. I spoke of the difficulty of getting these down into some sort of limitation such as the Deputy has suggested&mdash;&ldquo;Having regard to their expert knowledge, engineering qualifications or practical experience.&rdquo;  Deputy Thrift has now proffered two further suggestions, one being phrased this way: &ldquo;The members of the Board shall be chosen because of their expert knowledge of matters relating to electricity supply and the special needs of the country in that respect or their engineering qualifications or their practical experience.&rdquo;  In so far as that is a limitation of the general phrase &ldquo;expert knowledge,&rdquo; as suggested on Committee Stage, it is more objectionable from my point of view, because previously I was considering that expert knowledge means anything or nothing, as one liked to interpret it, and it really was amounting more or less to what I said to the Deputy, that the more limitations one seeks to put down in precise words the greater number of limitations by way of exceptions will have to be stated, so that in the end you would be very much as you were.  The second suggestion made by the Deputy was: &ldquo;The members of the Board shall be appointed by the Executive Council, having due regard to their expert knowledge of matters relating to electricity supply and the special needs of the country in that respect&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The second is not very much of a change from the first.  I was going to make the point that the difference was that the words &ldquo;expert knowledge,&rdquo; being general in the suggestion thrown out in the Committee, has been made more precise now &mdash;&ldquo;expert knowledge of matters relating to electricity supply and the special needs of the country in that respect.&rdquo;  I think the House will agree with me that what I said in Committee is sound in this regard, that above and beyond everything else, there must be put on to this Board at least one individual who has a proper outlook with regard to the handling of public money.</P>

      <P>I thought the Minister was objecting to the term &ldquo;expert knowledge&rdquo; as being too general.  It seems to me that it is a better phrase than the phrase I sent to him since the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>The more general the better from my point of view, but what &ldquo;expert knowledge&rdquo; would cover the particular point I meant when I spoke of a viewpoint with regard to the use of public money?  That is hardly expert; it is more a conscientious regard of the use of public money.  A man might have very little experience in the handling of money and yet have the proper outlook in regard to the handling of public money, and on this Board there must be somebody of this type.  I was hoping that I might be able to add to these two points of Deputy Thrift some other general words which would have made this wide enough for acceptance, but in the end it is better to face this matter in a sensible way.  Unless the Dáil believes it is competent at this moment to say: &ldquo;On that Board there ought to be six people, and the six people ought to be, roughly, these&rdquo;&mdash; I have spoken of the engineer in charge of the power plant and possibly the engineer in charge of the whole transmission system when it is established.  Supposing the Bill were simply to say: &ldquo;Two engineers, a financier, either a local official or a Government official,&rdquo; and so on&mdash;unless the Dáil believes it is competent to do that at this moment I do not believe you can put in a series of qualifications that would enable the Board to be finally chosen in a proper way.  I have read one suggestion that has been put to me, but I only read it because it comes back again to my own point of view, that an attempt to limit is impossible. One could phrase it this way: &ldquo;The Executive Council in appointing the members of the Board shall have due regard to their qualifications for exercising the powers and performing the duties conferred and imposed on the Board by this Act.&rdquo;  It means nothing. It comes back again to the point that the Dáil has either to make up its mind that certain individuals are required, that A must be an engineer, B must be <Col N="1244" /> a financier, C must be something else, and so on, and let us have that stated, or let us leave the team to be made up in the best possible way.</P>
      <P>I do not think there need be any fear with regard to it.  I put it to the Dáil, for their judgment on this matter, that there need be no fear with regard to incompetents being appointed on this Board.  There is far too much at stake, and I believe&mdash;I said it on the Second Reading and I repeat it&mdash;that if any party in this or any other Dáil had to seek for places to fit in people in order to get rid of political obligations that might have been incurred to those people, the last place to which they would seek to appoint them would be this Board.  This Board is going to be no easy task for anyone, and a man appointed to it is going to risk any reputation he has acquired up to date. He has a short term of office.  He has no pension rights; he is asked to make a big sacrifice, gamble more or less, and do heavier work than any Electricity Board has had to do.  He has to get the first five years' spade work of this Board done, and it will be a matter of getting men competent, irrespective of politics or anything else.  If there is any fear of the Government misusing powers, it will not arise in connection with this Board.  The task is almost an impossible one to get people to take on under any conditions.  They are up against the particularly bad atmosphere created with regard to this Board in the last fortnight.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy who has put down this amendment is making a mistake.  Deputy Good, in proposing it, enlightened me as to how one of the businessmen looks upon the practice of limited companies appointing mere financiers as directors of public Boards, companies and institutions.  Apparently the Deputy thinks that in this case, at any rate, the Board should be composed of men of a certain type of experience.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I was coming to that.  I think if the Deputy really desired to give an instruction to the Minister as to the type of person that would be suitable for the work that is cut out for him and the powers given him under this Bill, he should have suggested a person or persons who had experience as military governor on some island in the South Seas or let us say, Ireland.  General Macready, when he was here, had powers very like the powers in this Bill.  If that is the kind of experience that is needed, a man with absolute authority and a large experience of governing a country without responsibility except the fear that some day he may be recalled, the Deputy should have produced an amendment more in keeping with the requirements of the case.  The proposition that three, if only three are to be appointed, should be persons engaged in electricity supply undertakings seems to me to be quite faulty, because part of the work that will be required on this Board will certainly not be mainly knowledge of electricity and electrical supply.  The experts who will be appointed and will have equal authority with the Board, provided the Board decides to hand over that authority, will do all that, and the Board itself should really be somebody who will organise and act as a publicity agent.  It does not seem to me, except from the point of view of choosing their immediate advisers, that this Board need have any expert knowledge at all, and I seriously think that the Deputy is quite unwise in making a proposition of this kind.  After all, if the Board is eventually to be granted the powers that are expressed in this Bill it is far better that the Minister responsible who is going to have the first appointment should have the whole of the responsibility for choosing those men.  Let him make his own choice as to the knowledge and experience suitable. I hope there will be opportunities to consider the powers that are to be granted to this Board, whoever they may comprise, but I think that the Minister should have the liberty without limitation of this kind, as to the selection of the persons who will form the Board.  If you impose on him this kind <Col N="1246" /> of limitation he will be able to throw back upon the Dáil certain responsibilities for failure&mdash;he was limited in his choice of a Board and therefore he could not appoint the men he thought best qualified and suitable&mdash;in granting those utterly excessive powers to an irresponsible person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Committee Stage, the Minister told us, in discussing a somewhat similar amendment, that under those powers he could appoint the most incompetent Board which could possibly be appointed.  I want to make myself clear.  I fear the Minister has been misjudging me as a result of certain reports in the Press, because those reports are necessarily abbreviated.  I have never failed to do justice to the enthusiasm of the Minister for this scheme and to his desire to make it a success.  All I have suggested is that such enthusiasm is sometimes dangerous, that it sometimes oversteps the bounds of prudence, and that, therefore, some control should be exerted on it.  The Minister in Committee made certain qualifications, which he said were necessary, as to membership of this Board.  He said, as he said to-day, that the engineers in charge of the power station and of the distribution should be all members of the Board.  The amendment we are discussing provides for that.  They can become members of the Board under that amendment.  He went on and he said &ldquo;someone with a proper view of the handling of public money,&rdquo; and he instanced Deputy Johnson, though he hastened to qualify that conditional offer by the statement that Deputy Johnson was too valuable in the Dáil to remove him.  I think if he offered that to Deputy Johnson I know what the answer would be.  Then he went on and gave another instance which he did not repeat to-day.  He said it might be necessary to have a lawyer and somebody who could talk to farmers. Has the interval between the adjournment and the resumption of the Dáil proved that it is more difficult to talk to farmers than the Minister anticipated? I do not know how you could define anybody who could talk to farmers.  Even I sometimes talk to farmers, but if you define it as talking <Col N="1247" /> effectively to farmers I suppose Deputy Baxter fulfils the qualification suggested by the Minister.  The Minister has outlined very clearly and consistently the lines on which he proposes to appoint a Board.</P>
      <P>Why should he not seek the sanction of the Dáil for it?  Are we to be asked to give these enormous powers, this tremendous control of public money to a body of whom we know nothing?  I admit that the Minister will try to appoint the best men, but I do not know that he will be able to appoint these men before the general election, and who is to say who will be the Minister for Industry and Commerce after the general election?  It might be a very dangerous and disastrous power to give him.  Deputy Johnson talks&mdash;and I welcome his statement as I welcome his reappearance in our debates&mdash;about getting somebody who had experience of governing a country without responsibility.  We are going to give in this Bill the power of electrifying a country without responsibility, and surely we ought to know something of the qualifications of the men who are to do it.  This amendment may not be ideal.  I had been hoping for a better amendment from the Minister.  He seems to be allowing the opposition of four Deputies here to frame his Bill for him.  Four Deputies and 47 amendments!  These Deputies need not feel ashamed of themselves. He has indicated his qualifications in his speech, he will not indicate them within the four lines of the Bill, and the four lines of the Bill are the only things that bind and the only things that influence people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do again suggest that these are almost Napoleonic powers, by which the country will have to stand or fall, by which the country will have to lose an enormous amount of money, and will have to suffer in prestige if the scheme is a failure.  I do not want it to be a failure, and the Minister knows I have done my best to make it a success since the original Shannon Bill came along. Once it was removed from the avenue of contention I and Deputies on these benches did our best to make it a success. We are only asking that there <Col N="1248" /> should be some definite qualification for the persons who are to administer this enormous power.  The Minister has given us no alternative, and therefore I must support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to apologise for not being present to move the amendment standing in my name.  It will be within the recollection of the House that this is a repetition of the amendment which appeared on the former stage of the Bill.  In the discussion on that amendment and on an amendment put down by Deputy Thrift, I think the Minister indicated that he wished time to consider whether any portion of this or any other amendment could be embodied that would meet with his approval. In the meantime, of course, I had been hoping and expecting that the Minister would take the onus off my shoulders and come forward with a proposition of his own.  He has not done so, and I have to move the amendment. I admitted quite frankly on the Committee Stage that the amendment was put down with a general idea of attaching some qualifications to the post of members of the Board.  I think I made it clear on that stage that the terms of the amendment, as far as individual qualifications were concerned, were not hard and fast by any means.  We have now arrived at a point on the Report Stage when the amendment before us is the only amendment that deals with the matter.  I would like the House to appreciate that the Board is the important factor that is going to control the issue of the Shannon scheme and the results to flow from it.  If we might for a moment consider the commercial aspect of the case and assume that there was a proposal in which the public were invited to subscribe under the Companies Act for a large or a small amount of money, as the case might be, one of the very first things indicated in the prospectus issued would be the names and standing of the persons who would control the issue&mdash;the directors.  I say to the Minister that it would add enormously to the confidence and the general appreciation of the position of the Board if he would, even at this stage, indicate if in the same way the appointment of this Board is an important issue in connection with the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1249" /> This Board is going to come into being very shortly, I presume, after the passing of the Bill.  The whole foundation of the provisions of the Bill is based on this.  During the two years that have elapsed since the original Shannon Bill was passed, there have been ample opportunities for the Minister and those concerned in the scheme to review the whole position.  We have arrived at a stage when the Minister should have very clearly in his mind the personnel of the Board that is to be appointed.  If he has not it at this stage he must have, in the very near future, that matter in his mind when he comes to appoint the Board.  I invite the Minister, if he is not prepared to say what the personnel of the Board is to be, to say what the qualifications of the members he is going to appoint are to be. That would get rid of all doubt in the matter if there is any doubt.  I think it would be a tremendous asset to him in so far as it would carry the House and the country with him in approval of the Board that he is going to set up.</P>
    <P>If he is not prepared to do that, and if there is any wording other than that in the amendment which would indicate the direction in which he is going to move in connection with the appointment of the Board, that would be also helpful, but I think it is too much to ask the House at this stage to agree that no qualification should be specified and that nothing is to be done at this eleventh hour.  There is no Deputy here who would have greater confidence in leaving the selection of a Board in the hands of the Minister than I would. At the same time I think it is unreasonable, having arrived at this point, that something substantial should not be put in the Bill governing the appointment of a Board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Second Reading I raised the question of the constitution of the Board from the point of view of the advisability of having on the Board a member or members who would be conversant with the agricultural industry and its requirements, and the possibilities of applying electricity to that industry.  The mover of the amendment has not specified in the amendment that a member of the Board should have a knowledge of agriculture. <Col N="1250" /> The Minister gave an indication on Second Reading that he was prepared to consider that point of view, and that he felt it necessary and essential that there should be someone on the Board who would understand the requirements of farmers and meet them.  I believe it is absolutely essential to have a Board composed of people some of whom will have such qualifications.  If it was put to me to define the qualifications of such an individual I confess I would have difficulty. There are many types of men who would be competent to talk to, and do business with farmers.  On the other hand, the type of man capable of doing business with farmers must at the same time, if he is to be a member of this Board, be competent to explain the value of supplies from the Shannon scheme to them.  I suppose we are to presume that the Board is coming into existence immediately after the passing of this Bill.  If the Bill is passed before the dissolution of the present Dáil we are to have the Board in existence before the dissolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quarrel with the Minister on a good many things, but I do not think he has so little commonsense as to nominate men to act on this Board whom he cannot stand over.  If he does that and sends them down the country that will be the worst day's work he did for his Government since he came into office.  I question myself whether it would be advisable to write down here that three members of the Board must have practical knowledge of electrical supply, and must be connected with electricity undertakings. We could get, perhaps, a hundred men in the country coming within that category.  The competency of these men to serve on the Board would be another matter.  He would be a very foolish Minister indeed if he did not have a member or members on the Board who would come within that category.  It would be very bad business from the beginning, because certainly at least one man or more should have technical knowledge of the business in order to give information to the Board on matters that otherwise they would not be competent to pass judgment upon.  What I feel about this matter is this: The difficulty of saying <Col N="1251" /> exactly in the Bill what the qualifications of the members of the Board are to be is so great that if we had written them into the Bill and if we were asked to select men who would answer to those qualifications, we would have difficulty in doing so.  The demand that three shall have a knowledge of electricity is, in my view, asking that too many members of the Board shall have technical knowledge of one side of the business.  The Board might be lopsided in that case, and other aspects of the management&mdash;generating, distribution, supply, and financial administration&mdash;might <Col N="1252" /> be rather put at a disadvantage because of what is in the amendment.  It might be desirable that we should make up our minds and state specifically what it is we want, but I confess I do not see that that is possible. If not, all we can hope for is that the Minister will not be so foolish as to put on incompetent people.  If he acts like that the country will give an answer and pass its judgment upon his foolishness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 7, Section 2, to insert before sub-section (4) a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The names of the members of the Board so appointed by the Executive Council shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas forthwith, and if either House shall within the next subsequent twenty-one days on which that House has sat after such appointments have been submitted pass a resolution disapproving of such appointments, the said appointments shall be annulled.  No member of the Board shall act until after the expiration of said period of twenty-one days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the amendment is to retain control by the Dáil and the Oireachtas generally of appointments made to the Board.  I think it is very necessary, in view of the amount of public money that is to be administered by this Board, that the House should have a say in connection with the appointments. They should have a say to the <Col N="1253" /> extent that, when it is proposed to appoint a member of the Board, they shall have an opportunity of querying the appointment as far as qualifications or any other matters are concerned, or as to the advisability of the appointment. I think the Minister, in his explanation of the Bill, laid it down as his idea that the Board and its work should be kept as far as possible outside the range of the criticism of this House.  On the other hand, I think the members of this House would be taking rather a light view of the matter under discussion if they did not recognise that this House must, at all times, have a sense of responsibility, irrespective of what may be done by the management, for the general results of the scheme.  This amendment gives the House an opportunity, if it so desires, of raising the question of the appointment of any particular person to the Board.  I think the amendment is a reasonable one and might be accepted by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not possibly agree with the description of this amendment as &ldquo;a reasonable amendment.&rdquo; It introduces a completely new principle into the scheme of things. According to the amendment, the House is hereafter going to have responsibility for the Board.  Presumably, it will have responsibility for the administration of the Board if it has responsibility for the appointments. Apart from that, this is a most extraordinary innovation to make by way of a second amendment&mdash;an amendment which was to have been proposed if the first amendment down in Deputy Hewat's name were defeated.  I wonder does the Deputy or the House realise the extra difficulties that would be encountered, if this amendment were accepted, even in securing suitable applicants.  Imagine, if Deputy Hewat's name were considered for the Board, the twenty-one days' tension he would suffer while his name lay here for the House to make any comment that it liked to pass, the matter being raised day by day, the qualifications being looked into and all the different parties having a particular reaction to the name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I looked upon the amendment at first as a rather derisive amendment.  I was surprised to hear the Deputy speaking <Col N="1254" /> seriously to it.  If it is being proposed seriously, I must take up a serious attitude, definitely and clearly, against it.  Anybody who has any conception at all of the immediate difficulties before the Executive Council in trying to get seven people&mdash;if seven people are to be got&mdash;able to form this new Board, will appreciate the difficulty that would ensue from adoption of this amendment.  One must consider what these men are asked to do, what burden they are going to take up, how their whole reputation is at stake, what very thin security they have, how their whole position has been, as I say, prejudiced by absurd comments in the last fortnight.  If to all that, you add that every individual who is approached as a suitable member for the Board, hereafter, will have to consider, before he even submits to having his name put forward, that his name will remain here for twenty-one days during which either House is to meet, and that any consideration any member or any Party in either House may bring forward will be discussed, that his reputation is going to be first of all subjected to examination and debate in either House and, if he survives that, that he is going to have all the trouble that will fall upon him if he does take up the duties&mdash;if you consider all these things you will understand the difficult situation that would be brought about by adoption of this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>This Board is a somewhat anomalous body.  At times, particularly when under discussion here, it is an absolutely independent body but, when the Minister speaks of it elsewhere, he describes it as &ldquo;my&rdquo; board&mdash;&ldquo;my advice to the Board will be,&rdquo; and so-on.  I think, in view of the extraordinarily diverse complexity that exists in various aspects of the Board, it is not only wise but constitutional that the Dáil and Seanad should be acquainted with the membership of the Board, and should have a power of expressing disapproval.  The Minister says that it will be difficult to constitute such a Board.  Surely that is an argument against the Bill. If it is to be so difficult, the task should not have been undertaken, or it should <Col N="1255" /> have been undertaken with more consideration for the interests involved, more previous consultation, and not in a manner that makes it necessary for the Minister to bring in twenty-five amendments on the Committee Stage and forty-seven amendments on Report Stage.  The problem is so very serious and intricate it should not have been rushed like a bull at a gate.  We are now in the position that the Minister says that no suitable member of the Board will allow his name to be under consideration for twenty-one sitting days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He makes that plea to a Dáil within six weeks of its dissolution.  Shall we not to have our names under consideration for twenty-one days?  Shall we not all have to be criticised and have imputations made about us?  Shall we not have to endure the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune for much less reward, for an almost equal volume of work?  I do not believe that men engaged in public life, serious and responsible men such as the Minister proposes to appoint, are so easily deterred. If I may say so without offence, I think that the Minister attaches too much importance to the newspapers. It seems to me that there is a distinct constitutional principle at stake, and, while I have never denied the Minister's responsibility, and have never suggested that he would fail to fulfil his responsibility to appoint the best possible men, I recognise that we in the Dáil, as the custodians of public funds, have also our responsibility, and we must see that that responsibility is not removed from us.  By an arbitrary act we should not confer on the Minister power of appointing individuals to a great public trust without knowing who they are, or without the faintest possibility of even suggesting their unsuitability for that trust.  This Government, no doubt, has been described by many names, but I think the most appropriate epithet that you could attach to it is &ldquo;the blank-cheque Government.&rdquo;  It always comes and asks for a blank cheque.  In many instances that cheque has been filled up to the benefit of the State.  I admit that clearly, but the principle is not sound, and is one against which <Col N="1256" /> we should guard.  Therefore, I support the amendment, and hope that it will receive the support of the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I think this amendment, while it seeks to do something which is admirable, is proceeding in the wrong way.  I would much prefer to endeavour to alter the Bill in such a way as to make the Minister responsible.  From my reading of the Bill and from the Minister's statement, it is quite clear that the Minister is seeking to hand over his responsibility to the Board.  I do not think that we, as a Dáil, ought to take upon ourselves this administrative function.  I think that a great mistake is often made in treating the Dáil as though it were an administrative authority.  It is not, and this proposal, in effect, is to leave to the Dáil the responsibility of making these personal appointments.  I see clearly that the temptation to support the amendment is great.  The Board is one which, I think, ought not to be appointed at all.  I disagree utterly with much of the agitation that has gone on during the last week or two, and I think that, unfortunately, the criticism has been in the wrong direction.</P>
      <P>If there had been much more criticism directed against the powers of the Board and the non-responsible character of the Minister in respect of this Bill, we might have had more success in making the Bill acceptable, but to lay down in the Bill that the Minister is to make nominations and that the Dáil is to have the responsibility of accepting, or rejecting these persons is quite a wrong function for the Dáil, and we ought not agree to it.  I say that the temptation to support the amendment is great for one who thinks that the Bill has so many major defects in regard to the particular powers of the Board and the non-responsibility of the Minister.  The temptation to me lies in this, namely, if this amendment were passed, it would give an opportunity to the new Dáil to amend the Bill in that particular.  Taking the amendment on its merits, I think it ought not to be passed, and I shall oppose it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson has taken up the attitude that the amendment is wrong because it takes away responsibility for appointments from <Col N="1257" /> the Minister.  I entirely disagree.  We have had experience of the names of Extern Ministers and other persons being submitted to, and accepted by, the Dáil, and I have, so far, had no reason to think that the Dáil will make use of the opportunity afforded to discuss the merits and qualifications of individuals.</P>

      <P>They are responsible to the Dáil, but the question arises of eliminating responsibility to the Dáil with regard to appointments on the Board.  I do not see that by laying the names on the Table of the House there is any likelihood of any of the persons named being criticised here.  The amendment proposes to give a safeguard, and I would have expected to get Deputy Johnson's support, because in delegating the powers as proposed in this Bill to the Board and taking them out of the ordinary criticism by members of this House, we are proceeding on a road which may lead us very far.  I would have expected that the one man in the House who would support the authority of the Dáil to the moderate extent proposed in this amendment would be the leader of the Labour Party.  There is no doubt that the principle involved here is a very difficult one to support; that is to say, that an autocratic body is to be set up under the Minister and not be accountable to this House in the ordinary way. When it has gone so far as to do away with the very important Constitutional principle of examination and report by the Comptroller and Auditor-General of the affairs of the Board is it unreasonable for me as a member of this House to ask the acceptance of the principle that when you put men into that extraordinary responsible position each member of the Dáil will have the right, if he considers it wise to exercise it, to criticise the appointments?  I cannot see that there is any real solid foundation for the objection raised in the matter, and I hope the House will accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult at first to grasp the significance of an amendment such as this and say yes or no to <Col N="1258" /> it.  Recognising the point of view put forward by Deputy Hewat as to the great responsibility this Board will have, and the responsibility of the Dáil that has approved of the Shannon scheme, and that has a responsibility in the matter of its success, we should make sure that all possible safeguards as far as lies in our power are inserted in the Bill so as to ensure the success of the scheme.  Viewing it from that point of view, and weighing up the pros and cons of Deputy Hewat's amendment, I have come to the conclusion there is nothing in the amendment which would ensure that a better type of man would be put on the Board than would otherwise be the case.  No matter what Board can be got together the members of it will not be the unanimous choice of the country.  They may be, from the Minister's point of view, the best Board he could get, but even this Dáil would not be unanimous in approving of the very best possible Board to do the work.  Supposing what Deputy Hewat wanted were done, what would be the position of Deputies in this House?  There are in the country men with ambition and self-confidence who would imagine that they are the proper persons to be appointed on this Board to manage the Shannon scheme.  Those men might not be able to get on the Board, and they might not be thought by others to be the best men to be appointed.  If the amendment were accepted it will be found that the men who think they are qualified to get on the Board, but who do not get appointed would see all the faults of the men who have got on the Board, and they would approach Deputies and want to get their complaints rehearsed in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know that there would be greater possibilities for the better management of the Shannon scheme, and that the status of the Board and the prestige of the House would be raised by giving us this power, and, in fact, making it mandatory on us to discuss the qualifications, and so on, of the men who would be so fortunate or unfortunate as to be put on this Board. I think it would certainly happen that men would be unhappy because they were not chosen, and the problem would have to be faced in this House <Col N="1259" /> of discussing the constitution of the Board and why, perhaps, certain men were not put on it.  That, I think, would not be of any benefit to the men in public life who did not succeed in getting on the Board.</P>
    <P>If I could see that in Deputy Hewat's amendment there are possibilities of this House keeping watch and control in a manner that would be beneficial to the State as regards the management of the scheme, without having any counteracting influence on the prestige of the House itself, then I might have something to say in support of the amendment.  As it stands I think Deputy Hewat would be ill-advised to press it. If it were accepted he would have the most disagreeable task that could be set to any member of the House of coming here and saying that a certain person for certain reasons was not elegible and should not be put on the Board.  I do not think the Deputy should make it possible for anyone to be put in the position of doing that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if we take these two amendments together we would get not only a certain amount of enlightenment but of guidance.  The previous amendment we were considering was that the members of this Board should have certain qualifications to enable them to discharge the duties imposed upon them.  That amendment was not acceptable to this House, and the Minister, or his successor, is left in the position of appointing persons to that Board who, in the opinion of many of us, may have no qualifications whatever to discharge those particular duties.  It has been said here that the duties devolving on this Board will be exceedingly onerous and responsible, and that very fact surely carries with it the obligation that the men appointed are capable of discharging those particular duties.  You cannot have it both ways.  If we are not to have in the Bill a qualification which will give some guarantee that this Board will be composed of men capable of discharging the duties and responsibilities attaching to the position I think it lies upon us as the elected representatives of the people to have the opportunity of discussing, if we like to avail <Col N="1260" /> of it in the Dáil, the constitution of the Board and the names of the persons who form that Board.</P>
      <P>If the other amendment had been passed, I certainly would not have taken up the strong attitude I have on this particular one.  But, in the absence, as I say, of the other amendment, one is forced to the conclusion that in the interests of the country this power should rest with the House.  I cannot understand why we should have all this secrecy.  The proposal of the amendment is that the Minister should disclose the names of the Board to the Dáil.  We are all satisfied that the Minister is giving very serious consideration to the constitution of this Board. If he would unburden himself and tell us the names of this Board, then I am quite sure there would not be any further discussion about it.  But this secrecy is very undesirable.  This whole scheme has been evolved in undesirable secrecy.  I do not know what position other Deputies are in, but I have never seen either a figure or a plan in connection with this scheme.  I went down to Limerick at the invitation of the Minister to see the works, but I saw no plan there.  That is the position of Deputies with regard to the scheme, Now we are called upon, in continuation of that policy, to give the Minister a blank cheque in connection with the appointment of the Board.</P>

Let the Minister be more frank with us.  Let us know more about what we are doing.  Would any of us in our private capacity attempt to cast on others the responsibility cast upon us under this Bill&mdash;that is to say, as the representatives of the people to see that these different appointments are properly made?  If we are to pass a Bill of this character, we are simply passing on the responsibility that we are bound to discharge in connection with the trust put in us at our election.  I, for one, must protest against this continuous policy of secrecy in connection with this whole scheme.  Deputy Johnson mentioned <Col N="1261" /> that we might have been more successful in our opposition to this scheme if instead of concentrating on certain points we had concentrated on others. Whatever Party can be proud of its attitude&mdash;if any Party can be proud of its attitude in connection with this Bill &mdash;I do not think the Party that Deputy Johnson is at the head of has very much to be proud of.</P>

      <P>There has been a certain amount of talk about the previous amendment.  I refrained from speaking a second time on that, but as it has been brought in here I want to say again that the amendment which the House has just got rid of bound nobody, if passed, except in the most negative way.  I still could have appointed the most incapable and incompetent Board&mdash;a Board that would make this House simply gasp with amazement &mdash;under the last amendment.  That is the great safeguard.  The only thing that was really rigid about it was that it prevented me from putting on certain people who might be capable.  Deputy Baxter spoke on the Committee Stage about an individual who had the agricultural interests at heart, but he simply is taken out by this.  I spoke of a lawyer, I spoke of accountancy, I spoke of a variety of people, and all that the last amendment did was simply to say: &ldquo;You shall not appoint any of these; you shall simply pick incompetents&rdquo;; because the whole idea was that I was out to pick incompetents. All it said was that I should take the incompetents from two classes.  Whether it was thought that they would provide the most incompetents or not, I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this we are asked to put on the <Col N="1262" /> House the responsibility of an administrative act&mdash;that the House shall really appoint the members of the Board; at least, that the Executive Council shall bring up names&mdash;a litany of them&mdash;and the House is to sit in solemn judgment within a period of 21 days, and then that 21 days may be extended when vacancies occur; or if the original six were not approved of, then there would have to be some other names brought forward, and the Board would never be appointed.  If it were, it would be appointed more or less on strict Party lines, and we would be getting right away from the impartiality that should lie upon appointments of this sort, and the Minister and the Executive Council would be definitely relieved thereafter of all responsibility for whatever that Board might do. That is one side of it.  The side that Deputy Baxter stressed is the other&mdash; the tremendous difficulty that there is going to be, in any event, in getting people to take on the duties imposed on the Board by this Bill.  Add to that the fact that certain people will not be put on.  And remember applications are already flowing in to me for people to be put on&mdash;applications from people who spend part of their days in the early morning giving interviews in newspaper offices about the defects of the Bill, and spend the other part of the day in my office seeing can they get appointed on the Board.  These men will not be appointed possibly. Then you get the canvass of Deputies and the litany of the rejected man, with all his virtues recited and all that can be said of evil against any man who happens to appear to be the weakest candidate, and the convening of opposing public protest meetings to cast odium upon certain people.</P>
    <P>Would any man in my position think of approaching any person with regard to a position on this Board until he knew how a clause dealing with the appointment of the Board was going to be affected by debate in this House or the other?  I have no idea who is going to be appointed on the Board.</P>

The Dáil is not fitted to appoint the Board, but it is fitted to approve the Executive Council; it is fitted to appoint an External Minister, but it cannot be trusted to appoint the Board.</P>

      <P>The procedure of the amendment follows many precedents. It follows in particular the State Lands Act.  I am quite sure every Deputy knows what competition there is if a house or land is to let, and how many disappointed applicants there are.  All particulars of every letting under the State Lands Act has to be laid on the Table of the Dáil and the matter is open to discussion, yet I do not remember any such discussion.  The Minister should really give Deputies credit for a little more responsibility than he does.  I know that he will say he has reason.

The Minister cannot see the other side of the question so convinced is he of his rightness.  He cannot see, therefore, that we are not proceeding from personal motives.  I should be very sorry indeed to challenge any appointment of the Board provided there were any credentials at all for it.  We realise the Minister's sense of responsibility, but we also have a sense of responsibility, and we are proceeding in this matter from a sense of duty.  We do not feel that we would be justified in giving the Minister a blank cheque in this matter.</P>

      <P>The Minister confines himself to a criticism of the amendments. The amendments are liable to err, but they are the best attempt that could be made under the circumstances. I ask Deputies to go back to the alternative which is the Bill.  The Minister himself, according to the discussion that has taken place, is not very clear about this, and seems to think that the Bill leaves it in a rather indefinite way. He has attempted to do it himself in a sort of general way.  This position, so far as the Bill is concerned, is very unsatisfactory, and all that these amendments aim at is to find some means whereby that position may be cleared up.  If Deputies are satisfied that the conditions embodied in the Bill are right, then they are justified in voting against the amendment, but I ask them not to interpret the amendment in the light that because they do not agree with every word in it that therefore the alternative in the Bill is right.  I ask them rather to do what I tried to do on the Committee Stage, namely, to explore the position with a view to finding a solution for it.  On the Committee Stage we got the decision from the Minister that he would reserve the matter for further consideration.  The amendment moved then was withdrawn on that understanding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood at all events that we left it in the atmosphere in which the Minister was to give the matter consideration before the Report Stage was taken.  I only refer to that to clear the air.  Irrespective of what happened on the Committee Stage, I still hold that the Bill as it stands is unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the House is willing to say that the Bill as it stands is satisfactory and not capable of further improvement, well and good.  Deputy Baxter and Deputy Johnson, I think, visualised the laying on the Table of the House of the names of the members of the proposed Board and the names of individual members when vacancies occurred as creating a situation which would raise controversial discussions in this House.  Has that been our experience, or is it likely to be our experience? Is it likely that any body of men in this House are going to get up and criticise the recommendations of the Minister unless they feel that they have good cause for doing so?  There is no use in saying, in the competition for membership of this Board, that because one man may be recommended by the Minister, some outside person who felt that he had a better right to the position would move Deputies to have the matter raised in the House. Let us visualise that position for a moment.  Under those circumstances what sort of reception would that outside man get from Deputies Baxter or Johnson?  Would either of them get up and say that the appointment of the Minister was wrong simply because somebody else had approached them who felt that he had a better claim to the position than the man who had obtained it?  Why, the thing is unthinkable. I say that the only safeguard is that the Minister, or whoever has the making of the appointment, would have clearly before him the criticism that might be incurred in connection with the appointment.  As far as criticism is concerned, if there is to be any proper criticism to be made or likely to be made, I say it would be a great <Col N="1266" /> deal better that it should be made in this House than outside of it.  In connection with these matters one must always recognise that a great many hares might be started and statements made outside of this House which certainly would never be made in it.  As far as clarifying the position is concerned, I maintain that is done under the amendment.  A motion brought forward for the appointment of any person recommended by the Minister would be absolutely safe from criticism by any member of the House, unless there was something seriously to be criticised in connection with that particular appointment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the case that has been made requires further consideration and analysis.  I do not think there is any precedent for giving powers to the Board such as are contained in this Bill.  The amendment that is supported by Deputy Hewat and other Deputies proposes that the names of these whom it is proposed to appoint shall be laid on the Table, and that the members of such Board shall not act until after a period of twenty-one sitting days during which either House may discuss the merits of the appointments. I think the amendment is impracticable and unwise.  The nearest approach to a parallel to the powers of this Board that I can find is in the Comptroller and Auditor-General Act. The appointment there is made by the House by resolution.  It is a positive act on the part of the House.  If the proposal here is that a person shall be appointed as a member of the Board by a resolution of the House, then the House is taking all responsibility for that appointment as a direct and deliberative act.  The suggestion here is that the Minister shall make a nomination, and the House shall then consider whether it may oppose the appointment, any member of the House having equal authority to raise the question of the appointment and discuss the merits or demerits of the particular person. The same thing may happen in the Seanad.  In the meantime this person may not act.  Deputy Cooper suggests that there is an analogy in the State Lands Act.  There is no such analogy. That Act dealt with the making of contracts in respect to the property of the <Col N="1267" /> State.  If the names of the persons making contracts with the Government were not disclosed no one would know who they were.  There is no such secrecy possible when you are making an appointment like this.  Here the names of the members of the Board will be made public to everyone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  It is implicit right through the Bill.  I think the proposition in the amendment is quite unwise.  It is going to make almost impossible the working of the scheme, even though the scheme were satisfactory.  I think, when discussing this amendment, we are bound to discuss it on the assumption that this Board is going to be appointed with the powers that are contained in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope very sincerely and earnestly that those powers will be greatly modified and that all responsibility for the action of the Board to the country will lie on the Minister.  But we have to consider this proposal on the assumption that the Board that the Minister is going to nominate and appoint will be almost a self-contained Board with absolute authority.  I do not think that it is wise for this House to say: &ldquo;Yes, we agree to that kind of a Board, but we are going to reserve to ourselves the right of holding up the appointment for twenty-one days until the merits of the particular person nominated on the Board are canvassed throughout the Saorstát.&rdquo;  If we are going to do that, let us demand that there shall be a formal resolution that &ldquo;Peter Murphy&rdquo; shall be a member of the Board.  It is much more direct and satisfactory than this proposal.  I think that the general idea behind the suggestion is a wrong one.  The proposition is that the merits and demerits of the proposed nominations are going to be made the subject not of a formal resolution but there is to be the possibility that some chance member of the Dáil may have some grudge against a person nominated and may chance to bring it forward some time between the date of the nomination and the end of the twenty-first day.  I think those chances are <Col N="1268" /> too great, and the risks are too great to encourage any suitable man to accept such an appointment.  I certainly will not support the motion in these terms.  I stated earlier that if I thought we would succeed in holding up the actual working of such a Board until after the election I might be tempted to support it just for purely obstructive purposes.  But I do not think it will have that effect.  I think the danger involved in supporting this proposition is too great a risk.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 7, before Section 3, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every member of the Board and every officer and servant of the Board shall while holding office or employed as such member, officer, or servant be disqualified from being nominated or elected and from sitting or receiving payment as a member of Dáil Eireann or of Seanad Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment follows upon an amendment that was set down on the Committee Stage, and which I asked to have held over in order to have it fitted into the general scheme of the Bill.  This amendment now meets the main amendment before the Committee Stage, but it does not meet with the point which Deputy T. O'Connell raised when that amendment was under discussion.  The Deputy wanted to have this disqualification confined to members of the Board and to officers of a particular grade of salary.  There is no great distinction about it.  Deputy O'Connell's desire apparently was to have the ordinary employee of the Board not subjected to disqualification from membership of the Oireachtas merely because he was in the employment of the Board.  The amendment as set down here does not meet that point of Deputy O'Connell's.  That was pressed by the Deputy to a certain extent.  Previously I asked that the amendment as a whole should be left over.  I am bringing it in now, insisting that disqualification applies right through.  Every officer and servant of the Board shall by holding office or being employed as such member, <Col N="1269" /> officer, or servant, be disqualified from being nominated or elected and from sitting or receiving payment as member of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I am moving this for the reasons that I did state on the Committee Stage, firstly, I could not see how a fully occupied employee of the Board could serve in the Oireachtas.  I could not see how the two duties are going to be carried out by the same man.  Secondly, I had the point that it being admitted, as it apparently was admitted by the House generally, that it was unwise to have either a member of the Board or a higher official of the Board a member of the Oireachtas, it seemed to me there was an equal case made for not having an employee of the Board serving that Board while a member of the Oireachtas, and serving under a more-highly paid official who was himself disqualified from being a member of the Oireachtas.  It seemed to me that it was going to lead to a certain reversion of authority that was not going to lead to the proper carrying out of their duties by the servants of the Board.  Consequently the amendment goes the full length of disqualification with regard to all employees and officials of the Board.</P>

      <P>I do not like to criticise the work of the draftsman, but in one respect there is a loophole in this amendment which did not exist in mine.  This amendment prohibits any person or servant of the Board being elected a member of the Oireachtas or from receiving payment. But, as the Minister and everybody else knows, there are persons who have been elected to the Oireachtas and who have not taken their seats in the Oireachtas and have not received payment. These could be elected previous to appointment.  You might appoint a person elected to the Dáil who had not taken a seat in the Dáil.  Such persons can be appointed, because such a person would not be sitting or receiving payment as a member of the Dáil. Yet he might be an officer of the Board. I would suggest that the situation thus created would mean that such a person if he wished to take his seat in the Dáil could only do so at a considerable financial sacrifice.  Now, surely it is <Col N="1270" /> the aim of wise policy to get representatives from every section of the people of the Saorstát into the Dáil.  I have always held that, and I do hold that it is unwise by an accident&mdash;what I think is an accident of the draftsman&mdash;to hold out a barrier of that kind.  We know that one Deputy has recently taken his seat.  If he had been an employee of this Board it might not be possible for him to take it, because he might forfeit his employment.  My amendment provided that no officer or servant of the Board should be eligible for election, and that if any member of either House became a member of the Board, or an officer or servant of the Board, he should thereby be deemed to have vacated his seat. That would be preferable to the Minister's amendment.  I ask the Minister to consider that point.</P>

      <P>I would like the House to consider this amendment in the light of the Bill.  I suggest to the Minister that at least there should be some little consistency between the Bill and his amendment.  The Bill proposes to hand over to the Board great powers, including the making of appointments, and conditions of appointment, of servants of the Board.  Why, then, put this kind of a provision in the Bill? It is a matter between the Board and the Board's servants as to what shall be the terms under which these servants so serving shall be employed.  It does not seem to me to be at all desirable that the Dáil should deliberately go out of its way to say that the employees of a Board, of a more or less private undertaking, a Trust which may have been financed by the State but is not controlled by the State, shall not be eligible to sit in the Dáil and not even be eligible to be nominated. It seems to me to be utterly inconsistent with the whole scheme of the Bill, and yet it is the Minister's own motion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Then I will plead with the Minister that it is unnecessary and undesirable that in an Act of this House that we should lay down that the terms of employment of a person who is to be employed by this Board shall necessarily contain one particular provision.  We are not laying down any conditions with regard to suitability, competence, nationality; we trust the Board to do that; but we are saying that we shall make sure that no servant of that Board shall ever come to contaminate these Benches.  I think the Dáil should reject this motion entirely.  I think the whole principle is a wrong one&mdash;that we should go out of our way to limit the rights of the citizen in a matter of this kind.  Let it be a matter of contract between the employer and the person who is seeking employment.  If the Minister wants to make it a condition on the employee that he shall not seek nomination or election, or, if elected, shall not sit, well, that is a matter between the employer and the servant.  But to think that we are going to lay down one condition only in respect of the terms of employment and that that should be one to prevent a person becoming a member of this House, seems to me to be preposterous and entirely undesirable. It is not merely the sitting.  The objection, apparently, was that the two duties could not be carried out by the same person, each of them efficiently. Let us concede that but it is not going to affect the question of being nominated. If we are to contemplate the possibility of the powers of this Board extending, let us say, to the Dublin municipal electricity supply, we are <Col N="1272" /> going to disfranchise all the employees &mdash;the stoker, or the equivalent of the stoker, the oiler, or any person who wires a house; the electrician and the wiring man who occasionally serves the Board by wiring houses.  We are going to prevent them from being nominated as members of the Dáil or Seanad.  I cannot understand the argument in favour of that.  It is a proposal that I hope the House will refuse to agree to.</P>

If you are going to make a departure now you will have to consider the whole question and go back on all the other Acts under which this sort of disqualification exists.</P>

      <P>For the first time this Dáil has seen Deputy Johnson in the role of an extreme individualist. He says that this is a matter of contract between employer and employee. Deputy Johnson has ignored the interests of the State.  Also for the first time to my knowledge the Deputy has used words loosely.  He says this is <Col N="1273" /> going to disfranchise people.  I am sure Deputy Johnson knows the meaning of the word disfranchise as well as, and even better, than I do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Deputy does not know the meaning as well as I do.  The word franchise means the right to vote for a member of Parliament. The word nominate is not part of my original amendment; it is one of the Minister's graft which, I think, has not improved the tree.  I use the word graft purely in the horticultural sense.</P>
      <P>What was the main thesis of the Minister's argument?  The first is that this Board is to be dissociated altogether from politics.  Does Deputy Johnson think it would be possible to keep members of the Board out of politics if they were sitting here in the Dáil?  Is it not likely that by some ingenious speech, not inconceivably, to my mind, a speech by Deputy Johnson, would lure them into debate?  Deputy Johnson did not press any of his arguments that members of the Board should be ineligible for membership of the Dáil or Seanad.  Does he accept that part of the amendment?  He knows too much to reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson then comes to officers and servants. This Board is going to be a great power in the State.  It is going to be from time to time influenced and controlled by the Minister.  There is no doubt it will not be possible to dissociate it so much from politics that the Minister will not have some say in its affairs, and it is going to have its actions questioned and canvassed.  If the Dáil rejects the amendment it will be possible for the Board to create an army of placemen in the State with the assent of the Government, not the present Government, and not any Government that I can visualise, looking at Parties in the Dáil, but with the assent of an abstract Government&mdash;shall I say that Government foreseen by Dean Swift, who maintained it was right to crack eggs at the big end?  With the assent <Col N="1274" /> of the Big-endians it would be possible for the Board to corrupt the whole fabric of the State by the creation of machinery which would lead to corruption and by dishonest posts.  Surely we do not want to get to that.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment is not perfect. I prefer the amendment that was brought forward on the Committee Stage; but this amendment, at any rate, is a barrier against getting electricity into politics.  It gets into politics very easily, as anyone who has studied the history of electricity in other countries knows.  This amendment is something of a barrier, and I hope the Minister who is now indifferent to it will become a little more enthusiastic about it, and will resist Deputy Johnson's attack.</P>

Place these men in the position of civil servants and I am prepared to agree to the amendment, but there would be no need for the amendment then, because it is already a rule of the Civil Service. But you are now asking us to agree to a proposition which is equivalent to saying that the employee of a private employer, engaged on the terms made by the employer, shall not be eligible for membership of the Dáil or Seanad, shall not even be eligible to be nominated for the Dáil or Seanad, and that will throw on the returning officer the responsibility of refusing his nomination, and there will have to be some kind of proof to the returning officer that such and such a person, who is being nominated by a proposer and seconder, with assenting citizens, is not eligible.

      <P>So that the proposition is that the Board, which otherwise has full power to make the terms and conditions under which it will engage its employees, shall be obliged to dismiss an employee who happens to be nominated as a member of the Dáil or Seanad.  That is the only condition of employment that you are prepared to put into the Bill.  Deputy Cooper challenged me on the question of whether my criticism applied equally to membership of the Board.  The Board is appointed by a Minister, and undoubtedly I think members of the Board should be prohibited from being members of either the Dáil or Seanad.  But the officers and servants of the Board are appointed by the Board and paid by the Board, and no responsibility of any kind lies on the Minister.  He has fashioned this Bill in such a way as to relieve himself of all responsibility, and in view of the general character and scheme of the Bill, to ask the House to make one condition in respect of those who are employed by this independent Board, that its employees, the men who wire your house, shall not be eligible for nomination or election, or to sit as a member of the Dáil or Seanad, is surely asking too much.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>7. In page 8, Section 6, to delete sub-section (2), lines 9 to 12, and substitute therefor the words: &ldquo;The accounts of the Board shall be audited by an auditor appointed by a resolution of Dáil Eireann, who shall act on behalf of Saorstát Eireann.  The cost of such audit shall be paid by the Board.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is intended to provide the second best alternative to the audit by the Comptroller and Auditor-General. The proposal of Deputy Cooper on the last consideration of this question was that the Auditor-General should have the responsibility and authority to audit the accounts. That was defeated.  I would much prefer that that should be inserted in the Bill before it passes into law, and I am moving this amendment as something second best to the Auditor-General.  It is a great improvement on the proposition in the Bill as it stands.  I say second best, but I think that the position we are being faced with, if this Bill passes either in its present form or even as amended by my proposal, would still leave the question of the Comptroller and Auditor-General a little difficult.  The spirit of the Comptroller and Auditor-General Act and of the Constitution in my opinion requires that the Comptroller and Auditor-General should audit the accounts of this particular undertaking inasmuch as the money has been provided by the State and it is run under the authority of the State.  That is a matter on which there may be differences of opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House to this important fact that, the Comptroller and Auditor-General Act, Section 7, sub-section (2), provides that by resolution of Dáil Eireann at any time the accounts of this undertaking may be audited by that official, and notwithstanding that the Oireachtas may decide to remove them from the purview of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, any future Dáil, by simple resolution, may require that the accounts shall be reported upon by that official.  Therefore we may be laying up for ourselves unnecessary difficulties. We may be providing what the Minister thinks is desirable, that the finances of this particular undertaking shall not be brought under public criticism, and yet a resolution of the Dáil at any time may still bring the accounts and those finances under the <Col N="1279" /> Comptroller and Auditor-General. Therefore there will be two audits, and he will be required to report, not in the normal way, but as additional and abnormal procedure.  I think the fact that that is possible by such a simple process makes the proposals of the Minister unwise because it is requiring a kind of super-auditor over the auditor that the Minister himself proposes to appoint.  It would be much simpler to have the normal process that these accounts would be audited by the auditor who acts on behalf of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <P>However, I am dealing now with the second best proposition, as far as I can see, that is, that the auditor who is to be appointed to audit the accounts shall be one &ldquo;appointed by a resolution of Dáil Eireann who shall act on behalf of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  That is the phrasing of the Comptroller and Auditor-General Act.  I think the line taken by the Minister in regard to this proposition is misdirected and mainly based upon either a misapprehension as to the position of the Comptroller and Auditor-General or a very serious fault in his mentality regarding the public finances.  The case made by the Minister seems to have been that it is undesirable that a public auditor acting on behalf of the State should have any say in the control or the check of the expenditure of this particular board, and his reason is that he does not want to drag the affairs of this particular undertaking into the public gaze.  I can understand quite well a case made that one does not want to interfere with the details of administration by discussion in this or any other public assembly before the act or immediately after the act of administration, but the work of the auditor is the work of looking over the financial affairs a considerable time after the event.  It is no interference with the administrative activities of the Board.  His business is to make sure that the finances of the undertaking have been carefully looked after and that spending has been according to order and regulation.  I think that the people who are to provide the money are the people to make the appointment.</P>
    <P>Some references were made to public <Col N="1280" /> companies.  It is the shareholders at the annual meeting of an ordinary public company who appoint the auditor, and it is to the shareholders the auditor reports.  The proposal in the measure is that the Minister, who is the spending authority under our constitutional arrangement, shall appoint the auditor, and that the auditor shall report to him&mdash;entirely wrong from a financial point of view.  The people who provide the money are to have no say in the matter.  The auditors may report on the proceedings. They may put in their report exactly what they like and omit what they like.  They are not reporting on the finances.  They are making a report to the Minister, the spending Department, and the people who provide the money are to have no say in that most important of all affairs.  The Bill provides for the keeping of accounts according to an arrangement which shall be made by the Minister after consultation with the Minister for Finance. He will consult with the Minister for Finance and then proceed to make his own arrangements as to the form of accounts, but I think more than that is required in regard to any financial administration. There is something more required than the mere audit of the accounts and the presenting of the annual report.  &ldquo;The accounts of the Board shall be audited annually.&rdquo;  I believe in this matter, as in all public expenditure, it is desirable that there should be a running audit and that that audit should be conducted by a public official.</P>
    <P>Let us consider for a moment what power is given to this Board.  They are to be handed over five and a half million pounds' worth of supplies, power and material for producing power, plus two and a half millions of money that is now being embodied in this Bill, plus another one or two millions which they may take over from the municipal authorities, plus anything else that may accrue in the course of time.  It is a trust the money for which is being provided by the State, and the Board has absolute power in respect of administration. It may spend as it likes.  Its only responsibility, as far as I can see, is to ensure that the expenditure and the <Col N="1281" /> income will be more or less balanced and that the scheme shall eventually pay for itself, but the manner of expenditure the Board itself has to determine. We have the right to assume that they will be men of the highest integrity and capacity, with the utmost wisdom in regard to accounting, but they are going to hand over their powers to officers.  These officers, too, might be assumed to be men of the highest integrity and capacity, but they will be largely dependent on the action of subordinates, and we know that subordinates can very often spend wrongfully, waste public money.</P>
    <P>It is necessary that we, at least, should have some say in the checking of this scheme and the system, so that, as far as we can bring it about, opportunities for mis-spending those public moneys should be reduced to a minimum. That is not provided for by the scheme in the Bill.  The Minister intends that should be provided for by the appointment of an auditor who shall be qualified, and it is proposed that these accounts should be audited annually. That may mean anything.  You may have an internal audit which has to be ultimately overlooked by the annual audit, a continuous internal audit which has to be overlooked by the outside auditor.  We are getting no assurance whatever that the public side of this expenditure is going to be safeguarded. The Minister resents what he calls the interference of the auditor, but I think that is a very dangerous state of mind for the Minister to be in.  He resents the interference in financial matters of the Auditor-General.  He expressed the determination that, so far as he could ensure it, the accounts of this Board would not be brought into discussion in the Dáil.  On the second part of Deputy Cooper's amendment, the Minister objected to &ldquo;bringing back the whole of the accounts of the Board from year to year for discussion in the Dáil, in view of the political reactions that were bound to follow from that&rdquo;; he was &ldquo;not prepared to have every action of the Board criticised from the political point of view in the House&rdquo;; he was &ldquo;not prepared to have every account of the Board dragged back again into this House through the supervision of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.&rdquo;<Col N="1282" /> I say it is a deplorable and lamentable state of mind for a Minister to be in when he can give expression to such views as that about public expenditure.</P>
    <P>There are a number of members of this House who have been, during the last four years, from time to time, members of the Public Accounts Committee. I have the names marked on a division list of Deputy Wolfe, Deputy Patrick J. Egan, Deputy Wilson, Deputy Michael Hennessy and Deputy Martin Roddy as Deputies who voted against the proposal that the accounts should be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  They, no doubt, heard the statement of the Minister in regard to bringing before this House the report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, the &ldquo;dragging into this House&rdquo; of the accounts as audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General as representing the Saorstát and discussing them from a political point of view.  I challenge any of these members to say whether, at any time, in the Public Accounts Committee, there has been any discussion of the accounts from a political point of view.  Has there ever been any discussion in this House of these accounts from a political point of view?</P>
    <P>I say this, and I am loth to say it, that if there had been any desire to discuss these accounts from a political point of view we might have made much party capital out of it.  We have not done so, and I think it is a reflection upon the Public Accounts Committee and upon the majority of that Public Accounts Committee which always comes from the Government side of the House, to say that these accounts have been discussed from a political point of view or that it is possible to drag them into this House and discuss them there from that point of view.  If that is the attitude of mind of the Minister in regard to the Auditor-General and Public Accounts Committee then this State, under its present Government, is in a deplorable condition.  It is a very delicate matter to have at the early stages of this new institution Ministers resenting a public audit by a public accountant nominated and appointed by the House following an implicit direction in the Constitution, <Col N="1283" /> and resenting the examination of these accounts by the Comptroller and Auditor-General and an examination of his report by Deputies belonging to this House.  I say that is a deplorable state of mind to have expressed from the Ministerial Benches.</P>
    <P>I think the House would be very wise to pass this amendment, which will at least ensure that the auditor will act for the House and the public, and not for the Minister, who is the spending authority.  The Minister seems to suggest that he, in making the appointment, will be acting, for the public. But let us realise our relative positions under our constitutional scheme in regard to finance and administration generally.  Ministers come to the House and ask for money.  It is the House that provides that money&mdash; allows the Ministers to direct the spending of it under very strict check. It is not as representatives of the money-providing authority that Ministers are acting when they are dealing with the spending of public money. They are the people who have to be checked, and quite rightly.  I am sure that every Minister who appreciates the position welcomes that particular kind of check.  It is not a correct representation of the position for the Minister to say that he can act on behalf of Saorstát Eireann in making an appointment of the auditor who is to audit the accounts on behalf of the people who provide the money.</P>
    <P>There has been an attempt to make, throughout this Bill, an analogy with an independent public company&mdash;independent of the petty and detailed criticism of an elected body.  We can discuss the implications of that at another time, but let us accept that analogy.  If we accept that analogy we are bound to follow it a little further, and to say that it is the people who provide the money&mdash;that is, the public&mdash;who should appoint the auditor.  As I said at the beginning, I would much prefer that the question should be discussed as a proposition to give the Auditor-General power, but I am precluded from that by the rules of order, and, as I said, I am moving this amendment as second best.  I hope, before the Bill becomes law, that if this amendment is passed it, also, <Col N="1284" /> will be eliminated, and that a provision for the Comptroller and Auditor-General will be put in its place.  I want the House to remember that the possibilities are that the Dublin Corporation Accounts will be audited by the Auditor appointed under this Section; that is, the Dublin Corporation accounts in respect of their expenditure on electrical supply.  At present they are audited by a public official following an internal audit.  I think this proposition is lessening even the check on these accounts as compared with the check of the present audit.  Surely when we are enlarging the powers of a Board, we ought not, concurrently with that, to be weakening the financial check.  There is imperative need, I think, that we should be rigorous and stiff in ensuring that the public side of the financial part of this scheme should be absolutely water-tight, so far as we can make it so.  It is not so in this section, and no matter what forms may be devised by the Minister, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, no matter what finished accounts he may be presented with by the auditor, that is not going to be as valuable an audit, from the public point of view, as an audit of the kind that the Comptroller and Auditor-General would give us, or that an auditor appointed by this House would give us. I ask the House to give very serious and earnest consideration to the proposition in the Bill and to the proposed amendment.  I, for my part, will do my best to defeat this Bill&mdash;notwithstanding that there is much in it of which I approve&mdash;unless a very great change takes place in respect to the audit and in respect to the powers of the Board.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson rather apologised for his amendment because it was second best.  That is the position we are largely in with regard to the Bill as a whole.  There are objectionable provisions in the Bill. The amendments we put forward were not advocated on their individual merits, but because we regarded them as preferable to the provisions in the foundation Bill on which we were working.  I agree with what Deputy Johnson has said as regards the taking <Col N="1285" /> of control out of the hands of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  In doing that, I think we are opening a door which may lead to wide possibilities. Following his attitude on another amendment, I think Deputy Johnson's amendment is illogical.  Deputy Johnson proposes that the Dáil shall appoint an auditor.  That auditor, when appointed, is going to override the authority of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, already appointed by the Dáil.  The Deputy then contradicts himself by proposing the appointment of an auditor by the House when, on a previous occasion, he said that he would prefer an amendment in my name would not be passed because it would bring the House into relationship with the Board to be appointed.</P>

      <P>I am not very clear that it is.  I think we have very mixed ideas with regard to this Bill, when it is stated that the Bill is based on the position of the Board being that of a private enterprise, while we are told immediately afterwards that we, as a House, are to appoint certain officials to safeguard the interests of the House. I will vote for Deputy Johnson's amendment on the grounds that it is better than the provisions in the Bill, but I think the amendment is illogical in view of the attitude taken up by the mover on another occasion.  The principle running right through the Bill is that the State is going to indulge in a private enterprise.  This enterprise is going to be dissociated from the Dáil, as representing the people, as far as it is possible to do so.  If you call the £5,000,000 capital I do not know what you are going to call the £2,500,000 passed the other day and the unlimited amount of extra money that will be required in connection with development, but all that, under the Bill, will pass from the control of the Dáil.  There is nothing to prevent the Minister for <Col N="1286" /> Finance coming forward for another £2,500,000 or, perhaps, £10,000,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Except the Dáil. There is no reason why the Minister should not do exactly what he has done in connection with the £2,500,000&mdash; refuse to give the Dáil any information with regard to the segregation of the amounts.  The Minister for Finance simply came to the House with a resolution for £3,100,000, which was boiled down to £2,500,000 by taking away the £600,000 from the original amount. The Minister for Industry and Commerce refused to give any information to this House of the amounts, on the ground that this was purely a case of getting a certain amount of money to develop the scheme outlined in the Bill. Let us not forget that when this £2,500,000 is added to the £5,200,000, of what I may call capital expenditure, neither sum will be accounted for in any way.  The Bill provides that this matter is to be outside the purview of the House.  The House is deliberately laying down the principle that the Executive Council can come forward with a Bill at any time in connection with any matter and provide that in connection with that Bill this House is to have no right to criticise the expenditure of the moneys.  I do not accept that principle, and I will not accept it.  While I will vote for Deputy Johnson's amendment as being an improvement on what is in the Bill, I do not regard it as a solution to the problem. Under that amendment this House is to appoint an independent auditor in connection with the expenditure of money voted by this House, notwithstanding that we have at present the Comptroller and Auditor-General appointed for all these purposes.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be led into the side avenue down which Deputy Hewat has gone, but since this amount of money which has to be voted is such a sore subject with him I want <Col N="1287" /> again to assert that I did give information about it.  This is the business man's attitude over again.  There is no qualification in the Bill with regard to membership and, therefore, Deputy Good says: &ldquo;You are going to appoint a man without qualifications.&rdquo;  Deputy Hewat, because he does not get all the information he wants, says that he did not get any information.  That sort of argument would hardly deceive a child, but apparently it goes down in business circles.  There was an amount of information given, but not all that these Deputies wanted.  They wanted to know how much money was going to be segregated for particular purposes.</P>

      <P>Apparently the Deputy attends the House in body, but, so far as his mind or attention goes, being in an absent-minded mood, he can elevate anything out of the depths of his imagination and make that his argument.  I have given information about the moneys.  If the Deputy did not hear, he can read, and if he does not understand, he can ask us and we will see if we can give him anything more.  The Deputy is concerned about what we are going to do in regard to appointing people whom the Comptroller and Auditor-General will not be able to supervise.  Now, according to Deputy Hewat, we are accepting a principle which may be pushed to any extreme, and at any time the Minister may come forward and appoint this or that type of official, put him on the Central Fund, and there will be no opportunity of discussing him.  The Deputy does not, apparently, know <Col N="1288" /> that the judges and the Comptroller and Auditor-General are appointed in that way.  The Dáil, for what seemed to be a good reason at the time, decided that the judges should not come up here for review, so far as their salaries were concerned, and the only duty of the Comptroller and Auditor-General was to certify that certain sums issued from the Central Fund reached their destination.  I gave my reasons for this proposal on Second Reading, and also on the Committee Stage when the Comptroller and Auditor-General's amendment was produced here.  For these reasons I ask the House to assert that it is right that the finances of the Board shall be left as they are in the Bill.  What is that way? There is going to be room for discussion on certain aspects of the accounts. Under Section 31 the report has to be submitted to the Minister, and the Minister must lay it on the Tables of both Houses.  That report contains, amongst other matters, the auditor's report in connection with Section 6.</P>

      <P>I hold that that is one of the reports to be put in under that section.  I have, in fact, been so advised, but, if it is not clear, we can put it in.  I have not introduced an amendment to that effect as I am advised that it is necessarily included. We are going to have publicity.  I want all the publicity possible with <Col N="1289" /> regard to the Board.  I said that I want the Board to be free from political influences in its duties, and that the counter to that was that there should be as much publicity as people would regard as necessary.  I could amend the auditor's section in a variety of ways and am prepared to do so.  Even if that point of view seems deplorable, as reiterated by Deputy Johnson, it is still my mentality on that.  I do not want the Comptroller and Auditor-General, whose business it is to make a certain type of report and a certain type of audit which are not at all suited to a commercial concern such as this is going to be.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General's main function is to report on disbursements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going on the negative side.  I read at an earlier stage the duties of the Comptroller and Auditor-General as laid down in the Act of 1923.  The remark I made then was that there was nothing prescribed by law with regard to those accounts. All that the Comptroller and Auditor-General could do would be to say whether or not disbursements were in order.  I think that is a sound statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, we can have that argued.  One of his functions would be the matter of disbursement. The Comptroller and Auditor-General would still have, under the Bill as it stands, the duty of making a report as to whether or not issues from the Central Fund reached their destination. That is where the Comptroller and Auditor-General comes in, and there he stops.  After that, his place is taken and, as I hold, necessarily taken, by an auditor who will audit the accounts as those of a commercial firm.  What account is there presented to the Oireachtas by the Comptroller and Auditor-General in which you get the things mentioned in the amendment of Deputy Thrift which I accepted, namely, a statement regarding capital, a profit <Col N="1290" /> and loss account, and a balance sheet? That is not what the Comptroller and Auditor-General is for.  It was not for that particular type of function that his officials were given to him.  I hold that in ordinary accountancy outside you will get an auditor who will audit the accounts of this particular Board much better than the Comptroller and Auditor-General's office can do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

I go no further than that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if any of them had experience, so far as life under the auspices of the Dáil is concerned, in auditing accounts of a commercial firm&mdash;none whatever.  Let us take the second best amendment.  We are going to have an auditor, appointed by resolution of the Dáil, who shall act on behalf of Saorstát Eireann and the cost of such audits is to be paid by the Board.  We may take as an appendage to that that the accounts are to be presented. I take it that this amendment is to sub-section (3), instead of sub-section (4).  Apparently, the report is to be sent to the Clerk of the Dáil, instead of to the Minister, along with the various matters set out in the sub-section. What is the difference?  On the one hand, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, as the Bill stands, but, if this amendment be accepted, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, is to appoint a qualified auditor, or auditors, and the reports are to be submitted to the Minister.  These, I hold, are afterwards to come before the Dáil, and can be made to come before the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is described as the head <Col N="1291" /> of a spending department.  After all the talk there has been, and all the discussions that we have had with regard to the control of public expenditure, I wonder is there any doubt in anybody's mind in this House as to who really is the main check on expenditure as far as the Dáil is concerned. There are the Comptroller and Auditor-General, the Committee of Public Accounts, and this House in its discussion of the Estimates.  Is it not mainly&mdash; as regards nine-tenths of the work&mdash; done by the Minister for Finance who is the real check?  As far as the State is concerned the real check to extravagance in spending departments, if there be any attempt at extravagance, is the Minister for Finance and his Department. The auditor is to be appointed under the Bill, plus the amendment put forward for discussion, by the Minister for Industry and Commerce with the consent of the Minister for Finance, and the accounts are to be presented to the House and to come up for discussion. On the other hand, we have Deputy Johnson's point of view: &ldquo;Let us have a resolution of the House, and the report thereafter sent to the Clerk of the Dáil.&rdquo;  I do not know the significance of sending the report to the Clerk of the Dáil, except that he is the official who should receive the accounts from the auditor appointed by resolution of this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Baxter referred in an earlier amendment to the amount of canvassing and the beleaguering of the doors of the Dáil with regard to the appointment of members of the Board. If Deputy Hewat's last amendment, that the names were to remain on the Table for 21 days and be subject to criticism during all that period, had been accepted, would we not have the same beleaguering of the doors and canvassing with regard to the appointment of an auditor by a resolution of this House?  If that is regarded as probable or possible, is it a proper thing to have happening, and what extra safeguard is there after you have all this machinery set in motion?  The touch as between this House and anybody outside the House appointed for the business of the House should be in the biggest majority of cases through <Col N="1292" /> the Executive Council of the day.  It is quite a strange procedure to have the Dáil dealing direct with somebody to be appointed from outside as an official of the Dáil for the time being&mdash;quite as new a procedure as was the procedure outlined in Deputy Hewat's amendment with regard to the appointment of members of the Board on the nomination of the Minister and the censoring or rejection by the House.  The touch of the House with anybody outside brought in for a particular purpose to be the servant of the House should be through the Executive Council, through the people appointed to carry out that sort of duty for the House during their period of office.  This is quite as illogical as Deputy Hewat's amendment with regard to the appointment of members of the Board.  It gives no extra safeguard.  It brings nothing under the control of the Dáil that is not already under its control, and it introduces that very disturbing feature to the ordinary Deputy's life here in the hectoring and beleaguering that would go on with regard to an appointment of this kind if made by a resolution of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I know where the President was the day before yesterday, as I saw his picture in the paper.  I do not know if he met any masters of foxhounds, and if he did whether they asked him if he could find a man who would run a drag.  If they had asked him I know he would have recommended the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  There is no one who swings a red herring across the trail with so much dexterity as the Minister.  He has devoted his speech in part to one of Deputy Hewat's amendments which had been already rejected by the House, and he has not devoted more than five minutes to the actual proposal Deputy Johnson has made.  That is a strong proposition and requires a stronger case to refute and rebut it than the Minister has made in the course of his somewhat discursive speech.  The Minister says: &ldquo;I hold that the auditor's report must be submitted to the Dáil.&rdquo;  When did he begin to hold that theory?  I think it was on the Committee Stage.  It was not stated in the original Bill or during the Second Reading debate.  It has <Col N="1293" /> come into the Bill on Report as a result of an argument by Deputy Thrift, and I am not absolutely satisfied it has come in, even now.  Again the Minister says: &ldquo;The Comptroller and Auditor-General is not in a position to audit accounts as well as outside firms are.&rdquo; Has he inquired and has he satisfied himself that there are no members of the Comptroller and Auditor-General's staff who have experience of auditing the accounts of a commercial firm?  If my information is correct, there are members on the Comptroller and Auditor-General's staff who have the ordinary qualifications of chartered accountants, and who, before they became members of that staff, were occupied in the precise kind of work the Minister now says they are unable to undertake.</P>
      <P>However, that is beside the point, for Deputy Johnson's amendment does not say the Comptroller and Auditor-General. It merely says that the Dáil shall prescribe the auditor and not the Minister. The Minister has discovered that the one real check on the expenditure of money is the Minister for Finance, and he has a subsequent amendment requiring the assent of the Minister for Finance to the appointment of the auditor.  That check never occurred to him until I suggested it on the Committee Stage.  The more we discuss this Bill the better it becomes, and, therefore, the longer we go on discussing it the better we shall get the Minister from his present mood.  I remember when the President said that his motto was &ldquo;sursum corda,&rdquo; and it is a motto I have tried to adopt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has a different motto.  Whenever we try to question anything in his Bill it is not &ldquo;sursum corda&rdquo; but &ldquo;pax vobiscum.&rdquo;  I would like this Bill to be an agreed measure.  It is rather a big issue to gamble on.  I would like if the Minister had more consultation before he introduced the Bill, and given more weight to his opponents' views, and I think he should remove the atmosphere of suspicion and distrust that exists at present by assenting to Deputy Johnson's amendment. I do not believe that the finances of the Bill and of the Board cannot stand examination.  I believe they can, but I believe that Deputies, as a <Col N="1294" /> general body, and the public, as a whole, will not be convinced of that unless there is an entirely independent audit.  The Minister is two people rolled into one.  At one moment he is an independent Minister, and at another he talks about &ldquo;my Board,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the advice I will give to the Board.&rdquo; When he adopts that attitude one cannot be satisfied with regard to the appointment of the auditor.  It will be &ldquo;my auditor.&rdquo;  Therefore, I suggest that Deputy Johnson's amendment is a reasonable, sound and modest one. I am sorry if, to use, perhaps, an unparliamentary expression, I have queered his pitch.  I was conscious when moving my previous amendment that I was only a clumsy Ajax.  I now rejoice that Achilles has emerged from his tent and is taking up the burden of battle.  I hope that he will take up not only the burden of battle, but the laurels of victory on this amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister, I am afraid, has not given consideration to the importance of form and procedure in respect to finance.  I do not know whether he has consulted the Minister for Finance, or the President, who has had experience of the office of Minister for Finance, but I ask Ministers to give some weight to the consideration that the Comptroller and Auditor-General is a very important official, and that to imply that the value of his duties is only one-tenth as compared with nine-tenths for the Finance Department, suggests that Ministers are belittling the importance of the function of an auditor.  We all know that the Department of Finance, to protect the general interests of course, but, theoretically, at any rate, to protect the spending departments from outstepping their authority and spending more than they have been authorised to spend, acts as a check upon the spending departments.  But the Department of Finance is acting on behalf of Ministers to whom the money is granted.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General, on the other hand, acts on behalf of the State, on behalf of the Dáil as representing the public.  There is a very great and a very important distinction which is set out very clearly in the Constitution, <Col N="1295" /> that the Comptroller and Auditor-General is acting on behalf of Saorstát Eireann, appointed by the Dáil as the finance authority, and that his power in regard to accounts is practically supreme.  If we are to say that the Finance Department is all that is necessary&mdash;and that is more or less implied by the Minister's statement&mdash;then we should amend the Constitution and save a few thousands per year in expenses. But it is not sufficient.  It may be said that the whole financial system that we have adopted is all wrong.  On behalf of the Executive Council it may be said that this finance system should be scrapped, that it is utterly wrong, or even partially wrong, and should be amended.  But let them come and do that boldly and formally, and do not let the alteration come by these insidious side methods.  I would remind the Minister that in the Act he has quoted there is more than one section.  He said that the Comptroller and Auditor-General's Department is not fitted, and was never intended, to audit such accounts as the trading accounts of a board such as this, and he quoted the section which suited his argument regarding the control of expenditure and the check over disbursements. I refer him to Section 7 of that Act, sub-section (3), which refers to certain other Acts:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;III.... the Comptroller and Auditor-General shall have and exercise all such powers and perform all such duties as are prescribed by this Act or are conferred or imposed on him by any Act of the Parliament of the late United Kingdom having the force of law in Saorstát Eireann and adapted to the circumstances of Saorstát Eireann by or under the Adaptation of Enactments Act, 1922 (Number 2 of 1922), and particularly by the Exchequer and Audit Departments Acts, 1886 and 1921 ...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those Acts that the Minister forgot to note do give authority and quite clearly prescribe that the British Comptroller and Auditor-General whose system we have taken over, shall audit trading accounts.  I have here a report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General upon the accounts of the income and expenditure of certain manufacturing, trading and commercial services for the year <Col N="1296" /> ending 31st March, 1925.  The scheme of the Comptroller and Auditor-General fits in precisely with the proposal that he should have the responsibility of auditing the accounts of such a concern. It is wrong, I maintain, to argue that the audit by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, or by an auditor appointed by the Dáil, is going to militate against the efficiency of the business, unless the efficiency is purchased at the cost of bad financial administration. He comes in after the decisions regarding expenditure have been made; he seeks the authority for expenditure, and he will have perhaps a clearer recognition of the responsibility to the authority providing the money than an auditor appointed by the person who has the spending of the money, which in effect is the proposal in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this that may appeal to certain Deputies.  Has there been any estimate of the cost of the audit by a firm of outside auditors? Has the Minister given any consideration to that side of the question?  There is going to be a continuously increasing responsibility upon the firm of auditors that will be appointed.  In the early stages it will be much smaller than when the Board has taken over the distribution side.  When the electricity undertakings of Dublin, Rathmines and Pembroke have been absorbed, when the regular distribution of electricity the sale of apparatus, and perhaps the manufacture of apparatus, are brought under the authority of the Board, the-outside auditor who is to do this work efficiently is going to charge a pretty considerable fee, a very much greater fee than would be the cost of the audit under a State Department&mdash;possibly £20,000, £30,000 or £40,000 per annum, according to the extent of the consumption of electricity and the number of consumers.  That is a matter that, to my mind, is very small as compared with the principle involved.  The Minister tries to make play with the suggestion that the appointment of an auditor under my proposition by a resolution of the House would mean the canvassing of members.  There is no proposition here, that the Minister shall make a nomination, and that it shall lie in abeyance for 21 days.  The proposition here is that there shall be done exactly <Col N="1297" /> what the Ministers did when they appointed the present Comptroller and Auditor-General.  The nomination would be made by the Minister, and the House would accept or reject it.</P>
    <P>The Minister may know what the practice has been in regard to such appointments.  I do not know.  At least I would be rather surprised if such appointments as that have been very generally preceded by widespread canvassing of Ministers.  They certainly have not been preceded by widespread canvassing of members of the Dáil.  I say we are bound, if we are looking after the public interests, to ensure that the auditor, whoever he may be, shall be appointed by the money-providing authority, and that he shall report to that authority.  That is not done by the Bill, and I seek to do it by the amendment.  I ask the House to support the proposition in the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson professes to see in this amendment, or in the difference between this amendment and the provisions of the Bill, an issue so great and so important that the result of the Dáil's decision, upon it would influence in a decisive way his attitude towards the Bill.  Personally, I fail to see any such issue joined in the amendment. (Amendment quoted.) The provision in Section 6 of the Bill is that &ldquo;the accounts of the Board shall be audited annually by auditors appointed for the purpose by the Minister, and the fees of such auditors and the expenses generally of such audits shall be paid by the Board.&rdquo;  The Minister supplemented that by a reference to Section 31, and stated if there was any doubt that the report of the auditor would be one of the documents covered by sub-section (3) of Section 31 he was prepared to insert an amendment explicitly covering that report to ensure that, in that way, the report of the auditor would, in fact, come before the Dáil.  Therefore there is no question here of any desire to withhold from the Dáil the report of the auditor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question boils down simply to <Col N="1298" /> one of whether or not the auditor is to be appointed by the Minister, as provided in the Bill, or by resolution of Dáil Eireann as provided in the Deputy's amendment.  A resolution of Dáil Eireann tabled by whom?  By any Deputy presumably.  I want to make no particular point of that.  We will take it that the resolution would in fact, be tabled by the Minister.  It would be open to every Deputy to put down amendments so that we could have here, under the provisions of the Deputy's amendment, an interesting couple of days' discussion as to the merits of various firms of accountants and auditors in the city and throughout the State.  No doubt every Deputy would back his fancy and we would have a very interesting and lively discussion. Deputy Cooper emphasised the desirability, as he put it, of an entirely independent audit.  The Deputy knows, of course, that a Government commands a majority in the Dáil. If it did not it would not be a Government very long.  Is there really a point of substance between an auditor appointed as a result of a resolution tabled by the Minister and an auditor appointed by the Minister direct?  Let us bring our minds to bear on that for a moment.  The Minister comes here with a resolution naming a particular firm of auditors.  If that resolution is passed, and if that auditor is in fact, appointed, is there an enormous difference between him and between his degree of independence and the degree of independence of an auditor appointed by the Minister direct?  Deputy Cooper may think that there is a tremendous difference.  I do not.  I wonder does Deputy Hewat?</P>

      <P>So for the sake of this principle we are to open up the possibility&mdash;I do not put it higher because I have perhaps too high an opinion of the commonsense of Deputies&mdash;that when the Minister tables his resolution naming an auditor you will have ten or twelve amendments naming some other auditors.  Now do not Deputies know that if that resolution were brought forward, in fact, what would happen would be that there <Col N="1299" /> would scarcely be amendments tabled. The thing would become simply a kind of sham, the kind of sham that ought not to appeal to anyone.  But Deputy Johnson says that the great principle would be established, that this was an officer of the Dáil, and that is his next best to the Comptroller and Auditor-General. I do not want to travel the ground of discussing to what extent the Comptroller and Auditor-General, as distinct from the Minister for Finance or in contrast with the Minister for Finance, is a check on extravagance, to use the Deputy's words; but it has always seemed to me that the prime function of the Comptroller and Auditor-General was to see that moneys were duly paid and not expended otherwise than as voted, and not expended unless voted.</P>

      <P>I have not denounced anything.  &ldquo;Denounced&rdquo; is a strong word.  I tried envisaging the position that would or could arise on the adoption of the Deputy's amendment. First of all, it is not stated the resolution is to be tabled by the Minister. Presumably the Minister would be at pains to table the resolution before any private Deputy had got ahead of him.  You could then have a long discussion in the Dáil as to the relative merits of A, B, C or D with regard to this position.</P>

      <P>Does the Deputy <Col N="1300" /> envisage it as a possibility that particular firms or particular individuals might be unwilling to accept nomination by the Minister on those terms? If there could be here absolutely unrestricted criticism&mdash;not necessarily fair criticism and not necessarily impartial criticism; but that people influenced by business rivals would come here to the Dáil and make allegations under the privileges of Parliament&mdash;I could well imagine a firm of standing and repute refusing to accept the Minister's nomination, refusing to allow their names to figure in any such resolution on that basis.  Now, there is nothing in it in fact.  An auditor appointed as a result of a resolution tabled by the Minister and carried by supporters of the Government in the Dáil is not less independent than an auditor appointed direct by the Minister.</P>
      <P>On the question of the accessibility of his report to Deputies, there is nothing in it either, because the Minister has stated his complete willingness, if Section 31 (3) does not cover the point, to insert an amendment that will quite definitely cover it so that the auditor's report shall be available to the Dáil.  Therefore, on these two grounds there is nothing of substance and nothing of reality as between the Deputy's amendment and the provision of the Bill.  But the Deputy's amendment opens up an entirely undesirable possibility in the nature of criticism here in the Dáil as to the respective merits of business firms.  I suggest to Deputies that they would do well to abide by the provision in the Bill rather than pass the amendment.</P>

On this occasion he has been enchanted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and has merely substituted more abstraction.  I accept his low opinion of the common mind of the Dáil.  I am prepared myself to be the lowest common multiple of that mind.  As the Minister asked me at least one question I would like to ask him one in return.  He asked is there any difference between an auditor <Col N="1301" /> appointed by the Minister and an auditor appointed as the result of a resolution tabled by the Minister?  I would like to ask him in return, is there any difference between a Bill introduced by a Minister and a Bill as amended in Committee?  If the Minister will consult the Bill we are discussing he will find a very substantial difference, and if he will cast his mind so far into the future as to foresee that the 47 amendments tabled by the Minister for Industry and Commerce may be carried on Report Stage, he will find there is even a more substantial difference.</P>

A Press campaign can do far more harm, and there might easily be a Press campaign launched against an auditor appointed by the Minister without power of discussion.  That could do far more harm to an individual firm than any kind of criticism in the Dáil. Criticism in the Dáil is wholesome; it ventilates; it gives an opportunity to both sides to be heard.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice has made the point that the capacity, the qualifications, the character and all the rest of it of the auditor who is to be appointed by the House are to be discussed, and there might be half a dozen rival nominations, and the rival claims are to be canvassed. It so happens that the Minister who made that remark was responsible for introducing into the Provisional Parliament the Constitution which contained certain provisions regarding the appointment of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  I think he was responsible&mdash;if it was not he it was one of his colleagues&mdash;for the drafting of the Comptroller and Auditor-General Act and the procedure set forth in that Act for the appointment of the Auditor-General was exactly the procedure that was proposed in this amendment of mine for the appointment of an auditor for these accounts.  As a matter of fact, the amendment is taken exactly from the Minister's own Act.  &ldquo;It shall be lawful for Dáil Eireann from time to time by resolution carried by a majority of the members present and voting to appoint a Comptroller and Auditor-General.&rdquo; A Minister, the President, I think, proposed the name of an individual. It was within the option of any other Deputy to have proposed another name, and the rival merits might just as well have been canvassed.  There might be a half a dozen names by a half dozen Deputies, and the undesirable <Col N="1303" /> things that the Minister suggests might have happened if my amendment were operative might have happened under his own Comptroller and Auditor-General Act.</P>
      <P>But they did not happen.  The result of this Act was that an independent auditor, who knew that his appointment was in the hands of the Dáil, reported to the Dáil, acted with that knowledge and does his audit with that knowledge. I say, without any hesitation, that the person who appoints the auditor and to whom the report has to be made has an effect on and may govern the procedure of that auditor in his audit of accounts. It makes a great deal of difference to an auditor who it is who appointed him and to whom he is to report.  I dare say if the Minister for Finance were here he would tell you of auditors' reports that have come before his notice directly or indirectly, regarding, shall I say, income tax returns.  He has the auditors' reports signed and certified in accordance with the figures that were placed before them, and stating &ldquo;this is the result.&rdquo;  I am sure the Minister for Finance could confirm that.  That is the kind of return that you may get under the provisions of this section in the Bill; but it is not the kind of report that the public would require in respect of the expenditure of public money.  A check by an auditor who we know feels his independence of the person who is responsible for the spending will give much more confidence in respect of the legitimacy of that expenditure than the auditor appointed in the form devised in this Bill.  I repeat what I said earlier&mdash;and the Minister seemed to think that it was a light comment&mdash;that it is cutting at the very essence of the financial system, and it is extremely important in respect of this Bill as to who is to control expenditure, who is to check if and be responsible to the public in certifying that that expenditure has been properly conducted and that there is no misuse of public money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought that the Minister would have been very glad to have the assurance that comes with the appointment of the auditor appointed by the Dáil as distinct from an auditor appointed by <Col N="1304" /> himself.  Ministers have referred to the reports of that audit and the public criticism that may ensue.  I would like to have a little enlightenment on this point.  The report is going to be discussed. Who is going to answer for that expenditure?  Is it the Minister? Is he accepting responsibility for the expenditure?  Who is going to answer in this House for the Board?  Anybody? Presumably, by all precedents, the Minister ought to.  But he has disclaimed responsibility and that is particularly important when we are dealing with finance.  Somebody at least should be responsible in this House, and somebody should give an answer to this House for expenditure.  Under this scheme of things nobody is answerable, and we know that seven, eight, or ten millions of money will be in question and nobody is prepared to answer for it.</P>

I do not know if even under the conditions that that would be a sufficient reason for the Minister refusing the principle embodied in Deputy <Col N="1305" /> Johnson's amendment.

      <P>I think that is regrettable. It is regrettable from the point of view of the success of the scheme that the country has embarked on.  It is regrettable from the point of view of the State itself and from the point of view of the possibilities of future development.  In fact, it is not fair to the State, and I feel that everyone interested in the progress of the State has a duty to perform to try and dispel any cloud of suspicion that there may be.  I put it to the Minister that he, too, has some responsibility in this.  He has even to go farther than perhaps he would feel justified in going in the future, inasmuch as a certain position has, rightly or wrongly, been created. I feel it is not fair to suggest it&mdash;and it is being suggested and I believe will be suggested later&mdash;that because the Minister himself makes the appointment of the auditor who is to audit the accounts and make a report on them, that there is a possibility of something being kept back from the public&mdash;something which would not be kept back if that same auditor nominated by the Minister and submitted by resolution to this House was accepted by this House to conduct the audit.  I confess that it is difficult to follow the reasoning of people who will say that under one set of circumstances a man will do his work in such a fashion as to make it possible to suggest that his work is not well done and that in another set of circumstances the same man will do his work and do it well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yet the fact remains that that is the position, and I say that, personally, I regret, from the general attitude of a good many, there is no great indication there is to be a changed outlook in this matter.  I think the Minister has to guard against that and take precautions. I put it to him that under the circumstances it is better to make an effort and, if possible, indicate to the people who suggest that everything is being done in the dark, and is going to <Col N="1306" /> continue to be done in the dark, that the Minister is not responsible, but that the Minister is doing something with the sanction and approval of this House, and that this House will be in a position to examine what has been done, and what are the results of their action in this matter of the appointment of the auditor.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the point that the Comptroller and Auditor-General's functions were not of such a character as would enable his staff to take up this work and do it as efficiently as an outside body of auditors.  What is to prevent an addition to the staff of the Comptroller and Auditor-General which would make it possible for him to do this work?  I can see no objection to that&mdash;none whatever.  If an outside auditor is to be obtained and paid there seems to be no case against the staff of the Comptroller and Auditor-General being added to for such work.  If the Minister was in a position to come to the House and move a resolution proposing that so and so was to carry out the audit of the accounts, and if that action is going to dispel the cloud of suspicion that is being created, does not the Minister think that that would be good work in the interests of the Shannon scheme and of the State?  I have no sympathy whatever with the case that, because this appointment is to be made by the Minister, something is likely to happen.  There is weight undoubtedly in the argument of Deputy Johnson, and, inasmuch as the Dáil is finding the money, I feel that it has a right to have a voice in saying who is to look after the expenditure of that money. In principle it seems a case could be made for a vast difference between what Deputy Johnson is urging and what the Minister is prepared to concede. In fact, in the long run, the results of what the Deputy is proposing and what I suggest the Minister can concede might be exactly the same. But the effect on the country, and even on those people who are prepared to take the Minister to task about how he is handling this matter, and what his intentions are, would, in my view, be so beneficial from the point of view of <Col N="1307" /> the future of the Shannon scheme itself, that it is well worth while for the Minister to face up to it, and take the chance of the disagreeable side, so that he might come out to meet people who believe there is a reason for this House having a say in the appointment of an auditor, inasmuch as the House has admitted that the appointment of the Board is to be a matter for the Minister.  If that is done a great deal of the case that is being made, and many of the arguments that were put forward, some at least with very much justification, will have fallen short and flat.</P>

It is none of my doing that it is there.  I have made statements which, if they had been reported or adverted to, would certainly have led to a lessening of the suspicion instead of increasing it.  The Deputy will acquit me of any fault in that matter. I went to a meeting recently and did not say a thing beyond what I have said in this House, with a very definite effect as far as I could see.  I want to meet the Deputy when he says: &ldquo;Let us get this suspicion removed.&rdquo;  Deputy Johnson really talked of the Comptroller and Auditor-General on his amendment and said: &ldquo;This is the next <Col N="1308" /> best thing for the Comptroller and Auditor-General; as we cannot have him let us at least have this.&rdquo;  Take this amendment as it stands&mdash;the auditor appointed by resolution of this House.  The Minister for Justice has said that presumably the Minister for Industry and Commerce would come along and forestall anybody else in nominating, the House to approve by resolution.  But supposing he did not?  Then you would be in this impasse, that either the accounts are not audited or somebody other than the Minister has to move, and if somebody else moves the Minister is free from any responsibility for that appointment. Take this position: The Minister appoints, and that is an administrative act.  Somebody&mdash;I think it was Deputy Magennis&mdash;on a previous debate raised the question as to whether the arbitrator should be appointed by the Minister or by the Chief Justice.  He raised the same point which applies here, that an appointment by the Minister was an administrative act which could be questioned, but that an appointment by the Chief Justice could not be questioned. The same thing will apply to the auditor, and when you come to Section 31 you will find that it is bound up with this.  The moment these accounts are presented there is a case to be made&mdash;&ldquo;Why did not a particular Minister indicate to the auditor that such and such account had to be presented, that such and such a report had to be presented?&rdquo; But throw on to the House an appointment for which the Minister can avoid moving and for which anybody in this House can avoid moving, and who is responsible for moving it? To people who are thinking clearly there is no doubt about it that the appointment is, by Section 6 as it stands, one which saddles the Minister with much more responsibility than the other one.  In addition, you have the other point mentioned by Deputy MacNeill that this is an entirely novel amendment.</P>

      <P>To meet a very novel situation.  But the appointment of an auditor is a very normal thing. The point that is in the Bill throws <Col N="1309" /> much more responsibility on the Minister and makes the Minister have much more to answer for than if it were to be done in the way suggested in the amendment.  To people who think clearly on the matter there can be no doubt about that, and if there is any suspicion about this, it can best be cleared by leaving the responsibility with regard to the appointment on the Minister, a matter upon which he can be questioned afterwards and about which the whole doings of the Department may be dragged into discussion.</P>

      <P>I want to make it <Col N="1310" /> quite clear that it is not due to suspicion in respect of any proceedings under this scheme that I was moved to take the line I have taken on this Bill. Deputy Professor MacNeill spoke of a precedent.  I realise this is a precedent, and I say it is a very important precedent that we are establishing if the Bill passes as the Minister wishes, that we should provide £7,000,000 for a Board to spend, with innumerable other thousands following on, with a monopoly, with almost indefinite expansion as a possibility, and that we should not have the appointment of the auditor who will control that expenditure.  It is a matter of principle, and it is a precedent. Having this as a precedent, and reading the Bill in the light of the Minister's arguments on the earlier stage about the undesirability of dragging into the Dáil a discussion of these public accounts, I think the precedent is all in my favour and against the proposal in the Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 8, Section 7, to delete sub-section (2), lines 33 to 35, and substitute therefor the following subsections:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) The rates of remuneration, hours of duty and other conditions of service of officers and servants of the Board, other than such superior officers as the Minister may determine should be excluded from the operation of this sub-section, shall be regulated in accordance with agreements made or to be from time to time made between the trade unions <Col N="1312" /> representative of such officers and servants of the one part and the Board of the other part; provided that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the minimum wage of an adult male employee shall in no case be less than is sufficient to maintain a well-conducted employee of average health, strength, and competence, and his wife and a family of three children in a fair and average standard of comfort, having regard to the conditions of living prevailing among employees in the calling in respect of which such wage is fixed, and provided that in fixing such minimum wage the earnings of the children or wife of such employee shall not be taken into account;</P>
    <P>(ii)  the minimum wage of an adult female employee shall not be less than is sufficient to enable her to support herself in a fair and average standard of comfort, having regard to the nature of her duties and to the conditions of living prevailing among female employees in the calling in respect of which such minimum wage is fixed.</P>
    <P>(3)  The original or a counterpart, or a copy, certified in such manner as the Minister shall direct to be a true copy, of every such agreement as is mentioned in the next preceding sub-section shall be deposited with the Minister within one month after the making of such agreement.</P>
    <P>(4)  The remuneration and allowances of officers and servants of the Board shall be paid by the Board out of the funds at its disposal under this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a slight error in punctuation here.  The comma after &ldquo;determine&rdquo; in line 5 of the amendment should be deleted.  This amendment is a very important one from several points of view.  I would point out, for the reassurance of timid Deputies, that it is not novel and is not creating a precedent.  At least, it is not the original creator of a precedent.  The first part of the amendment is taken out of the Railways Act, for which the Minister was responsible, and the second part is taken out of an Australian Act.  I hope that the Minister <Col N="1313" /> will make himself responsible for the acceptance of this and establish a really satisfactory minimum wage clause in respect to any agreement with servants of this new Board.  It is of the utmost importance that there should be such a clause as this inserted in the Bill.  We have to remember that the powers of the Board are very widespread.  There may be men and women engaged by this Board for all sorts and conditions of employment not merely electrical employment.  The Board has power to engage in publicity work, even the distribution of handbills, explaining to householders how important and how valuable it is that they should use electric power.  By the way, Deputies by a recent vote decided that the distributor of a handbill, if employed by the Board, should not be eligible for membership of the Dáil.  The Board has extensive powers for engaging in an infinite variety of occupations, and unless there is a provision of this kind we may have the precedent followed of the original power scheme, when starvation wages were prescribed and paid by the Shannon authorities and, unfortunately, supported by the majority of this House.  I think it is necessary that we should make provision in this Bill to prevent a repetition of that, and we should fix a minimum which shall be as determined by organised employers and organised workmen where possible, and if there is not any such machinery of organised workmen and employers then the family minimum wage should be established as a minimum.</P>
    <P>I cannot imagine any Deputy who thinks seriously upon his obligations to oppose this principle.  The Railway Bill did, as I have already said, impose a duty upon the railway companies of fixing rates of remuneration, hours of duty and other conditions of service on lines similar to that prescribed in the first part of the amendment, but I am aware of the fact that in the innumerable variety of occupations and in the various parts of the country where such occupations will be affected there are many men and women who will not be organised in any trade union and therefore will not be able to make terms by collective bargaining with their employers. <Col N="1314" /> In such a case it is proposed that a certain standard should be fixed Under the original Shannon Scheme Bill we had assurances that there was inserted in the contract, as in every contract entered into by Ministers, a fair wages clause.  That was the assurance given in this House by the Minister's predecessor, that the fair wages clause enteredinto was inserted in every public contract made by the Government, and I assume&mdash;I have no reason to think otherwise&mdash;that the fair wages clause was inserted in the Shannon contract.  It is pointed out that the terms of the clause were such as would allow the 32/- starvation minimum to be paid to navvies and labourers, adult men on that particular work.  Consequently, notwithstanding the provisions of the fair wages clause, as has been for years inserted in public contracts, it was possible for the Minister to evade the spirit of that clause by allowing Shannon contractors to pay this unfortunate starvation wage.  This particular section is not merely a desire to insert that hitherto fairly satisfactory fair wages clause, but attempts to be somewhat more water-tight, because we know the mentality of the Minister in this matter, and it is necessary that we should be a little more strict in the conditions which we allow him to give the Board instructions about.  The Board itself may be composed of people who have been, shall I say, familiar with the terms of the Shannon power contract.  Certain people connected with it may be quite naturally associated with this Board, and unless they are directed by the Act which empowers them to proceed with their business they are likely to follow that bad precedent.</P>
    <P>The second portion of this proposal, which deals with the case of the unorganised, and incidentally may also cover the case of the organised, fixes a definite family wage minimum.  At this stage I think it would be rather an audacious act on the part of any Deputy to say that the people employed by a Board of this kind, adult male employees, should receive less as a weekly wage than would enable them to keep a family according to the standard required by the life they live.  It <Col N="1315" /> would be difficult, I say, for Deputies to go out frankly and say they are against a minimum of that kind, but I would like that it be something more than a fear of stating publicly that they are against such a minimum.  I desire that they should positively instruct that this Board shall not pay any workman a less sum than would keep that man and his wife and three children in decency.</P>
    <P>There have been a good many advocates of a wage which will at least enable a family to live in decency.  This is an opportunity for us to ensure that under this big scheme the Board will not be able to evade that responsibility, and that all employees of that Board will be assured at least of something above the starvation level which has sometimes been defended and which, unfortunately, was ratified by the majority of the House a year or so ago. As I said, this is not an untried precedent. The first part of the motion is already law in respect of the Railways Act, and the second part is taken from an Act of one of the Australian Parliaments.  I am asking the House to give it full consideration and support. I hope it will not be necessary to have a very long discussion on it. The Minister will readily give his assent, and thereby wipe out some of the evil effects of his Act on the original Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy relieved me of the necessity of saying much on this amendment when he said he already knew my mentality on this subject.  I think I can leave it at that. Starvation wages have been referred to, and that by Deputy Johnson, in whose absence a member of his own Party pleaded that the Barrow wages should be raised to those given on the Shannon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be, but there are also degrees of raising people above starvation, and that is what has been done on the Shannon in regard to particular areas.  This amendment is in the first part an excerpt from the Railways Act, and in <Col N="1316" /> the second part an excerpt from some Australian legislation.  So far as the first part of it has to do with railways, it is facing a very definite situation with regard to the limited number of trades unions which were representative of the officers and servants.  All the officers and servants were known. There was a definite state of things in regard to the railways which a great many people deplored, but which nobody set out to change in that Act. This proposal deals with an entirely different set of officials on whose behalf the same comment cannot be made.  As to the second part, I think the Australian legislation from which it is taken provides for some court to decide what is the standard, but is this going to be operative here in the absence of anybody to decide what is to be the standard?  Let us take the second part of the amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The minimum wage of an adult female employee shall not be less than is sufficient to enable her to support herself in a fair and average standard of comfort having regard to the nature of her duties and to the condition of living prevailing among female employees in the calling in respect of which such minimum wage is fixed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Who is to determine the standard of comfort?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That has all to be explained by the mover of the amendment, but certainly the legislation from which it is taken has ways and means for determining these things.  If the Deputy had moved an amendment to have the fair wages clause inserted we might have a discussion on that and see how far it might be made applicable to the working of the Board, but to bring forward a resolution which is a composite proposal made up partly of a provision of the Railways Act, having no relation whatever to the conditions that have to do with the Board and no application whatever to them, and partly of an excerpt from Australian legislation, leaving out any provision for any sort <Col N="1317" /> of arbitrator or umpire or any court to decide the vague things set out in (i) and (ii), does not seem to me to be a true attempt to meet the case at all. It is only an attempt to get the old question of the wages on the constructional portion of the Shannon scheme raised again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it very hard to understand why the Minister would not accept this amendment.  I take it that the Minister and his colleagues will agree that it is necessary that the people of this country should be put in the position that they can live a decent life and that they should be paid wages which will enable them to have a fair standard of comfort.  The Minister's attitude to this amendment would seem to suggest that that is not so and that we are to take it from what he said now, that the idea of the standard of comfort of the workers of this country is based on the Shannon scheme wage. I take it that the Government's view is that a worker should not have greater comfort in this country than can be purchased for 32/- a week or less.  The Minister asks who is to determine the standard of comfort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Might I ask who determined the standard of comfort or discomfort on the Shannon scheme itself?  If the Minister and the Government were in the frame of mind to accept this amendment they would find little difficulty if they desired to do it to establish a standard of reasonable comfort.  The Minister suggested that this was raised merely in order to provide an opportunity for talking about the conditions under the Shannon scheme.  There is not very much necessity to talk about the conditions of the Shannon scheme. Many people in the country are conversant with the present and past conditions on the Shannon scheme&mdash;more so than the Minister may think.  The real question in this amendment is whether the House believes that the workers in the country should receive a wage that will enable them to bring up their families in decency and comfort. It is a straight issue and a straight vote upon the matter will be taken.  It is a vote between a decent standard of comfort for the people and giving them just enough to keep the <Col N="1318" /> life in them, just enough to enable them to exist, and just enough to prevent something happening similar to what happened in the South a couple of weeks ago.  That is the issue on this amendment.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had any desire to meet the principle involved he would find very little difficulty in determining the standard of comfort.  He has been able to determine many questions much more difficult than this in other Bills. He is quite well aware of that.  I suggest to the House that they ought to give a direction to the Government in this matter that they are to see that the people to be employed on this great national scheme will be paid a wage that will enable them to live decently. If the view of the Government is that this scheme can only be made successful by reducing and lowering the standard of living in this country it would be better that we never had the scheme.  If the scheme meant anything at all it was that it was going to improve the conditions for all the people; if it is going to be used, instead, for lowering the standard of living and setting a headline to private employers throughout the country then, I say, it would be better we never had the scheme.  We have at all times, from the beginning, backed the scheme itself because we were believers in it.  We criticised it and had reason to criticise the conditions that obtained, and that obtain to-day, and we certainly are going to see, as far as we can, that the conditions that shall obtain in the working out and spreading of the scheme throughout the country shall be somewhat better than at the moment. I put it to any reasonably-minded member of this House who is not satisfied merely to be assured that the people are going to get barely enough to live upon, I put it to any Deputy who approaches the matter in a Christian spirit that this amendment is reasonable; that it is a feasible amendment, and that, if accepted, the Minister could easily find ways of determining what the standard of comfort is to be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. NORTON Mr. NORTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has made a very poor case indeed against the acceptance of the amendment. In connection with the first part <Col N="1319" /> of it, the Minister said the situation in connection with the Shannon scheme is not at all analogous to that of railways. He suggested, in the case of the Shannon scheme that you will not have definite and recognised groups of workers organised by trade unions, and consequently you have difficulty in entering into negotiation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that is the position at all.  You will have tradesmen employed on the Shannon scheme belonging to definite trade unions, and these people surely provide a medium for discussing matters of hours, wages and conditions of labour.  There may be people employed in isolated and rural areas not members of any trade union organisation, but in fixing their standard of wages, as Deputy Johnson said, the essential minimum condition of comfort ought to be taken into consideration. That is not an unreasonable suggestion. A couple of years ago the Shannon scheme came into operation on the constructional side under somewhat gloomy circumstances.  We had then an attempt, and it was a successful attempt, to inflict a thirty-two-shilling-a-week-wage upon that scheme.  The only case made for that wage was the fact that people could be got to work for it.  Of course a certain type of poverty-stricken people could be got to work for that wage.  People who can only get one meal a day were quite willing to work for that wage.  Advantage was taken of the condition of the labour market to enforce a wage of 32/- on that scheme for men with wives and families, and it was justified because a number of men were willing to work for it.  Photographs were published in the daily papers of piles of letters, several feet high, from people looking for jobs, and that is the justification for the un-Christian wage paid. The whole argument in connection with this matter bears a very definite relation to what is fairly well recognised by people with any Christian outlook as the pagan law of supply and demand. In other words, when there is a glut of people on the market, pay the least possible wage: pay only just sufficient to get their labour.  When there is scarcity of people wages must go up <Col N="1320" /> accordingly.  In other words, the same argument that can be applied to soap, boots, cabbages and that sort of thing is to be applied to human beings with definite responsibilities as citizens.  It is to get away from the idea and mentality that labour should be bought as cheaply as possible that this amendment is moved.  It claims broadly that the workers employed upon this big State engineering scheme, with its far-reaching possibilities, which may affect a considerable number of workers when in complete operation, shall be ensured a standard of living that will be reasonable and that will bear relationship to their responsibilities and to the standard of life that they are expected to maintain.  The Minister resists this amendment on one ground.  Who, he asks, is going to determine this question? I agree at once that the amendment does not suggest the machinery necessary.</P>
    <P>I suggest, as well, that it is not impossible for the Minister, or even difficult for him, to set up machinery to determine the question or to ascertain, by inquiry, what is a minimum or a reasonable standard of living or what wage ought to be paid to people engaged in working for the community as a whole&mdash;what responsibility as regards a decent standard of living the community has to those workers.  One thing this House ought to get away from&mdash;it is regrettable that a State in its infancy, as this State is, has not already got away from it&mdash;is that people employed by the State and serving the community as a whole should be taken advantage of by paying the minimum possible price for their labour.  The Minister may say that I ask the State to subscribe to a policy or doctrine to which private employers do not subscribe.  But that is no argument.  Nobody claims that everything a private employer does is perfect.  Nobody claims that it is even 5 per cent. perfect.  Some employers pay better wages and afford better conditions to their workers than others.  But nobody in his senses would defend everything that private employers do or regard their conduct to their employees as an example to be followed by the State.  I suggest to <Col N="1321" /> the Minister that notwithstanding that there is no machinery in the amendment for determining what is a reasonable standard of living, it is not at all impossible to ascertain that.  If the Minister would meet this amendment to the extent of paying 90 per cent. of what is regarded as a reasonable standard of living, it would be a good deal better than and a considerable advance on the outlook that was adopted and the wages that were paid in connection with the original constructional work on the Shannon.  This amendment definitely suggests that people employed on the Shannon scheme should have a certain rate of wages in order to obtain a minimum standard of comfort.  I hope that, by similar amendments, or perhaps by general legislation, the same principle will apply to all other industries.  For the time being, it can only apply to this Bill.  I suggest to the Minister that this amendment ought not to be rejected, that serious consideration ought to be given to it, and that a mere technical defence should not be put up to override the big and fundamental principles embodied in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made the point that there is no machinery for determining what is a fair and average standard of comfort. I confess to the Minister that in the first draft of the amendment I had suggested a tribunal which would determine what standard of life should be maintained by an employee and his family&mdash;such a tribunal as might be nominated by the Archbishop of Dublin, the President of the College of Physicians, or some ether medical authority, with, perhaps, a nominee of the Minister from the Statistical Branch. My desire was to have established some standard whereby the prices of commodities would have to be taken into account&mdash;the cost of feeding and clothing a family and the standard which a tribunal such as I hinted at might decide as a minimum.  Such an authority would be, if you like, a Board of Arbitration.  I concluded that that might give rise to doubts, and that the machinery might not be satisfactory; that it would be better establish the principle, that the minimum wage should be sufficient to maintain <Col N="1322" /> the family in a certain fair and average standard of comfort, and, if that was agreed upon by the House, that we might look into the question of machinery for determining what was that fair and average standard of comfort. Even in the absence of machinery and in the absence of an arbitration or determining authority, if you put that into the Bill the Board will know exactly what their direction is, and they can determine an average standard of comfort very much more closely related to the needs of the case than has been determined hitherto in respect to the existing Shannon Power Scheme. Is the House prepared to agree to the proposition that no person shall be employed under this Board at a wage insufficient to maintain a family in the standard of comfort which prevails amongst workers in the callings in respect of which such wage is paid?  If the Minister merely opposes this amendment because there is no machinery, then, I think, we can, with good-will, devise machinery without very much difficulty.  I want to lay special emphasis on the importance of some such provision in the Bill.  It is set out that the Board may manufacture, as well as provide and sell, electrical lines, fittings, apparatus, and appliances for lighting, heating, motive power, or any other purpose for which electricity can or may be used.  They may connect, repair, maintain or remove any lines, fittings, apparatus or appliances.  They may establish shops and establishments for the hire and sale of these fittings.  They are required to establish some publicity schemes which may involve, as I said earlier, an immense variety of occupations in all parts of the country.  With the powers that are given in this Bill, there is no protection to the workman against a downward trend on the part of the Board.  There are certain prohibitions in regard to strikes in this Bill which are only justifiable if you have established a certain minimum&mdash;if they are justifiable at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You are empowered to undertake all these operations; to go into, let us say, Rathmines or Pembroke, and employ either the same men who are at present employed <Col N="1323" /> or other men to take their places on a wage which the Board itself may determine.  No statutory standard is fixed, and there is prohibition against collective action, which sometimes enables men to resist the downward trend of employers who are required to make income meet expenditure. Section 4 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act which relates to breaches of contract in regard to persons employed on gas and water undertakings, is to extend to persons employed by the Board or any authorised undertaker or permitted undertaker. I think that section is going to prevent ordinary combination to protect standards which trade unions have found, more or less, effective and certainly necessary to make an attempt to do so.  You are prohibiting combination, you are prohibiting the employees under that section from doing the necessary protective work for their standards, and there is nothing to ensure that the necessary minimum shall be maintained.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, it will be possible under this Bill for local branches of this undertaking to establish works, of one kind or another, in any part of the country.  You have certain standards set up in Dublin, Rathmines, Pembroke or Dun Laoghaire, but you may do the work in Kerry, Cork, Galway, or Donegal; you may go where there is cheap labour and the powers of the Board will enable them to do the necessary work in the cheap labour districts and displace the men in the dearer labour districts for the benefit of the Board but for the deprivation of the regular employees.  You are establishing, or you may establish, in this measure, without any protection of this kind, standards very much below those at present prevailing, and it is necessary that there should be some protection for the workmen who may be employed by this Board.  Bear in mind, there is no alternative employment.  Men cannot play one employer against another. Men cannot play one town against another. Here you have a monopoly and no responsibility to the public, except to produce power and sell it at a price which will not yield a profit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1324" /> There is no other responsibility, but there is a monopoly and, therefore, once you have an employee in any of these innumerable departments who finds himself in difficulties with the foreman, the manager or the Board, he may leave the country.  He has no other employment in that particular industry.  In these circumstances I say that you are bound to put into the Bill certain minimum standards.  If you do not do that, you are not only handing over electricity to this non-responsible Board, but you are handing over men, women and children.  You are preventing the ordinary operations of combination to have effect against the downward pressure of firms looking for cheap labour. If the Dáil is going to agree to pass a Bill of this kind, without some provision such as this, it is going to do a very great wrong to the people who have to seek their livelihood in the employment of this Board.  As to the proposal that the minimum should be such as would provide such family with sufficient to keep it in that standard of comfort which prevails amongst employees of that kind, I think it is a reasonable proposition and one that this House ought to lay down at this stage.  It will come to it some time, I hope and believe, and I think this is the time to do it, when we are starting on a new scheme and a new industrial movement.</P>
    <P>I confess that the attraction of this whole scheme to me&mdash;I mean the whole Shannon electrification scheme&mdash;is that it may introduce into the country new industrial processes which will mean new industrial relations.  It may well mean the distribution throughout the country of economic activities in a way which are not prevalent at present and which will prevent over-concentration. I hope that the ultimate effect of this whole proposal is going to be beneficial, both economically and socially, and it is because of that view that I would like to see the scheme started on a right foundation.  If that is a fair and reasonable hope, can we not begin by preventing the wrong thing entering in at the beginning?  If we are hoping for better social relations, surely we are bound to make provision for a minimum standard family wage.  Otherwise, as I have said, you are putting the lives <Col N="1325" /> of men, as well as the material, plant and appliances in the possession and under the control of this Board.</P>
    <P>I think we have got to think of it a little bit further than the mere material supply of electricity.  We have got to think of it in relation to the humanity that is going to be benefited or damaged by the scheme.  I hope the House will approve of the proposition, and I would like to hear some views from other Benches as to why a proposal such as this should not be inserted in the Bill. The Minister has given a view.  Are we to assume that his view is the opinion of the House and is the opinion of every Deputy except those on the Labour Benches?  I think it is due to the amendment, and the ideas behind it, that there should be some expression from Deputies, other than those on the Labour Benches, as to whether a minimum standard family wage ought to prevail in this electricity scheme.</P>

      <P>The whole case for the amendment seems to be based on what the Deputy described as the unfortunate starvation wage of the Shannon workers.

      <P>I have met many workers who are down there, and I have never yet heard any of them describe the wage as a starvation wage. It is an unfortunate wage from the point of view of Deputy Johnson, because of the reactions on the particular class of labour which he represents, namely, the sheltered trades in the cities, the professional men and the State officials.  I have heard this claim made on behalf of the people of the country.  To say that it is made on behalf of the people of the country is not true, because the condition of the majority of the people, and the majority of the workers in the country, especially those engaged on the land, is of a very much lower standard than that of workers employed on the Shannon scheme.</P>

      <P>I object to this because uf its reaction on civil servants, professional men, railway workers, and the sheltered trades in general.  Deputy Johnson has referred to a starvation wage, and he wants to add to that list I have mentioned the new Shannon scheme workers, and then he will be satisfied.  What about the rest of the country?  If we are to have a standard of living, let us have it for the whole country and not merely for a portion of the people.  The whole plea is made here for a sheltered few, and there has never been a plea made for the mass of the people.  Reference has been made to the unfortunate occurrence in Cork. There are many similar cases all over the country among the rural population, farmers and agricultural workers, and not a word has been said for them, though they are the people who have to pay for the comfort of the favoured few in the sheltered occupations.</P>

This, in my opinion, is a favourable opportunity for inserting a section regulating the standard of wage.  I would even suggest the application of the scheme in operation in the Civil Service, by which the wage of a single male employee is put on the same standard as that of the female employee.  That is a matter to which I think consideration might be given.  I am sorry that the Minister cannot see his way to accept some form of amendment on the lines suggested.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to speak at length on this, as the Deputy has announced that he knows my mentality on it.  We have heard a lot of ordinary matter from Deputy Johnson on this amendment, and we have the usual running comment about insufficient and starvation wages.  No consideration is given to the other side of the matter.  I have heard a discussion about the minimum wages, but the other side of the question has not been brought into discussion, that is, what you can afford to pay in a particular <Col N="1328" /> industry, and then pay such and such a wage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Minister's contention that the standard of living must be determined by what a particular industry is able to pay?  And if it is not able to pay more than say, 5/- a week, is the person employed in that industry supposed to be able to exist on that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If they cannot live on it, they cannot.  There is always that other side, that is what the industry can afford to pay.  People should not be getting up into the clouds as the Labour Deputies do on this subject. If they got their feet on to the earth and considered what industry could afford to pay they would be more practical.  Apparently they can get into the clouds more often on this subject than any other section of the community on any other subject.  If Deputies on the Labour Benches want to test the point of view of this country with regard to Australian legislation and the minimum wage, what the married male employee should get, and what the unmarried employee or the female employee should get, then let that matter be brought forward for discussion by way of a resolution, but do not let it be brought in with regard to one class; let it apply all round.  I object to this because it is brought into this scheme by a side wind.  It is an attempt to get a big advance from a Labour point of view on a single scheme.  Deputy Johnson made his plea on the ground of the vastness of this scheme.  The ambit of it is very big, and the policy is to get this particular principle accepted here, and the battle is won with regard to the country.  Let us have a discussion on that as a general principle with regard to industry and trade in this country, and let us get the whole Australian legislation, and not have it brought in by way of camouflage by reading excerpts from <Col N="1329" /> the Reports and Acts.  Let us know what the conditions are, what Court is to be established, and what the nominations of the Court are to be, and how the three individuals are decided upon.  The plea has been made that Section 6 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act is a continuation of what is in every Electricity Act to-day.  I make no excuse for bringing it in.  The construction of such work in this country is going to be a vulnerable thing.  Electricity schemes are always regarded as vulnerable in this way.</P>
      <P>That blow can be struck at the community there.  There has always been a special regulation to protect the community from such a blow, and that special protection has been put in here and there are no apologies for it.</P>

The Minister, as usual has a powerful ally in Deputy Gorey.  Deputy Gorey gets up in his usual dogmatic fashion without having gone to the trouble even of reading the amendment or the Bill, and holds forth about the plain people of the country, the hundred per cent., the farmers and so on, and sneers about the wages paid to city and town workers and State officials without knowing anything at all about their conditions or their wages, or worrying very much about what they are.  No <Col N="1330" /> Deputy talks as loosely as Deputy Gorey.  No Deputy, I think, has less sense of his responsibility either to this House or to the country.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has enough to do in his own place.  Deputy Gorey and the Minister have evaded the principle of the amendment.  Neither the Minister nor the Deputy has made any attempt to meet the principle.  The principle is whether on a huge State undertaking like this a living wage is to be established.  The Minister said that it is because of the vastness of the undertaking we were attempting to get this living wage set up, because if we were able to establish it then three-quarters of the battle was won for the whole country, and that we would be able to get the same wage established in all other industries. Might I remind the Minister that that argument cuts both ways?  I take it the Minister's view is that if he is able to get a standard, something like the standard of the Shannon scheme itself, established under this Bill, three-quarters of the battle would be won for a lower standard of living in the country than exists at present.  That is apparently the object.</P>

All the side issues that have been brought into play by the Minister and Deputy Gorey have nothing to do with the principle embodied in the amendment. The Minister talked about the difficulties of giving effect to the amendment if it were inserted in the Bill.  I do not think the Minister would have any difficulty whatever in doing that, and I am quite sure he would be quite capable of giving full effect to the amendment if the House insisted on its insertion.  I want to try and clear away all the side issues that have been raised.  The principle involved in the amendment is whether or not the people engaged in the industry are to get a living wage.</P>

      <P>I desire to support the amendment.  When the Shannon Bill was under discussion, I asked the Minister if he could state on what wage basis the Shannon scheme was estimated. The Minister replied to me: &ldquo;I do not think that at the present moment it would be advisable to state the wage basis.  Full allowance has been made in the detailed costings.&rdquo;  Then the Minister went on to say: &ldquo;The estimate of wages is based on information <Col N="1332" /> supplied by my own Department.&rdquo; What I am afraid of is that that very same idea may still be in the mind of the Minister and that he or his Department may supply information to the Shannon Board as to conditions, etc., that would encourage the Board, or at least suggest to them, to pay a wage that would be even somewhat worse than what we are hearing about to-day. I would like to know if it is the intention of the Minister or his Department to suggest to the Board what wages they should pay and whether he has anything like that in his mind at the moment?  If he has, it would be well that he should say so to the House now so that we may know whether the wage that he is contemplating will be a living wage or a fair wage&mdash;a wage that we would wish to see paid to every citizen of the State.  I am informed that rather a large number of the men at present engaged in generating stations will lose their employment and get small gratuities.  These men at the present time are being paid a fair wage in the generating stations in which they are employed.  When they are displaced those who take their positions will probably get only half the wages that they are drawing at the moment.  If that is to be the position we ought to know whether the Minister's Department intends to supply to the Board information as to the rate of wages to be paid. The Minister, I think, should state now how the rates to be paid in the future will compare with the rates paid to the men who may lose their employment. Personally I am satisfied and believe that the Department will supply such information to the Board, information that will be based on the number of unemployed men that we have in the country districts.  I greatly fear that the Board may do what happened in days gone by, namely, take advantage of the fact that you will have five or six men looking for every one man's job, and that they will only pay a wage that will not be sufficient to keep a man and his family.</P>

      <P>The De Clifford estate, No. 220, County Mayo, was purchased by the (late) Congested Districts Board in 1913.  Of the 115 tenants, about 60 had uneconomic holdings.  The Congested Districts Board resumed and distributed 3 farms containing 352 acres, and negotiations are pending for the acquisition of further lands to provide enlargements for the remaining congests. An effort will be made to have vesting, where possible, completed at an early date.  The Land Commission cannot make any refunds in respect of rent or interest paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>A sum of £1,362 18s. 7d. was received from the British military authorities in respect of excess expenditure incurred as a result of the occupation of Kilmallock Workhouse by military forces.  The amount was paid to the Limerick County Council in January, 1924, as the successors of the Kilmallock Board of Guardians.  That sum included £808 19s. 7d. in respect of additional remuneration payable to officers and servants of the Mallow Union to which the Kilmallock inmates were transferred.  The allocation of the remuneration paid to officers and servants for extra duties was left in the hands of the Commissioner administering the North Cork County Board of Health as it was felt that being fully acquainted with all the circumstances he was the best judge of the value of the extra work devolving on the different officers.  I am not aware that any official received more than the amount claimed.  A sum of £375 was also paid to the county council in connection with a claim for structural damage to Kilmallock Workhouse premises.</P>
