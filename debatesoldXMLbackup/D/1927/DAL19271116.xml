      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware of the services rendered to the National cause by Mr. T.J. McElligott, now of Bedford, Listowel, County Kerry, by initiating the movement against Conscription in the Royal Irish Constabulary in 1918, and, subsequently, the movement to make the force an unarmed one; if he is aware that Mr. McElligott refused an offer of promotion and resigned from the R.I.C. in 1918, and that previous to and after his resignation he was one of the chief advisers of the Republican Government in matters concerning the R.I.C., and police matters generally; if he will explain why no pension has been awarded to Mr. McElligott, and if he will say whether he proposes to take any measures to ensure that Mr. McElligott and all the other men who resigned or were dismissed from the Royal Irish Constabulary because of their national sympathies shall receive treatment, as regards superannuation and pensions, at least as favourable as that already accorded to those who remained in the force until its disbandment.</P>

      <P>The applications for the grant of a pension under Section 5 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923, lodged in this and a small number of other similar cases have not been hitherto entertained because in each such case the applicant was known to be a member or helper or active sympathiser with the organisation engaged in armed opposition to the late Provisional <Col N="1364" /> Government or the Government of Saorstát Eireann.

      <NameTxt>Mr. FRANK CARTY</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance why John Maughan, of Carrenrod, Easky, County Sligo, had his old age pension of 8/- per week reduced to 5/- in 1925, and completely stopped in July, 1927.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>When the pension of 8/- a week was originally granted the pensioner's wife was alive, and his means for old age pension purposes were assessed under Section 2 (2) of the Old Age Pensions Act, 1911, at one-half of the joint means of the couple. The rate of pension was reduced, as from 5th September, 1924, to 5/- a week on review under the provisions of Section 4 of the Old Age Pensions Act, 1924.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1365" /> In March, 1927, the pension officer discovered that the pensioner's wife died in October, 1926, and as the pensioner thereupon ceased to be entitled to the benefit of Section 2 (2) of the Old Age Pensions Act, 1911, and, as a result, his means exceeded the statutory limit, a question was raised for revocation of the pension.  This question was allowed by the Department of Local Government and Public Health on 19th August, 1927, and payment of the pension was accordingly stopped on receipt of this decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankJCarty" hpid="Mr. CARTY Mr. CARTY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CARTY</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this old man is an invalid; that he is suffering from a fractured hip, and is only able to move about with the assistance of crutches?  Is he further aware that his sole means of support at present is a pension of 8/5 per week which he is in receipt of from the English War Office for a son who was killed during the Great War?  In view of these circumstances, would the Minister be prepared to reconsider the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it can only be reconsidered in one way&mdash;by making application, if he believes that his means are less than the statutory limit. The matter will then be decided in the ordinary way.</P>

As to the present position, I am informed that the applicants opened their case on the 8th and 9th of this month, and that the opponents will appear before the Commission on Tuesday and Wednesday of the coming week.  Further evidence <Col N="1366" /> will, I understand, be required from the applicants, and a careful investigation must be made of all the aspects of the application before the Commissioners can prepare their report. If the Deputy has any information of interest to the Commission, perhaps he would consider the advisability of communicating with them direct.</P>

      <P>An application from Mrs. Katherine Shortall, of Annagortha, Ballykieran, Athlone, for compensation in respect of personal injuries alleged to have been received by her on the 1st January, 1921, at the hands of British Forces was fully and carefully considered by the late Compensation (Personal Injuries) Committee, who, as a result of their investigations, recommended that no compensation should be paid.  On consideration of the case, I saw no reason to depart from the findings of the Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BOURKE (Parliamentary Secretary)</NameTxt>
      <P>The works carried out at Killarney Post Office for the past twelve months consisted of maintenance items, all of a minor nature, with the exception of one item, viz.&mdash;Opening and closing ground for telephone cable in December, 1926, which cost £22.</P>
      <P>The total cost of the works amounted to £35 4s. 8d., and the claims that made up that amount were examined and certified by the Board of Works' Accountant and Architects.</P>
      <P>The work of opening and closing ground for the telephone cable had to be ordered from a local contractor as an item of urgency, and there was no opportunity of inviting competitive tenders for it.  The remaining works consisted of trivial repairs, for which orders were given to local contractors, in the usual way, without competition. Competition in such cases would be a waste of time.</P>

An investigation was made into the state of the carpet industry generally in the Saorstát, but the information obtained held out little hope of an early reopening <Col N="1369" /> of the Naas factory, and in consequence it was decided to postpone convening a meeting of such business people in Naas as might be prepared to put up part of the necessary capital if the old company or a new company were prepared to restart work.</P>

      <P>Thomas McGuinness, Coolarty, Edgeworthstown, claimed unemployment benefit on the 29th July, 1925.  His claim was disallowed by the Insurance Officer on the grounds that he was &ldquo;not unemployed&rdquo; and &ldquo;not unable to obtain suitable employment.&rdquo;  Mr. McGuinness appealed against the Insurance Officer's decision to the Court of Referees, and finally the claim was referred to the Umpire, who decided that the claim must be disallowed.</P>

      <P>The Great Southern Railways Company states that Thomas McGuinness, who was a member of a re-laying gang, was, in common with other men, paid off in 1925, owing to the company having introduced an improved method of re-laying which did not require so many men.  The company contends that his dismissal had nothing to do with amalgamation, and that Schedule 3 of the Railways Act consequently does not apply.  A dispute on such a matter can only be determined in accordance with that Act, and I am not prepared to make any representations in favour of the payment of compensation to persons who do not establish that they are entitled to it by Statute.</P>

The claim was disallowed, as no contributions had, up to <Col N="1373" /> that date, been paid into the Unemployment Fund on Mr. Brett's behalf. Mr. Brett's claim was the first intimation from him that he had been in insurable employment in respect of which contributions had not been paid. Inquiries were then made, with the result that contributions due in respect of the employment referred to by the Deputy have now been collected from the employer and will be available for benefit purposes from the date on which they were paid, namely, the 9th instant.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries if he is aware that action has been taken by the Limerick Board of Conservators requiring the Trustees of the Rinn and Black River drainage district to alter the Tooman Weir in County Leitrim, so as to comply with the Fishery Act; whether, having regard to the fact that this weir was erected by the Board of Works at the request of the late Lord Leitrim, and to the detriment of the farmers in the locality through the flooding of their lands, the Minister will see that any expense in altering said weir shall be borne by those who are responsible for its existence there, and, also, will he take steps to ensure that the severe damage by flooding referred to, will be removed.</P>

      <P>The attention of the Limerick Board of Conservators of Fisheries was drawn by me to apparent illegalities in connection with the weir referred to. The question of who is to bear any expense which may be incurred in complying with the law, by persons other than the Conservators, is not for me to determine.  The removal or prevention of damage by flooding in the area controlled by this weir is, I understand, the business of the Rinn and Black River Drainage Trustees.  The position was fully explained in reply to a question by Deputy Michael Carter on the 26th July last.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that the Executive Council should appoint forthwith a Commission to investigate and report on the circumstances of the British ex-Servicemen in the Irish <Col N="1394" /> Free State and their claims (if any) against the British Government in respect of rights arising out of their past services or against the Government of the Irish Free State in respect of alleged discrimination against them in regard to employment on public works or in regard to their general rights.</P>
    <P>I must confess this is somewhat of a pleasant surprise.  I expected this would be taken during private members' time.  Before the motion would be taken, I had intended giving notice through the usual channels that I desired to raise a point of order on the amendment.  I hope, sir, that you will not, therefore, object to my raising it now.  I submit this amendment is out of order.  According to Standing Order No. 42, every amendment must be relevant to the motion to which it is proposed, and must be directed at omitting, adding or substituting words; no amendment which is equivalent to a direct negative shall be accepted.  Now, I submit that in both respects this amendment is out of order, but I shall take the last first.  The motion proposes that a commission shall be set up, and the amendment proposes there shall be no commission.  The words of the amendment are as follows: &ldquo;To delete all words after the word &lsquo;opinion&rsquo; and substitute therefor the words: &lsquo;that any representations regarding alleged disabilities of British ex-servicemen in the Irish Free State should be formulated and brought to the notice of the Executive Council by associations or representatives authorised to speak on behalf of these ex-servicemen for consideration with a view to such action as may be necessary or expedient.&rsquo;&rdquo; That, I submit with confidence, falls within the definition contained in Article 42, which says that no amendment which is equivalent to a direct negative shall be accepted.  I may also point out that there is nothing in this amendment which could not be debated upon the main question, and, that it does not in any way add to or enlarge the scope of the debate, and, as far as minimising that scope is concerned, it takes it away altogether, because it proposes, in effect, that there shall be no commission.</P>

      <P>I humbly submit that the amendment is in order.  It has been on the Order Paper for a considerable period, and no attention has been called to the fact that it is not in order. It is not a direct negative; in fact, I intended my speech to suggest a certain direction in which a more limited commission would be valuable.

      <P>I had notice of this point of order from Deputy Redmond some time ago.  The fact that the amendment has been on the Order Paper is not, of course, sufficient of itself to make the amendment in order.  It seems to me that the amendment is not a direct negative, because the purport of Deputy Redmond's motion, as I read it, is the investigation and report on the circumstances of British ex-servicemen with a view to remedying their grievances if any are found to exist.  That is the essential part of Deputy Redmond's motion.  The commission suggested is a machinery matter, and Deputy Cooper's amendment is an alternative method of investigating and reporting upon the circumstances and grievances of the same set of people.  It seems to me, therefore, it is a relevant alternative proposition and not a direct negative to the main purpose in Deputy Redmond's motion.</P>

I think, therefore, the amendment is in order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, of course I must bow to your ruling, but I beg profoundly to offer my individual disagreement. In proposing this motion I would like the House to understand, if they will believe me, that it is put forward from no political point of view nor with the idea of making a political score.  This is purely a non-party question.  British ex-servicemen, numerous as they are in this country, are to be found in the ranks of, and supporters of, every political party in the country.  I hope that during the course of this debate the attitude that I bring to bear upon it will be understood and followed by others.  It is nothing either in the nature of a vote of censure upon the Irish Government or the British Government.  My sole object is to have as soon as possible a fully representative, independent and impartial investigation into the whole circumstances of British ex-servicemen in this country.  When I say British ex-servicemen, I mean Irishmen who have served in the British forces. There is no other means very well of expressing that position.  When it is remembered that there are, as has been stated many times, from 150,000 to 200,000 British ex-servicemen in Ireland, and when one realises that their dependents, taking the dependents on a very low plane as three, would make the total sum of citizens of this country involved in this motion in or about half <Col N="1397" /> a million, I think that the House will recognise its gravity.</P>
      <P>I make no apology to the House for bringing forward the motion; but at the same time I make no special claims on behalf of British ex-servicemen from the Irish Government.  I want them to be regarded and recognised by the Irish Government of the day as Irishmen with equal rights of citizenship in this State.  I ask no more and I claim no less.  It is somewhat different in regard to the British Government.  These men were induced by the predecessor of the British Government and by others who agreed with them to take a certain course during the Great War.  I hope that the merits or the demerits of that course will not be entered into at all here this afternoon, because that is not the question before us.  They were induced to take this course by several means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among other things promises were held out to them, very far-reaching promises in some cases.  They were told that if they survived the war they would get special, preferential treatment from the Government which was, then, of course, the British Government. When the time came for these men to be demobilised that state of affairs had come to cease. The British Government was no more in this country, and these men were left in the position of not being able to have some of those promises performed. I am not blaming the Free State Government.  They did not make those promises.  But what I am asking the Government to do by the setting-up of this Commission to investigate and report with regard to the promises made by the British Government and the obligations which, I say, the British Government are under to these men, is that if this Commission reports favourably in regard to the claims made against the British Government that then it should be their duty as an Irish Government to make immediate official representations to the British Government on behalf of a large body of the citizens of this State.  I make the distinction, therefore between the two classes of claims&mdash;the first against the Irish Government, and the second against the British Government.  The <Col N="1398" /> first, as I say, is a claim for equal rights of citizenship, no more and no less.  The second is a claim for the fulfilment of solemn obligations and undertakings entered into by a previous British Government and binding on the present British Government.</P>
    <P>In regard to those undertakings I do not, this afternoon, propose to go into the details or to examine closely the numerous claims or grievances that are made by ex-servicemen.  That is just what I want this Commission for.  But I will mention a few of the principal heads of those grievances. In 1919 a Land Trust was set up by the British Government.  That Trust was allotted a large sum of money.  I think that for the Free State it amounted to about three-quarters of a million pounds.  That money was to be expended upon the erection of houses for British ex-servicemen. Any Deputy here can bear me out in this case because I know every Deputy must have correspondence from the men as I have, and it is notorious that there has been the most extraordinary delay in the erection of these houses.  A certain number of houses have been erected, and a certain amount of money has been expended, but seven years have elapsed since the institution of the Land Trust, and, to say the least of it, they have made exceedingly slow progress.  I will give you one instance in my own constituency.  In the city of Waterford there is not a house erected yet by this Trust for the ex-servicemen.</P>
    <P>Apart also from the delay, there has been a question of the rentals.  Deputies will hardly believe me when I say that the rents charged for British ex-servicemen's houses in the Free State are considerably higher than those charged for ex-service men's houses across the Border in the Six Counties.  That is a matter which unquestionably ought to be inquired into.  Similarly, when representations were made to the Land Trust, after a long series of negotiations and controversies, some of which are not yet concluded, some of the rentals were reduced.  But the reductions were made not from the time that the demand was made but from the time the Land <Col N="1399" /> Trust decided that they would make the reductions.  There have been representations made by the British Legion and other organisations of the ex-servicemen throughout the country on this question and it is still in abeyance.  There is the whole subject of the erection of houses for ex-servicemen which demands instant investigation at the hands of our Irish Government in order that our Irish Government will be strengthened when they go, as they should go, to the British Government and demand that this Trust should be properly carried out.</P>
    <P>There is another point of not perhaps so great importance, but it is a matter of extreme hardship on Irishmen who served in the British forces and who paid their insurance stamps while serving there.  When demobilised if a man came from Dundalk, say, and his people lived there, and if he chose to go back there and live there and if he required the assistance which was due to him from these payments of stamps, he would not receive a single penny.  If he stayed in Newry, a few miles across the Border, he would be entitled to every penny of it. Now I say that that is not right, and that is a matter also for investigation and for some form of reciprocity between two Governments.  While on that subject I may say that the same thing obtains with regard to Irishmen engaged in the Mercantile Marine. That is a question, however, for another day.  There was also a proposal held out to the men who joined the British Army, and that was that if they survived they would, if they so required, have passages facilitated for them and settlements made easy for them in the British Dominions.  That was known as the Empire Settlement Scheme.  I want to make my position clear in that regard.  I am not proposing that our Government should insist upon a subsidised form of emigration to other Dominions.  No such thing. What I am proposing is that in view of the different circumstances of to-day and in view of the fact that we are now a Dominion, that we have our own Government and that we are not <Col N="1400" /> in the position in which ex-servicemen would be if resident in England or Northern Ireland, that these men should get something, at least, by way of a substitute for the loss of that benefit or advantage, whichever it may be.  Why should they not have some form of subsidy for the advantage which was held out to them at the commencement of the war and which, through no fault of theirs now, has been taken away from them?  I say that there is a very strong case now for the Irish Government to put up to the British Government, that they owe these men something by way of a substitute for that proposal.</P>
    <P>Then there is the larger question of the administration of pensions generally. I know the Free State Government has nothing to say to the administration of British pensions.  But these are Irish citizens, and if they think they are not being treated fairly by those who are under obligations to them, is it not the duty of the Free State Government formally, through the proper channels, to make representations that they should be treated fairly?  I am not making a general complaint about the administration of British pensions in this country, but there are grievances and hardships and hard cases, and this Commission would give an opportunity to those who feel that they have grievances to ventilate them and have them brought to the notice of the Executive Council, so that the Executive Council might make representations on their behalf to the British Government.</P>
    <P>These are the main heads, as I see them, under which there may be said to be grievances against the British Government.  Those grievances may not exist&mdash;I am not saying that they are all valid&mdash;but what I want is to have an impartial investigation into whether or not they do exist, because so many people believe that they do, and the feeling is so widespread in regard to the matter.  In order to allay those feelings, set them at rest, and, if possible, to remedy the grievances, I ask for a Commission to be set up with a view to the Executive Council taking further action.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1401" /> With regard to the Irish Government there are also grievances.  I have had deputations and communications&mdash; possibly other Deputies also have had them&mdash;from those who were employed by the British Government in the capacity of temporary clerks when the Free State Government took over.  Those temporary clerks were there under certain conditions which were held out to them as inducements by the British Government. If there had not been a change of Government they certainly would have been in a much more advantageous position to-day.  I am not claiming that our Government should carry out all the obligations under which the British Government employed these men.  What I am claiming is that they should not be put in a worse position to-day than they would have been in the ordinary sense under a British Government.  I have asked questions in the Dáil about a number of these men, and about the examinations that were held to enable them to be placed upon a permanent basis.  It appears that there were 658 British ex-servicemen serving as temporary clerks transferred to the Irish Free State; that there were 212 left in the service, and that out of this number 158 sat for the qualifying examination in June and July, 1925.  They have a grievance inasmuch as while they were not allowed to sit again for reexamination those who had served in the National Army were.  There was an agreement in England known as the Guinness agreement which they are demanding to be applied to them here. I am not going into that matter in detail, but I say that there is a special class of case which needs investigation and examination by a tribunal such as I propose, with a view to fair and proper action on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>Again we have the question of employment on public works.  I am not going to bore the Dáil once more by raising the question, that I have raised so often, in regard to the method of employment under the grants made for road expenditure.  I raised the matter particularly in regard to my own constituency. At first it was turned down, and subsequently, when the President re-investigated it, he admitted that there was something harsh in the <Col N="1402" /> matter of employment and made a concession. What British ex-servicemen have objected to has been that though they may be married, with large families, and in poor circumstances, they have been specifically put in a different category&mdash;what I might call a subsequent category&mdash;to ex-National Army men, who need not either be married or be particularly destitute.  In other words, the first people to be employed on these works have been ex-National Army men, whether married or unmarried.  Then come the civilians, included among whom are the British ex-servicemen.  The President did make some concession to me in that respect in regard to the money voted for Waterford City.  But I think there is a distinct grievance throughout the rest of the country on the same score.  That is another matter which should be investigated by a Commission.</P>
    <P>I do not make any charge against the Labour Exchanges, but there is not a day passes when I ask a man, who comes to me and says he is a British ex-serviceman, why he does not go to the Labour Exchange, that the inevitable reply is not: &ldquo;What is the use of my going there?  I am a British ex-serviceman and I will be told to stand down.&rdquo;  I say that in fairness to the Labour Exchanges themselves, and to the carrying out of such administration, such a matter should be open to investigation by a commission such as I have proposed.  My reason for proposing the commission is that a commission should be an impartial body of disinterested citizens who will not go into this question with any biased view, but who will make a fair report to the Executive Council, which the Executive Council may act upon as they think right.  I think that that is far the best way from the point of view both of the people concerned and of the Executive Council.</P>
    <P>The amendment seems to me to be a most extraordinary one.  It proposes that any representations&mdash;I take the word &ldquo;any&rdquo; there to mean &ldquo;all&rdquo;&mdash; regarding alleged disabilities should be formulated and brought to the notice of the Executive Council by associations or representatives authorised to speak on behalf of the ex-servicemen. I only wish we had associations or <Col N="1403" /> representatives authorised to speak on behalf of the great body of ex-servicemen. The unfortunate thing about it is that the great bulk of British ex-servicemen are not connected with the principal organisations.  I am not saying that in any way which would be derogatory to these organisations, because I myself hold a very high office in, perhaps, the leading organisation&mdash; the British Legion.  At the same time, that does not get away from the fact that they do not represent anything like a sufficiently large proportion of the ex-servicemen to say that they are authorised to speak for them.  Even if they were authorised to speak for them, even if every ex-serviceman in the Free State was in the British Legion, or any other ex-soldiers' organisation, I say that this amendment is nothing short of an insult to the Dáil and to the whole Parliamentary structure.  It is suggested that nothing should be done for anybody except through their own organisations. As far as I can read the amendment, it seems to me to go so far as to suggest that I had no right to move this motion, and that the only method of getting ex-servicemen's grievances remedied was a back-door method, by way of representations to the Executive Council or individual Ministers through various organisations</P>
    <P>I desire to say I am speaking on behalf of no organisation.  I am speaking on my own sole responsibility.  I brought this matter forward as an ex-serviceman myself and as one who, I hope, has taken a little interest in ex-servicemen since the demobilisation.  I cannot conceive the lengths that such a suggestion as is contained in the amendment would bring us to if it were adopted.  One may as well say that no labour question was to be raised except through trade unions.  One might as well say that there should be no committee to inquire into unemployment, that the trade unions should go to a back door or a front door to the Executive Council and make representations in regard to unemployment.  Therefore I sincerely trust that if the House has sympathy with the object I have in view, and which, I think, it must have, it will not entertain the suggestion contained in the amendment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1404" /> My suggestion is a plain, straightforward one, and one that has been carried out and acted upon by Governments in the past in regard to other large bodies of citizens.  Even when I myself proposed a Town Tenants Bill, on the second occasion of my doing so the whole question was referred to a commission. It was not suggested then by anybody that the Town Tenants' League or the All-for-Ireland Town Tenants' Organisation, whoever they may be, were to be the only means through which representations were to be made to the Government for the remedying of the town tenants' grievances. No; the Government set up a commission, and I am merely asking that a similar body should be set up to investigate a problem which concerns a very large body of citizens in this country, many of whom are in a state of fearful want and destitution.  That also might be the means of bringing about a better feeling between different classes in the community, and it would show that this Government had some desire to do justice to these men as Irishmen and as Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>I ask no more from this Government than equal rights for these men as citizens of the State.  But I do ask that this commission be set up to investigate both these problems, and that if it reports favourably, which it may not do, in regard to their grievances against the British Government, that it should be the bounden duty of whatever Government is in power here, on receipt of that report, to make official representations and demands to whatever British Government is across the water.  I, therefore, hope that I have not overstated the case on behalf of the British ex-servicemen nor understated it.  They are entitled, as Irish citizens, to no more and no less than any other citizens, and as long as I can do anything I certainly will not be diverted from doing what I consider my duty by having it said that no representation should be made except through certain organisations.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, sincerely trust that if this goes to a vote the Government will not make it a party question.  I do not see how they can make it a party question; I think it would be folly of them to do so, in the first place, and I think <Col N="1405" /> it would be distinctly unfair in the second place.  Let them not put on the Party Whips in regard to this proposal. I claim for it that it is above party, and that it is a genuine proposal in the interest of a large section of the Irish population of this State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like that that should be made quite clear.  I shall give the House one reason why, in my opinion, these words should be inserted.  The mothers of soldiers who were killed in France and who got a pension of £1 a week, when they reach the age of 70 get an ordinary notice stating that 10/- is deducted from their army pension because they get that sum in old age pensions.  That is the case in England or Northern Ireland; it is merely a matter of exchange and a question of which of the Departments the money is to come from.  But in Ireland the mother who loses 10/- on reaching the age of 70, owing to the method of estimating assets in relation to old age pensions here, is left without the 10/- or the 9/- old age pension, and the British Government pockets the 10/- which up to then made up the £1.  There is an obligation on the British Government to continue to pay the mother or the dependents of the soldier full pension until somebody else steps in and makes up the difference, but what they are asking now is that when the mother of a deceased man reaches the age of 70, to get free of paying half the pension themselves. They are trying to force the liability on to the Free State by ordering people to get the old age pension of ten shillings. This with the army pension of 10/- they give them makes up the £1 that these people were awarded originally as an army pension on proving dependency.  It might be the case of a son who was killed.  I believe that if our Government made a suggestion to <Col N="1406" /> the pension authorities in England and asked them to fulfil their obligations to the mothers of those boys that the mothers would continue to draw the £1 a week.  I know of one case where the mother of one of those boys had her army pension reduced by 10/- on reaching the age of 70, but she did not get the old age pension from the Free State authorities.  I do not think it is fair that the mothers of those boys should have their pensions cut by half on reaching the age of 70, and for that reason I ask the movers of the motion and of the amendment to amend their proposals as I suggested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I desire to say that I am quite prepared to accept the amendment to my amendment suggested by Deputy Alfred Byrne.  I agree with a good deal that Deputy Redmond said.  I welcome a good deal that he said, particularly his statement that this is not a political question.  It should not be.  I think there is only one Party in the Dáil that has not amongst its members some person who served in the British Army during the period of the Great War. That Party, I think, is the Labour Party.  I regret that, because I think Deputy Anthony or Deputy O'Connell would have made a fine figure on parade, and I should like to have heard Deputy Morrissey's voice reverberate on the barrack square.  But I am sure the Labour Party are not less sympathetic towards those labouring men who <Col N="1407" /> served in the British Army than any other section of the Dáil.  I hope, with Deputy Redmond, that to-night we shall have no discussion of motives as to why men enlisted.  Their motives were many.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree, to a certain extent, with Deputy de Valera that a great many of them enlisted from very much the same motives that actuated American citizens of the United States who went to Canada and joined the Canadian forces.  There was no enthusiasm for the British Empire, but there was, as one who enlisted and never returned said, &ldquo;not for King or flag or Empire, but for a dream born in a herdsman's shed and for the simple scripture of the poor.&rdquo;  That was the highest motive, and I hope that we will have no recriminations over the graves of those who fell or the fate of those who survived.  I was peculiarly glad to hear Deputy Redmond say that this is not a political question.  It confirms a belief that I had, that he had no knowledge of a leaflet that was issued in the County Dublin during the June election.  I shall quote a few words from it: &ldquo;If you served in the Great War, or if you lost anyone dear to you in the Great War, then vote for &mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; and there followed the names of the three National League candidates.  I think reopening wounds and reopening sorrows for political purposes is a thing that Deputy Redmond would never have allowed.  I come to the question of grievances&mdash;not the grievances, if any, as to alleged discrimination, but grievances that I do admit frankly exist among British ex-servicemen. These fall under two heads, as Deputy Redmond said.  There are grievances against the British Government and there are grievances against the Government of the Saorstát. I have not Deputy Redmond's advantage in being learned in the law, but I have always felt that if you put two prisoners in the dock at the same time, charged with different offences, you are not likely to get speedy or satisfactory justice.  That is what Deputy Redmond's motion proposes to do.  It is a double-barrelled motion, intended to bring down the British Government with one barrel and the <Col N="1408" /> Saorstát Government with the other. The only doubt he has is whether he will succeed in hitting the British Government, but he is quite sure that he can bring off the second barrel against the Saorstát Government.</P>
    <P>The grievances against the British Government are fourfold.  First, there is the grievance with regard to pensions. With regard to the point raised by Deputy Alfred Byrne, that matter has already been taken up by the British Legion, through its headquarters in London, with the British Ministry of Pensions.  They are the people who can most readily and quickly remedy that.  We are doing all in our power to have their grievance remedied.  I do not intend to dwell long on the question of pensions.  I have not very great knowledge on this matter, but the essential thing is this: that the laws relating to pensions and the code governing the administration of war pensions are identical in Great Britain and the Saorstát.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>Not altogether. There is no medical referee here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a very great point.  Broadly speaking, the practice is the same in both countries, and I suggest it would not be practical politics to get the British Parliament to pass a Bill improving the condition of our pensioners and at the same time doing nothing for their own.  On this question there is a common interest between the ex-servicemen in Great Britain and the ex-servicemen here.  They both have grievances, and we have been striving, by working together with the ex-servicemen in Great Britain, to try and get the grievances complained of remedied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come to the question of housing. A great deal of what Deputy Redmond said on this is justified.  I have taken a fairly active part in relation to this matter.  I can say this, that the only satisfactory action that has been taken has been by this Government, and the only sure shield against injustice has been the influence of the Government of the Saorstát.  I was with the President time and again on this matter when I was an Independent <Col N="1409" /> member of the Dáil.  He was always accessible and was always anxious to help us.  Will a committee or a commission, if set up, do any more?  Will a commission set up by the British Government to examine the housing problem here be an improvement on the present position.  I do not believe it would.  I do not believe that any commission, merely reporting to the Saorstát Government on the question, could teach the President anything about housing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Redmond raised a point about insurance benefit.  What use will a commission or a committee be there?  The real difficulty is that the rate of benefit in Great Britain and Northern Ireland is different to the rate of benefit here.  The facts of the case are perfectly well known.  The British Government will not fall in with our desires, and so far all our pressure and all our influence with them has failed.  I do not think that a commission could make them do it.  Then the next point of the Deputy was in regard to emigration.  I think Deputy Redmond was a little inaccurate in the statement he made in regard to that.  He said that promises were made at the commencement of the war that ex-servicemen would be facilitated in the matter of emigrating to the British Dominions.  I do not think there was anything of the sort said at the beginning of the war.  I think that was a post-war promise.  At the beginning of the war the statement made was that &ldquo;this was going to be made a land fit for heroes to live in.&rdquo; It was only when it became clear that it was beyond the power of the then British Government to achieve the fulfilment of that promise that emigration to the colonies was suggested as a substitute.  At that time the Saorstát was in being.  While it would be a great help to us if some men not likely to get employment were to find employment overseas, I think it is very doubtful whether many of them are not too old to go away.  Many of them, particularly those without previous training, could not hope to make a success of their lives in a new land. Deputy Redmond did not stress that point.  I need not labour that further.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1410" /> I come now to the Deputy's grievances against the Saorstát.  There is the grievance that Deputy Redmond alluded to at some length as regards temporary civil servants.  The ex-servicemen have a grievance in that respect. That grievance, as far as I can gather, was this&mdash;that an examination was set up at which they were entitled to compete. That examination was set up for a limited number of vacancies&mdash;I think, 300.  All who qualified at that examination&mdash;to the number, I think, of 450 &mdash;were made permanent civil servants. There were some who did not qualify, and that was a hardship on them, because the bulk of them were men over 40 years of age, who find it not easy to compete in examinations with young men.  They have not the faculty of acquiring knowledge so quickly.  At similar examinations in Great Britain, men of this class were given a certain number of merit marks.  A man who was a civil servant for two or three years, of whom there was knowledge in his Department that he was an efficient official, was entitled to a certain number of merit marks.  I think these men have a certain grievance that merit marks were not given them here.  I think the position of these temporary civil servants might be a very suitable matter for inquiry by a commission or a committee.  But I think that the commission or committee should be limited to the question of these temporary civil servants alone.  Such a commission could report in a comparatively short time.  The problem is comparatively small and could easily be resolved in three months.  It requires more consideration than has been given it by the Government of the Saorstát up to the present.  There has been long delays in dealing with it through representatives on Civil Service bodies and so on, but I should prefer to see the committee or commission inquiring not alone into the question of British ex-servicemen, but also into the cases of all temporary clerks, including ex-National Army men.  I have always held that the British ex-serviceman is a citizen of the State and must regard himself primarily as a citizen of the State.  It is not of any service to him to single him out specially.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1411" /> Deputy Redmond's next point had reference to the preference given on road work to ex-National Army men. It is, I believe, a fact that 50 per cent. of the members of the National Army were men who served in the British Army.  In that sense, that preference is a 50 per cent. preference to ex-British servicemen, and I would sooner have a 50 per cent. preference than no preference at all.  Deputy Redmond suggested that the size of a man's family should be the criterion.  If that were to be so, the ex-British soldier who was not in this country for three or four years, but who was serving in Palestine and Mesopotamia, would be in a worse position as compared with the ordinary labourer who did not serve than he is now.  I think Deputy Redmond's intended remedy there is worse than the disease, so far as the ex-serviceman is concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Redmond instanced the Labour Exchange.  He said he made no charge against the Labour Exchange, but that all the men were under the impression that there was discrimination against them.  I know of many cases of British ex-servicemen, who are also ex-National Army men, who have been unable to get employment through the Labour Exchange.  But I do not think the state of affairs is peculiar to them.  I think you will find in every section of society complaints that there was nothing doing at the Labour Exchange.  In any case, Deputy Redmond proposes to set up a commission to see whether this charge, which he does not make himself, is justified. I have, I think, now summed up Deputy Redmond's arguments.  I have dealt, more or less briefly, with every head of his argument, and I confess that I do not understand on what he based that passage in his letter to the &ldquo;Daily Mail.&rdquo;  He said in his letter: &ldquo;The resolution is founded upon the ex-servicemen's claim to equal rights of citizenship and to equal treatment by the Legislature of all who are citizens of the Saorstát.&rdquo;  I heard no instance given of unequal treatment by the Legislature.  Deputy Redmond and I would have failed grossly in our duty if there had been any unequal treatment during the past four years <Col N="1412" /> by the Legislature.  Deputy Redmond referred in his letter to &ldquo;equal rights of citizenship.&rdquo;  The only thing Deputy Redmond brings up in support of that is this question of temporary civil servants. He may say they have not the same rights as ex-National Army men. Though I have admitted their grievance, that is surely rather a small matter to hang a charge upon.  I think Deputy Redmond must have been reading Burke, and that he realises that anybody can bring an indictment against a nation.  He has brought this indictment, in what I believe is the most widely-circulated paper in the world, on the strength of 600 temporary Civil Service clerks, and he has brought the charge of unequal treatment by the Legislature on no basis at all, so far as I can discover.</P>

      <P>Let me quote the Deputy's letter again.  &ldquo;The Resolution is founded on the ex-servicemen's claims for equal rights of citizenship and to equal treatment by the Legislature.&rdquo; That implies that there have been unequal treatment and unequal rights.  It is censure, though it is not a vote of censure, because one cannot move a vote of censure in the Press&mdash; fortunately.  As regards discrimination, there is only one thing to be said.  This spring the Chairman of the British Legion of ex-Servicemen came over to Ireland to investigate this question of discrimination.  He travelled all over the South of the Saorstát.  He saw men of all sorts&mdash;not men connected with the Legion only.  When he came to the end of his journey, he reported that in <Col N="1413" /> one district he thought the Home Assistance Officers were exercising some discrimination against ex-servicemen. That was a matter for the local authority and not a matter for the Government.  That is all the discrimination that I have been able to discover as existing.  So far as I know, ex-servicemen have equal rights of citizenship. There are grievances.  I have acknowledged them.  The question before the Dáil is: How are those grievances to be remedied?  That is really a question of machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To begin with, Deputy Redmond wants a commission.  I wonder why he chose the word &ldquo;commission,&rdquo; because there are precedents in the shape of commissions dealing with matters that concern the British Government and the Government of the Saorstát.  Does he intend the British Government to be represented on this Commission?  Is he so enamoured of the precedent of the Boundary Commission? Is that the sort of commission he wants?  He said he wanted a commission that would be a disinterested body.  If it is only a Saorstát commission, the British Government will not admit that it is a disinterested body. They will say that it is established to protect Saorstát interests.  If, on the other hand, it is a joint commission, will it have the same result as the Boundary Commission?  Is the Deputy prepared to accept that?  Surely, the Government is the constitutional medium for making representations affecting citizens of this State to the Government of any other State.  The right course, I suggest, was taken by Deputy T. Murphy last week when he put down a question with regard to housing for ex-servicemen, and asked the Government to make representations to the British Government on the matter.  That is the course contemplated in my amendment.  But the real crux of the question is this: Will the Commission be a speedy and effective method of remedying the grievances of the ex-servicemen?  I say it will not. Deputy Redmond talked about the great bulk of British ex-servicemen being unconnected with any organisation. Deputy Redmond knows that the British Legion does not ask whether a <Col N="1414" /> man with a grievance is a member of the Legion or not.  It has always taken up the grievance of an unorganised ex-serviceman as well as the grievance of those who are its members.  I think three-fourths of our pensions work is done on behalf of men who are not members of the Legion.  We have never been exclusive, and we have never said that we will not intervene except a man is an active member of the Legion. How, otherwise than by the methods proposed in the amendment, are unorganised men to put their cases before this commission?  There may be 20,000 of them.  Is every one of them to come up and give evidence before the Commission? Is the commission to enter into the case of every man who wants a house built and cannot get it, of every man who thinks the rent of his house is too high, of every man who has a pension grievance, of every man who is unemployed, because that is what is contemplated by Deputy Redmond's commission?  Only that commission, he said, can get at the unorganised.  It can get at them by inviting them to come and give evidence before it, and the result will be, if his plan is carried, that the sittings of that Commission will be Kathleen Mavourneen sittings&mdash;&ldquo;it may be for years and it may be for ever.&rdquo;  It would take years to report.  I do believe that it would lead to no effective action.  It would raise fruitless hopes, and it is wicked and cruel to raise false hopes.  The Government, as I have said, have always been accessible; they have always been ready to listen, and I hope they will always be ready to listen.  I hope and believe when there is a change of Government that the new Government will recognise that the ex-servicemen are citizens of the State, and deserve to be considered.  The Government have always been accessible and ready to listen to these grievances and to do their best to remedy them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who is fairly conversant with the schemes existing in the Free State for the benefit of ex-servicemen, I would like to explain the machinery that is in existence at the moment.  The information which I am going to give the Dáil is official and is computed for the month of September, 1927.  At the present time there are five war pensions advisory committees operating in the Irish Free State, with a total membership of sixty-two.  In addition, there are 524 voluntary workers appointed by these committees, whose function it is to assist disabled men, and widows and dependants of men who lost their lives in the Great War.  As members of committees also act as voluntary workers, the total number of voluntary workers is 586.  There is an area office at Dublin and another at Cork, together with two whole-time sub-offices and thirty-six part-time suboffices in various parts of the Free State.  The total staff employed as at 30th September was 164.</P>
      <P>The following figures give some indication of the amount of work performed at these offices during the month of September last.  There were 3,602 direct interviews; 456 applications were dealt with and 1,711 disabled men were examined.  The average four-weekly expenditure on pensions alone (not including other expenditure of the Ministry on administration or special allowances to disabled men undergoing treatment) was to disabled men £86,500; to widows, £25,300; to dependants, £13,300.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British Ministry of Pensions have appointed these area advisory committees, and they have nominated two or three persons from each county in the Free State.  Those persons attend at the head area advisory office whenever <Col N="1416" /> meetings are called.  They appoint sub-committees.  That brings up the rather limited number, I admit, which I have given here.  I want to pay a tribute to these persons who have brought such extraordinary benefits and such a large influx of money into this country, and joy and happiness into many and many a home.  Only for the fact that they travel long journeys to attend these meetings and to ventilate grievances which the ex-servicemen and their dependants suffer from, the ex-servicemen certainly would be much worse off than they are at the present time.  The work of the area advisory committees is to see that claimants receive the maximum pension, gratuity, treatment allowance, sickness benefit, educational grants, grants from voluntary funds, and other innumerable benefits that I could mention. We bring these claims under the notice of the British Minister of Pensions direct, and we, being the body nominated by the Ministry of Pensions, I believe, have more influence with them than any other body that could be appointed.  Pensioners or dependants can appear before those committees, and if they have any complaints to ventilate we certainly give them the fullest possible hearing.  The British Ministry of Pensions are very sympathetic, and if there is any possibility of falling in with the claims we put before them they do so.  But, as Deputy Cooper mentioned, there is a code of rules which would apply both in England and in Ireland, and, of course, there are cases which they are not able to deal with.  I want to give to this House an illustration of the extraordinarily good work that these committees are able to do.  I want, if possible, to remove whatever prejudice may have existed in the past, because if there was prejudice against ex-servicemen there should not be prejudice against widows and orphans, and mothers who lost their sons in the Great War.  As an illustration of what we were able to do&mdash;the committee of which I have the honour to be chairman &mdash;we have sixty children at the present time being educated at Summerhill, Athlone Convent, Sligo Convent, Salt-hill Industrial School and many other such places.  The Ministry of Pensions <Col N="1417" /> pays for their maintenance, education and clothing.  If it was not for these committees and those voluntary children would be in the County workers a large number of those Homes, or, worse still, they would be with tramps on the side of the road. They would be nobody's children.  I say it is up to every Deputy to go into every institution in the Free State and find, if possible, children who are eligible for the same education, and have their cases brought before the proper authorities.  That is the kind of work that these committees and these voluntary workers are engaged in.  It is a great pity that we have not more voluntary workers.  We have found it very difficult to obtain voluntary workers, and although Deputy Redmond takes considerable interest in the ex-servicemen, and although it was mentioned at the last election that nobody should vote for persons except the National League candidates who support ex-servicemen, I say we have got no help whatever down the country from persons who may be supporters of Deputy Redmond.</P>
    <P>I have given the sum of money that came into the Free State in September. I believe that amount could be very much increased if more persons took an interest in these people, because there are a great number of people not able to ventilate their own claims. They should have someone to help them, and I believe during the past two years they had very few to help them.  Persons in receipt of a dependent's pension can appeal for an increase if they can show that their circumstances have become worse since the pension was awarded.  In other words, if a wife has lost her husband, or perhaps a boy who has been working and bringing in something to the house gets married or otherwise leaves her, that woman is entitled to appeal and get her case reconsidered.  In many such cases we have been successful in getting the pension increased.</P>
    <P>I hope I am not travelling outside the scope of the amendment, but what I have to say now is of such vital importance that you, sir, will give me more scope than usual.  It is in connection with the certificate of death given in the case of an ex-serviceman. <Col N="1418" /> That certificate is of the most vital importance to the widow, children or other dependents of that man.  While I know there are a number of medical men in this House I wish just to mention a few cases that have come to my notice with regard to the cause of death. If a man is discharged from the Army suffering from chronic rheumatism and dies of heart disease, if the primary cause of death is not shown, his widow and children are not entitled to receive a pension.  If a man is discharged suffering from bronchitis and dies of phthisis, if also the primary cause of death is not shown, he is not eligible for a pension.  The same thing applies to malaria.  A man may be discharged from the Army whose disability was malaria and die of pneumonia. I mention those cases because I have seen the greatest possible hardship inflicted owing to a careless doctor's certificate.  While I know it may not be exactly right to raise it here, I think I shall not get a better opportunity again.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Redmond's motion and Deputy Cooper's amendment I find myself in great difficulty, because I think it is a thing there should not be a division on.  I am sure we are all agreed that something ought to be and could be done for the purpose of assisting ex-servicemen. My reason for explaining the present machinery is to show that they are not, by any means, neglected. In the year 1924 there was a Free State advisory council formed of which General Sir William Hickie was the Chairman and Sir Henry McGloughlin, Vice-Chairman.  I shall not read the long list of other people on that committee.  That committee was in direct touch with the British Minister of Pensions and brought all the cases it was possible to bring under his notice.  Owing to the existence of the area advisory committees that particular committee lapsed and is not functioning so that, as far as I can see, even if there were a committee appointed as suggested by Deputy Redmond, I should be surprised if it would have more influence with the British Government than the large number of persons, well-known supporters of ex-servicemen, who <Col N="1419" /> were appointed on the Free State Advisory Council and who met in Dublin very regularly and undoubtedly did a very great deal for ex-servicemen.</P>
    <P>I am in complete disagreement with the second part of the resolution because, as far as my experience is concerned, I have never found any discrimination in the counties I represent against ex-servicemen.  No doubt a large number of them are unemployed but they are no worse off than all the other unemployed. Colonel Crosbie, Chairman of the British Legion, who came over to Ireland very recently went from one end of the country to the other and reported that ex-servicemen in the Free State were in a very bad way, that a large number of them were unemployed but said he could not find one single concrete case of a man being victimised because he was an ex-soldier. With that statement coming from the Chairman of the British Legion, sent over here to investigate, I do not think there is any necessity for me to say anything further on the matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to housing, ex-servicemen have a very decided grievance because there was originally a sum of £1,500,000 allocated for the erection of houses in the Free State and Northern Ireland.  Subsequently this sum was reduced by £200,000, and how much of that £1,300,000 is unspent at present I am not in a position to say.  There are 1,859 soldiers' houses erected in the Free State at present and 162 in the process of building, and these will be handed over before Christmas.  Deputy Redmond said there were no houses built in Waterford.  I do not know why, if he took as much interest in ex-servicemen as he says he does, because I got 65 houses built within three miles of where I live, at a cost of £50,000, in the Mullingar area.  I mention now that the rents of these houses are too high.  These houses cost more than the houses in Northern Ireland and England&mdash;I believe £100 more.  The houses here cost £800 and the houses in Northern Ireland and England £700.  That is a matter.  I think, that ought to be considered by the British Government, because undoubtedly between rents <Col N="1420" /> and rates the houses are too dear here. As I said before, I am in complete agreement with the Deputy that this country has been badly treated by the British Government in connection with houses, because 200,000 men returned here from the war, and the number of houses I have given is very small.  I received a letter the other day which I intend to read, and which is only an illustration of innumerable other cases in this country.  It is dated the 8/11/'27 and is addressed to me.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Sir,&mdash;I am much obliged for cheque £2 which you obtained for me from the Irish Guards Fund. It is very welcome as I am unemployed, and am living with my wife and five children in a house with practically no roof.  I receive 12/- per week for a gun-shot wound received at the battle of Ypres, and as I cannot get work this is my only means of living.  The house has practically no roof, and on a wet night I have to remove the children from where their bed is in order to keep the clothes dry.  So I hope you will see and bring my case before the authorities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a terrible charge from an Irish Guardsman who undoubtedly served for many years in the war. That man and many others like him ought to be provided with houses.  The number of houses that were to be erected in the Free State was 3,600, and the number already built is 1,859. I hope that this is a matter that will receive the sympathetic consideration of the British Government.  I say that the matter of the ex-soldiers has not been as yet fairly dealt with.  With regard to the delay that has occurred in the building of these houses, I must say that I do not understand it, because there is a large sum of money available, and I cannot give a better illustration than the one I am going to give. In the town of Athlone eight ex-servicemen's houses were sanctioned to be built six months ago.  An inspector was sent down there to inspect many sites in Athlone.  He returned to Dublin, and nothing has been heard in Athlone of these sites since his return. I hope that the Government will bring under the notice of the British Government <Col N="1421" /> the great necessity for additional houses for ex-servicemen.  I believe that these men are entitled to receive more gratitude than they have been receiving in that particular way.  I am sorry that Deputy Redmond was out when I mentioned one matter, and it is this&mdash;I find myself here in a very considerable difficulty.  I hope there will be no division on this matter, in which we should be in agreement, because there is an absolute machinery in this country to ventilate any grievances the ex-servicemen have got.  We have a large number of responsible men all over the country connected with the Legion.  They meet regularly to ventilate the claims, grievances, and troubles of the ex-servicemen, and if they would report to the Executive Council here, if they have any particular grievances, or if they are not quite satisfied with the treatment they have received from the British Government, the Executive Council might be able to do better in that way for them than anything that the Commission might do.  I would be very sorry to see a division taken as between the proposition of Deputy Redmond and the amendment of Deputy Cooper on a subject in which all of us are most anxious to help.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. DALY Mr. DALY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who comes from a district where there are thousands of ex-servicemen, I must say I was delighted this evening to listen to the little scrap between Deputy Redmond and Deputy Bryan Cooper.  I think it is one of the best things that could have occurred to ventilate the grievances of the ex-servicemen.  I recognise that both these gentlemen were aiming at one object, and that was the betterment of the circumstances of the men with whom they associated in the Great War.  There is one thing I would like to point out, and that is: the ex-servicemen in any district where they are in large numbers are a great source of revenue, because they get their pensions every Friday morning, and I assure you they do not go to the banks with them.  Every town in which these men live is the better of them.  For that reason I think it is the bounden duty of everyone here to help them.  I know it would be a most pleasing duty <Col N="1422" /> for President Cosgrave to do what he could for them.  I can say that, from my experience of the President.  It would be a great help to them if their grievances were brought before the British Government by our Executive Council acting in co-operation with the Legion of Ex-Servicemen.  The latter, I think, should serve just as well as a commission.  I do not object to a commission if it is an improvement on the Legion of Ex-Servicemen, but I do not think it would be an improvement. Would it be an insult?  Would not such a commission take away from the ex-servicemen and from the Legion a right which they possess, and that is the right of appealing to the British Government?  The men themselves should be the better able to know what is the best in a matter of this kind, especially when they are led by such able advocates as Deputies Cooper and Redmond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the housing problem, I think the ex-servicemen are very badly treated.  In Fermoy there are thousands of ex-servicemen, as can be understood when I tell you that Fermoy was a large military centre.  In Cobh, where there were thousands of sailors and soldiers, there are fifteen or sixteen cottages built for the ex-servicemen. There are none at all built as yet in Fermoy.  We have a promise of fifteen houses in Fermoy out of a possible 150 that is due to the men.  These fifteen will be built in the very near future, but that is a very insignificant number in satisfaction of the claims of Fermoy ex-servicemen and the numbers that were sent away from Fermoy to defend the rights of the people across the Channel.  However, I hope we will get more of them.  I believe the rents of these houses are too high.  The rents should be an addition to the pensions. A lot of these pensions, just like the pensions to our own people, are too small, and these people tell you that they did quite as much as the people with the big pensions.  We do not know whether they did or not.  However, I think this is a matter on which there should be no division.  We are all agreed that if this money comes into the country to build houses it will be adding to the wealth of the country, and we would all be delighted to help <Col N="1423" /> in that.  Employment would be given in the building of the houses, which in the first instance are so much needed, and in twenty or thirty years' time they will be used, perhaps, by the descendants of the ex-servicemen.  A great many of these men, indeed nearly all of them, are as good Irishmen as any others in the country.  As regards employment, there may be some little difference, but I agree with Deputy Cooper when he says that 50 per cent. of them at least were in the National Army, and surely in that way they have a bit both ways. For that reason the whole of the grievances cannot exist.  Whatever grievance does exist will, I am sure, be forcibly brought forward by Deputy Cooper and his Legion or by Deputy Redmond and his Legion&mdash;I suppose there are two Legions now.  It is helpful for ex-servicemen to have two such legions with so small a difference between them.  I believe that the little fight this evening between these two leaders is a friendly fight and one that will cause no division in the House, at any rate for such a worthy purpose as, in the first place, building houses for these men and thereby giving employment, and secondly, as was pointed out by Deputy Byrne, getting fair play for the dependents, the wives and mothers of the soldiers.  I think it is a very good thing this evening that Deputy Redmond put forward this motion, and that Deputy Cooper put forward his amendment.  The ex-servicemen will be glad to-morrow when they read the newspapers to see that this matter has been taken up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarney" hpid="Mr. CARNEY Mr. CARNEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CARNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>In rising to support the motion of Deputy Redmond I may mention that I do not speak on this question of ex-soldiers as one who is entirely ignorant of the subject, because I happen to be an ex-soldier myself.  As a matter of fact, the only brother I had in the world is buried three miles north of Cape Helles.  I know something of the matter at all events, and I suppose Deputy Cooper would tell me I have since fallen from grace.  There is no need to reiterate what has been so ably said on the matter by Deputy Redmond. He has detailed a number of the disadvantages under which ex-soldiers <Col N="1424" /> and their dependents labour. No doubt, there are many disadvantages. Deputy Cooper holds that all those grievances should be put through certain organisations like the British Legion and so on.  But there are hundreds and thousands of cases of ex-servicemen who do not belong to any of those organisations.  It would be simply impossible for those organisations to deal with the cases of men who do not come on their roll.</P>
      <P>In addition to the disadvantages enumerated by Deputy Redmond there is one other typical thing.  For example, if an ex-soldier, who has been in receipt of a pension, and say he is a man who has been badly wounded, goes into a mental institution, his pension goes to his maintenance while he is in that institution. In certain cases if an ex-soldier has a widowed mother or other dependents there is a small amount of five shillings a week, perhaps, paid to that dependent or dependents while the ex-soldier remains in the institution.  But if that ex-soldier dies in the institution the pension dies with him, and in many cases widowed mothers and others who are genuine dependents have been deprived of the support given them by the ex-soldier when he was alive.  I have one typical case in mind, where an ex-soldier went into an institution, died there, and all his widowed mother was granted at the time of his death was £7 to cover his funeral expenses, although he was her only support.  I am sure Deputy Cooper would be surprised to hear I made representations to the Pensions Department of the British Government on her behalf, and I must say they did pay a pension to the mother; they awarded her five shillings a week in addition to her old-age pension.  There are, perhaps, hundreds of cases like that, and these are all cases that do not come ordinarily within the scope of the British Legion or any other ex-soldiers' organisation. Deputy Daly has told us that fifty per cent. of the ex-soldiers served in the National Army.  I am beginning to think the other fifty per cent. must have served in the I.R.A.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter that I will risk boring the House on.  It is a matter I mentioned before but, as they <Col N="1425" /> say in our country, I am a sort of crabbed individual if I do not get satisfaction.  It is the matter of the ex-Connaught Rangers who mutinied in India.  To my mind they have been not alone shabbily, but disgracefully, treated by the Free State Government. Those men were serving in India and they found that certain things were happening in their own country which did not come up to their standard of fair play.  Before that they had risked their lives in the fight for the freedom of small nations and it appeared to them that certain things were happening in Ireland which should not happen there; in other words, that their country was being overrun and treated in a way they did not approve of.  They showed their disapproval by staging a mutiny.  I hold it is a more difficult thing to mutiny in the British Army and get away with it than it is for a policeman in this country simply to leave the service in sympathy with a national cause.  As proof of that I point to the fact that some of these men were executed, others were shot during the course of the mutiny.  As I have said, some were executed and others were brought home and imprisoned in England. J.J. Daly was executed.</P>

      <P>I am only showing the circumstances surrounding the cases of the ex-Connaught Rangers who are ex-British servicemen and I think in this instance there is a big grievance against the Free State.  I will not quote.  I have the names here of some of the men who died as a result of their prison treatment.  Those men, remember, were serving in a tropical climate.  They were full of malaria and other tropical diseases. They were thrown into prison in England and as a result of the prison treatment some of them are since in bad health.  Almost all who have survived are unemployed and some of their dependents are in starvation.  I hold that those cases should come within the scope of the investigation of this suggested committee.  I am sorry that this amendment was proposed <Col N="1426" /> by Deputy Cooper because I think this is a thing we should have agreement on.  It is absolutely essential for the welfare of these ex-soldiers because they have genuine cases, definite contracts, and in many cases those contracts have been broken.  It is up to us to see that those contracts are carried out as far as it is possible to carry them out.  I am sorry to see the amendment proposed.  I am sorry that we are not all able to get together on this matter and endeavour to have the grievances of the ex-soldiers remedied.</P>

I am not saying that the amendment proposed by Deputy Cooper is the only possible alternative, but it does seem to members of the Government to be a satisfactory alternative, and we will vote for it as against the motion.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Redmond in hoping that the substance of this debate will find favour with all Parties in the House, because there is no Party that does not reckon amongst its supporters men who have served in the Great War.  It is a matter that concerns the whole country.  From what I have read and heard from people in touch with ex-servicemen, these men have very great grievances.  I am not so intimately connected with them as Deputies Redmond and Cooper. Although I served 11 years in the British Army, it is 38 years since I left it, and I am not very well acquainted with the present rules and regulations. However, my interest in the men's welfare still remains, and I am desirous that everything to which they are entitled by their service, and that was promised them by the British Government, should be obtained for them.  It seems to me that the British Government are very slow in carrying out part of their engagements, notably the spending of the money that was to be given for building houses here.  That is a most important matter not only for <Col N="1428" /> the men themselves, but in connection with the employment that the building of the houses will give throughout the country.  At present I believe that at least 30,000 of these men are in a very bad state, and are adding to the unemployed which we have in the country. If these men had what they seem to be entitled to they would not be adding to the number of people who are without the means of living.  Therefore, I think that it is right and proper their case should be taken up and presented in the best possible way to the British Government.</P>
      <P>The question is, by what means will their grievances best be remedied. Deputy Redmond thinks a commission is the best way.  I do not agree with that.  If the matter were not so very urgent, perhaps a commission could be set up on which the British Government would naturally have to have representatives. To my mind, however, that would entail a very long period of waiting, and these men cannot afford to wait.  It is necessary that they should get what they are entitled to at once.  Therefore, I think it would be much quicker and much more efficacious if their needs were presented to the Free State Government through the responsible leaders, through the trustees appointed to look after the expenditure of this money, so that their outstanding requirements should be stated clearly through this body, on which, I think, there are five or six important members who ought to have at their fingers-ends the needs and requirements of these men.  I think that is the quickest and the most efficacious method of having their needs brought to the attention of the British Government.  If the case were properly represented to the British Government, and if the matters in dispute were clearly stated there ought not to be any difficulty in this matter being settled to the advantage not only of those men, but of the country, through the spending of the money to which they are entitled.</P>

      <P>It is very hard for an ordinary Deputy to make up his mind what to do in connection with this matter.  Deputy Redmond puts down a motion asking for a commission to <Col N="1429" /> be set up.  Deputy Cooper has an amendment asking that the grievances of these men should be put forward through the medium of the British Legion.  Deputy Cooper's amendment stops at that.  Although he mentioned that the Executive Council would then take up the matter with the British Government, there is nothing specifically mentioned in the amendment which requires them to do so.  I think that at this stage we are entitled to a statement from the Government as to what they are prepared to do in connection with the undoubted grievances of these men.  Deputy Cooper stated that the President has always been accessible to hear the grievances of ex-servicemen, but he has not told us what measure of success has been attained by the President in so far as these representations are concerned.  Everybody knows that these ex-servicemen are suffering from a great many grievances. Deputy Redmond has mentioned many &mdash;I could mention a great many more. He has mentioned that so far as he knows no houses have been built for them in Waterford City.  The same thing applies to Wexford, which, as Deputy Redmond knows, sent a great number to the Great War.  A gentleman visited that town on numerous occasions, and every time he came there he promised that the houses would be built in the very near future.  He has been offered facilities by the Urban Council so far as free sites are concerned, and although it is three years since his first visit, not a single house has yet been built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, it is very hard for ordinary Deputies to arrive at a decision as to what they are to do in this matter. We have Deputy Redmond on the one side and Deputy Cooper on the other side with different view-points as to the means by which those grievances could be remedied.  I think it is due to the House that the Government should let us know if anything has yet been done to bring the matter before the British Government.  These people are Irish citizens, and are entitled to have their grievances remedied.  I have been informed on various occasions that the President has made representations to <Col N="1430" /> the British Government, especially in regard to housing, and we are entitled to know if anything has come out of these representations.  Lavish promises were made to these people during the recruiting campaign, but very few of them have fructified since these unfortunate men came back.  In the interests of the common citizenship of the country, everybody here should see that strong representations are made to the British Government, so as to make them realise that they cannot make promises to Irish citizens and break them as disgracefully as they have done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel under certain obligations to add a few words to those already uttered in connection with this matter.  I am speaking as an ex-member, not of the British forces, but of Dominion forces, and I realise that owing to the political change which took place in this country between the time when Irishmen joined the British forces to serve in the Great War and the present time those men have become to a certain extent nobody's children, and that their grievances are not receiving the attention which they would receive if no change of government had taken place.  When I say that, I do not imply any blame on the present Government, but I do say that the political changes have had a detrimental effect on the interests of these ex-servicemen.  Our status has been changed from being portion of the United Kingdom to being an independent member of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  It is well known that the ex-servicemen of the Dominion forces were extremely well treated by the Dominion Governments, and Irish ex-servicemen have the right to claim that they will not be treated any worse because of the fact that we have become a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy Corish, I am rather in a difficulty about the motion and the amendment.  I accepted it that Deputy Redmond was putting his motion in a non-party spirit, and that the House was meeting the motion and the amendment in the same spirit.  I believe it is up to us in this House to devise and recommend some measures whereby the attention of the British Government <Col N="1431" /> will be directly called to the grievances of the ex-servicemen, but it is difficult to decide what are the best methods to recommend for that purpose.  The appointment of a commission seems to me to be a somewhat dangerous procedure. We are now dealing with the British Government from the point of view of an independent country, and we must be careful, in my opinion, not to take any action that will affect our relationship with them from that point of view.  It seems possible to me that if we were to appoint a commission to go into these grievances, if that commission is regarded as an official commission set up by the Executive Council to sit in judgment on the treatment that the British Government are meting out to the ex-members of its forces, that is rather a dangerous direction in which to have the attention of people directed.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to say that Deputy Cooper's amendment meets the case fully.  Perhaps some suggestion might come from the Ministerial Benches before we are finished.  Anyhow, I am perfectly sure that there are grievances which ought to be remedied, and I am perfectly sure there is general agreement here that the men who offered their services in the Great War are as good and as patriotic and as loyal Irishmen as those who did not, and that in so far as our treatment of them is concerned they should not be placed in any worse position than any others seeking the guardianship of this country.  In particular I think special attention ought to be directed to the delay in completing the obligations in regard to the building of houses.</P>
    <P>In my own particular constituency in some towns, apparently, the British Government has met its obligations fairly fully, but there are other towns where the building of ex-servicemen's houses has not yet been commenced. In my native town of Cahir I believe they have only just started, and this only as a result of the representations of a very efficient representative in the district.  In Cashel, although the local council has been making representations for some time, I believe a start has not yet been made with regard to building houses.  It is quite evident <Col N="1432" /> there has been delay in this particular matter just as there has been neglect in regard to other grievances of the British ex-servicemen in this country. I think it would be a good thing if a general expression of opinion came from this House instead of this motion being pressed, and if anyone concerned gave thought to devising the best means of meeting the grievances that exist we might do something helpful for the British ex-servicemen, and that is what we are all endeavouring to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrPatrickJODowd" hpid="Dr. O'DOWD Dr. O'DOWD">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'DOWD</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the motion moved by Deputy Redmond. Deputy Cooper in his amendment would have the ex-servicemen voice their grievances through the British Legion, or some other ex-servicemen's organisation.  There is general unanimity on the fact that the majority of ex-servicemen do not belong to the British Legion or to any other ex-servicemen's organisation.  There are in Ireland to-day many ex-British servicemen in dire distress who, prior to the Treaty in 1921, took service with the I.R.A., and these men who, like myself, joined the I.R.A. on their return from France, will not seek help through the British Legion to-day.  They have helped to make the Treaty a <i>fait accompli</i>; they have done in the Black and Tan war more than a man's part, and this House should not ask these men to go back to the British Legion, or any other ex-servicemen's organisation, because they are in want.  These men are Irish citizens.  They may have taken the wrong step in their participation in the Great War&mdash;that is a matter of dispute&mdash;but these men joined the I.R.A. in pre-Truce days with a national outlook common to the whole country, and these men will not seek help or any favour through the British Legion.  I could refer Deputy Cooper to many hundreds throughout the country.  This House should not ask these men to remain in want and dire distress because they will not submit to such a display of Imperialism once again.</P>

      <P>That is a very intelligent speech to which we have just listened, and it is in keeping with some of the other statements I have <Col N="1433" /> heard or have been made in connection with this matter.  We are told we have approximately one hundred thousand ex-British soldiers in this country.  How are we to get information regarding their needs?  Is it through each man bringing in its own needs to the commission? Has the Deputy who has just spoken any experience of previous commissions? Has he any experience of 100,000 men having grievances or, to take him at his own words, being in want, and who will not consider the advisability of coming together and banding themselves into some organisation and putting their needs in a businesslike way before an investigating body?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House is asked to discuss this question in a non-party spirit.  Let us look at what is meant by the non-party spirit.  There is always a claim for a non-party spirit when people want to get their own way.  We are invited to consider it in a non-party way, taking as much support as we can from those who stand for what sense there is in this House.  That is the non-party spirit in which we are asked to set up a commission and put on trial two governments, neither of them appearing before it in order to make their case. That is not a business method.  Have any of the great international lawyers who have spoken known a commission of this kind being set up by any other country to consider cases of this sort? Has the Deputy who has just sat down and who has had continental experience ever heard of such a commission as this being set up on the Continent to inquire into the relative merits or demerits of the Magyars or the CzechoSlovakians in connection with the disposition of territory that took place on the Continent?  Not at all.  This commission is an excellent way, the Deputy says, and should not bind anybody to put his case through an organisation. This is a commission which is to try two governments, and in respect of which no case has been made for their trial. What case has been made?  Six hundred civil servants, we are told, were temporary. An examination was held, and now the claim is made that another examination should be held.  Was there ever a case put up whether on the adjournment <Col N="1434" /> of the House or by motion asking that there should be a second examination?  Has there ever been a representation made to the Minister for Finance by Deputy Redmond to consider those cases?</P>

      <P>The amendment at least has this much in its favour, that it asks for representations regarding disabilities to be put before the Executive&mdash;to put the Executive in the position of being able to make representations and to take such action as in the circumstances may be necessary or expedient. The motion goes on to say: &ldquo;In respect of rights arising out of their past services or against the Government of the Irish Free State in respect of alleged discrimination against them in regard to employment on public works or in regard to their general rights.&rdquo;  What are they?  The only case that Deputy Redmond could make in respect of discrimination, and it is not discrimination against them&mdash; it is discrimination against me, against Deputy Redmond, against Deputy O'Connell, against Deputy de Valera&mdash; is that there is a preference given of about one-tenth per cent. to ex-National <Col N="1436" /> Army men in respect of road work, and it is on the cards that they would get that even if that preference were not there.</P>
      <P>The Dáil is in the position to express its opinion regarding this commission. I know of no commission and I know of no personnel of a commission established here to make a case regarding the grievances or alleged grievances or claims which would receive satisfaction from another Government in the circumstances. I do not say that the same result would apply to bona fide representations made in respect of those men by one Government to another.  If the Dail desires to get a business solution of this it is in the amendment.  It is not in the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a word or two with reference to the examinations for temporary clerks. As the President stated, there was no discrimination against British ex-Army candidates, but there was a certain discrimination in favour of ex-National Army candidates.  The examination for temporary clerks was held in July, 1925.  1,244 temporary clerks entered for that examination.  The 651 who qualified were appointed.  These included British ex-Army men.  These British ex-Army men had had previous opportunities, at least some of them &mdash;perhaps the great majority&mdash;of entering the permanent Civil Service, because examinations for ex-British service men had been held before the change of government.  There was even an examination held subsequent to the change of government, at which British ex-servicemen had an opportunity of competing.  We decided to give one further opportunity to ex-National Army men, and, in consequence, <Col N="1437" /> in May, 1927, an examination was held, as a result of which 128 ex-National Army men were admitted to the Civil Service.  They got a preference over every other candidate, those who had never been in the British Army and those who had, by getting this second chance, but there was no discrimination against British ex-Army men.  What happened was that there was no discrimination in their favour.</P>
      <P>With regard to the motion, and to what Deputy O'Dowd said, it may be that large numbers of ex-British Service men would not enter any of the existing organisations, but it would be possible for them to come together in some other way and form some other organisation to sift this matter and to find what genuine case they have, so that it might be put up in an authorised way to the Executive Council, and so as to give the Executive Council ground for making representations. I believe that representations made by the Executive Council, after having the cases examined in this way, would be much more likely to secure some good for the ex-servicemen than anything that could result from the commission suggested by Deputy Redmond.  The setting up of a commission such as that necessarily means putting the British Government in the dock.  I think that if the British Government were to set up a public commission in England to consider whether or not the people who had claims against us, or who thought they had claims, were right in their claims, we would be irritated and annoyed by it.  We would not be more disposed to do good for those people because of that.  I do not say this motion would damage the ex-servicemen, I say it would prejudice those who would have to deal with them.  Deputy Wolfe said that the British Government should be represented on the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it would be desirable and I do not know whether we could arrange to have the British Government represented on a commission set up here.  If they are not represented, they will not appear before the commission and what will happen will be that they and their actions will be tried in their absence with the result that, almost <Col N="1438" /> inevitably, such a commission will go wrong in some of its findings.  If they could not or did not hear one side of the case and heard the other side, it would be almost impossible for them not to go wrong in some of their findings. Because of some extravagances of that kind, the position of the ex-service men would be prejudiced.  I do not say that Deputy Cooper's proposal is ideal.  If we were to consider the question further, we might discover a better way of dealing with it.  The better plan might be to have these two proposals withdrawn and have the question further considered.  But Deputy Cooper's method does give more hope of having something done for the ex-service men than the method that Deputy Redmond suggests.  Under Deputy Redmond's motion, there can be only one side of the case considered.  If we were dealing with grievances that ex-servicemen might have against the Saorstát Government and not against the British Government, then the setting up of a commission would not have the objections I mentioned in reference to the claims they have against the British Government and I think that is the main thing.  I suggest to Deputies that we should not be trying to score in this matter.  We should try to find what is best for the ex-servicemen.  I suggest most sincerely that the proposal of this public commission is not what would be best for the ex-servicemen.</P>

That is why I do not like to withdraw my amendment, which is an alternative, though possibly an inadequate and unsuitable alternative, to Deputy Redmond's motion.  If the Deputy withdraws his motion, I shall be glad to withdraw my amendment and co-operate with him in trying to find some more suitable method of dealing with the matter.</P>

      <P>It has been suggested that I should withdraw this motion.  At the back of that suggestion there seems to be only one reason.  That <Col N="1439" /> is embarrassment.  Embarrassment to whom?  Embarrassment to the British Government on the one side and to the Irish Government on the other.  I am to withdraw my motion that the claims and interests, rights and grievances of the ex-servicemen should be investigated by an impartial tribunal because it might be an embarrassment to the British or the Irish Government.  All I can say about that is that the reason the ex-servicemen require this motion is because of the state in which they are to-day.  That state of affairs has reached such a stage that Field Marshal Earl Haig has actually made an appeal in Great Britain for the destitute and suffering ex-servicemen in this country. Everyone knows that Colonel Crossfield, to whom Deputy Cooper referred, in his report, which was published in this country, gave a fearful description of the condition of many of the ex-servicemen here.  My complaint is that something has not been done, so far, and not that representations have not been made through the British Legion and other organisations, because I know these have been made.  I agree with Deputy Cooper that when he made personal representations to President Cosgrave the President took up individual cases and probably did a great deal for them.</P>

      <P>I withdraw the word &ldquo;personal.&rdquo;  Deputy Cooper made representations in some capacity and, possibly, the President acted upon those representations.  But that is not my complaint.  Here in the Dáil, by way of question and answer, I elicited the fact that houses were not being built in this country by the Land Trust to the extent they should be.  I asked whether representations would be made to the British Government officially, and the President declined to <Col N="1440" /> make them.  Furthermore, I can say, when statements are made by many Deputies that they are anxious to have more money brought into this country from the British Government for expenditure on houses for ex-servicemen, that I do not complain that the money is not coming in.  My point is that the money is there.  There are three-quarters of a million there.  It has been there for the last seven years and has not been expended, as it should have been expended, upon these houses and in supplying the needs and necessities of these men.  It has been suggested that a commission would not be advisable, because it might embarrass the British Government.  Where is the embarrassment? Neither the British Government nor the Free State Government is to be brought to the bar and indicted at this commission.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation, if nobody else referred to embarrassment, I certainly did.  But the point I made was not about the embarrassment of the British Government, but the effect on the prospects of having something done for the ex-servicemen.</P>

      <P>I was endeavouring to show that the commission I was anxious to have set up was not to be regarded as an indictment of either Government.  It was to be a commission of inquiry&mdash;a genuine commission of inquiry&mdash;to ascertain what the position of the ex-servicemen was.  That is for the Government to find out, and it is for the benefit of the Government that I propose this motion. The Government cannot know what the position is to-day.  If they did, and if they had been true to the people they represent, they would have acted long ago on their behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the Government to set up a commission to find out impartially what the position of the ex-servicemen is.  It will be a purely Irish commission, and will have nothing to do with the passing of a vote of censure upon the British or Irish Government.  It will be a matter of investigation entirely, and when that investigation is concluded the Government will be in the position to know what is the true state <Col N="1441" /> of affairs and how they should act in the matter.  I certainly think that no reason has been shown why there should not be a commission.  What harm is a commission going to do? Supposing it is discovered that these grievances are only imaginary, will that be any great loss to the Government or to the country?  Won't it be a satisfaction if such results follow. Supposing it is discovered, on the other hand, that there are genuine grievances, will not the Government be only too pleased to acknowledge that they have discovered something and can act upon it, in the interests of a large section of the people of this country?</P>
    <P>No similar suggestion was made when a commission was proposed in regard to the grievances of the town tenants, or to the question of unemployment in this country.  The President's speech this evening could have been made upon the proposal to set up any commission that was ever proposed to be set up. He asked how were these people going to come and make their representations. He said they have not got an organisation and so forth.  The same thing could have been said about the town tenants.  The same thing could have been said about the commissions that have been set up to inquire into the arterial drainage or any other subject matter under the discussion of any other <Col N="1442" /> legislature in any country in the world. That is no argument against the setting up of this particular commission.  The attitude of the Government is, with respect to them, a purely Party one. They were asked if they would take off the Whips.  I asked them in my original statement and they were asked subsequently by an Independent Deputy. It took considerable time to elicit the information that they were not going to take off the Party Whips.  It will be interesting to discover after this discussion has taken place why the Government would not take off the Party Whips.  What is in this motion which the Government should oppose as a Government if they are all so keen and anxious as to the welfare of Irish ex-servicemen, and if they are all so anxious about it as a non-party matter, when they insinuated that I, as the mover, brought it forward in a party strain?  If I did that why not take off the Whips and let the Dáil vote as they please on it and they can say to the country in the morning that it was a free expression of the opinion of the Dáil?  No; it is they that are making it a party matter and refusing, as a Government Party, to set up an impartial commission which would investigate the alleged claims&mdash;the grievances if any&mdash;of a huge body of Irish citizens whose claims, in the past, have been neglected or set aside.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="MINISTER for DEFENCE (Mr. Fitzgerald) Desmond FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for DEFENCE (Mr. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is very well known to the Dáil, as <Col N="1447" /> similar Bills have been before the Dáil on a number of occasions.  A Bill such as this is necessary to renew the legislation governing the defence forces, as otherwise the control of the Oireachtas over the Army would, to a large extent, lapse on the 31st of March next, and military law would cease to have effect from that date.  It has been understood all along that the present Acts do not consist of provisions for the government of the Army that are final in form.  Another Bill constructed in the light of our experience in defence matters will be introduced, I hope and I expect, within the next year. In the meantime it is, as I have just mentioned, essential to provide for the maintenance of the Army until the 31st March, 1929, or until the passing of any Act making similar provision.</P>
      <P>With regard to the policy, the formation and the character of the Army, our idea, and the type of army that we propose ultimately reaching, is an army composed of three parts&mdash;a standing army, a reserve, and a territorial or a militia force.  Up to the present the Army has consisted solely of a standing army.  Our idea is that that standing army should be maintained as the framework of a much bigger force, which will include the reserve in the immediate future and a territorial force in the almost immediate future.  The territorial force will consist of men partly or wholly trained; but although we aim at having an army, as I say, in this form, which will consist of a standing army much smaller than the present, a reserve which is just coming into being, and the militia which we hope to bring into being at a later stage, there are certain things which make it impossible for us to go quite as quickly as we would like to go.  The standing army should, as soon as possible, become the framework of the whole army, but, as I say, there are certain considerations which make it impossible for us to move on towards that end as quickly as we would like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The political situation has prevented that feeling of security which is a normal thing in most countries, and <Col N="1448" /> which, I hope, is being very rapidly established here.  Owing to that lack of political security it is necessary for the Army to provide guards to a greater extent than would ordinarily be required. The same political causes make it necessary for us to keep in being more military posts throughout the country than would be needed after a long period of political rest.  The defence of our coast, maintained by the British under the Treaty, has required so far that we should maintain a military post nearby.</P>
    <P>Though undoubtedly those abnormal causes are passing away with commendable rapidity, for some time to come there must remain considerations that will affect the speed with which we move towards the Army organisation I have mentioned.  Another thing that will be a temporary stop to our progress towards that end is the fact that various technical corps, such as artillery, air and other corps, need specialised training which could not be given during the infantryman's period of army service, and therefore the period of service in the case of the corps is longer, namely, five years for the colours and seven for the reserve. That means that the movement of these technical men to the reserve is slower than that of the infantry.  The character of the framework which is being formed as a nucleus of our defence forces is modified by this fact and is also affected by the need of maintaining standing troops for the purposes of national defence and for the purposes of training.</P>
    <P>In view of the type of army we have in mind, composed of three parts, of which the standing Army will be the smallest, it is necessary for us to consider discipline and training and to consider them to an extraordinary degree. I think that during the present year military training is being carried out intensively and that very good progress is being made.  It will be remembered that we sent certain officers to America for the purpose of being able to establish, when they came back, a military college.  These men have come back from America and we intend to establish a military college without delay. I do not think I need go into the matter <Col N="1449" /> further.  This Bill is the type of Bill that has been introduced in the Dáil a number of times and people have criticised us for not moving on to the permanent Bill more quickly.  I think we have been well advised of the circumstances that prevented our moving on to the permanent Bill more rapidly.  I do think, as far as one can judge the situation, that within the next twelve months we shall be able to introduce a Bill which will supersede the Bill I am moving.  I move that this Bill receives a Second Reading, so that the Army may be maintained in being, and so that the Oireachtas will maintain control of the Army until the 31st March, 1929, or until such time that the Bill which I hope to introduce becomes law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise a point of order on Deputy de Valera's amendment.  I submit that in so far as it is not a direct negative it is not relevant to the motion but it is perhaps put down by way of analogy to the amendment to the Public Safety (Repeal) Bill, which was tabled on behalf of the Government.  The amendment to the Public Safety (Repeal) Bill was a proposal that the Bill be repealed as from a date eighteen months ahead.  The real motion was that the Bill repealing the Act immediately be passed so that the amendment in that case was strictly relevant to the motion. It seems to me that this is not relevant or if you do hold it relevant you will open a very wide door for amendments to Second Readings of Bills.  If this particular amendment is in order, it would be equally in order&mdash;I say it by way of illustration&mdash;to put down an amendment saying, that the Dáil declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill and is of opinion that the Gárda Síochána ought to be armed.  It might, perhaps, be possible to put down an amendment saying that the Dáil declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill and is of opinion that we should try to get increased activity on the part of the League of Nations.  It seems to me that it is entirely wide of the scope of the Bill and suggesting an alternative measure, and is not properly in order as an amendment to the motion, &ldquo;That the Bill be read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to see the point made by the Minister in connection with this amendment.  I cannot see why it is not in order according to the rules.  The point in the amendment is, that instead of continuing the defence forces provisions as they stand we should change the form of the Army, and therefore reduce it to a small standing force and a volunteer territorial army instead of the present one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion is: &ldquo;That the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) (No. 2) Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  The Bill is simple and brief, but it proposes to continue in force the original Defence Forces Act of 1923 with the amendments that have since been made to it.  It is, I take it, a Bill to continue the statutory provisions under which the Army is now in being.  The amendment seems to me to be an amendment suggesting an alternative&mdash;that is, that a defence force of a different kind should be arranged for.  The amendment should possibly have some reference to legislation in it and might be improved in that way, but it seems to me to be quite relevant to the motion.  There is some question of a direct negative raised.  I think that what is called a reasoned amendment to a Second Reading motion is, in effect, itself very often a direct negative&mdash;that the Dáil declines to give a Second Reading for a reason.  An amendment might be either in the form of a direct negative giving a reason, or a direct negative giving a reason with an alternative, or a direct negative giving an alternative. As this appears to me to establish an alternative, as far as I can read the Defence Forces Act, and as far as the general question of relevancy is concerned, the amendment is in order.  It raises the question of the type of army, which is, I think, essentially the type of question raised by the Defence Forces Act itself.  It involves not only re-organisation but legislation as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>My object in raising the point of order was that, in my opinion, if we are to admit an amendment of this type, which goes a great <Col N="1451" /> deal further away from the actual motion than the amendment put down by the Government on the Public Safety Act, we shall rapidly reach the stage where it would be possible to devise dozens of amendments which might be moved successively to a motion for the Second Reading of a Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>If an attempt is made to devise dozens of amendments to a motion for the Second Reading of a Bill, it would simply be the function of the Chair to see that any such obstructive procedure is not carried out.  Notice, of course, would have to be given of these amendments. The Minister gave as an example that there might be an amendment that the Gárda Síochána ought to be armed. That raises a different matter for consideration, and I am not prepared to state, on a hypothetical case, what ruling I would give.  The amendment, as it stands, plainly implies a type of army, not an armed police force.  That seems to raise an issue which would be quite relevant to the debate on the main question.  I am accepting the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with attention to the statement made by the Minister for Defence with respect to the Executive policy concerning the type of army they purposed having finally.  I was very glad to note that there is a considerable approach towards the type of army which we think ought to be the type we should have in this country.  Naturally, when you ask yourself what is the type of army you are going to have, and whether you can afford the expense of the army you require, you have first of all to ask yourself what is to be its main objective.  The question for us is whether the objective of the army is to be the objective that most armies in normal countries have, namely, that of protecting the State and the nation against an outside aggressor, or whether we are going to have the continuation of an army which, as far as we can see, is going to function in this country mainly on the lines of Lord Birkenhead's policy of wishing Irishmen <Col N="1452" /> to keep down, as I think he said, the turbulent population of the south of Ireland in the interests of Englishmen. When we look around, we must ask ourselves what outside aggressor have we got to fear?  Is the attack on the liberties and rights of the Irish people going to come, say, from France or Germany, or from what quarter is it going to come?  I think every Irishman will have to admit that the one quarter from which we have been attacked in the past is not from Germany or France, but from across the Irish sea.  If we want an army to protect ourselves it is against the one Power that has been the aggressor in the past on our rights and liberties, and the Power, indeed, which has attacked us and interfered with our rights within a very short space of time.  We all know that the Treaty was forced upon the representatives of the Irish people&mdash;that those who accepted it and submitted to it took it as an alternative to immediate and terrible war.  Therefore, I say that the one Power against which we have to defend ourselves is that Power across the water.  If we want an army to defend our rights and liberties at all, it must be an army which will give us the best possible defence against attacks from that quarter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we ask ourselves, &ldquo;How are we going to defend ourselves from such attack,&rdquo; I think we will not be very long in examining the question before we convince ourselves that an army such as has been maintained for the last four or five years is not the type of army to defend us against such attack. If we are going to defend ourselves against any Power, we can only do it in the way we did before, and that is, not by a standing army of this particular normal type, but by a force which will make it impossible for that foreign Power to rule in this country or make it very expensive for them at any rate. I do not think that any army which we can afford to raise is going to be effective in preventing an invasion, for instance, of our coasts here by the British.  Suppose there was a difference of opinion and that they invaded our coasts, I do not think any army we are likely to raise in the form in which it <Col N="1453" /> is at present is going to be an effective defence.  Our defence will, I say, in the future lie, as in the past, in having a territorial volunteer force which will make it impossible, or at least very costly, for that one Power to try to establish its rule here amongst us.  On that account I say we ought as quickly as possible to get away from the present army organisation, and get to a small standing army which will be the nucleus from which we can expand in case there is need for defending ourselves.</P>
    <P>Now it is obvious that that small standing force will have to have within it a technical corps mainly, and I have not, at the moment, sufficient data to enable me to say exactly what the size of that central nucleus or standing army should be.  I had hoped that the Minister for Defence would give some indication as to what the size of the standing portion of the army would be, and what would be the size of the reserve and what would be the size of the territorial army.  He has not given that though I think that he has the material from which he could very rapidly get these material facts, and we have not.  But if we take, for example, some of the small Continental armies, for instance, Switzerland, Denmark and others, we get something to go on.  Let us take Switzerland.  We find there that roughly the standing portion of the army is about one-tenth of the total, and I say that if we are going to have a territorial force, let us say, for example, of 50,000 men we ought to be able to get on with a standing army of not more than five thousand and as far as we are concerned we shall reduce it to the point below which we could not go if it was to be effective at all.</P>
    <P>The organisation, then, we think, ought to be on a territorial basis.  We think that we could, if we had an organisation on that basis, bring down the present expenditure on the Army by at least one million pounds.  Again, without the actual details&mdash;the cost of the various corps, and so on&mdash;we cannot prove that in figures, but our belief is that we could reduce the cost of the present Army by over one million pounds at least, and that that could be done in a comparatively short space of <Col N="1454" /> time.  We think, for example, an effort to reduce that should be made within a year.</P>
    <P>Now if we cannot get a force which is going to be effective in defending us against aggression from the only point from which we think aggression is likely to come, then I say any money spent is absolutely wasted.  I think it is not necessary for me to outline any further what our views are on this matter, because to do it in detail would require that we should have at our disposal the staffs and the information which the Minister for Defence, at all events, has.  We have got certain information but not sufficient to enable us to make this case out conclusively. However, until we can be shown that it cannot be done, and that a reduction on those lines and an army of that particular type cannot be set up, we cannot vote for this particular Bill, and, therefore, we will have to oppose it.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that, of course, anybody speaking on this has to refer, and that is whether the idea of an army here is to be that of simply an addition to the British Forces.  In other words, is the Irish Army to be maintained simply to be handed over to the British in time of war?  I think the Minister for Defence said on one occasion, when he was Minister for External Affairs&mdash;perhaps it would be just as well to quote his exact words.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I had better get the exact words.  He said: &ldquo;We need not blink the fact that it is quite possible in the event of a general <Col N="1455" /> attack on these islands, it is perfectly obvious our Army must co-operate with the British Army.  It is practically inconceivable that our Army would ever be opposed to the British Army,&rdquo; but that our officers, etc., should go to learn.  The points I am going to deal with are these two statements: &ldquo;We need not blink the fact that it is quite possible in the event of a general attack on these islands, it is perfectly obvious that our Army must co-operate with the British Army.&rdquo;  What is meant by a &ldquo;general attack upon these islands&rdquo;? As well as I can remember, when the Great War was on, the appeal to Irishmen was that the safety of these islands was imperilled, and that this Great War was, in fact, a general attack upon these islands.  Irishmen were asked to go out to that war to fight in order to repel this general attack upon these islands.  Are we going to be dragged into all these wars?  Are we going to be dragged into any war that the British may regard as a war of aggression? Has any aggressor ever admitted at any time that the war they were engaged in was a war of aggression? They have always claimed that it was a war of defence.  We may be perfectly certain that any war will be put down as a war of defence, and a war for the defence of these islands, and the attack will be represented as a general attack upon these islands.  Therefore, what is going to happen is that the Irish forces are going to be simply a part of the British Army in repelling these general attacks.  That is my view, anyhow.  I think that that ought not to be our policy.  We should insist upon having I believe a policy of general neutrality the right of maintaining our neutrality. is the proper policy for this country.  It is the one policy we can afford to maintain, and we ought to maintain it, and we ought not to commit ourselves to engaging with the British Army in anything that they may choose to call the general defence of these islands.  &ldquo;It is practically inconceivable that our Army would ever be opposed to the British Army.&rdquo;  As I indicated at the start, I think if we are ever going to see that force of ours as a defence force, <Col N="1456" /> it is to defend us against aggression from England.  That is my view, and I think there are Deputies here who will agree that that is much more likely to happen than that we would be defending ourselves against the United States or France, or any other country.  I say that if we are to defend our people it must be against one Power that in the past has been interfering with our rights and attacking us.  I say in that matter we ought not to organise our Army with a view to making it an effective auxiliary of the British.  We ought to organise our Army to defend the rights and liberties of our own people. And it is because we think the present organisation of the Free State Army, and keeping such a large portion of it as a standing army is not the best way, that we propose our amendment.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To delete all the words after &lsquo;That,&rsquo; and add the words: &lsquo;The Dáil declines to give a second reading to a Bill having for its purpose the continuance of the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts, 1923 to 1927; but is of opinion that the Defence Forces should be organised before March 31, 1928, on a volunteer territorial basis, with a small permanent training and maintenance establishment.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say a word or two on that portion of the amendment that, I take it, we may discuss.  The motion before the House is to give a Second Reading to a Bill to continue in force in this country the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act of 1923.  I suppose the number of Deputies who have seen the Act is probably small, but I am quite certain that the number of Deputies who have read it is smaller still.  I doubt, outside the Government Benches, if even there, there is anybody who has read the Act which consists, I think, of about 250 sections.  That Act was before the Dáil in 1923, a few days before the general election of that year.  The Dáil then or since has never had an opportunity of discussing a single section scarcely of that Act.  That is the present position: that this vast and <Col N="1457" /> complicated measure which legalises and governs the Army never got an hour's consideration in the Dáil.  At the time it was introduced we were told that it was a purely temporary measure and that opportunity would be taken, in the course of the next twelve months, to have a Bill introduced which would put the Army on a permanent basis.  I certainly would pay more attention to the promise made by the Minister for Defence, in the course of his opening remarks this evening, to the effect that he would have a Bill brought in twelve months hence if I were not aware that that promise has been repeated almost year after year since 1923.  We had that promise made in 1923, and we had a definite promise from the President, who then was Minister for Defence, in June, 1924, that we would have that Bill before Christmas. I believe a similar promise was made last year when they were continuing this Act, and we have the same promise made again to-day.  I would like to know what greater strength there is behind this promise than there was behind the promises made in 1923, 1924 and 1925.  Perhaps, after all, it might have its advantages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe, as circumstances have turned out, that there is an advantage in the fact that no permanent Bill has been introduced up to this.  Undoubtedly the circumstances now are different to what they were at any time previous to this year.  We have now a full representative Dáil.  In framing a permanent Bill and in deciding what kind of an army we are to have, it will undoubtedly be of much greater advantage to the country as a whole and to the general stability of the country, that such a Bill can be framed by a full representative House than one where you had one-third of the elected representatives absent from the Dáil.  To that extent there has been a certain advantage.  There is no doubt whatever that the time has now come when there ought to be a consideration of the position with regard to the Army. As Deputy de Valera said, the purpose of the Army must be taken into account when considering what the future organisation of our Army is to <Col N="1458" /> be, but be that as it may, at the moment we are asked to consider the motion before us.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Act now in force will expire on 31st March, 1928.  The effective clause in the Act of 1923 was the one which gave the Executive the power to raise and maintain an army in this State.  If that Act is not continued&mdash;in other words, if the Bill now before us is not passed&mdash;it might happen that on the 31st March, 1928, we would have no Bill or no Act legalising the Army, unless, of course, in the meantime, that is between now and the 31st March, 1928, we set up what might possibly be a new scheme for army reorganisation, and at the same time passed legislation through this House legalising that army.  Apart altogether from what views we may have as to the future of the army or as to the line army organisation should take, I hold the view that it would not be physically possible in that time to set about what might very well be a wholesale reorganisation of our Army and at the same time introduce and pass through the House what must necessarily be a very complicated measure. That, I think, would take almost three months to go through the House and get consideration section by section. I do not believe it would be possible to do that between now and 31st March, 1928&mdash;at least, to do it effectively. That is the view that I take of this Bill, and that is the reason I am prepared to vote for its second reading.</P>
    <P>With regard to the scheme of re-organisation, so far as I can gather, there is not a great deal of difference between the suggestion made by Deputy de Valera and the suggestion made by the Minister for Defence.  In principle and in essence I believe they are the same.  The Minister said that their intention as to what the army ought to be was a small standing army &mdash;much smaller, he said, than it is at the present time.  Deputy de Valera's idea is the same&mdash;that it would be organised thereafter on a volunteer basis with a reserve.  In principle I do not think there is any difference between these two points of view.  Therefore, the question boils itself down to this: <Col N="1459" /> How soon can this re-organisation be carried out?  Deputy de Valera suggested that all this could be done before March 31st, 1928.  I must confess and say definitely, as a result of my experience here, that it could not be done and that if it were done in that time it would not be done with the care and consideration that such an important question deserves from the House and the country generally.  We have the promise again, as I say, for what it is worth, because I am forced to say that from my experience of previous promises, that a new Bill would be introduced before the expiration of the period for which this new Act is asked.  As between the two suggestions that have been made, I am prepared to support the Second Reading of the Bill on this occasion, but, I say definitely, on this occasion.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera referred to&mdash; perhaps it is as well I should say a word on that&mdash;the purpose of the Army.  Of course it is intended should be used to protect this country, to defend this country against outside aggression from any quarter.  I think it should be our purpose in this Dail and in this country generally to try and get the idea cultivated at home and abroad, so far as we can help to do so, that the occasion would never arise and ought not ever arise when the Army should be used in that connection at all: that our ideals, our aims and our thoughts should be directed towards peace rather than war, even a defensive war.  I believe there are many forces in this country and outside of it, in Europe, America and elsewhere working at the present time in that direction. I believe it should be the aim of this country and of representative people of all shades of opinion in this country to make it plain that the Irish Free State has as its object the creation of peace at home and abroad. That is an idea that on all occasions we ought to put before ourselves, not only because peace in itself is good and is a good thing to be aimed at, but because we are bound to lose in the case of almost any war that will occur and that involves even our neighbouring countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1460" /> I am with Deputy de Valera entirely in what he has stated as to the attitude the Army should adopt in case Britain is involved in war.  I am entirely in favour of the view he has stated&mdash;that it ought to be neutral, and that it ought to have the right to be neutral.  If the Army is to act independently or in co-operation with that of any other country, that should be done only with the authority of this Parliament.  The Army should have the right to take any action which this Parliament directs it to take.  It ought to be under the complete control of this Parliament, and there should be no binding arrangements beforehand with any country.  There should be nothing in the way of a binding agreement as to how the Army should act or the line we should take in this country. Our Army should be under the control of this Parliament.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another point, which I think it would be advisable to mention in this connection.  There is in this country a certain doubt in the minds of a great many people regarding the relation of the Army to the present Parliament or any Parliament which may succeed it.  I had occasion, on the opening day of this Dáil, to make reference to that point and I should like to refer to it again.  I think we should take an early opportunity, in view of the doubt that exists in the minds of many people, of explaining clearly that the position to be maintained is that there is to be one army in this State and that that army is to be subject to this Parliament; that there is no reason or need for any army distinct from the army maintained under the control of the Executive appointed by this Parliament.  I ask for a declaration from the leader of the Fianna Fáil party&mdash;I should be very glad to have a declaration from him&mdash;on this matter, and I believe such a declaration would tend to increase the stability which is gradually growing in this country.  On the other hand, it has been the experience of many Deputies within the last few months&mdash;especially during the elections&mdash;that the impression got abroad, and was encouraged by many supporters of the present Government, that the Army and the Police should <Col N="1461" /> and would be loyal only to the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, if the Cumann na nGaedheal Party formed a Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">

      <P>I do not want to go down to Mayo or Wexford or Tipperary, or any other place.  I am not making a charge against any prominent Deputy or any representative man.  I say that impression was created. I believe it has been created.  I believe there are many Deputies in the House who will support the contention I make, that that impression got abroad.  I believe that that idea is in the minds of some of the humbler members of the Gárda Síochána and the Army&mdash;that that is their duty.  That, I think, is their belief.  I should be glad if the position were made clear.  I believe it is the duty of the present Government to make it clear.  I have no hesitation in saying that there was talk and whispering going on that if, for instance, the Fianna Fáil Party happened to be returned to power at the last election something catastrophic would occur in regard to the police and the Army.  It was suggested that the Army would resist disbandment, and that there would be all sorts of trouble.  I believe it is the duty of the present Government to make it clear and definite that it is the duty of the Army and the Police to give faithful service to and obey this Parliament no matter who may be in power&mdash;whether it be Fianna Fáil, Labour, Farmers, or Cumann na nGaedheal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt about the Civil Service&mdash;none whatever. Many of the civil servants have served under different governments and have given equally faithful service to all. They have a tradition of service behind them, as it were, to different parties coming into power.  It is not the same in the case of our Army and Police. They are new bodies, bodies who have never served any party or government but one&mdash;the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  Some of them believe that if <Col N="1462" /> that Party go out of power they may possibly have to go out along with them.  Ministers and Deputies may say that that is a foolish belief.  It may be a foolish belief, but the fact that it is foolish does not necessarily mean that it does not exist.  I believe that the Government would be well served and would be doing a good service to the country as a whole, and to the stability of the country, if they made plain that it was the duty of both these bodies to give faithful service and to be obedient to any government in power in this State.  I do not wish to suggest, for a moment, that the Government has not that view, or that the Ministers have any other view than that.  But it is well to express it and emphasise it&mdash; especially now in view of the awkward circumstances in this country.  If that were done, I think it would help to increase the growing stability in the country, just as I believe that a statement from the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, that we would have one army and that any changes in that army would be only made as a result of legislation in this House, would be equally useful at this juncture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am voting for the Second Reading of this Bill without expressing any other view at the moment on the suggestion that has been made than that, in general, the principle seems to be a sound one.  The principle has been equally accepted, as far as I can see, both by the Minister for Defence and by Deputy de Valera.  The principle I refer to is in respect of the lines along which our army ought to be organised. The temporary Act which it is now proposed to continue does not, perhaps, deal with organisation.  I believe an Act would be necessary even if Deputy de Valera's idea as to the army were carried out.  Perhaps Deputy de Valera has read the Act through.  I do not believe he has.  I have not read it through, either.  As far as I could gather from the headings of the chapters, it deals&mdash;except in the effective clause which gives the right to the Executive to set up an army, which clause is necessary no matter what army you have&mdash;with the internal government of the army by officers and that sort of thing.  Its main point is not in connection with the organisation of the Army. <Col N="1463" /> It does not really touch upon how the Army should be organised.  I believe this Act is necessary, in any case, and I cannot, therefore, support the proposal that we should refuse to give the Bill a Second Reading.  If the idea of Deputy de Valera is that which he put forward in respect of a previous measure&mdash;to bring pressure to bear on the Government&mdash;I agree that it is necessary to bring some form of pressure to bear in order to get the Government to hurry up.  But I think that, in this case, delay has its advantages.  I might throw out a suggestion to the Minister that before he finally comes to decisions with regard to the form the Army ought to take and before he puts these decisions into the form of a Bill, to be presented to this Dáil, that he might consider the question of setting up a select committee representative of all parties in the House to consider, in a general way, the lines on which our Army ought to be organised and what the purpose of our Army ought to be. He might, in that way, get suggestions that would be helpful.  I cannot consider anything more harmful than having a scheme of army organisation which would be supported in principle even and largely in detail by only one particular party in the House.  That certainly is a matter on which there ought to be agreement secured from all parties.  I believe the Minister would be well advised if he gave consideration to the suggestion.  I am only throwing it out as a suggestion that he might set up a committee representative of all parties in the House to consider the lines the organisation ought to take.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not yet a member of the Labour Party, and I doubt if they would accept my application if I desired to make one.  All I can say in regard to what Deputy O'Connell has said is that I am like the old lady who was getting rather feeble and was not able to go through the whole of her prayers every night. She was told by the priest that everything was in the intention.  She tied a rosary beads to the head of the bed and she used to look up at them and say, &ldquo;My Lord, them is my sentiments.&rdquo; As far as Deputy O'Connell <Col N="1464" /> has gone with what he has said both in regard to the motion for the Second Reading and the other motion I am in agreement.  It is hardly necessary for me to say to Deputies who have been in previous Dáils that every time this army question came up for discussion I proposed that the standing army should be reduced and that it should be placed upon something in the nature of a territorial or reserve basis.  I was scouted at first by the then Minister for Defence, but I was very pleased to see his colleague, the Minister for Finance, actually stating in his last Budget statement that that was now the considered intention of the Government.  I was also pleased to hear from the present Minister for Defence that that is their intention.  I sincerely hope that they will proceed with that intention.  As Deputy O'Connell has said, we had several intentions expressed in the past by the Executive, but the execution of those is another matter.  I am in favour of a small standing army in this country, but I am not in favour of anything on the scale, size and equipment of our present army.  I think a territorial force would be a good thing for the youth of the country.  I think it would be a good thing for the stamina of the country, and, of course, I am in favour of only one army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point that must be considered is that there should be no permanent army.  The Army is only the servant of the State and it must be brought into existence every year by the State.  Certainly at no longer periods than one year would I be in favour of the creation of anything in the nature of a permanent army.  In regard to what Deputy O'Connell said about the feeling that was abroad concerning the position of the members of the Army and the police forces, I desire to endorse thoroughly his remarks.  I would also add in regard to the civil servants, as far as I am concerned personally, I actually went out of my way during the last two elections to disclaim any suggestion that if ever a party came into power I would be opposed to any of these institutions or members of them being unduly interfered with, because that was the notion abroad.  Even among civil servants&mdash;I will not say <Col N="1465" /> among the older members of the Civil Service, but there is a very large new element in the Civil Service recently recruited&mdash;for some reason or another in large departments like the Post Office and elsewhere I have found the feeling abroad that if any government were to take the place of this Government, they and their jobs were done for.</P>
    <P>I think that Deputy O'Connell's suggestion is a very proper one, because I think it is the duty of the Government to allay these fears and suspicions, and, through their spokesmen, to tell the people of this country, including the members of these public services, that they must be regarded as servants, not of one particular government, but of the State, no matter what that government may be.</P>
    <P>I have really nothing to add to what Deputy O'Connell has stated with regard to my position on these two motions. If there was any possibility of a new organisation being brought into existence, before March, 1928, I might be in favour of supporting the motion, though, as Deputy O'Connell has said, there is nothing very much in substance between the proposal as outlined by the Minister and that of Deputy de Valera.  But we must have an army.  The State must have an army of protection against aggression, whether it is internal aggression or external aggression, and in the meantime I fear that we would not be able to consider adequately any new proposal as to what form it should take.  It is for that reason I shall support the Second Reading, in the hope&mdash;I hope it will not be an unfounded one this time&mdash;that something will be done shortly in the direction of curtailing the existing standing army, and placing the new one, to a large extent, on a territorial basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>From Deputy O'Connell's remarks I must occupy a rather unique position in this House, because I have read the Act.  I read the Act some time ago.  I am prepared to admit that when I was endeavouring to acquaint myself with the constitution of the Free State Army it had nothing to do with the business that is before this House, but I can assure <Col N="1466" /> Deputy O'Connell, having read the Act, I would advise him to vote against it. I am going to do so, at any rate, because I think it is in the best interests of this State that it should not be continued. We are told that this Bill that is now before us is a simple one and it has been repeated from year to year.  It is, I submit, just as important as the original Act of 1923, and as any of the amending Acts introduced since.  It provides, as we know, for the establishment of a standing army, a provisional military force.  I submit that in the circumstances that exist in this country to-day there is no justification for the maintenance of a provisional military force of that nature.  The Minister has told us that within twelve months a Bill will be introduced to make permanent legislation concerning the defence forces of the State.  Deputy O'Connell has pointed out that that is a promise that has been made before, and has not been kept.  It is being made now again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to have information from the Minister as to whether the Bill which he proposes to introduce or which he promises to introduce within twelve months is going to contain the provisions necessary for the establishment of the force which he outlines&mdash;a small permanent standing force, a larger reserve and a much larger volunteer territorial force.  If we could feel certain that that Bill would be introduced within twelve months and would contain proper provisions to bring about a force of that nature it is possible that our attitude towards this Bill might be slightly altered, but the Bill, as it stands at present, is such that we do not feel we could be justified in voting for its continuance.  The military force which exists in this country, the standing army, as was pointed out by Deputy de Valera, would be practically useless to defend the nation against any of the great military powers who under any conceivable circumstances might decide to invade this island.  It is organised on the lines of the military forces on the Continent, a hard shell easily cracked by superior force.  If the real purpose of the defence forces of this State were to defend the island against outside aggression and particularly <Col N="1467" /> against aggression on the part of one Power from which our history has taught us to expect it, an entirely different organisation would be necessary, not a hard organisation that could be cracked with a blow but a soft one on which blows would have little effect, and whose purpose would be, as Deputy de Valera stated, to make it not impossible for an invader to establish himself here but to make it impossible for any outside authority to rule with comfort in this island.  If the force that is to be maintained is intended as a defence force it is useless.  It is too small; it is powerless.  If it is intended as an auxiliary police force, an armed constabulary for the purpose of maintaining internal order only it is too big and certainly much too costly.</P>
    <P>There is another danger which we, as representatives of the people, must take into consideration.  A standing army in the hands of an unscrupulous executive could be made a menace to the liberties and rights of the Irish people. I am not suggesting now&mdash;there is no election on&mdash;that the present Executive is unscrupulous.  I know that is a matter on which there might be a decided difference of opinion in this House.  Personally, and I think I can speak for a number of Deputies on those benches, I consider the term is much too mild.  In any case, the point I want to make is that a standing army in any country, in the hands of an unscrupulous executive, can be used for party purposes and against the interests of the nation.  In this Act which we propose to continue there is one section which provides that the Minister can appoint to commissioned rank in the Army persons other than citizens of the Free State.  Again we are talking of an unscrupulous executive.  An unscrupulous executive can use that section to officer the army with hirelings from other countries with no interest in this country except the pay and the loot they can get out of it, and to use the army thus officered against the people of the State and to maintain themselves in power, if necessary.  The Act also provides that it can be utilised for the prevention and suppression of internal disorder within the State. That is a very dangerous phrase.  Who <Col N="1468" /> is going to decide what constitutes internal disorder, and having decided that, who is then going to fix the exact moment at which the process of preventing internal disorder is going to begin?  Remember, I am merely pointing out the dangers which would arise from this Act being in the hands of an unscrupulous executive, and when we know it can be officered with persons with no national interest in the country, and utilised under the terms of a very loosely-worded section for the suppression of internal disorder, I think we can see that there are motives which would inspire us to oppose this Act other than that the machinery it establishes is not the most efficient possible.</P>
    <P>Again, the present force is a partisan one.  There is no good denying that and saying it is otherwise.  It is.  Its history has made it so.  The whole course of its development has been such that it could not be otherwise.  It was originally formed to fight the Deputies on these benches.  We fought against it, and the spirit of opposition between the Party represented here and the Army in existence has not died.  This Act, if continued, would enable that partisan spirit to be continued.  The Act provides that officers are appointed and hold their commissions at the pleasure of the Executive Council.  They can be removed at any time the Executive Council so decides.  It is obvious that men who are in the positions and who feel they are indebted to the particular Executive on that bench opposite for their positions and continuance in them will develop a partisan outlook.  I cannot say that people on the benches opposite have been very scrupulous in the use of the term &ldquo;government&rdquo; at election times.</P>
    <P>You see &ldquo;Vote Government&rdquo; and a poster of that kind is likely to cause considerable confusion in the minds of the ordinary people.  I would be very much in favour of the introduction of legislation to prevent that happening in future.  I suggest for your consideration that the issuing of a poster of that kind, &ldquo;Vote Government,&rdquo; when it relates to Cumann na nGaedheal government might, in some respect, be taken as contempt for the Constitution.  The point I want to make is this, that unless the force that <Col N="1469" /> exists at present is reconstituted on an entirely different basis and for an entirely different purpose than the one for which this force was formed that partisan spirit is going to continue and the danger of disturbance following a change of government will continue.</P>
    <P>We have been told of the importance of adhering to the principle of one army in the State.  We have always stood by the principle of one army in the State, but it must not be a partisan force.  It must be a national force formed to defend the liberties and rights of the Irish people and open to every Irishman, no matter what his political or national opinions may be, who desires to serve that purpose. There has been, since 1923, a development of ministerial policy obvious which is in the entirely opposite direction. In the 1923 Act there was, for example, an oath or declaration which recruits subscribed to and by which they pledged themselves to defend the country against all enemies whomsoever. That oath was deleted by the amending Act of 1924, and another declaration was substituted by which the officers and men of the Army and recruits joining the Army pledged themselves to maintain this State and the Constitution of this State by law established. I know there are hundreds of suitable young active men in this country who would be only too willing and glad to join a force that was intended to defend this country against all enemies whomsoever but who would not lift their little fingers to defend a constitution imposed on this State by British law or any other means.</P>
    <P>If you want a defence force that is going to be effective in defending the State against outside aggression you have got to give up these little finicky points, and you have got to consider the main thing, which is the defence of the nation, and leave your forces open to everyone who is willing to serve the nation as a soldier in that capacity. There is another small point which, I think, this is the proper place to deal with.  In the amending Act of 1924, in this declaration that I mentioned, a clause was inserted by which the officers and the men of the Army undertook <Col N="1470" /> not to belong to any political organisation or political society.  Now, I am doubtful if the insertion of a section of that kind is in strict accordance with the letter of the Constitution.  The officers and men of the Army are part of the electorate.  They voted in the election of every member of this House. In fact, Deputy Gorey, I think, owes his presence here to the fact that he got a big majority of the military votes in the by-election in Kilkenny.  I do not see why the men who have votes and who have as much to say in the creation of the Parliament of this State as anybody else should not be entitled to associate with others for the purpose of educating themselves, if nothing else, in political matters; and I would suggest, also, that candidates at an election, and political parties who are behind the candidates, should have an opportunity of placing their views before all the electorate, if necessary by a personal canvass of the electors in the barracks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>An advertisement in the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; is one way undoubtedly. I do not know if the ordinary rank and file of the Army read the &ldquo;Independent.&rdquo;  I certainly hope not. But, mind you, I am not to be taken as arguing, or as being taken in favour of a system of that kind by which political candidates and parties can go amongst the members of the Army advocating different political theories.  I believe the Army would be much safer if put upon the same basis as the members of the Civic Guard, and if they had no vote at all, and were merely servants of the State, divorced altogether from matters of political interest.  I think that a very strong case can be made out for the abandonment of the present system of a permanent military force, and the institution of a volunteer force on a territorial basis, such as was mentioned in our amendment and outlined by the Minister in his speech.  He was not sure whether that would be instituted in twelve months or in twelve years, but he corrected himself, I think, and he said twelve months.  We hope so.  I would be glad to hear that it is the purpose of this Bill, which he states <Col N="1471" /> he is to introduce, to provide for such a force.  It would be much more efficient if it were properly instituted, and if the right spirit were behind it; it would be much more effective as a defence force, and as Deputy de Valera pointed out, it would cost much less, and that is a factor which we must undoubtedly take into consideration.</P>
      <P>I will be interested to hear the Minister for Defence when he concludes this debate dealing with this point.  If the present force is merely to be continued indefinitely from year to year, maintained as the Minister said because of some political situation which may possibly arise as he sees it, then we are going to vote against the Bill.  Personally I am certain, and I feel that if the right spirit went into the making of legislation of this kind, if there was a definite indication that the national policy which should be decided by this House, for this portion of Ireland at any rate, was a progressive policy, progressing towards that old ideal of national independence, if we could feel that the government in charge of the State was working towards that end, then you could throw your Army open to every citizen of the State, establish it on the widest possible territorial basis, and with no danger whatsoever of any Executive elected by this House. It has got to be done in the right way, not in the spirit of party, not for the purpose of taking party advantage of the arguments that were used during the recent elections, but for the purpose of establishing in this country an organisation of the patriotic youth, armed and trained to defend the rights and liberties that are common to us all against any possible outside aggression.</P>

      <P>As to the organisation of the Army, as far as I could make out, Deputy de Valera's ideas do not differ a great deal from ours, but they seem to differ a great deal from the ideas of Deputy Lemass. The Army exists for protection against any and every enemy, whether that enemy be outside or inside.  Deputy de Valera suggested that it was to keep down the turbulent Irish in the south of Ireland in the interests of England. <Col N="1472" /> It is to keep down the turbulence in this country that the Army exists, solely and exclusively in the interests of Ireland.  Deputy de Valera propounds what might be called a doctrine of war, the idea being that the only possible enemy of this country in the future is Great Britain.  I often wonder why, as far as we can judge their history, our ancestors&mdash;my ancestors in two ways&mdash;did not fight&mdash;did not generally put up a better fight against my paternal ancestors, that is when the Normans came.  It now strikes me that from the time the Danes had been here there had been de Valera parties, who used say: &ldquo;All our army organisation must be directed against nothing whatever but against the Danes, and we must consider no other possible enemy in the future.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It would be more intelligent for them to have said: &ldquo;Our Army should exist to protect this country against any and every enemy, whether those enemies be Norman-French, Vikings or turbulent Irish, who may be national enemies in their attempts to upset the State.&rdquo;  I said on a previous occasion that I considered it almost impossible or practically impossible that the Irish Army should be pitted against the Army of Great Britain.  I presume in saying that that no matter what party is in power in this country, no matter what Dáil may exist in the future, that the ordinary commonsense and ordinary intelligence would prevail.  I insist upon believing that if the party opposite were to get into power that no matter what they may now say and no matter what they say during election time that even amongst them some vestige of intelligence will assert itself and when it comes to the point they will not pit whatever army they may have, whether a standing army, a territorial army, or such an army as they have in mind, against the greatest Power in the world.</P>

      <P>When I name any individual State I must presume it will not go out of its way to attack this country, and on the Deputy's showing in that case one may assume that it is practically certain that our small army will not be pitted either aggressively or defensively against the army of this great Power which is adjacent to us.</P>
      <P>I do not want to deal with remarks about the Treaty being forced upon us; I might go on dealing with that matter for quite a long time.  The army, as I have said, is a defensive force, a national defensive force against any and every enemy.  It is controlled by this House in the name of the people of this State, and exists solely in the interests of the people of this State, to protect their rights whether they are attacked by enemies outside or armed enemies inside.  Whatever situation may arise, as long as I am in the position that I occupy, and as long as I can persuade this Dáil, the Army will be used for that defensive purpose, and for no other purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to organisation, Deputy de Valera, unlike Deputy Lemass, seemed to realise that even in an army the major portion of it is composed of a territorial force and a reserve force. Deputy Lemass, although he says he has read the Bill, is the only Deputy who really convinces me that he did not read it.  Deputy de Valera realises that you must have a framework, and he suggested that what applies to Switzerland could apply here&mdash;one in ten.  That is about possible.  Deputy de Valera proposed a standing army of about 5,000, which means on a ratio an equipped force of trained and semi-trained men to the number of 55,000. He proposes to equip and maintain such a force for about £1,100,000 annually. I have not gone sufficiently thoroughly into the figures to know whether that is humanly possible.  I do not think it is humanly possible in this country at the moment to bring down the cost of the Army as much as <Col N="1474" /> that.  So far as I am concerned, I cannot make any promise of reducing the cost of the Army by £1,000,000 within one year.  If I attempt to make any such promise I will be promising a thing which would be nationally harmful.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a tendency to think that the Bill, as it stands, commits us exclusively to a standing army, and precludes the possibility of an army organised on the lines suggested. I say it does not.  At the present moment&mdash;it could not have been so a month or two ago&mdash;our Army does consist of a standing army and a reserve. The reserve at the moment is much smaller than the standing army, but the movement towards the reserve is continuous, and is controlled, so that as regards the existing Act, although the Army can consist of a standing army and a reserve, there were certain circumstances under which the Act was drawn up, and there are certain inconveniences in the Act which make it necessary to have a new one.  There is very little change in the Act, and an army organised on the lines set out by Deputy de Valera could actually be run under that Act.</P>

      <P>I have attempted to give accounts of it now and again.  It is a rather difficult situation when one says &ldquo;In the event of a general attack upon this island,&rdquo; and people then very carefully misrepresent what you say.  Following the words &ldquo;In the event of an attack upon this island,&rdquo; someone drags in something about war.  It is difficult to deal with a situation like that when you have a very powerful and well-financed organisation using quite a lot of space in the newspapers carefully to misrepresent what one has said.  I hope that we never will have to use the Army in warfare.  Does it follow that the Army is therefore unnecessary?  I do not think so.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass has told us that Deputy Gorey was elected on the military votes.  Well, it was not the military votes that really put him in; they made up the little balance of difference.  In the same way, although our Army may not be sufficiently great to overcome any of the armies of the great Powers &mdash;and the people across the way there seem to be quite disappointed that we cannot put up an army which would, like the army of Alexander, seek new worlds to conquer&mdash;our Army is not necessarily useless.  Even though the Army is not strong enough to overcome such armies as Alexander led, it is not useless.  Every war has been won, just like the election, by the little number that made the majority.</P>

When one talks about the promises made last year, one must remember that we had two general elections in the meantime and that a whole lot of things happened which tended towards the postponement of measures. Deputy O'Connell hopes that the Irish Free State will be associated with every movement for peace.  I hope so, too. I think we have done our share in that matter.

As far as the influence of the Government is concerned, it is quite possible that the Government, which has shown a certain amount of energy, has put more energy into this than anything else: to create a government machine here&mdash;police, army, civil service, etc.&mdash; which will carry on, no matter what government is in power.  We have been accused of calling ourselves the Government Party.  Since the last election I have seen an advertisement in a newspaper, paid for by the Party opposite, which described us as the Free State Party.  Can a party which calls us the Free State Party turn round and suggest that we are trying to use the Army as a party force?  The Army is the army of the Free State as by law established, and the army of the only Irish State known internationally or that has been known internationally for 100 years.  We have the epithet thrown at us, and rejoice in it, and accept it&mdash;&ldquo;the Free State Party.&rdquo; We are the Party that have stood for the Free State and the Army and the Constitution, and the Army of the Free State will stand for the Free State and be subject to whatever government is legally in power here.</P>

So far as I am concerned, I never in any way tried to create the impression that we had failed in our great objective: to create a police force, an army and a civil service, and all Government services, which will carry on irrespective of what particular government is in power.  I have never failed to make that clear. We have done our best and I believe we have succeeded.  Deputies say that moving on towards a reserve, etc., is not founded on fact.  It is founded on fact, and is actually in operation.  Already something like 1,000 men are in the Reserve&mdash;not quite 1,000 yet I think.  Deputy Redmond suggested that there should be no permanent army&mdash;that it should be brought into existence every year.  We need not go into an argument on that.  That is based on an entirely English view of things.  In this country the Army depends solely upon the Government and the Parliament&mdash;that is the constitutional position here.  In England, theoretically the army exists, and is held in existence, by the King.  That is what makes it necessary, but that remains theory only.</P>

Deputy O'Connell has pointed out, and I have pointed out, that it is so important that the whole Army position collapses if this Bill is not passed and law by the 31st March, or if this Bill is not passed, that another Bill should be passed in the meantime.  The new Bill, like the present Bill, will make provision for the Army as outlined&mdash;that <Col N="1479" /> is to say, an army consisting of three parts.

      <P>Then we come to &ldquo;the unscrupulous executive.&rdquo; The Deputy rather nicely says that there being no election on now he does not suggest that the present Executive is unscrupulous.  I have no doubt that if an election were on to-morrow he would promptly get up and say that the present Executive is unscrupulous. He says that the Army was brought into existence largely against the Deputies opposite.  If he wants proof of the lack of unscrupulousness, of the extreme scrupulousness, tender-heartedness, almost to the point of crime, of the present Executive, there are 57 proofs of it in this House now.</P>

      <P>The Deputy thinks it is a terrible thing that one of the reasons for maintaining the Army was the prevention of suppression of internal disorder.  That is one of the functions of it.  In the event of internal disorder, if the Army is required under existing circumstances, the Army will be used promptly for the suppression and prevention of internal disorder. We are asked who is going to decide what is internal disorder? There is a legal machine; there is this House and the Government elected by <Col N="1480" /> this House; there is this House supreme here to decide whether and when there is internal disorder.</P>

      <P>It might really happen&mdash;it has often happened in history&mdash;that a criminal attempt is made to overthrow the State, and that is exactly the point that is in the Constitution when it says that the whole House must decide except in the case of invasion. In the case of invasion, the Government can use the Army against the invaders even without calling the House together.  In the event of any criminal organisation of sufficient strength and power and armament to threaten this State, obviously if the House is not meeting the Government has one clear duty, and that is to suppress that attempt.</P>

      <P>It is not law in the Six Counties, but I am not going to bother about any more of these interruptions. As long as the present Government is in existence, and as long as this House exists, and as long as the State exists, and as long as Ireland exists, whatever army is established by the State shall maintain the State and the Constitution as by law established, whatever the State may be at that time, or whatever the law or the Constitution may be at that time. Deputy Lemass seemed to regret, though he carefully refrained from saying so definitely, that we cannot have political meetings in all the barracks. There was a wistful note in his voice when he talked about the possibility of meetings in barracks.  They are splendid places for political meetings, but political meetings will not take place there while the present Executive is in power.  Deputy Lemass seemed <Col N="1482" /> to think we were abandoning the permanent standing army.  Neither I nor Deputy de Valera propose to abandon the permanent standing army.  The permanent standing army must be there as long as we have an army, but the difference is that instead of only having a permanent standing army we have a permanent standing army in direct relationship with two other sections of the Army, namely, the reserve and territorial or militia forces.</P>

      <P>I understand &ldquo;nuance&rdquo; in verse and poetry, but I do not understand it in the drafting of Private Bills.  When we bring our Bill along I hope that clarity will be its outstanding feature.  The Bill, when brought forward, will be marked by clarity providing for a standing army, a territorial and reserve force, possibly limiting the power of the Executive as to the extent to which it can raise the standing army, but at the same time allowing a certain amount of latitude. In fact, a Bill that will allow this country to evolve for itself an army maintained for the one purpose for which an army here should exist, namely, for the defence of the lives and property, rights and freedom of the people of this State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJordan" hpid="Mr. M.J. JORDAN Mr. M.J. JORDAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. JORDAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice to-day that I would raise on the Motion for the Adjournment the question of the enforcement of the vaccination laws in the County Wexford.  I do so for the purpose of giving the Minister for Local Government and Public Health and members of the House some idea of the situation that exists in the County Wexford in connection with this matter.  At the outset I would like the House to know that I am not going to argue the question from the anti-vaccination point of view.  Rather, I propose to argue it from the point of view of the expense that will fall on the ratepayers of Wexford if the Minister insists on the County Wexford Board of Health putting the vaccination laws into force.  I might state that the vaccination laws have been in abeyance in the County Wexford for the last twenty years.  As a result of that there is a very large number of defaulters in the county at the present time.  From the medical returns supplied to the Board of Health recently it appears that at the present time there are 17,000 vaccination defaulters in the county.  Personally I am inclined to think that the number is much larger. I should imagine it is nearer to 20,000. My information is that it will cost 1/- to serve a notice on each defaulter. Taking the number of defaulters at 17,000 that will entail an expenditure of £850.  The doctor's fee in each case I am informed is 2/-.  That will amount to £1,700.  If there are to be prosecutions in Wexford, which I believe there will because we have had them before, and I am certain we will have them again, then estimating the cost of them on the cost of the prosecutions previously carried out in the town of New Ross, the ratepayers of the County Wexford will be asked to pay something like £5 per case.  If we <Col N="1487" /> take the number at say five per cent. of the total who refuse to carry out the vaccination laws, and put the cost down at £5 per head the amount involved will be £4,250.  I am doubtful whether in most of those cases after spending all that money, the vaccination laws will be carried out.  I daresay that the position in Wexford is probably different to that in any other county.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. JORDAN Mr. JORDAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JORDAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to know that I am not alone in this.  I am arguing the case purely from the ratepayers' point of view.  We in the County Wexford are hearing every day that the ratepayers are overburdened and that they cannot pay the present rates any longer.  If this Act is going to be enforced in Wexford then the rates in the county are going to go up very considerably. At the present moment the greatest difficulty is experienced in getting in the rates.  If this additional burden is placed on the ratepayers they will find their position an impossible one.  The present position is that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health has issued a threat of mandamus against the County Wexford Board of Health unless they agree to put the Act in force.  The position that we on the Board of Health find ourselves in is that we are not prepared to shoulder this burden and, on the other hand, we do not want to saddle the ratepayers of the county with the cost that will be entailed by the enforcement of the vaccination laws.  That is the position in Wexford at the moment.  In reply to the question which I had on the Order Paper to-day the Minister stated that he had no intention of amending the Act to allow conscientious objectors to go free.  In view of that answer I do not know what sort of position we are going to be put in in the County Wexford, and I am anxious to know what the Minister has to say on the matter.</P>

      <P>Would the Deputy just develop the point as to who is going to bear the expense of an outbreak of <Col N="1488" /> smallpox if that occurs in the County Wexford?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. JORDAN Mr. JORDAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JORDAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact remains that for the past twenty years the vaccination laws in Wexford have been in abeyance and no case of smallpox has broken out.  You cannot say that you will be involved in the cost of an outbreak of smallpox until it occurs, but we know definitely that if the vaccination laws are put in force we will certainly incur costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support what the Deputy has said.  I think the Department should not take up this <i>non possumus</i> attitude.  This is a very exceptional case and a reasonable time should be given in order to get these different parts of the county in which the Act has not been enforced into line with other parts of the country.  The Minister for Finance is very ruthless in collecting income tax, but I doubt if he would demand that 25 years' arrears of income tax should be collected in one year.  He would be prepared, I am sure, to make some concession.  That is really what it amounts to, as far as the ratepayers of County Wexford are concerned.  They are expected to pay for a situation which has been in existence for twenty years.  I think the Minister might consider a progressive and gradual improvement in the situation in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJamesCraig" hpid="Sir JAMES CRAIG Sir JAMES CRAIG">
      <NameTxt>Sir JAMES CRAIG</NameTxt>
      <P>A letter appeared in the &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo; on yesterday from Sir Edward Rogers in connection with smallpox.  He started the letter by saying, &ldquo;Seven million pounds sterling will be the price the nation will have to pay during the year 1928-9 for dealing with smallpox, if the present rate of increase of the disease is continued.&rdquo; He gives figures to show that in 1920-21 the actual number of cases was 226.  They have increased rapidly, until this year the number of cases is 15,000.  If they increase at the same rate for the next couple of years, the number of cases of smallpox occurring in England will be at least 50,000.  The cost of an epidemic of smallpox would be tremendous.  This method of vaccination is undoubtedly the only means of protection against smallpox.  Vaccination is in the nature of an insurance. <Col N="1489" /> If a man pays £5 or £6 a year to protect his house in case of fire, he is not at all anxious that his house should go on fire. If at the end of twenty years he has escaped an outbreak of fire, he is not prepared to stop payment on account of his insurance policy.  I say, therefore, that vaccination is in the nature of an insurance.  I say, furthermore&mdash; I am sure others will agree with me&mdash; that not only is vaccination necessary but re-vaccination is necessary.  If I have time, I will allude to that aspect of the question in a moment.</P>

      <P>There would be no use in my attempting to develop my argument in that time.  All I would like to say is that it would be the greatest possible disaster to public health in the Saorstát if vaccination were allowed to fall into abeyance.  I was talking to a very distinguished County Wexford medical man yesterday and he said he would like to be able to tell those Wexford cranks what he thought of them.  He said he would describe them as nothing but criminal lunatics and that they should be treated as such.</P>

      <P>I am not interested, personally, in the matter, but I would like to give as much weight as my position can give to it.  So far as smallpox is concerned, they will be very sorry in County Wexford if this were allowed to occur.  If an outbreak occurs not only will they be burdened with the cost of hospitals and nurses, but everyone who is in contact with a case will have to be kept apart for sixteen days at least.  That will be a tremendous cost to the country.  If they do not look upon this in the nature of an insurance, I cannot say anything more for them.</P>

      <P>I do not like to contradict <Col N="1490" /> Deputy Craig because he has much more experience of medical matters than I have, but I think if an epidemic of smallpox were to occur in this country at the present time there is no county that would escape so well as Wexford.  The people there know that they are not vaccinated, and if small-pox were to break out they would go immediately and have it done, while people in other counties who have been vaccinated would believe that they were immune, but they are not, because vaccination done in childhood does not prevent smallpox in later years.  Unless we go into this matter properly and, as they do in Germany, have it done every seven years, vaccination is no preventive of smallpox.  Therefore, I think the people of Wexford have shown a little more sense in this matter than some of the lunatics that are trying to enforce it.  As far as the gentleman Deputy Craig referred to is concerned, I am afraid common sense is not all on his side.  The big grievance they have in Wexford is that in England there is a conscientious objection clause; a person can object conscientiously to having his child vaccinated, but here there is no such clause.  That was how this agitation was started twenty years ago to have a conscientious clause inserted in the Irish Act.  It was not inserted.  Deputy Craig will remember a man called Edward Jenner who, in the year 1791, discovered vaccination.  He vaccinated his own child, two years old, and a few years afterwards he injected the child with smallpox to prove that he was right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of Wexford are not like Edward Jenner, they are not prepared to see their children suffer.  They have a conscientious objection to vaccination and want to see a conscientious objection clause introduced in Ireland.  If it were introduced I believe they would be quite satisfied.  I do not know what the numbers are but I think the figures given by Deputy Jordan&mdash;17,000&mdash;is a very big proportion of the population. I know the figure is very high and I know that there is great dissatisfaction. What is more, I know that there is nothing political or what you might call anti-Government in the thing.  I think <Col N="1491" /> the people on all sides object to vaccination. The peculiar thing about it is this: If a man is summoned for not getting his child vaccinated and goes to jail for a week the child is absolved. How can a week in jail for the father prevent the child getting small-pox?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>The position, as Deputy Jordan has pointed out, is a very peculiar one so far as Wexford is concerned.  The number unvaccinated is very high, but 17,000 is certainly large.  The people there have a decided objection to vaccination because of the fact that some children who were vaccinated as far back as twenty years ago are still showing signs of that vaccination. Deputy Craig talked about small-pox and the danger there is if people are not vaccinated.  As far as I am concerned, I am perfectly satisfied that if the towns and cities of Ireland are looked after in a proper manner by the Public Health authorities&mdash;if sanitation is attended to&mdash;there will be no such thing as small-pox in this country. There are big numbers of people in Wexford who have not their children vaccinated.  The Minister knows and a great many people in this House know, that the anti-vaccination propaganda at one time was synonymous with our fight against the British Government.  A great many of the arrears of vaccination were due to that, apart altogether from a conscientious objection.  The Minister should bear that in mind before he enforces his mandamus.  I think the situation as far as Wexford is concerned should be carefully examined.  Certainly it is going to cost the ratepayers a great amount of money, if the calculation made by Deputy Jordan is correct. It would mean more than 2d. in the pound.  Wexford is an agricultural county and the farmers there, as in other parts of the State, are not in a good position at the moment.  So that I think the least the Minister should do would be to reconsider the whole position as far as Wexford is concerned. County Wexford as far as vaccination is concerned is in a state of chaos.  The matter has gone beyond the control of the County Board of Health.  It was a legacy handed over to them from the different Boards of Guardians at the <Col N="1492" /> time of amalgamation, and apart altogether from the question of the people's consciences it is not fair that they should be asked to clear up the mess that was created in the days of the old Boards of Guardians.</P>

During the past 25 years this question has been left in abeyance, and now we are told that there are 17,000 who are not vaccinated.  If this thing is enforced I do not believe that more than 5 per cent. would be vaccinated through the action of the Minister. The majority of them are opposed to vaccination for conscientious and other reasons.  If they are prosecuted at the cost of £5 each case, it will mean £85,000.  That is a burden that the people could not bear.  I think the least the Minister might do is to postpone the enforcement of this Vaccination Act until the coming summer.</P>

      <P>There was no small-pox in some of the counties in England five or six years ago, and what <Col N="1493" /> is the position there now?  The public bodies in the different counties have made statements in regard to the expense they are under, and the hopelessness they feel in fighting small-pox.  If a small outbreak of small-pox occurred in Ireland at the present time it might easily lead to conditions that would be very serious, and might spread very rapidly throughout the country.  On 23rd January, 1926, the &ldquo;Daily Mail&rdquo; reported that an epidemic of small-pox was sweeping over the northern part of the parish of Durham and all efforts of the medical authorities to stem it had failed.  The report gives the number of cases notified in the county in each of the quarters of the previous year.  In the first quarter it was 16, the next 79, then 152, and then 729.  That was in 1925.  There has not been a week since in which Durham has not recorded extra cases of small-pox, both in its urban and rural areas.  Deputy Craig quoted some figures with regard to, I suppose, Britain as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterDeLoughry" hpid="Mr. DE LOUGHREY Mr. DE LOUGHREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE LOUGHREY</NameTxt>
      <P>They referred to a mild form of chicken-pox, as stated in the &ldquo;Daily Mail.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to small-pox in Monmouthshire, where the outbreak is not as great as in Durham and has cost the ratepayers £10,000 in capital expenditure and equipment, while the maintenance of 200 beds for six months will mean another £13,000.  Of the 773 cases reported 173 cases were left on their hands.  It is a mild form, Deputy de Loughrey says, but the position with regard to small-pox is that while you have light forms of small-pox in different parts of the world with the exception of one case in Switzerland, it is never associated with the more virulent type. It has been found in Detroit, where a mild form of small-pox existed for a number of years, that it developed into the virulent type and, as far as we can be advised by medical men to-day, we have no assurance that the mild form when existing in any particular area is not going to develop into the virulent form.  In Detroit there were only 17 deaths among the 4,631 cases reported from 1915 to 1923, giving a case mortality of 3.7 per 1,000; in 1924 there <Col N="1494" /> were 163 deaths among 1,610 cases; 124 of these cases were of the virulent type, all but one with fatal issue.  We have the responsibility of carrying out the vaccination laws.  On an occasion like this raising a matter in this form gives no one a fair opportunity of dealing with it.  It has not been suggested, in any kind of logical way, that the medical basis upon which our vaccination laws are framed is unsound and that is the first thing that ought to be argued here before we are asked to relax in the administration of the vaccination laws.</P>
      <P>We are here in the happy position that since perhaps 1908 we have had only 11 cases of small-pox, and owing to the vigilance of our Public Health Authorities these cases have been dealt with without the infection, to the extent of creating disease, extending to a second person, but Britain, during last year, if we except Spain and Russia, for which we have no particulars, has had 90 per cent. of the small-pox that existed in Europe.  Living as we are with our ports in constant communication with Great Britain, we must certainly regard seriously the presence of this extensive and dangerous outbreak of small-pox in Britain and we would, in the Department of Local Government, be neglecting very serious duties to the county if we did not point out the danger or left anything undone to secure that the vaccination laws were administered to the greatest possible extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that the administration of the laws in Wexford would cost a considerable amount and figures have been quoted with regard to New Ross. I do not agree that the vaccination laws have been in abeyance there for 20 years.  There has been a certain amount of agitation against vaccination in Wexford for some time past and there are at least 8,000 odd cases in which the dispensary medical officers have not got tired of recording&mdash;they may be the most recent cases.  The medical officer gets 2/- for every vaccination that is carried out.  In every case in which notice has to be served on a person where that person does not get his child vaccinated during the statutory period it costs 1/-.  Where there are legal <Col N="1495" /> expenses that is another matter.  But in January, 1925, the Urban District Council took over the administration of vaccination from the Board of Guardians of New Ross.  New Ross has a population of 5,009 and the average yearly number of births is 112.  Since 1925 the Board of Public Health has endeavoured to have the vaccination laws administered there and 708 successful primary vaccinations have been done.  There have been some legal expenses in the case of 38 defaulters prosecuted recently.  The total legal expenses, in connection with vaccination since January, 1925, including the 38 defaulters in New Ross, were £21 14s 7d. So that the cost of having the vaccination laws put into force properly in Wexford is not going to be excessive. There is no reason why, if it is clearly shown that there is a danger in our present circumstances here because of the position with regard to small-pox in Britain, the Wexford people are not going to be as sensible as any other people in the country.</P>
    <P>While the point has been raised that people, when they grow up, get over their first vaccination and are inclined to get small-pox, at any rate the childhood period is a dangerous period.  It is worth noting in connection with the present outbreak in England and Wales that in 1926 there were 10,141 cases of small-pox.  An analysis of the figures shows that complete immunity against the disease was conferred by vaccination under the age of 12 years, and that no infants or young children who had been vaccinated were attacked by small-pox.  Indeed, such is the efficacy of infantile vaccination that only 8 children, who have been successfully vaccinated, contracted the disease under the age of 15 years, whereas amongst the unvaccinated <Col N="1496" /> children of the same age period the disease developed in 4,840 with fatal results in seven cases.  If we are not in the frame of mind that we are prepared to follow France and Germany in having adult vaccination at a particular period, we can be assured that infantile vaccination is going to protect the children of the country up to the age of 12 years practically completely against the danger of small-pox.  The cost is very heavy, as I have mentioned in connection with the Monmouth case, and you have costs for medical fees, special nurses, clothing destroyed, and clothing of contracts destroyed.  You have the person attacked laid up from 3 to 12 weeks, and the person who is only a contact put into isolation from 12 to 23 days.  It is all very well to feel you are not going to have an outbreak simply because you have had only 11 cases considering the number of years since that time.  Within the last two years you have had a serious situation brought about in Britain, and we have to realise in the way small-pox is carried that we can very easily find a number of cases springing up in our midst, brought over from England, which only developed when the persons were here in this country. We have a duty to the people to carry out.  We are certainly prepared to carry out that duty, and we ought to stop any kind of loose talk.  If there is a feeling that there is not a sound medical basis to our present vaccination laws we ought to have the position stated from the medical point of view.  Do not let us act blindly in the dark, because someone said anti-vaccination was always connected with the national movement in Ireland.</P>
