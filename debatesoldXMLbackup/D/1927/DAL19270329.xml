      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he is aware that a large number of prosecutions have been taken against owners of dogs in County Limerick for not having them licensed before the 31st December, 1926; that notices were not served on the owners of dogs of the change of term from the financial year to the calendar year; that it was the custom formerly to have posters put up in public buildings and other prominent places for at least a month before the expiration of the financial year; and whether he will instruct the superintendents of the Gárda Síochána not to press the charges against those who take out licences before the 31st March, 1927.</P>

      <P>I have ascertained that 50 prosecutions have been instituted against the owners of unlicensed dogs in County Limerick since the 1st January last.  I am aware that many owners of dogs were ignorant of the fact that dog licences expired on the 31st December and not on the 31st March as formerly and I have accordingly issued instructions to the Gárda not to institute proceedings in any case where the failure to pay the duty was not due to a desire to evade or challenge the law and where the licence is taken out within one week after a warning.</P>

As I indicated on that occasion, should a scheme of pensions for secondary teachers be accepted by the Dáil, it may be found possible to extend the provisions of the scheme to older teachers who are eligible to share in its benefits, and who retire, with the sanction of the Minister for Education, after the date of that announcement.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that the Dublin Corporation has dismissed 150 employees from its Electricity Department, stating that the reason for dismissal is the refusal of the Minister to sanction the continuance of the normal development of the undertaking in cable-laying and other services; whether the Minister proposes to take any action in the matter, and whether provision for the payment of compensation to employees so dismissed is made in the Electricity (Supply) Bill, 1927.</P>

I have received particulars of new works which it is desired to carry out and a decision regarding them will be arrived at without undue delay.  It will be appreciated that it is necessary for me to ensure that costly works are not carried out at this stage which would be useless or unsuitable when a supply of electricity from the Shannon becomes available two years from now.</P>

      <P>It is a fact, as stated in the question, that an Order in Council was issued on the 24th July, 1925, providing for the constitution in Northern Ireland of new fishery districts in place of those formerly existing of which a portion is now in An Saorstát.</P>
      <P>My Department was aware that the splitting up of the districts referred to followed inevitably from the Treaty, and the boards of conservators of the districts were also aware of it.</P>
      <P>The property of boards of conservators consists only of money collected by way of licence duties, rates and fines, and in some cases grants from the State, from year to year, which have to be expended on the protection of the fisheries in these districts.</P>
      <P>Any attempt to ascertain precisely the amounts in the hands of the former boards at the date when they ceased to exist, or to provide for mutual debits and credits on this account between the Saorstát and Northern Ireland would require reciprocal legislation in the two countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill comes before us from the Seanad, and I do not know to what extent it is pertinent to advert here to the fact that, in the Seanad, the Bill was passed by the casting vote of the Cathaoirleach.  I want to oppose the Bill on behalf of the Executive Council, and in doing so I would like to advert, in the first instance, to certain objections which may be considered accidental rather than fundamental to the project embodied in the Bill.  There is, as we know, a considerable divergence of <Col N="397" /> view amongst the subscribers to the £40,000 that is on hands, and there is as we all know, a considerable diversity of opinion amongst the surviving ex-servicemen as to the desirability of proceeding with this particular project. Two prominent representative ex-servicemen, Senator General Sir Bryan Mahon, and Senator General Sir William Hickie opposed the Bill in the Seanad.  As to the point of view of the subscribers.  I would like to refer Deputies to a letter that appeared in the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; of the 11th May, 1926, signed by Lord Glenavy, and it might be proper to read to the Dáil certain extracts from that letter:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In view of the evidence I have received of the increasing hostility, on the part of subscribers to Lord French's War Memorial Fund, to the contemplated diversion of part of the funds to the conversion of Merrion Square into a public park, I feel that I have a certain responsibility to them in the matter by reason of the fact that at Lord French's request I presided at the representative meeting in the Viceregal Lodge at which the fund was inaugurated. The hostility I refer to is not against the project in itself, which, as a municipal enterprise, has much to commend it to the citizens of Dublin provided they are willing to pay for it, but is due to the feeling that, in view of the express purpose for which the subscriptions were invited, and received from every county in Ireland, any such allocation of the money, in whole or in part, would involve a wholesale departure from this purpose and a substantial injustice to those for whose benefit the money was subscribed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;There can be no room for doubt as to the governing purpose on this point, because, at the meeting to which I have referred it was distinctly understood and agreed that the object of the fund was to perpetuate the memory of our fallen soldiers in a form that would, at the same time, benefit their surviving comrades.  Concrete expression was subsequently given to this definite purpose when it was resolved to utilise the fund in the erection or <Col N="398" /> acquisition of suitable premises in the City of Dublin, to be used as a hostel for British soldiers and ex-servicemen. The Treaty and its consequences put an end to this project, and also greatly embarrassed the Committee in their selection of a suitable alternative; and I am satisfied that it was only as the result of a full and conscientious inquiry that they finally selected the Merrion Square scheme.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I was not myself a member of this Committee, and cannot recall the sequence of events in connection with this fund for the last four years; but, so far as I can recollect, no attempt was ever made, by convening a general meeting of subscribers or by circular letter to those of them who could be traced, to ascertain their views upon this scheme.  At the same time, it is only fair to the Committee to state that during the long period occupied by them in giving effect, to the scheme and applying to the court for its sanction, they were not, so far as I am aware, challenged by any public expression of dissatisfaction on the part of subscribers. But while this has to be admitted, in justification of the action of the Committee, the explanation is probably to be found in the fact that, until publicity was recently given to them by the application in the courts, many subscribers were wholly unacquainted with the details of the scheme, and, in particular, were unaware that the conversion of Merrion Square into a public park was to be carried out at the expense of the fund.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In this respect my position was different, as I was acquainted with the general details of the scheme.  I never regarded it with favour, and entertained, and still entertain, the gravest doubts as to the jurisdiction of the court&mdash;unless possibly upon the clearest evidence of its approval by the subscribers as a whole&mdash;to sanction such a wide departure from the original purpose, upon the faith of which the money was subscribed; but, in the absence of any general complaint by the subscribers, I was prepared to acquiesce in the Committee's <Col N="399" /> scheme, provided they could prevail on the court to sanction it. I am now, however, satisfied from the volume of complaint that has reached me that this scheme is not only distasteful to some of the most generous subscribers to the fund, but is also greatly resented by those in a position to voice the feelings of the relatives of our dead heroes and their surviving comrades, in whose interest the fund was originated.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In this state of facts, and the light of my own responsibility in the matter, I would respectfully suggest to the Committee to delay further action until effective steps have been taken to ascertain the wishes of the subscribers as a whole, and to arrive at a solution which would not so directly violate the purpose, and trust for and upon which the fund was invited and subscribed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That letter voices the discontent and disagreement that existed amongst those who subscribed the £40,000 that it is proposed to devote to this project of the Memorial in Merrion Square. As it was said, following on the discussion in the other House, it is questionable whether it is wise or proper to proceed with a project of this kind, in the absence of something in the nature of substantial unanimity amongst those who subscribed the funds.  And when in addition to the sharp diversity of view amongst the subscribers you have also a strong difference of opinion amongst the surviving ex-servicemen, I think the case against proceeding with the project is complete.</P>
    <P>I refer to these objections as accidental and they are accidental so far as my personal objection and the objection of the Executive Council are concerned.  This money was subscribed by prominent people throughout the country to commemorate those who died in the Great War as it seems agreed to call it.  The original proposal was that there would be a hostel established here in the capital, dedicated to the memory of those men, to be used by the British soldiers and ex-servicemen of the Great War.  I remember when that project was <Col N="400" /> mooted in or about the year 1920, reflecting that it was something of an irony that men who joined the British Army and fought in the War to the slogan of the freedom of small nations were to have their memories perpetuated by a glorified canteen for an army of occupation in this country.  That project fell through; as Lord Glenavy remarks in his letter, the Treaty and its consequences rendered that particular project unattainable, and it became a question of searching for an alternative scheme.  The scheme that is embodied in this Bill is to set up a Memorial in Merrion Square, to dedicate the Square and the Memorial to the memory of those who fell in the Great War, and to have the Square open to the general public.  I believe that the considerations which I have mentioned ought to be sufficient to prevent the Dáil passing this Bill.  But I want to say that to my mind they are not the objections on which I personally would wish to base my opposition to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I believe that to devote Merrion Square to this purpose would be to give a wrong twist, as it were, a wrong suggestion, to the origins of this State. It would be a falsehood, a falsehood by suppression of the truth and by a suggestion of something that is contrary to the truth.  I want Deputies to picture the effect on the minds of strangers coming into this State and visiting this capital.  You have a square here, confronting the seat of the Government of the country, and it is proposed to devote that square to this purpose.  I say that any intelligent visitor, not particularly versed in the history of the country, would be entitled to conclude that the origins of this State were connected with that park and the memorial in that park, were connected with the lives that were lost in the Great War in France, Belgium, Gallipoli and so on.  That is not the position.  This State has other origins, and because it has other origins I do not wish to see it suggested, in stone or otherwise, that it has that origin.</P>
    <P>I want it to be understood that I speak in no spirit of hostility to ex-servicemen, qua ex-servicemen.  Two members of my family served throughout <Col N="401" /> that war&mdash;one who did not survive, in the British Army, and another who did, in the Navy&mdash;and so it will be understood that it is in no feeling of hostility to those who were through that war in the ranks of the British Army that I oppose this scheme; but this proposal, if it is proceeded with, means that you are to have here, straight in front of the seat of the Government of the country, a park monument dedicated to the memory of those men.  I object to that because the fulfilment of such a project suggests that it is on that sacrifice that this State was reared.  No one denies the sacrifice, and no one denies the patriotic motives which induced the vast majority of those men to join the British Army to take part in the Great War, and yet it is not on their sacrifice that this State is based, and I have no desire to see it suggested that it is. We have to go back a bit to get our perspective of this proposal.  We have to take really the decade leading up to the war to remember the political position of this country from about 1908, or thereabouts, on to 1914.</P>
    <P>We had our parliamentary representatives in Westminster.  They held a particular strategical position in that assembly, and by the strength of that position they were able to arrive at a particular agreement with the British Government of the day.  That position was watched with intense interest by many in Ireland, and I think that many in Ireland decided to form their considered view of the efficacy of constitutional action, as it was called, the efficacy of parliamentary agitation, on the result.  Parliamentary action was to be tried out.  It was to be tried out under the fairest possible conditions. It was to be tried out under a particular set of circumstances which might not arise again in a generation&mdash;a balance of power held by the Irish Parliamentary Party in the British House of Commons.  We watched that game played out.  We watched that situation develop.  We saw the Government getting through many of its major measures, and there were those who thought, as each such measure went through, that the grip of the Irish Parliamentary Party must be to some extent, <Col N="402" /> greater or less, relaxing.  Accordingly, as each big measure of the Government programme went through, and went through with the support of the Irish Parliamentary Party, then there were those who held the view that the grip was looser.  Constitutional action, parliamentary agitation, was played out within those years leading up to the war, and we saw strange things.  We saw the British Constitution crack and break under the strain of that paltry extension of local government. We saw the law flouted openly and the Government, with a Parliamentary majority, cowering before the challenge.</P>
    <P>We saw arms imported into the North of Ireland, and the whole administration held up, so that that measure could never become operative law. Those who had watched the beginning of that situation with interest, with tense interest, were losing day by day their faith in the efficacy of constitutional action, and day by day a lesson was being burned into their brain by British statesmen, by the Conservative Party of Great Britain and their adherents in Ireland, that direct action was the winning card.  If ever man set out to teach people that lesson, the Opposition in the British House of Commons during those years, and their wing on this side of the Channel, seemed to have that end in view.  Here was a measure introduced into the House of Commons with a parliamentary majority to back it.  Here were people threatening to kick the King's Crown into the Boyne, to lynch British Ministers on London lamp-posts, to smash and trample on their own Constitution rather than have that measure become law.</P>
    <P>Then we narrowed on to the war situation of 1914.  We had our talk of political dismemberment; we had our talk of partition; we had our conference on the less or more of partition; we had the shelving of the whole issue, the hanging up of the Bill until after the war, when that whole issue was to be re-opened.  The horse was to live, and it would get grass after the war.  The horse, not unwisely, as I see it, decided that it would have a bid for grass before the end of the war.  Someone said, or wrote, that somehow, sometime, and <Col N="403" /> by somebody, revolutions must be begun. A revolution was begun in this country in Easter, 1916.  That revolution was endorsed by the people in a general election of 1918, and three years afterwards the representatives of the Irish people negotiated a Treaty with the British Government.</P>
    <P>It is on that Treaty won in that way that this State and its Constitution are based and I submit to Deputies it is not wise to suggest that this State has any other origin than those.  Let men think what they will of them; let men criticise them and hold their individual viewpoints, but those are the origins of the State.  It would be lacking in a sense of truth, in a sense of historical perspective, a sense of symmetry, to suggest that the State has not those origins, but that it is based in some way on the sacrifice of those who followed the advice of the Parliamentary representatives of the day and recruited in great numbers to the British Army to fight in the European War.  Fifty thousand Irishmen died in France.  I hope that the memory of those men and their sacrifice, and the motives of their sacrifice will always have respect and reverence in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In that connection I would like to say that I deprecate profoundly the mentality of either side that would like to make of the 11th November a Twelfth of July.  I hope there will always be respectful admiration in the minds of Irishmen and Irishwomen for the men who went out to France and fought there and died there believing that by so doing they were serving the best interests of their country, but I do not want to see the little park in front of this State's seat of Government dedicated to the memory of those who fell in the Great War.  To do that would suggest that there is the connection, there is the link, there are the roots from which this State has sprung, but those are not the roots.  If it were another park, Fitzwilliam Park, or the park in Parnell Square, my objection personally would be considerably less than it is to the project embodied in the present Bill.  You <Col N="404" /> have a division amongst the subscribers; you have acute division amongst the ex-servicemen, and if there were no other reasons these are reasons against proceeding with the Bill; but the reasons I would prefer to give as my own, and the reasons I am authorised to give as the reasons of the Executive Council, are not those but an objection to have this park here, near by the seat of Government, dedicated to that purpose.  Other suggestions were made in the Seanad, suggestions that would redound more to the benefit of surviving ex-servicemen. I would consider it presumption to dictate to those who contributed this £40,000, or to the Committee, as to how they should use it, and I prefer simply to take the line that with regard to this particular project my vote must be a negative vote.</P>

      <P>&mdash;history of the affairs of this country from the year 1908 onwards, but I was glad to hear in the concluding portion of his remarks that personally he, at any rate, is not against a national War Memorial as such.  I must confess that I regret the attitude of the Executive Council as expressed by the Vice-President in regard to this particular measure.  I think the Minister for Justice is labouring under a complete misapprehension if he thinks it was the idea either of the promoters of this scheme or the subscribers to this fund that the erection of a memorial, which should be the outcome of both, would in any way be meant to suggest anything whatsoever about the origin of this State.  That is certainly far from my mind.  I am not going to follow the Minister in arguing the point as to the origin of this State; I am not going to show where possibly I may disagree with him, but I want it to be clearly understood on my own behalf, and I should imagine on behalf of subscribers to this fund, that it was never their intention that the erection of this <Col N="405" /> memorial should in any way suggest what was the origin of this State.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of referring this Bill to a Joint Committee of the Dáil and Seanad, which is what we are asked to do, to investigate the details of this scheme.  On every ground I think it is right and proper the Bill should be facilitated by this House.  In the first place, it is a Private Bill, and it is promoted by trustees at the expense of the Trust itself and under the direction of the High Court, which fact in itself should not be lost sight of by individual Deputies.  The Bill seeks legislative facilities for what must be described as a proper transaction, for the purchase of property from willing vendors with the object of presenting that property to a public authority, that public authority being willing and anxious to accept the property and to hold it as a gift dedicated to the public use for ever.  In other words, the promoters of this Bill have adopted the very course the promoters of any Private Bill would have adopted, and, further, being trustees they have sought and received the considered views of the High Court of this State upon it.  It is upon those views, and in view of the High Court's decision, that they are proceeding.  They have complied with all the necessary Standing Orders which entitle them to get this Bill passed.  I submit that unless some great principle or question of public policy is involved the Bill should not be rejected.  I am not concerned so much with the details of the proposed Bill, because that is a matter for Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But I am concerned with the nature of the opposition to the Bill, and especially with the arguments put forward by way of opposition.  I ask Deputies what good cause has been shown so far, either by way of principle or public policy, to warrant our rejection of this Bill?  What are the grounds of the opposition to it?  I am not going, at this stage&mdash;I do not think it is the occasion&mdash;to enlarge upon the great part that Ireland played in the Great War; I am not going to do so because I think that it would not perhaps be altogether relevant to the actual subject-matter of discussion.  But let us <Col N="406" /> get down to the facts: Ireland did play a great part in the Great War.  As stated by the Minister for Justice, over 50,000 of Ireland's sons were killed in the Great War.  Whether taking part in that was right or wrong, I submit, does not enter into our consideration this afternoon, but the fact that 50,000 Irishmen died does, and a large body of the relatives, friends and sympathisers of the men who died subscribed a fund of between £40,000 and £50,000 for the purpose of commemorating their deaths. The means whereby they had intended to do so have disappeared because it is not now possible to carry them into effect owing to the course of political affairs in the meantime.  That being so, the trustees of the fund, after going through lists of various schemes, arrived definitely at this Merrion Square one, and in order to safeguard themselves as trustees they approached the High Court and asked for its decision upon the matter.  The High Court decided rightly or wrongly, but there at any rate is their decision, that this was a proper method of carrying out the trust, and it is on that decision, and because of that decision, that the promoters of this Bill have come to the Oireachtas to ask to have it passed.</P>
    <P>Now this money&mdash;this sum of between £40,000 and £50,000&mdash;seems large, but it is not State money; it is money that has been subscribed by the surviving relatives and friends of the deceased.  It is their own money, and they have asked that it should be used for their own purposes.  They are only asking for ordinary facilities to carry out a scheme approved by the Court. I think the Minister for Justice himself would admit that they should be entitled, everything else being equal, as citizens of this State to have that money utilised for their own purposes. The question, I think, that is really for the consideration of the Dáil is: why should not this money, belonging as it does to a certain body of subscribers, be spent as the subscribers desire, or as the trustees and the High Court have held that the trust requires? I certainly do not imagine that those who oppose the Bill ask that this Dáil shall, by their action to-day. <Col N="407" /> openly, avowedly and publicly repudiate the action of those who fought and died on the side of the Allies.  I cannot believe it.  I believe it is clear to everyone who has at heart the ultimate re-union of our country that what is needed most to-day is a policy of appeasement and of reconciliation to bring about the effacement of past feuds and to make way, if we can, for a proper and healthy national development. I suggest most seriously to Deputies&mdash;I want it to be understood that I do so in no partisan spirit whatever&mdash;that the best means by which that appeasement can be brought about is on the basis of agreement amongst all who in different spheres and in different circumstances fought for Ireland in different fields of battle and on different occasions, to tolerate and facilitate the commemoration, without offence to either side, of their respective dead.</P>
    <P>What is the meaning of this Bill? The promoters want to spend the voluntary subscriptions amounting to this large sum of money in Dublin because it is the capital of our country, and they wish to spend it in making a noble and a valuable gift to the municipality of Dublin&mdash;a gift that, to my mind, will be priceless as well as health-building.  It will be for the benefit not only of Dublin's public but of Dublin's poor, and the children of Dublin's poor.  I ask is there anything wrong in that?  The promoters might have taken this money to Belfast.  I do not know but that if this Bill is thrown out to-day that the money will not be given, but will be expended elsewhere.  I cannot conceive that any representatives here from Dublin, certainly from Dublin City, or indeed any Labour representatives from any part of the country, would be willing that this great chance of benefiting both Dublin itself and especially the poor of Dublin should now be turned down and cast aside.</P>
    <P>The proposal is that for the mere sum of £800, which is practically nothing, considering the benefit that is to be derived from it, there is to be 14½ acres of now a closed park known as Merrion <Col N="408" /> Square handed over until evermore to the authorities, whoever they may be in the future&mdash;to the present authorities at any rate&mdash;of the municipality of Dublin for the benefit of the people of Dublin.  I think that the scheme in itself, from every point of view, is probably better than even the schemes put forward from various quarters for the temporary relief of surviving ex-servicemen, because this would be, if it were now passed, not only a lasting and permanent benefit but an actual health-giving advantage to the city of Dublin at large.  What are the grounds of the opposition? The grounds, so far as I can see, are threefold.  First, it is said that the ex-servicemen themselves do not want it. Secondly, it is said that Merrion Square itself is an unsuitable place&mdash; this was an argument used in the Seanad&mdash;because it would not be right and proper or indeed suitable that the public demonstration should be held there upon what is known as Remembrance Day, and the third objection, I am afraid, especially from the speech from the Minister for Justice this afternoon, is that in effect, there should be in no conspicuous place in Dublin a National War Memorial at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that later on.  As regards the first, it is said that the ex-servicemen do not want it.  From what I can gather the very contrary is the case. It is true, as the Minister for Justice has said, that two ex-Generals of the British Army opposed it in the Seanad, one voting against it and the other speaking, but not voting, against it. With respect to these gentlemen, I submit they do not represent the bulk of the ex-servicemen in this country.  The organisation that Senator General Hickie speaks for and of which I am a member, on one occasion after circulars had been sent round to their various branches, decided unanimously in favour of this scheme.  It was only at a rather sparsely-attended meeting, and not after circulars had been sent especially in this regard, that the resolution <Col N="409" /> was passed suggesting that the money might be utilised otherwise, and since that resolution was passed I and a number of others who took part in the late war actually published an appeal to ex-servicemen.  We have received thousands&mdash;I cannot say at the moment how many, but certainly thousands&mdash;of answers from all over the country in favour of the present scheme.  Some of the largest branches of the British Legion, notably the Limerick Branch, comprising over 400 members; the Waterford Branch, comprising 300 members, the Sligo Branch, the Dungarvan Branch, the Loughrea Branch, 53 members of the Staff of the British Ministry of Pensions, 22 employees of the Cork Electric Tramways, and 60 employees in the Royal Hospital&mdash;pensioners here in Dublin&mdash; want this Memorial, and I could go through a long list to prove that the statement that ex-servicemen do not want this Memorial is far from the truth, or the statement that they are seriously divided upon it is not quite accurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the second class of objection, namely, that this Square itself would not be suitable for what is known as Remembrance Day, I would like to point out that it was never suggested that it was in the minds even of the trustees or the promoters of this scheme that this Square should be used for that purpose.  Indeed, Senator Jameson, when speaking in the Seanad, pointed out that he would be prepared&mdash;I am sure also the other trustees would&mdash;and indeed the Joint Committee would have the power to take the action whether the trustees were prepared to accept it or not, to have inserted a clause in the Bill providing that no such demonstration should be allowed to take place.  It is not suggesting too much that such a provision would be enabled to be enforced just as much in regard to Merrion Square as it is at present in regard to St. Stephen's Green.  There you have one of the most beautifully kept parks in the world&mdash;a credit to Dublin or any capital city&mdash;in which there is never anything in the nature even of a political demonstration.  I suggest that Merrion Square could be <Col N="410" /> just as strictly kept for the purpose for which it was opened, namely, free and accessible use by the public and especially by the poor public of the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Now, in regard to the third objection, I am afraid, listening to the remarks of the Minister for Justice, that that seems to be really the root objection to this scheme.  It is that Merrion Square should not be handed over to the municipality of Dublin for the benefit of the citizens of Dublin to commemorate the 50,000 Irishmen who fell in the War because it would be a War Memorial.  I must confess I was not very much impressed with the Minister's argument that he would be prepared to let Fitzwilliam Square be handed over.  Parnell Square, or any other square in the City of Dublin, but not Merrion Square because by the opening of Merrion Square to the public for the purpose of a War Memorial it would, to his mind, suggest to any stranger coming to Dublin that it was the 50,000 men who died in the War that brought about the present State in which we are living.</P>
    <P>I do not think for a moment that such an idea could ever enter into the heads of any such strangers and certainly not any of the inhabitants of this country.  Is it suggested that because there is a memorial at the corner of Stephen's Green to the Dublin Fusiliers who died in the Boer War that the people of Ireland, or even a majority of them, were in favour of that war? Nothing of the kind.  There is a monument in the very centre of our city, probably the most prominent place in the commercial and residential quarters of Dublin, to a Dublin regiment who took part in a war which nobody in their senses would suggest had the approval even of a very small percentage of the Irish people.  Does anybody coming to Dublin and looking at that gate and at that memorial think that the action of these men had anything to do either with our history in the past or with our future?  Similarly I suggest that if anyone was to come to Dublin and see a beautiful open public square in place of the wretched and enclosed park which you have now in Merrion Square, and if they perchance saw by <Col N="411" /> the inscription on any of the gates that it was dedicated to the 50,000 Irishmen who shed their blood in the honest belief that they were dying for Ireland, it would not enter their minds that it was because of the action taken by those men that we are in the position which we find ourselves in to-day.  With all respect to the Minister, I confess that I do not see the force or gravity of that argument.</P>
    <P>In spite of the decision come to by the Executive Council, which I very much regret, I would appeal to the Government, and especially to the President, to reconsider that decision.  Let it not go forth that this memorial project is being turned down by the Dáil, especially at the direct instance of the Executive Council.  As I said before, I do not want to approach this subject in a contentious way.  I am at one with the Minister that respect should be paid to all our dead.</P>
    <P>As to the question of the right of those people to have a memorial. I should like to ask one question. Are the surviving British ex-servicemen to be regarded as citizens of this State, with equal rights with any other citizens, or are they not?  If they are to be so regarded, I say that they should have, and that their friends and relatives and sympathisers should at least have equal rights in regard to this or any other matter as any other section of the community.  Therefore, it would be far more becoming and more in the interest of future appeasement and reconciliation if the Government would let this measure go to the Joint Committee to be set up as representing the two Houses, and let that Committee hear all the evidence in regard to the wishes of the subscribers on the one hand and of the ex-servicemen on the other.  If it is suggested that the ex-servicemen do not want this, then it will be for that Committee to hear evidence upon the subject and to decide for themselves.  I do not believe for a moment that the subscribers are opposed to this memorial, in spite of what Lord Glenavy said in his letter, because Lord Glenavy in this regard, as in many others, I do not think represents anyone but himself.  Lord Glenavy <Col N="412" /> wrote a letter to the newspapers on his own behalf and not on behalf of any of the subscribers.  If the subscribers were also given a chance of giving evidence before this Joint Committee, the Committee would be able to come to a conclusion whether the ex-servicemen desired this and also whether the subscribers desired it.  They would be able sensibly and reasonably to review the whole situation, even from the point of view laid down by the Minister as the chief objection to the Bill, namely, whether the handing over of this Square to the municipal authority for the benefit of Dublin would be taken as a challenge as to the origin of this State.</P>
    <P>In spite of what the Minister said I cannot refrain from appealing to the Government to allow this Bill to proceed as any other Private Bill would procced.  That is not asking anything out of the ordinary.  Why should not this Bill be given the same opportunity as any other Private Bill?  Why should an attempt be made in the Dáil to strangle it at its birth and leave the impression outside, as I am sure the impression will be left, unfortunate as it may be, that this Dáil is really repudiating the action of certain sections of the people of Ireland in taking the side of the Allies in the Great War? Is the Dáil to be asked to take that step?  It is an injurious step which will, I think, create a nasty feeling elsewhere outside the Free State, especially in view of the recent work done by Ministers at the Imperial Conference in England, and more especially in view of the fact that the Vice-President was asked by the President to represent him at the ceremonial at the Cenotaph in Whitehall which took place on Remembrance Day.  I think that it will be injurious to the future reconciliation and bringing together of those who in the past may have been torn asunder, and I do most earnestly ask the President and the Executive Council to reconsider their decision. and, if possible, to allow this Bill to proceed like any ordinary Private Bill. In doing that they will not be subjecting themselves to any taunt of in any way approving of the action of those 50,000 men who died in the war.  Nobody <Col N="413" /> is asking them to do any such thing.  It is merely asking that simple justice should be done both as regards the promoters of the Bill, the subscribers to the fund and the object in view, which nobody I think can deny is a most commendable one, namely, commemoration of the dead.</P>
    <P>It is to my mind a far more serious matter than may appear at the moment.  To a large extent it is a matter of State policy, I am not saying that there is any malice on the part of the Executive Council in the action they have taken, but if this is to be turned down now once and for all it will be a long, long day before the effect of that action will be blotted out.  It will leave a very bad impression indeed on our fellow-countrymen in the North and also on the people of Great Britain, both of whom I hoped and believed would have been led to think from the speeches and actions of the Ministers in the past that it is their object and the object of the Government by their actions to appease&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am afraid I cannot explain <Col N="414" /> myself any more clearly to the Minister. I think it is a very grave and a very serious step for this Government to take, and one which will not redound to their credit either in this country or abroad, and the only thing I can say is I regret it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to see that the opposition to the Merrion Square project is non-political, coming, in the first place, as it does from the residents of Merrion Square, and, in the second place, from the Legion of ex-Servicemen.  On that point, which I look upon as the most important in connection with the matter, I would like to refer to what Deputy Redmond said upon the subject.  He said that statements were made that the ex-servicemen did not want this memorial and that the very contrary was the case.  I have the honour to be Chairman of the area of Advisory British War Pensions Committees for the counties of Galway, Sligo, Mayo, Leitrim, Roscommon, Longford and Westmeath, and at a meeting of the representatives of the ex-servicemen held in Mullingar on Monday week it was unanimously resolved that I was to oppose the Merrion Square project and, on the other hand, to speak in favour, and strongly in favour, of a memorial being erected in Ireland to the 50,000 persons who died in the war.  Deputy Redmond mentioned a resolution in connection with Sligo.  At the meeting at which I spoke there were two Sligo representatives of the ex-servicemen present&mdash;Major O'Hara, D.S.O., and Lady Crofton&mdash;and both were agreed, as representing these men, upon the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objection of the Merrion Square residents is based upon the possibility of disturbance during Remembrance Day celebrations and also that the place is unsuitable for large gatherings, I do not attach much importance to the first objection, as the small section of the community who object to Ireland honouring her dead are unworthy of any notice, and have only earned contempt by their cowardly interference with the celebrations in memory of 50,000 brave Irishmen who died during the Great War.  The second objection comes from the Legion of <Col N="415" /> Ex-Servicemen on the ground that the money would be better expended in the starting of industries and the giving of employment, or in providing houses for them.  The money was not subscribed for these purposes.  In connection with what Deputy Redmond said when he asked why should not the money be spent as the subscribers desired I, personally, am aware that there is very considerable difference of opinion amongst the persons who did subscribe, and the persons whom I mentioned as being at the meeting in Mullingar, representing seven large counties.  Now, owing to the opposition of the ex-servicemen and their leaders.  General Sir Bryan Mahon and General Sir William Hickie, who led them in France and elsewhere during the Great War, I find, as one who has done his best to help these men and their dependents and to get for them from England the highest pensions and gratuities and innumerable other benefits up to the present time, my position is very easy because I have no hesitation whatever in voting against this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not think that Ireland's great part in the war is really generally known.  Ireland with only 300,000 men in the trenches lost 50,000 whereas America with something slightly over 700,000 only lost 40,000 simply because they did not come into the war until it was seen who was going to win, and they had got practically all the money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Personally, I would like to see a white marble cross erected with the names of the 50,000 Irishmen who fell <Col N="416" /> inscribed on it.  I am glad to be able to make it perfectly clear that, as far as the ex-servicemen are concerned, and as one who has been in very close touch with them, they are not in favour of the Merrion Square project.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJamesCraig" hpid="Sir JAMES CRAIG Sir JAMES CRAIG">
      <NameTxt>Sir JAMES CRAIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Executive Council has taken up an attitude of hostility to this scheme.  I want to make my position clear with regard to this Bill.  It is that of a Commissioner of the Square.  An appeal came to the Commissioners of the Square from the Trustees of this Fund, asking whether they would agree to hand over the Square for this Memorial.  The request was a serious one, because many of the inhabitants of the Square had paid high prices, not alone for their houses, but for the privacy of the Square.  That applied particularly to people who had young families that they could turn into the Square, so that they would be out of danger of being run over by traffic on the street.  The matter was fully discussed by the Commissioners, who came to the conclusion that for two reasons they could not oppose the application.  Their first reason was that this would be an opportunity of throwing the Square open to the poor people congregated in large numbers in the more or less slum areas behind Merrion Square.  Anyone who has to pass through Denzille lane or Denzille street knows the condition of these places, and that large numbers of children are playing on the streets. It is one of the most dangerous places that I come across in my daily work. The Commissioners came to the conclusion that this was an opportunity of throwing the Square open to the children of the poor and at the same time having it kept in a more respectable way than it was possible for them to keep it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I may explain how the Commissioners have to manage the affairs of the Square.  Each inhabitant of the Square pays a certain sum in proportion to his frontage.  The sum probably amounts to £3 15s. or £4 a year.  When wages were much smaller than they are now there was no great difficulty in keeping the Square in proper order. Of late years it was impossible to keep <Col N="417" /> it in any sort of decent order.  The amount of money that the Commissioners had at their disposal was about £350 yearly.  The Square is held under Lord Pembroke, and the lease will expire in about ten years.  Lord Pembroke can do then what he likes with Merrion Square.  It is quite possible that he may not wish to make money out of it, but if he does, he could let it for building or other purposes.  That was in the minds of the Commissioners when they considered this matter.  The second point that appealed to them was to try to have this considerable sum of money spent in the city of Dublin, in giving employment to men on whose behalf appeals are constantly made here.  The Commissioners came to the decision that on the whole it would be a wise thing to recommend to the inhabitants that the Square should be given to the Trustees of the proposed War Memorial.  A question then arose as to how to deal with the inhabitants of the Square.  They were summoned to a special meeting and the position was put before them.  It was pointed out that in the existing conditions the amount of money available was not sufficient to keep the Square in good order, and that new railings were required.  It was put to the residents that the Square, if taken over, would be as great a credit to the city as Stephen's Green is to the southern portion of Dublin.  There was some little opposition to the proposal, but a resolution was put and carried in favour of it.  I cannot remember that there was actually any vote given against it.  The Commissioners were then satisfied that the inhabitants were prepared to hand over the Square for the purpose intended.</P>
    <P>The matter then left the Commissioners' hands and was taken before the Courts where the scheme was adopted.  The City Commissioners were willing to take over the entire charge of the Square, and open it up, particularly for the poor of the neighhood. The points that have been raised with regard to this matter centre chiefly around the fear that if the Memorial were erected in the centre of Merrion Square huge crowds would assemble on Armistice Day. <Col N="418" /> Everybody knows that that sort of argument is not worth listening to.  The Commissioners of the Municipality would be perfectly within their right in stating that no assembly should take place in Merrion Square or the neighbourhood on that particular day. I think that fear is met in that way. Some Deputies said that Union Jacks would be hung out of the windows there, and so on.  That is not worth talking about so far as objection is concerned.  I think Deputy Shaw mentioned opposition that came from the inhabitants of the Square.  I think the opposition that comes from the inhabitants is on a very small scale, as far as numbers are concerned.  I think it was said that that opposition was chiefly based on the fear that there might be thousands of people collected in Merrion Square on Armistice Day.</P>

      <P>I did not suggest that.  I was suggesting that Deputy Shaw had stated what the objection was.  Deputy Shaw did not agree with that objection, and I do not think it is worth considering.  I am very sorry for the sake of the centre of the city, for the sake of Merrion Square, and the poor people living in the vicinity, that the Executive Council have taken up such a position.  A few years ago the Women Workers' Association sent a deputation to the Corporation asking that body to do what is offered now.  I am almost afraid to mention women now lest I should make some silly or stupid joke.  At that time the Corporation stated that they were unable to interfere with an Act of Parliament. The ladies on the deputation did not know then that the inhabitants of the Square had to pay £3 15s. Od. or £4 for enjoying the privacy of the Square.  An appeal was made by the Women Workers' Association in order to get the children a lung space in a part of the city that is greatly congested. Any Deputy who doubts that statement should try to drive a motor car through Denzille Lane or Denzille Street, when he will be impressed with the necessity of taking the children off <Col N="419" /> the streets, now that motor traffic has reached such immense proportions.</P>
      <P>I suppose there is no use in appealing to the Executive Council if they have made up their minds on this matter, but, so far as I am concerned, as one Commissioner I strongly urge that this scheme should be adopted, particularly because of the public good that would ensue.  If there is any use in making a final appeal to the Executive Council I would urge them to let the Bill go to the Joint Committee of the two Houses.</P>

      <P>Before I get to my main argument I want to say a word about Deputy Shaw's speech.  No Deputy has a greater right to speak, and to speak with authority, than Deputy Shaw on this subject, because he has been a very good friend to British ex-servicemen.  It would have been a very great advantage to the ex-servicemen if there had been a Deputy Shaw in every county in Ireland.  I am going to disagree with him, but I want to say that I respect his opinions.</P>
      <P>The Deputy quoted an opinion as representative of the opinion of ex-servicemen, and he selected two names as representative of County Sligo. They are names of friends of mine; I have known them all my life, and they are the names of people whose opinions I respect.  But neither of them voices the opinion of men who served in the war.  The Committee is not a committee of representative men who served in the war.  The Sligo branch of ex-servicemen, by its president and chairman, representing more than three hundred members, has expressed approval of the Merrion Square scheme.  I am sure that Deputy Shaw did not know that, that he would not wish to mislead the Dáil, and that he will excuse me for correcting him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now come to the main question. I did not intend to vote on this question. I am one of three members of the Dáil charged with the duty of selecting Deputies to serve on the Committees of Private Bills.  In every case &mdash;and especially in a case where there has been so much discussion and comment <Col N="420" /> as there has been in this case&mdash; it is very desirable that one should approach that function in a judicial spirit and not as a partisan who has expressed himself by speech or vote on the merits of the question.  That was my opinion when the debate commenced to-day.  If the debate had followed the normal channel&mdash;the channel it followed in the Seanad and in the Press&mdash;I should have adhered to that decision, but the speech of the Vice-President of the Executive Council has put a different complexion on the matter. It is, I think, unprecedented for any Government to oppose a Private Bill on Second Reading.  That in itself has destroyed all the precedents on which I was relying.  It is not, as was suggested in the Seanad, an unheard of thing to reject a Private Bill on Second Reading.  That has occurred.  It has occurred even during the present session in the House of Commons.  But if it is not absolutely unprecedented. it is extremely unusual for a Government to oppose a Private Bill on Second Reading.  Once the promoters have complied with the forms of the House and have satisfied Standing Orders, it is generally assumed that they have a right, at any rate, to have their Bill considered by a Committee.  But more than that, the argument of the Minister for Justice convinced me that I must vote in favour of this Bill.  I realise that the Minister for Justice is deeply concerned in this matter.  I realise that he has, in one sense, a greater claim than I have to speak on this matter, because he lost a relative in the war and I did not.  I, therefore, respect his views.  I should like, in passing, to correct his statement as to the purpose for which the money was originally subscribed.  There was no queston of a hostel for ex-servicemen. It was to be a hostel for service soldiers. The British military authorities made it quite clear that they would not allow any Irish ex-servicemen inside that hostel, because at that time they realised that the attitude of the Irish ex-servicemen was not the attitude that they wished and desired.  Therefore, the Minister when speaking about its being a hostel for serving soldiers and ex-servicemen was in error, and I hope he will allow me to correct him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="421" /> The Minister indulged in a survey of the decade before the Great War. I do not know what his purpose was. He always has a purpose.  He seemed to me to impart a polemical flavour to a discussion that ought to be conducted, as it has on the whole been conducted, in a manner consistent with the respect we all feel for the dead. I suppose the Minister had a purpose. I can only conceive that his purpose was that he is just as well able to adopt the shibboleths of the old Parliamentary Party as anybody else.  In manner he reminded me very forcibly of a distinguished member of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.  He did it nearly as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I would argue the question on other lines.  I would suggest to the Minister that one factor in procuring the Truce of 1921 was the international situation and the strong desire the British Government had to secure the co-operation of the United States of America.  He knows that the United States of America would have been very much less in favour of a peaceful settlement in Ireland had it not been for the services rendered by the Irish soldiers in the Great War, side by side with the soldiers of the <Col N="422" /> United States.  I merely suggest that to the Minister as a factor that enters into the argument.</P>
      <P>I must confess that, in dealing with this matter, the Government have not done themselves justice.  They are generally capable of greater generosity than they have shown on this occasion.  While the Minister was speaking some words of Shakespeare passed through my memory and I thought of the nobleman who rebuked the men who bore &ldquo;a slovenly, unhandsome corpse betwixt the wind and his nobility.&rdquo;  How dare those interested in the war memorial bear fifty thousand slovenly, unhandsome corpses betwixt the winds of Merrion Square and the nobility of Government Buildings!  Really, that is not a serious argument.  It is not an argument the Minister can expect the Dáil and those whose hearts are still sore and bleeding to accept.  As a matter of fact, the Minister has misread the situation to a certain extent.  He has assumed that if this motion is rejected the result will be the end of the Bill.  I think that assumption was implicit in his speech. But Standing Order 59, regulating private business, says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the Dáil do not concur with the Seanad in the reference of any Private Bill to a Joint Committee, the Order of the Seanad referring the Bill to such Joint Committee shall stand discharged, and the Bill shall stand referred to a Special Committee of the Seanad.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So that the promoters will have to go to the trouble of making their case before a Special Committee of the Seanad which will have no operative effect.  I do suggest that in view of that Standing Order, it might be only reasonable and fair for the Dáil to be associated on that Committee with the Seanad, and for the Bill to stand or fall by the Report of that Committee.  When the Minister is alarmed at the prospect of my being on the body that will select the Committee, I can only say that the other members of the Dáil on the Committee are Deputy Magennis and An Leas Cheann-Comhairle, so that it will not be a Committee with a majority of British partisans.  Now, what is the situation?  The Government refuses to <Col N="423" /> have a memorial in Merrion Square because it is too near Government Buildings; as the Minister said, it would be suggesting something contrary to the truth.  The Square is private property.  As Deputy Sir James Craig said, the lease will expire in less than a dozen years.  It will be open to the proprietor to do what he likes with it, to build flats, restaurants, dance halls or cinema theatres.  These may exist in close proximity to Government Buildings, but not a memorial to service and sacrifice, that would also be of benefit to the poor, and especially to the children of the poor.</P>
    <P>I do say again that we had hopes for greater generosity from Ministers, because, so far as I, and so far, I think, as any member of the Dáil who served in the British Army and fought in the war, have been able to do so, we have tried to prevent any revival of old issues that would cause bitterness and ill-feeling.  There appeared on the Estimates last year a sum, not a very large sum, but a sum taken from the pockets of the State to build a 1916 memorial in Glasnevin.  Not one of us opposed that vote.  We did not oppose it, partly, as I say, because we did not want to revive old wrangles and old quarrels, because we think the country ought to look to the future and not to the past, while honouring those who died in the past, whatever the cause might have been.  I, at least, did not oppose it also in the spirit of James Connolly who, when he was about to die, was asked if he would say a prayer for the soldiers who were to shoot him, and who said he would pray for any brave man who was doing his duty. Would he not have honoured the memory of brave men who died through doing their duty?  I appeal from the words of the Minister for Justice to the words of James Connolly, and I ask the Dáil to allow this Bill a Second Reading.</P>

      <P>Standing Order No. 59 relative to Private Business has been quoted by Deputy Cooper.  It runs:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If the Dáil do not concur with the Seanad in the reference of any Private Bill to a Joint Committee the <Col N="424" /> Order of the Seanad referring the Bill to such Joint Committee shall stand discharged and the Bill shall stand referred to a Special Committee of the Seanad.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That does not mean that the Bill must go through all its further stages in the Seanad.  The promoters can, if they so signify, withdraw it at any stage.  A Private Bill differs in that respect from a Public Bill which can only be withdrawn by leave of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. BYRNE Mr. A. BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>With Deputy Redmond, Deputy Sir James Craig and the last speaker, I appeal to the Dáil to allow this matter to go to the Special Committee for consideration.  I think we owe it to the 50,000 brave, voluntary soldiers who died in France, and if we do not owe it to them we owe it to their relatives.  If for no other reason than that stated by Deputy Sir James Craig, I will support this plea, that is for the sake of the children of Dublin citizens who live in the rere of Merrion Square, and who are deprived of any playground unless the side streets, where they are in danger of being run over by motor cars.  I was in Denzille Street yesterday between the hours of 4 and 5 and there were at least 1,000 children playing there, while two minutes' walk from them was a beautiful park, railed, closed and barred against them.  If for no other reason than to get that handsome square opened to the public, I would ask the House to vote for the memorial.  If the Minister did not state it, he practically suggested that he might alter his hand if the proposal for the memorial was for some other square not so convenient to Government Buildings.  I wonder why? Surely, if that park were opened to the memory of those who died in France it would not offend the eye of those who frequently visit Government Buildings and this House?  I think it would be a great tribute to this House if it would help onward the opening of Merrion Square, and not alone Merrion Square, but the similar parks that are closed against the children of the working class&mdash;Parnell Square and Mountjoy Square, that are secured by <Col N="425" /> a few privileged persons who are able to pay key money to go in.</P>
      <P>Without referring to the portion of the Minister's statement dealing with this country, I would have the Minister, and every other member of this House, to know that very brave and great Irishmen gave up their lives and fought in France in the belief that they were fighting for Ireland, and I am satisfied, when the Treaty was signed, that the work of these men and the sacrifices made by them, were not forgotten, and in no small way led up to the Treaty.  Another thing we should not forget is, that when we were forming our own Army, when the country was in trouble, it was largely recruited from the men who served in France. It is dangerous to mention figures but I would say that a very large number of those who joined the National Army were men who went through the war in France.  I think it is due to the survivors of these men that there should be some fitting memorial to them.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there is a difference of opinion amongst unemployed ex-servicemen to-day.  The unemployed ex-service man, who has just cause for complaint, thinks that something should be done for him, something in the way of a week's wages, something that would provide his family with bread and butter, and with the means of support, but this fund is too small for that.  There is no use in anybody trying to hide his opposition to a memorial behind the plea that it is in order to get something for the ex-service man, to give him employment or give him a small donation. If this fund were divided amongst the unemployed ex-servicemen, I am satisfied that it would not give them 10/- each.  For that 10/- I am not going to vote to destroy a lasting memorial to those who died in France.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well to know that in eighteen years' time the owners of Merrion Square can build on it.  I think it would be a deplorable thing that we should lose this opportunity we are now getting to give this handsome park to Dublin City, and that when the lease of this Square is up buildings should be erected so convenient to the houses that now surround the Square. <Col N="426" /> Undesirable buildings may be erected there.  There is nothing to prevent, so far as I understand, the owners of the Square from selling or letting the Square in eighteen years' time.  We are practically being offered the Square rent free for ever&mdash;an area of 14½ acres.  A small sum of £800 has to be paid because there is some charge on the Square to that extent.  There is no objection to paying that.  The Committee have made arrangements, and the future upkeep of the Square would not work out at a farthing in the £ to Dublin citizens.  For the sake of that farthing in the £ I appeal to Deputies not to allow this opportunity to pass of giving to Dublin City this magnificent park for the children of the poor.  The object for which the men died has been referred to, and I avail of this opportunity to quote a few lines of a great Irishman.  I refer to Tom Kettle.  This is what he wrote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Died not for flag nor King nor Empire.</P>
    <P>But for a dream born in a herdman's shed</P>
    <P>And for the sacred scripture of the poor.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that a great many Tom Kettles died in France for the same object.</P>

      <P>As one who had something to do with the collection of this money, I would like to say very briefly that when we had the question of its disposal under consideration we had a number of schemes, as one would naturally expect, and though I personally was never very enthusiastic about the Merrion Square scheme, it was the one scheme, apart from the original proposal, that seemed to meet with the largest measure of support.  In addition, when the scheme was brought before the Court it met with approval.  As Deputy Byrne has just pointed out, the scheme has also had the approval of the local authority and I might say, speaking with some knowledge of the subscribers, it has the support of the majority of the subscribers.  That being so, I think it is unfortunate that the Executive Council should have taken <Col N="427" /> upon itself to turn down the scheme. As one who has listened with admiration on a great many occasions to the Minister for Justice, I am sorry to say I cannot but deplore the speech that he made on this subject this afternoon. I regret that that speech will give and will be looked upon as giving a political significance to this Memorial no matter where it is erected.  That is an aspect that one deplores.  We have been too prone in the past, in this poor country of ours, to look at everything through political glasses, and I was hopeful that this Memorial which all parties representing all political creeds had subscribed to so freely would have been kept clear of politics.  I cannot but deplore the Minister's speech for having given a certain amount of colour to that particular aspect of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would urge, in addition to what has been put forward by many speakers, that this Bill be sent to a Select Committee.  Let the Select Committee explore the whole situation in connection with the Bill; let it, if it thinks desirable, hear the subscribers to the Memorial, but let the Bill be subject to that inquiry.  It was passed through the other House, as we all know, by a narrow majority, but it was given reference to a Committee on the understanding that it is a principle that should be supported that Private Bills ought to get a fair measure of inquiry. I do not speak with any knowledge of the functions of Parliament and as to whether this sets up a precedent or not, as has been pointed out, is a matter upon which I cannot offer any opinion; but I must say that when Private Bills are brought forward we ought, to see that they, at all events, get a reasonable amount of fair play.  In the past we have had it urged in connection with Private Bills that there was an amount of expense connected with them and that for that reason local inquiry was desirable.  Many of us advocated that particular scheme in the past.  We were hopeful that in an Irish atmosphere an Irish measure would have got, at all events, fair play, and I cannot say, if the House is to reject this proposal and refuse to refer <Col N="428" /> this Bill to a Select Committee, that many of those who are interested in this Memorial and, may I say, in Parliamentary procedure in connection with our State, will be satisfied that the measure has had fair play from this House.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the very interesting speech of the Minister for Justice in opening the debate in opposition to this Bill, there remains very little for me to say.  In my opinion there are various objections to the Bill both inside and outside the Dáil.  I think that any Deputy who favours the Bill and who has read the debate in the Seanad cannot hope to impress or even to convince Deputies who are in opposition to it now that it is not a contentious Bill or that it ought to pass in this House.  It is opposed by people outside and by a good many who are representative of different political opinions.  Their opposition is based on the belief that in turning Merrion Square into a public park, as a national war memorial, opportunity would be provided for a considerable amount of disturbance and discontent at various functions that might from time to time be held there.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Sir James Craig mentioned that the Commissioners had a right to refuse permission for the holding of such meetings if this Merrion Square Park were turned into a war memorial.  Many people in Dublin know well that last year there was a considerable amount of discontent because the city authorities changed the venue of a certain gathering.  I think the arguments that have been put up by those in favour of the Bill were the weakest I have yet heard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to utilising the place as a public park, Deputy Byrne and other Deputies have been quoting poetry and wailing in relation to the unfortunate poor in the surrounding districts who have to do without a park.  What is preventing Merrion Square being thrown open as a public park?  The inhabitants of Merrion Square who are opposing the Bill have passed a resolution favouring the handing over of any powers or rights they have with the object of opening it as a public park for the use of the poor.  They have objected to <Col N="429" /> turning the park into a war memorial for reasons that have been fully dealt with already and that I need not repeat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask if the Deputy is aware that the Memorial Committee proposed to buy out the owner of the Square, and whether the residents of Merrion Square objecting to the Bill, who are a small minority, are also prepared to buy out the owner?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. DOYLE Mr. DOYLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOYLE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in the argument that opposition to the Bill is meant to deprive the poor of a public park.  Opposition to the Bill is not preventing the poor from having these privileges.  We are told that this is a gift to the city.  It is the type of gift that the citizens would have to pay for. They would have to pay for its upkeep, and I do not think the citizens of Dublin want gifts of that kind.</P>
      <P>So far as I am concerned, I agree with everything stated by the Minister for Justice in the very clear and straightforward statement he made when opening the opposition to-day. I hope the Dáil will vote against the Bill.  There are many points one could discuss in connection with this measure, but they touch on delicate matters, and I do not think it is right that certain points should have been introduced to-day by those who favour the Bill.  There was no intention on this side of the House to bring in contentious points such as were raised by other Deputies.</P>
      <P>If people who are anxious for the peace of the city will study, for instance, what took place within the last couple of years, the position will become more plain.  On one occasion it happened that near Trinity College the Trinity College students challenged a Commissioner of the Gárdaí to open fight.  If the people who talk about peace and law and order wish to have a continuance of that class of thing in the heart of the city, I, for one, will do my best to prevent it.</P>

      <P>I cannot give a silent vote if this matter is put to a division, I have been instructed by a section of my constituents to vote against giving permission for the erection of a war memorial in Merrion Square.  The <Col N="430" /> South Westmeath branch of the British ex-servicemen, numbering 800 members, are of the opinion that a memorial erected in the Phoenix Park at a cost of £3,000 or £5,000 would suit the purpose, and they object to a memorial costing between £40,000 and £50,000.  Many of these men are at the moment on the brink of starvation.  I have been requested by the British Legion of ex-Servicemen, who have offices in Wicklow Street and who number about 700, to mention that they are not in favour of putting the money collected into the Merrion Square project. They believe the money could be better utilised.  This organisation had offices in Middle Abbey Street but they have changed to Wicklow Street. They represent the rank and file.  In some cases they are brothers of men who fell in battle, men in whose memory the memorial will be erected. They favour utilising the money in helping to educate the children of soldiers killed in action, men who gave their lives for the freedom of small nations and who died in France or Flanders or in other foreign countries. There are 150,000 ex-servicemen.</P>

It would be better if the promoters of this national memorial looked at both sides of the picture.  They should try to do something for the men who went out in 1914, as the Minister for Justice said, on the instructions of many men who are alive to-day.  Some of them went out as dupes to fight for the freedom of Ireland in a foreign country. We are asked to establish a War Memorial in Merrion Square.  I strongly object to the proposal.  I do not object to a Memorial being erected, but I do object when it comes to a question of <Col N="431" /> £40,000 because I think the money could be utilised better.</P>

It would be a greater honour for the dead if such a scheme were put on foot to help their dependents rather than have erected a memorial at the cost of £40,000.  It is a well-known fact that in every county in the Saorstát there is a very large number of ex-servicemen.  Since I became a member of the Dáil, in 1922, we have been speaking about unemployment among civilian workers and amongst ex-servicemen, but neither the promoters nor supporters of this Bill have as yet done anything for their relief.  Nothing has been said by them or by anybody else in the Dáil as to the very acute distress that prevails amongst the members of the Legion of ex-Servicemen who are citizens of this State.  We have been told by Deputy Sir James Craig that his sole ambition in supporting this Bill is to find some place in which the children around Merrion Square could play.  That, he tells us, is his chief ground for supporting this measure.  We have been told by other Deputies that from the Labour point of view the Bill is commendable, as it is going to give employment.  How much more employment would be provided by that money if it were invested in some industry where it would give continuous employment to at least 100 ex-servicemen?</P>

      <P>I have little to add to what I have already said by way of indicating the objection I have&mdash;an objection which the Executive Council shares with me&mdash;to proceeding with this project.  I want to make it clear that it is to the place objection is taken and not to the erection of a War Memorial in or near the City of Dublin. I want to make that quite clear, because it may have some interest for the promoters of the Bill in the event of the Bill being rejected.  There has been a suggestion made that it is not fair play&mdash;I think Deputy Good used that expression, and possibly some others&mdash;to oppose this Bill at this stage, and that the Bill should be referred to a Committee.  If the Bill were to pass its Second Reading Stage and go to a Committee, then the Committee could discuss one thing, and one thing only, namely, the project to erect a War Memorial in Merrion Square.  That point emerged some time ago in connection with the Private Bill dealing with the Butt Bridge, that alternative schemes are ruled out once this stage of the Bill is passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is not merely fair play, but the fairest play to the promoters of a Bill, if there is strong objection felt in the Dáil to that Bill, that that objection should be manifested at this stage and not at any later stage.  Deputy Cooper suggested&mdash;he is good at suggesting&mdash;that in taking the line which I took in relation to this Bill, I was in some way thinking in terms of a General Election and waving a flag, so to speak.  He said that I did it almost as well as a distinguished member of another Parliament.  I want to assure Deputy Cooper that in considering this Bill, nothing was further from my mind than any question of a General Election or any question of what the electorate, either generally <Col N="433" /> throughout the State or in a particular constituency, would or would not do.</P>
    <P>A tree can but grow from its roots. If you try to substitute others you will have a poor tree.  This State has particular origins, and particular roots, and we should not suggest either to ourselves or to people coming here amongst us that it has any other roots. I put it to the Dáil that if you make this park here in front of your Government Buildings a public park, and if you dedicate that park, and a permanent memorial within it, to a particular purpose then you are suggesting, in fact, that the State has other roots than the roots we know it to have.  I did not want simply to indulge in Party controversy when I passed very briefly over the six or eight years antecedent to the Great War.  But it is relevant to this project that nationalism in this country is, and always has been, predominantly nationalist; that nationalism which was running substantially in one stream hitherto split into two streams in and about the time of the commencement of the Great War. Some men went to France; 50,000 of them did not come back.  Others stayed here at home at the time, and joined issue with Dublin Castle and the British administration, and the net result of that was the Truce, the Treaty, and this State. Now, if we are to have a public park in front of our Government Buildings, let the monuments and memorials in that park be monuments and memorials that suggest the true origin of this State. There has been much talk here lately about town planning, symmetry, perspective and a due sense of proportion. Let us have symmetry, perspective and a due sense of proportion in State planning.  This Bill is bad State planning, wrong State planning.</P>
    <P>Commemoration of the dead is a pious and proper thing, and we should always try to distinguish very clearly between commemoration of the dead and glorification of the living.  In the 11th of November proceedings there is a danger that the one aspect will overshadow the other, that people will turn out and in some way tend to make that very solemn day and that very solemn occasion an opportunity for demonstrations of a controversial nature, an occasion <Col N="434" /> for flag-waving and slogans that give offence, and have their counteractions. Unless we are careful the 11th of November commemoration that was intended to be a very solemn act of reverence will degenerate into simply an opportunity for the exuberant youth of one university to demonstrate against the exuberant youth of another, or for people of one tradition to go out with symbols and emblems that must be offensive to people of another tradition.</P>
    <P>I am not attempting to apportion responsibility or blame, but I say there is that tendency, and, unless responsible people check it, it will end in making that day anything but the solemn day it was intended to be.  Merrion Square is not the place for this memorial.  That is my opposition.  Merrion Square, adjacent to the seat of Government, is not the place for this memorial, and to erect it there is bad State planning.  It will be understood, I think, from what I said in opening the opposition to the Bill, that there is here no question of antagonism or opposition to ex-servicemen as such.  I mentioned one compelling reason why I, at any rate, should have no such antagonism, but it is another thing to keep your growing State in line with its origin and tradition and not allow any confusion to arise or any oblivion to grow up about that.  Let there be a War Memorial. That is one thing, but a War Memorial in Merrion Square, a public park, presumably with the railings gone and leading up to the entrance of Government Buildings, is another thing.  It is suggested, despite what is said to the contrary, that there is connection between the loss of those lives in France and the establishment of this State, but there is no such connection.  It was not irrelevant to dwell on the fissure that took place in nationalism on the issue of the Great War.  I dealt with it very briefly, and certainly not with any intention of drawing down here, in this Dáil, which is scarcely the place for it, a controversial, party, political issue, but it has a place as a factor in our consideration of this whole matter.</P>
    <P>We can only consider what is before us.  I object to what is before us.  The Executive Council also object, and if we do not object at this stage we would <Col N="435" /> have no standing to object at any later stage.  It is now that the opposition to the main proposal of the Bill should voice itself.  Deputy Cooper made one point, namely, that a Private Bill should not be opposed by a Government. One can state general principles till the cows come home, and one will always find that the finest general principle that one could cite will have its exception here and there.  Normally, I agree that an Executive Council might well sit back and let discussion range around a Private Bill by a private Deputy.  This, however, is not a case of the kind.  I submit that there are aspects in this proposal which not merely justify but demand that the Executive Council should take some definite line upon it.  If the promoters come along with a Bill dealing with some other park in the city, dealing with the little park in Parnell Square, or even with Fitzwilliam Square, my advice to the Executive Council would be to sit back and let Deputies discuss it in the freest possible manner and on non-party lines.  There are aspects of the proposal which make it incumbent on the Executive Council to say whether this, the park confronting <Col N="436" /> Government Buildings, should be a park devoted to that particular purpose. The Government think not.</P>

      <P>May I add a personal note of explanation, to explain the reference which the Minister has made to my suggestion that he was actuated by a desire for electoral popularity? That suggestion was tinged with a reprehensible touch of humour and was not intended to be taken seriously.  I only suggested that if the Minister wished to follow the example of other Parties on the political platform he could do so.  I am sure he does not intend to do so, and I am certain that if he woke up some morning and found that he was popular he would examine his conscience.  May I say, as regards the 11th November, that we realise the danger as fully as the Minister, and we should regret it as much as anybody if that day, intended to be a day of commemoration, should become one of Party or sectional strife. We will do all in our power to prevent it.</P>

      <P>Amendment 7 would need to be taken in connection with amendment No. 1.  The intention is to provide a new definition for &ldquo;restaurant.&rdquo;  On reflection it became clear to us that the definition in the Bill as introduced might be construed to cover premises which it is not our intention should be comprised in the term &ldquo;restaurant.&rdquo;  There are certain publichouses in the city, for instance, in which counter lunches are given. Whilst that is so, it is clear that it is very difficult to lay down a rigid definition.  It seems preferable, on the whole, to give a certain discretion to the District Court to determine whether given premises are fit to be described as a restaurant in accordance with the evidence before it.  Amendment 7 is self explanatory.  It will be realised that the proprietor of any licensed premises who desires to have the benefit conferred by Section 11 of the Bill must apply to the court for a restaurant certificate, and if the applicant is able to satisfy the District Court that the premises are being bona fide and mainly used as a restaurant, and after the police have been given the opportunity to argue contrary if they think fit, then the applicant is given a certificate.  The possessor of such certificate is entitled to the privileges conferred by Section 11.  It will be appreciated that this proposal makes police work more practicable.  If people are found being served with intoxicating liquor on Sunday between the hours of 1 and 3 and 6 and 9 the police need only satisfy themselves whether the restaurant proprietor is the holder of a restaurant certificate.  If we did not introduce this idea of a certificate from the District Court, then the police would have to prove in every case of prosecution that the premises were not a restaurant within the meaning of the Act, and one can conceive that, in certain cases, it might be a matter difficult to prove.  I prefer the idea embodied in these two amendments&mdash;one and seven.</P>

      <P>In page 5, Section 2 (4), lines 28-30, to delete all words from the words &ldquo;and in&rdquo; to the end of the sub-section.</P>
      <P>This is a purely drafting amendment. Reference to Part 3 of the Bill, Section 21, shows that &ldquo;offences under the provisions of the Bill relating to prohibited hours&rdquo; come within Part 3, and it is tautology to repeat in Section 2, sub-section (4), that offences of this character must be recorded on the licence.  It is also desirable that information as to what is a recordable offence can be found in Part 3 without reference to any other part of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, at the end of Section 2 to add a new sub-section as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(6) Nothing in this section shall in the case of licensed premises situate in a county borough prohibit between the hours of half-past two o'clock and half-past three o'clock in the afternoon on any week day the receipt by post, telegraph, or telephone of orders for intoxicating liquor for consumption off the premises or the delivery at or dispatch of to the purchaser's residence or a <Col N="439" /> railway station of intoxicating liquor sold for consumption off the premises.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment carries out what I indicated, on a previous stage, it was our intention to do.  It makes it clear that between the hours of 2.30 and 3.30, when certain licensed premises are closed, that all licence holders, &ldquo;on&rdquo; and &ldquo;off&rdquo; will be at liberty to take orders for liquor for consumption off the premises, or to deliver or to dispatch liquor so ordered at the purchaser's residence or to a railway station.  The closing down from 2.30 to 3.30 is aimed at preventing drinking in bars, and there would appear to be no objection to the taking of orders for drink for consumption of the premises, or for delivery at the purchaser's residence or to a railway station.  To prevent the transaction of that kind of business might simply be imposing an unnecessary and irritable restriction on the proprietors of licensed premises.  Therefore, I am moving this amendment.  The amendment may need some slight polishing in the way of draftsmanship.  There is, for instance, one obvious slight mistake in it as it reads.  In the third last line the word &ldquo;of,&rdquo; following the word &ldquo;dispatch,&rdquo; should, of course, be struck out.</P>
    <P>There is something perhaps a little more substantial than that because this is the conception: that a person with an on-licence, a licence for consumption on the premises, may, if he receives an order by phone or by letter through his letter-box, send liquor to the residence of a customer or to a railway station, but it would not be a sufficient excuse for being found on his premises that you had come to order intoxicating liquor to be consumed at your residence or to be delivered there.  In other words, what any person can do by 'phone or letter or telegraph he is free to do under this, and the on-licence holder is free to deliver at the residence of the purchaser or at a railway station.  With regard to the off-licence holder, it is not proposed to insist on closed doors in his case at all.  All we are asking of him is that for that hour he will <Col N="440" /> not hand physically across the counter to purchasers intoxicating liquor.  He may take an order verbally or otherwise for intoxicating liquor to be delivered at the residence of the purchaser or at a railway station.  It may be that the word &ldquo;railway&rdquo; would need to be amplified&mdash;to deliver to a common carrier for delivery at the residence of the purchaser.</P>
    <P>At any rate, I want to say that the wording here is not final, and that it may need repolishing by the draftsman and some amendment in the Seanad.  I want Deputies to be clear as to the intent.  The intent is that within this hour the on-licence holder will have shut doors, but if he gets by 'phone, letter or other means of that kind an order to send intoxicating liquor to the residence of a purchaser, he can book that order and complete it by delivery.  The off-licence holder is only asked to abstain for that hour from the sale of drink across the counter&mdash;the actual handing over of intoxicating liquor to a purchaser across the counter&mdash;but he is not being asked to shut his shop at all.</P>
    <P>I have come to the conclusion that it is unnecessary to ask the off-licence holders to shut their doors.  There are only three hundred of them for one thing.  For another thing, this hour, 2.30 to 3.30, which is the choice of the on-licence holders, would be a very inconvenient hour for them indeed, because it is, in fact, something of a rush hour in the provision trade.  A great many of these off-licence holders do, in fact, close for an hour, but an earlier hour, 1 to 2.  Having discussed factors of this kind with a deputation, I have come to the conclusion that it is not reasonable and not necessary to ask the off-licence holder to close at all for that hour, and the utmost restriction that we are putting on him is that within that hour he will hand out no intoxicating liquor across the counter.  We are leaving him free, as indeed we are leaving the on-licence holder free, to take orders for intoxicating liquor and to deliver such orders freely at the residence of the purchasers or for consignment at the residence of the purchaser. I hope Deputies know just what is involved during that one hour break in the day.</P>

      <P>I quite follow, but it is only in regard to off-licences that people are to be permitted to go into the shop.  Of course the number of off-licences may be small, as the Minister said, but at the same time I think he will find it rather difficult to carry out his intentions.  He may, as he said previously, have a higher opinion than, as he said, I seemed to have of people engaged in this trade.  I do not see for the moment that there will be a steady and direct movement to illicit trading, but at the same time undoubtedly these people will be open to great temptation and it will place them in a very awkward position when people go into their shops.  They will find it very difficult to refuse them.  However, he has made up his mind that this system will work.  I trust it will, and as far as off-licence holders are concerned who, he says, are not mixed traders, they will not by this proposal be interfered with.  I do not think there can be any great objection from any part of the Dáil to his suggestion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not making a complaint about this amendment.  The Minister for Justice says that there are only 300 off-licences involved.  He must also take into account that if the hour <Col N="442" /> between 2.30 and 3.30 is a busy one for off-licences and grocers the same thing applies to mixed traders.  If the Minister gives the off-licence holders an opportunity of keeping open for this hour to sell other articles and if they can take orders for the sale of intoxicating drink so long as they do not hand it over the counter why should not the same thing apply to mixed trading? There cannot be a large number of these mixed traders in Dublin.  They are generally in the country.  I think this is a great hardship and gives a monopoly to the off-licence holder as against the mixed trader.  The customer who is dealing with the on-licence holder when the latter is closed goes into the off-licence.  The result is a certain amount of harm is going to be done to the mixed trader.  When I voted in favour of having premises closed for one hour from 1.30 to 2.30 I did not think the Minister for Justice was going to alter his own decision, because he said that all houses with a licence were to be closed for that hour. Now I find it only applies to on-licences.</P>
      <P>By compelling the mixed trader to close for an hour you are giving a monopoly to the man with the off-licence. I hold what applies to one should apply to all.  A man, living, say, in O'Connell Street, who is a mixed trader, paying £50 or £60 more than his neighbour the off-licence man, is made to close and the man who pays less is allowed to open.  I do not think that is fair when you take into account the harm that is done.  As Deputy Redmond has said, you will find it difficult to administer the law or to get proof whether a man has or has not been supplied in an off-licence with a pint or a half-pint of whiskey.  The Minister himself has said if the houses were to be closed for two hours he would be quite agreeable to leave the mixed traders keep their doors open for the sale of goods other than liquor if they put some card in the window saying &ldquo;This shop cannot sell so and so.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally I am pleased with the way the Bill has been amended, and I think that the people in the country in general, who were so much up against the Minister, particularly on that clause, <Col N="443" /> have greatly altered their opinion.  A big majority who may have been against him some time ago probably see eye to eye with him at present.  On this particular amendment I think a lot of people who have to depend on mixed trading are going to be deprived of a very big amount of their turn-over at the end of the year by being compelled to close down for that hour.  I think the Minister should at least act as fair on this amendment as he has acted throughout on the Bill.  It would be very advisable, and it would be much appreciated by the mixed traders.</P>

Whereas the off-licence holder, who is not asked to shut his door at all during this hour may, of course, take orders verbally across his counter, and the only restriction on him is that he may not hand out the goods across the counter during that hour.</P>

      <P>This amendment means that it is proposed that these premises shall be allowed to open between nine and ten in the morning, but not during the one hour in the afternoon.  Of course, that carries out the Minister's intention as he has expressed it, but I fail to see on what grounds the on-licence mixed premises should not be allowed to trade during this hour in the middle of the day.  As it is proposed that they should be allowed to trade from nine to ten in the morning, I do not think there is much to be said for insisting upon their closing in the afternoon, because they have an on-licence, and allowing the off-licence houses to keep open.  The fact, as mentioned by Deputy Lyons, that one is for consumption on the premises, probably paying a higher licence duty, I do not think is a sound reason for not allowing the same sort of trade to be carried on, what is known as a mixed trade.  It will, of course, be <Col N="445" /> a considerable hardship on those licensees who have on-licences that during this hour in the middle of the day they will not be able to do any trade in goods other than liquor, whereas their neighbours who have only an off-licence will be entitled to do that business.  I think that is a matter for the Minister to consider further.  His original intention, as I understood it, was that they were all to be closed down.  Now he has come to see that certain of them should be allowed to open, and if supervision can be carried out in regard to the off-licences, I do not think there would be any greater difficulty in carrying it out with regard to all.  If there are three hundred off-licences where the Minister thinks he will be able to supervise this new form of restricted trading, I do not see why the same supervision could not be exercised in regard to the others.  Of course there will be a difference in number&mdash;I may be told that the number will be doubled or trebled.  That argument might carry some weight if the off-licences were only a small number, but as they number about three hundred, I do not think the risk would be very much greater if the on-licensed houses were allowed to trade in goods other than liquor during the same period as the off-licence houses are.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Redmond that the on-licence houses should be allowed to trade in the same way as they are in the mornings. There should be the same privilege in the middle of the day as in the morning. I believe the off-licences are a greater danger to the community than the on-licences, because when a trader supplies two or three gallons of whiskey or two or three bottles there is no supervision over the way in which it is drunk.  It could be drunk by drunken men, because it is not an offence to drink it in a private house. On the other hand, if a man is caught in a publichouse with a sign of drink on him it is an offence.  For that reason there should be as much, if not more, supervision over the off-licence. The Minister has met us pretty fairly since the Bill was introduced, and I think he should wind up now in a satisfactory <Col N="446" /> way and not discriminate between the two classes of licence.</P>

      <P>In page 10, before Section 14, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>14.&mdash;(1)  The Justice of the District Court upon its being represented to him by the officer in charge of the Gárda Síochána for a licensing area (not being or forming part of a county borough) that, by reason of the expected incursion on any Sunday or Saint Patrick's Day of a large number of persons into such licensing area for a special occasion, the observance on that day by the holders of on-licences attached to premises in such licensing area or any particular part thereof of the provisions of this Act relating to prohibited hours and the enforcement of such provisions on that day by the Gárda Síochána will be attended with unreasonable difficulty may, if he so thinks fit, grant in respect of such licensing area or any particular part thereof (in this section referred to as the exempted area) an order (in this Act referred to as an area exemption order) exempting all holders of on-licences <Col N="448" /> attached to premises in the exempted area on such Sunday or Saint Patrick's Day from the provisions of this Act relating to prohibited hours in respect of such premises during such period or periods (not exceeding in the whole three hours) as may be specified in such order.</P>
    <P>(2)  Whenever an area exemption order is granted the holder of an on-licence attached to premises in the exempted area to which such order relates shall if he takes advantage of such order during the period or periods on the Sunday or Saint Patrick's Day named therein supply on his premises food and non-alcoholic drink at reasonable prices to any person demanding the same.</P>
    <P>(3)  Whenever an area exemption order is granted the holder of an on-licence attached to premises in the exempted area to which such order relates shall if and so long as he complies with the provisions of the foregoing sub-section be exempted during the period and on the Sunday or Saint Patrick's Day named in such order from any penalty for contravention in respect of such premises of the provisions of this Act relating to prohibited hours, but not from any other penalty under this or any other Act.</P>
    <P>This amendment carries out what I had undertaken at an earlier stage to do.  It is self-explanatory; it gives the District Court the power on the occasion of big football matches and hurling matches in provincial towns to permit licensed premises to open for three hours on Sunday or Saint Patrick's Day where it would be impracticable to administer the regulation governing the supply of drink to bona fide travellers.  With this amendment there must be read sub-section (7) of Section 4. &ldquo;No general exemption order shall be granted for any time on any Sunday or Saint Patrick's Day or Christmas Day or Good Friday.&rdquo;  That is the general position and this amendment is the exception.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that this exemption order can be granted only on the certificate of the responsible officer of <Col N="449" /> the Gárda Síochána that a crowd is expected in the area so large that the administration of the bona fide regulations would be impracticable both for the trader and for the police.  Whenever that certificate is forthcoming the District Court will have discretion as to whether or not an exemption order should be granted, but in no case shall it operate for a period of more than three hours altogether.  That is as far as I am prepared to go to meet the case raised here by Deputy Morrissey.  First, I make the police officer the judge as to the dimensions of the crowd expected and as to whether or not that crowd will be so great as to render the operation of the bona fide laws impracticable or extremely difficult and, then, that if the certificate of the police officer is forthcoming the District Justice may, if he thinks fit, grant an exemption order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister has not thought fit to go the length of the amendment, or the proposal embodied in it, which I put down to Section 5 on the Committee Stage. That amendment proposed that on the occasion of any football or hurling match an exemption order might be granted, but it went on to suggest, in sub-sections, that food should be obtainable wherever this exemption order was granted.  In one respect the Minister has gone further than I proposed.  It is now suggested by this amendment that the occasion shall not be confined to a football or hurling match but a special occasion on which, in the opinion of the District Court, the ordinary law would be difficult to enforce. But he has narrowed it down very considerably by applying it only to areas outside the county boroughs.  My original proposal included the county boroughs and though at the time I admitted that on Sundays there was a period during which liquor could be supplied in the county boroughs to anyone, whether resident or not, yet it was during this very time that people who came up from the country would be at the football or hurling match.  Therefore I am disappointed that in the proposals the Minister made he has restricted the possibility of granting those <Col N="450" /> orders to the areas outside the county boroughs.</P>
      <P>I think the framework upon which he has grounded his amendment is quite sound.  I am perfectly prepared to have the District Court decide whether, in view of the special circumstances of the occasion, the ordinary law would not be enforceable, but I do think that that should also apply to the cities. Take an occasion such as that of the big hurling and football matches that take place in the cities of Dublin or Cork or elsewhere.  The crowd is so large, numbering tens of thousands, that though there is a period of three hours when liquor can be had, that is the very period at which the people are at the football or hurling match.  I do not think it is quite fair that the exempted cities should not be placed upon, at least, an equal footing with the outside areas in this respect.  I ask the Minister to apply this also to the exempted cities.  With the proposal that the matter should be decided by the District Justice I have no complaint. Neither have I any as to the occasion on which it might be granted, but it is quite as likely that the period of opening in the cities would not be sufficient for the large crowds on those occasions as it is that the ordinary bona fide regulations would not be observed in outside areas.  I think the District Justice in the city would be quite capable of determining from the circumstances brought to his notice whether the ordinary law would be enforceable owing to the enormous crowds that would be likely to flock in, and, therefore, I ask the Minister to extend this to the cities as well as to the outside areas.</P>

      <P>The Minister has met the point I made rather fairly, and I am prepared to support the amendment. I agree with Deputy Redmond that difficulties arise in the cities on days of big matches, but these difficulties are not as great there as in provincial towns.  Dublin has a large number of hotels and restaurants, and the publichouses are open for three hours. I agree that the hours during which the publichhouses are open clash with the hours at which the matches take place.  Notwithstanding that, I think <Col N="451" /> if Dublin people are business people, visitors to Dublin ought to be able to get reasonable refreshments on Sundays. There was a necessity for some such provision as the Minister is prepared to insert, and I am prepared to support the amendment.</P>

      <P>I agree that the Minister has met the matter fairly.  On the Committee Stage I pointed out that on holidays like St. Patrick's Day there is an influx of people to a town and they require refreshments.  While the Minister has met the matter very fairly, the hours of opening in the cities do not suit those attending a football match.  It is, however, hard to ask the Minister to go any further.  At the same time, the Minister might give the District Justice power to grant an hour, in addition to the two or three hours already allowed, if a case was made before him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Deputy Redmond's appeal to the Minister. It is well known that large numbers of people from the Twenty-six Counties come to Dublin on days on which there are big demonstrations or football and hurling matches.  The present hours for opening are between 2 and 5 on Sundays and holidays.  That time is not sufficient when 30,000 or 40,000 people want refreshments. Publicans in the cities are paying bigger licence duties than those in the provincial towns.  While the Minister has gone very far to meet the circumstances in the towns, I think he could allow exemption orders to be granted to publicans in the cities, as was the case in the past.  I have often seen publichouses overcrowded on days when large numbers of people came to the city.  It is all very well for Deputy Morrissey to say that these people could go to hotels and restaurants. They are working people from country districts, and when they go to Dublin, Cork, Limerick, or Waterford, they do not think of going to hotels or restaurants. They go to licensed premises, where they can have a meat or a cheese sandwich and a bottle of stout.  I do not see why these people should not be allowed to get these refreshments in publichouses.  They will not be able to <Col N="452" /> get them if the Minister does not agree with Deputy Redmond's suggestion, and allow the cities the same privileges as provincial towns.</P>

      <P>At an earlier stage of the Bill I undertook to introduce an amendment providing for the gazetting of reference orders and abolition orders.  On looking into the matter I do not consider it is necessary to gazette reference orders.  The abolition order is the important thing and, as it operates to abolish the licence as from 30th September succeeding the day it is made, the order itself being made not later than 31st December, and operating over a minimum period of nine months, there is ample notice to all parties concerned.

You may have an abolition order referring to some licence in a remote part of Cork.  The holder of that licence may have a liability to a creditor in Dublin to whom the notice of this abolition would be very useful.  As a rule these creditors do not see &ldquo;Iris Oifigiúil,&rdquo; and wider publicity would be very desirable. I do not know that it would involve much expense.  In other measures we provided for publication through the means of a local paper and a Dublin daily paper.  If the Minister could see his way to provide for that additional publicity in this case, he would be doing a useful service to the commercial community.</P>

How are these people to live for the three months?  If they fail to secure employment during the three months, then the Compensation Commission will consider their claim for a gratuity, being a sum equal to three months' wages&mdash;that is, the three months they have been unemployed.  Of course, I understand that men who have been in positions for a number of years may have some little money saved, but a number of those people have not the means of saving.

    <P>During that three months that applicant must depend on unemployment insurance benefit, but, as everybody knows&mdash;I am sure the Minister for Industry and Commerce will bear out this&mdash;it takes an applicant considerable time on a great many occasions to get benefit, and this person cannot receive one halfpenny for a period of <Col N="458" /> four weeks.  Then he gets unemployment insurance benefit and presumably must still remain unemployed in order to complete the period of three months and at the end of that time, when any little savings he may have had will have become exhausted, he has got to set the machinery in motion, which will not be an inexpensive machinery, in order to prove his claim for compensation. What is to happen the employee if he secures one week's work or two week's work during the three months immediately following the period of his discharge?  Would that operate to disqualify him until such time as he was for three months idle? I think this sub-section will impose a good deal of hardship, and I think it might reasonably have been deleted. The Minister might say then a person might walk out of one job and into another.  That would happen in very few cases, if any, and often the job he might walk into might not be a job in his own town.  He may have to go elsewhere; he may even have to go at a lower rate of wages than he was in receipt of in his previous employment after years of service.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister might consider the question of allowing him to make his claim for compensation much earlier than three months after the date of his discharge.  Even though he does get a job within three months, he may not get it in his own place; he may get it at a lower rate of wages and he certainly will be put to the expense of moving to one town from another. If he was married his three months' wages would hardly pay the expenses incidental to removing himself and his family from one town to another.  I think sub-section (d) might reasonably be deleted because, as it stands, it simply obliges the man to be idle and penniless, practically, for three months, before he could establish his claim for compensation.  After he has been idle and penniless he is put under the obligation of proving his case.  He could not do that unless he had some funds.</P>

      <P>I am glad to be able to congratulate the Minister on having at last received the felicitations of Deputy Lyons.  I want to call attention to another sub-section, without <Col N="459" /> quarrelling with Deputy Redmond's argument; that is sub-section 4 under which parties may be heard&mdash;the applicant, any holder of a licence and the Attorney-General.  Is it necessary to charge the Attorney-General with this duty?  Presumably he will not carry it out in person.  Presumably he will instruct counsel to appear on his behalf.  But in the aggregate these cases will be fairly numerous and this provision involves that all the papers in respect of all the cases will be sent to the Attorney-General's office and examined there.  I suggest to the Minister that the question might well be considered, before the Bill is finally dealt with, of substituting State Solicitors.  That would be a matter of decentralisation, but I think it might save the Attorney-General some unnecessary trouble.</P>

    <P>This is in the nature of a drafting amendment.  It provides that when compensation is being paid to a licence-holder at a time when he himself owes a levy for some preceding abolition, it should be competent to deduct the amount due by him from the compensation <Col N="460" /> moneys payable to him.

If it is a debt cognate to the money that is to be paid to him in the sense that it arises out of this process of extinction of licences then the amount of that debt may be stopped from the moneys payable to him.

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 22, before Section 48, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;48.&mdash;Whenever a licence is <Col N="461" /> abolished by an abolition order and the premises to which such licence was attached were held under a contract of tenancy, and were subject to a covenant, agreement or condition that the tenant of such premises should sell only intoxicating liquor purchased from or through his landlord (whether such covenant, agreement or condition extended to all intoxicating liquors or only to one or more particular class or classes of intoxicating liquor) then on and after the date of the abolition of such licence the standard rent of the said premises shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1923 (No. 19 of 1923), notwithstanding the fact that the case may come within the provisions of paragraph (a) of sub-section (1) of the said Section 1.</P>
    <P>In many cases tied tenants were charged less for the houses which they occupied than the full letting value of the houses, that being part of the brewer's arrangement for providing an outlet for his own produce.  If the licence is abolished and compensation paid to the tied house tenant, it would be obvious that this special letting arrangement should be ended; in other words, that the rent prior to the extinction of the licence was a special rent based on the business arrangement, that the brewer was getting the advantage and the facility of an outlet for his own special produce, and the rent arrived at in cases where any rent was paid at all, would be a rent based on a recognition of the business arrangement between the tenant licence holder and the brewer landlord.</P>
    <P>It may be taken that all these publichouses fall within the Rent Restrictions Act as dwelling houses.  It was represented to me that when the licence was abolished the house might be taken outside the Rent Restrictions Act, and vacant possession given to the landlord. While there is a certain amount in that, I feel that perhaps the most we should do is to enable the rent to be adjusted on the basis that there is no <Col N="462" /> longer any relationship of brewer and tied tenant existing.  The gist of the amendment is that the court can fix a standard rent for the house on the basis of what it would have been reasonably let for in 1914, if there was no question of tied tenancy involved, and if there was no question of a sale of intoxicating liquor in connection with the premises and a special business arrangement as between the tenant and the landlord brewer.  When you abolish the licence, then the whole basis on which the rent was arranged before that falls through, and it is reasonable to make the provision that the court can fix a rent after that special business arrangements has ceased to exist, the arrangement as between the tied tenant and the landlord brewer.</P>

      <P>At the same time, most of these tenancies, according to my information, are tenancies <Col N="463" /> from year to year and terminable, I think, on a three or six months' notice, but that does not very much matter, because they would be within the Rent Restrictions Act.  Really, the effect of this will be that after the licensee's means of livelihood is taken away, there will be a possibility of the rent being raised, because if the Court will have consideration, as is suggested here, of the altered circumstances by reason of the brewer not getting the advantage of having his liquor sold there, it is quite natural to suppose that the rent it considers a reasonable one will probably be greater than what it would have been if the licence remained.  It is a difficult matter about which to come to a fair conclusion.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly the brewer will not be in the same position, because his liquor will not be sold there, but, at the same time, I do not know that it will be possible for the Court to form much reasonable grounds for altering the rent.  It will be very difficult for it to say what these premises would have fetched in 1914 if there had been no licence attached.  It will really be largely guess-work.  For that reason it is not a provision with which one would be head over heels in love, but undoubtedly the brewer will have some right to have his new position reconsidered. I think, myself, that the basis the Court should go upon would be the possible reasonable rent of the premises without the licence from the date of the abolition of the licence and not from the year 1914.  However, I presume it is a matter of opinion.  As a result of this I only trust that the rents of these licensees, whose licences are being abolished, will not be systematically raised.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the amount paid annually by the tied publican to the brewer should be looked upon as a rent at all, because it is a kind of agreement between the publican and the brewer.  To my mind, the more important a house would be, and the more drink the publican would sell, the less rent he would be charged, because he would be of greater benefit to the brewer.  For that reason the amount payable annually to the brewer <Col N="464" /> from the publican can be no guide at all as to what rent should be if the house were taken under ordinary circumstances.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 23, Section 50, to add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) In this Part of this Act the expression &lsquo;sports club&rsquo; means a club within the meaning of and for the time being registered under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act, 1904, the main object of which is the promotion of any outdoor pastime, sport, game or recreation amongst its members.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come now to the amendments bearing on the question of sports clubs. This amendment provides for the definition of a sports club.  The important thing is contained in amendment 16, which shows the special provisions made for sports clubs.  On the last stage I indicated that I was satisfied that there was a case for having a somewhat different set of hours for outdoor sports clubs from the ordinary social club.  After defining a sports club in amendment 15 we move on, in amendment 16, to provide that a sports club shall be eligible to be registered under the Registration of Clubs Act, 1904, &ldquo;if, instead of complying with the appropriate provisions of the preceding section the rules of such club (in addition to the matters mentioned in Section 4 of the said Act) provide that no excisable liquor shall be supplied for consumption on the club premises to any person (other than a member of the club lodging in the club premises) or be consumed by any person (other than a member of the club lodging in the club premises) on any day (not being Sunday, Good Friday, Christmas Day or St. Patrick's Day) during the months of May, June and July, and before the hour of half-past twelve o'clock in the afternoon or after the hour of half-past ten in the evening.&rdquo; Those are the ordinary weekday hours.  In the summer time period the hours are from half-past twelve o'clock in the afternoon to 10.30 in the evening, and then during any month <Col N="465" /> other than the months of May, June and July half-past twelve o'clock in the afternoon or after the hour of 10 o'clock in the evening.</P>
    <P>Then, on any Sunday or Good Friday &ldquo;during a period appointed by or under the Summer Time Act 1925 ... to be a period of summer time at any time except during such stated period or periods not exceeding in the whole seven hours and not commencing before the hour of one o'clock in the afternoon and not ending after the hour of ten o'clock in the evening, (ii) during any time which is not appointed to be a period of summer time, before the hour of one o'clock in the afternoon or after the hour of eight o'clock in the evening, or (c) on St. Patrick's Day before the hour of one o'clock in the afternoon or after the hour of eight o'clock in the evening, or (d) on Christmas Day before the hour of twelve o'clock noon or after the hour of three o'clock in the afternoon.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You have set out there the hours considered reasonable for a club that fulfils the requirements of the previous amendment and comes within the definition of a sports club.  I am satisfied there is a case for special hours, for some adaptability of the hours, with regard to clubs that are genuine outdoor sports clubs, like golf clubs and others, and I recommend these hours to the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has put forward a very reasonable amendment.  However, he draws a distinction as between sub-section (a) and sub-section (b), applying summer time in sub-section (b) and a three months test in sub-section (a).  It would seem more natural to have stuck to summer time as distinct from ordinary time throughout.  There is no difference between July and August except, perhaps, at the very extreme end of August.  It would seem more of an improvement to have kept a clear distinction between summer time and what is not summer time in the whole section.</P>

      <P>Half-past ten is a very late hour and I am prepared to give that only for the three months <Col N="466" /> where you have the longest period of light.  The whole thing is an attempt to get at what the reasonable hours would be having regard to the time at which playing must cease because of failing light.  We have attempted to follow that very closely.  I am prepared only to give that half-past ten for three months and ten o'clock must suffice for the remainder of the year.</P>

      <P>This is a fairly obvious amendment.  When a person is allowed to trade, pending the result of the appeal, on deposit of the licence duty it is provided in the event of his failing he will not be entitled to get all the duty back; there will be retained by the State a proportion of the duty attributable to the period over which he was allowed to trade pending the result of the appeal.  I think that is a very reasonable provision.  It simply provides for an apportionment of the deposit in the event of the appeal failing. Some portion is retained in respect of the period over which he continued to trade.</P>

      <P>When I was introducing this Bill I expected it would have been non-controversial.  I think now that the Bill has been circulated probably there will not be much more discussion on it.  I think it was just because only the long title of the Bill was known certain Deputies took exception to it.  However, there was a discussion on the First Reading and a division was challenged.  Because of that discussion it will be necessary for me to make a statement dealing with the position, particularly the position of the Commissioner in Offaly who will be mainly affected by the Bill.</P>
      <P>In reply to a question by Deputy Davin on January 27th, 1926, I stated I was considering the possibility of having an election in Offaly at an early date.  The answer to that question provoked quite a number of resolutions from people interested in that particular county, and the burthen of all these resolutions was to continue the Commissioner for some time longer. I gave a good deal of consideration to those representations and, as a result, I decided to retain the Commissioner for some time longer.  My action in doing so has been criticised and in order to justify what I did on that occasion it will be necessary for me to give some account of the stewardship of that Commissioner in Offaly.</P>

    <P>At the time the Commissioner took over office in Offaly the rate on agricultural land was between 5/6 and 6/5 in the £, and on other hereditaments it was from 7/- to 8/- in the £.  The general rate for the current year to the 31st March, 1927, was on land 6/9½, and on other hereditaments 6/10½.  This latter rate represents a reduction of £3,000 odd on the levy for the previous year.  The levy for March, 1928, is down by over £3,000 as compared with the levy on the 31st March, 1927.  Since he took office the Commissioner in Offaly has succeeded in reducing the rates by over £6,000.  With attenuated resources he has achieved important results. As regards rates, the Commissioner inherited from the Council a legacy of £44,000 uncollected on the <Col N="470" /> 30th September, 1924.  In March, 1926 the uncollected rates amounted to £16,389.  That was lodged in the following month.  I might add that by March, 1925, all previously irrecoverable arrears had been got in, and the outstanding rates in March, 1925, were in respect of that half-year only.</P>
    <P>In the matter of overdraft, the liability to the bank on current account for the year ending 30th September 1924, was £30,766.  The overdraft on the 31st March, 1926, was £16,336, notwithstanding the fact that the overdraft was reduced by a sum of £14,000 odd and the unpaid debts of the Council and the abolished unions which the Council had failed to discharge were paid off.  These amounted to £25,000 for the half-year ending March, 1925. In the half-year ending March, 1926, the debts of the dissolved rural district councils were reduced to the amount of £11,600, and these debts were further reduced on the 30th September, 1926, to £6,226.  On the 31st March, 1927, it is estimated that the assets will exceed the liabilities by £13,000.  It is clear that up to March, 1926, the work of the Commissioner generally was concerned with putting the finances of the Council on a proper footing.  As has been pointed out, the overdraft of £30,766 on the 30th September, 1924, was reduced in March. 1926, to £16,333.  I considered it was unwise to determine the period of office of the Commissioner until the overdraft had been cleared off, the rates collected, and until the other business of the Council was in such a way that it could be handed over in a proper way to the County Council.  The road administration is a fair example of this. Under the County Council, from February, 1922, to September, 1924, the mileage of roads steamrolled was 7½ miles.  From September, 1924, to March, 1927, under the Commissioner, 51½ miles have been steamrolled.  Similarly the number of men employed on the roads has been steadily increased. For the half year ending 30th September, 1923, the number of men employed was 234.  For the half-year ending 30th September, 1924, there were employed under the County Council 401 men on the roads.  Under the <Col N="471" /> Commissioner for the half-year ending 30th September, 1925, there were employed 751 men, and in the half-year ending September, 1926, under the Commissioner, the number of men employed was 1,110.</P>
    <P>The wiping out of the overdraft, the collecting of the arrears of rate, the increase in the steam-rolled road mileage and in the number of men employed, apart altogether from the re-building and re-furnishing of the courthouse just completed, the re-building of the county bridges and the repairs of the county home, etc., are plain facts which would satisfy any fair-minded, reasonable man that the case for the reversion to the county councillors in 1926 required very careful consideration, and that in deciding not to withdraw the Commissioner in 1926, my judgment was abundantly justified.</P>
    <P>I felt it necessary to make that statement, in view of the criticisms and certain suggestions that were made here on the occasion of the First Reading of this Bill.  The matter is really not a strictly pertinent one to the present issue, as irrespective of whether the Commissioner was a success or a failure in his job, it would be ludicrous to insist on two elections where one would serve the same purpose.  Under Section 72 of the Act of 1925 it will be necessary, as a result of the amendment passed to that section, to hold elections in Offaly County and for the Urban Councils of Tipperary and Cobh in September next.  The cost of the election for Offaly would amount to £600. Without this Bill I would be forced to hold another election for the urban authorities in January of the following year and for the Offaly Co. Council and the other county councils in June of next year.  That would mean that the ratepayers there would be put to the expense and inconvenience of holding two elections for the same purpose within a few months of each other. Apart from the expense altogether, it is doubtful if you could get candidates to go up for such a short period.  It is merely with a view to obviating an obvious anomaly that this Bill is introduced and that I ask for a Second Reading for it.  There is no principle of any kind involved.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to what he terms criticisms on the First Stage of this measure.  I do not think anybody offered any real criticism, because there was no opportunity to do so.  I merely asked the Minister whether he was requested by responsible bodies representative of the ratepayers to hold an election within a certain period.  The Minister's reply was that that matter was receiving his consideration, and as far as I knew his sympathetic consideration. I did that because I was made aware of the fact that, for instance, the Farmers' Union&mdash;and they did represent, I suppose, a section of the ratepayers&mdash;and other bodies representative of certain ratepayers were demanding an election for the county council.  I never suggested to the Minister, neither privately nor publicly, that the Commissioner was unfit to carry on the work.  I am not going to do so now because, so far as I know and so far as my knowledge and experience go, I would never suggest that he was not capable to conduct the affairs of the council in the same way as the very best county council that we in the ordinary way could get would conduct it. I think my colleagues on this side of the House suggested a dislike for the Bill merely because of the title of the Bill.  There was another reason and that was the speech made by the Minister himself to his constituents in Thurles some time ago, where he foreshadowed an extension of the present Commissioner system.  I gather now, however, from what he has said that he does not intend to go on these lines. He has certainly given some reasonable justification for the powers asked for in the present Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the position is as indicated by the Minister, I certainly would not think that we would be justified in opposing the Bill, but if the Minister has in mind an extension of the principle of the present Commissioner system, apart from the powers sought in the Bill, I think we would be obliged to take a different view of his attitude. I do not know how one must weigh the statements of Ministers when speaking to their constituents against <Col N="473" /> statements made in the Dáil, but there is certainly a contradiction as regards the statement, to which I refer, made by the Minister in Thurles and the attitude which he has adopted this evening.  When the Minister is replying perhaps he will say whether he has changed his mind in regard to his statement made in Thurles.  I want to make it quite clear, so far as I am concerned, that the Commissioner who is administering the affairs of Offaly has done good work, and the statement of the Minister is proof of that.  So far as the opinion of labour people in Offaly is concerned, there is no reason for grumbling at the manner in which he has carried out his work.  That does not, however, get away from the fact that the Offaly County Council was abolished for purely political reasons, namely, that at the time it was under the control of the Republican element, which was not amenable to instructions issued by the Department of Local Government.  If the election was held now or in the near future as is proposed in the Bill, such a state of affairs would not, I think, exist.  On grounds of principle, I think you should revert to the old system of allowing the ratepayers to elect their own representatives, to administer the affairs of the county council, not only in Offaly, but elsewhere. In view of the reasons given by the Minister I personally would not feel justified in opposing the proposals in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear that Deputy Davin appreciates the work done by the Commissioner in Offaly. In regard to his expression of opinion as to my object in putting a Commissioner into Offaly, he is rather wide of the mark.  I had no political object in doing so.  It was done merely because of the fact that the council had got into a bad way financially.  It was to straighten out the situation that the Commissioner was sent, and I think he has justified his appointment.  I am glad to hear that the Deputy is not opposing the Bill, but I do not want him to expect me, as a result of that, as a quid pro quo, to retract anything I said with regard to Commissioners. <Col N="474" /> From my experience of them, I think they have proved a great success.</P>
      <P>If we had a longer period of office before us and had time before the election to introduce a comprehensive measure, it is possible that I would introduce a measure extending the principle of Commissioners, particularly with regard to certain county boroughs, such as Cork, Limerick, Waterford and, of course, Dublin. That, however, would be a very big measure and would require a lot of time for consideration.  I would not think of putting in Commissioners unless they were in some way responsible to an advisory body.  That matter would take a great deal of thinking out.  It is a very big problem, altogether removed from the proposal in this Bill.  I have no intention of bringing forward such a measure during the present session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister for Industry and Commerce makes his statement, I want to call attention to a point of order.  I suggest, in the first place, that this is really a Private Bill.  The existing powers of the railway companies are conferred on them by Acts which were promoted by Private Bills, and a measure extending those powers should also be promoted as a Private Bill in order to give an opportunity to those interests that may be affected by the measure being heard.  It will be in the recollection of the Dáil that two years ago, when the Dublin United Tramways Company wished to obtain precisely similar <Col N="475" /> powers to those contained in the Bill, it was necessary for them to proceed by way of Private Bill legislation.  I suggest that this is an occasion on which the same procedure should be followed.  Failing that, in the event of your ruling against me on that point, I want to call your further attention to Standing Order 52 in regard to Private Bill procedure, which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a Public Bill (not being a Bill to confirm a Provisional Order) is ordered to be read a Second Time in either House, on a day appointed, and it appears to the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil, or the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, that the Standing Orders relative to Private Bills should be applicable to the Bill, the House may refer the Bill to the Examiner, who shall examine the Bill ...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would like your ruling on the question as to whether this is not a Bill to which Standing Orders relative to Private Bills should apply.  I have given my reasons, but I should reaffirm that this is a measure affecting many interests, that it was introduced only last week, and though only made available for the public on Friday, Deputies have already received numerous representations from various interests that will be affected by it.  I suggest that it would be desirable to allow those interests to be heard by Counsel, or otherwise, according to the procedure arranged for Private Bills.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooper has just avoided saying that this is a Private Bill.  He said that it should have been a Private Bill.  If he intended to imply that this must be treated as a Private Bill, I would ask him to read the definition of a Private Bill.  I think he would then see that his contention could not stand.  According to Standing Order No. 1, &ldquo;Every Bill promoted for the particular interest or benefit of any person, or that interferes with the private property of any person, otherwise than in the interests of the public generally and as a measure of public policy, shall be treated as a Private Bill.&rdquo;  I think that that last phrase rules this out from being considered as a Private Bill. <Col N="476" /> Deputy Cooper puts it to you that you should rule that the Standing Orders relative to Private Bills should be made applicable to this Bill.  I do not know on what ground you should so rule.</P>

      <P>The Deputy urged certain considerations as an argument to sway your judgment in coming to a decision as to whether the Standing Orders referring to Private Bills should be applicable to this measure.  One of these arguments was that private interests concerned should be allowed to appear.  What private interest is concerned in this?  The Deputy raised an analogy of the Dublin United Tramway Company's Bill.  If that Bill had been introduced, not for the benefit of the Dublin tramway system alone, but for all the tramway systems in the country I doubt if it would be considered as a Private Bill. As to private interest, with regard to this measure, I know of none.  I know of common rights which certain motor buses associations have in common with myself, if I liked to run a motor bus on the road.</P>

      <P>On the first point as to whether this is a Private Bill, I think the definition of a Private Bill is quite plain, as given in Standing Order No. 1.  This is a Bill for the purpose of conferring on all railways in the State certain powers, as a measure of public policy.  The procedure under the Standing Orders would appear to be that the House should be allowed to decide by taking the Second Reading in the House in the ordinary way, as to whether it agrees that policy does not dictate that certain principles should be affirmed.  With regard to the applicability of Standing Order 52, it would have to be shown. I think, to the Chair that the Bill proposes to interfere with the private property of some person before that Standing Order could be made applicable. It does not appear to me that the Bill interferes with the private property of any person, but if Deputy <Col N="477" /> Cooper has any point to make on that question I would be glad to hear it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that this Bill, <i>inter alia</i>, interferes with the private property of the Dublin United Tramways Company, who have a right to run trams between Kingsbridge and Westland Row, and this Bill would empower the railway company to place buses in competition with the trams.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the Tramways Company are allowed by statute to run trams from Westland Row to Kingsbridge does not mean that they have a private property within the meaning of Standing Order 1.  They are not secured against competition and, as a matter of fact, when the Tramways Company were applying by Private Bill for power to run buses, other bus owners, against whom the company were going into competition, were not heard before the Private Bill Committee.  If it were proposed in the Bill to take something from the powers already conferred on the Dublin United Tramways Company, then the question of the applicability of Standing Order 52 would arise.  I do not say how it would be decided, but in this case I cannot see any such intention.  At present any citizen can run buses in competition with the Tramways Company.  The Bill proposes to add to these persons the railway companies.  On the other hand, if the Southern Railways desired to build another line from Dublin to Greystones, say, further inland than the present line, they would have to proceed by way of Private Bill, as they would be interfering with the private property of certain persons whose lands they would have to go through. This being a measure applying to all the railways in the country, and a measure of public policy, it appears to me to be a Public Bill and not a Private Bill, not even a hybrid Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The justification for this Bill can be quite simply stated. The position at the moment in regard <Col N="478" /> to road transport is, that anyone can put a motor service on the road on complying with certain general conditions. These general conditions are under law, the administration of which lies either in the Department of Local Government or in the Department of Justice.  There seems to be no good reason why the railway companies should not have the same rights as everybody else with regard to road transport and motor services on the road, if two conditions are safeguarded and if, in addition to that, benefit seems likely to accrue to the public. The two conditions to be safeguarded are, first, that the general intention of the Railways Act of 1924 shall be carried out, and that the intention of that Act be safeguarded by not allowing any raising of rates or any reduction of revenue by reason of motor services being entered on by the railway company, where they are not able to meet competition of services already in existence.</P>
      <P>Secondly, there must be security that the Railway Company shall not, by virtue of their larger financial resources and their situation generally in regard to transport, secure what would amount to a monopoly detrimental to the public.  Having shown that that can be done, and that benefit is likely to accrue to the public by better service by road and rail, then there is not merely no objection to the railway company getting these powers but there is a definite case in favour of these powers being given.  The safeguards regarding the two points I have dealt with are contained in various sections of the Bill.  The safeguard with regard to the intention of the Railways Act is contained in Section 10 of the Bill, where it is stated: &ldquo;A road motor service run by a railway company under this Act shall for the purposes of the Railways Act, 1924, be deemed to be a business carried on by the company ancillary or subsidiary to its railway, the charges for which are not subject to the jurisdiction of the Railway Tribunal.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That means the reaction of Section 53 of the Railways Act of 1924, on Section 10 of this Act amounts to this: that the standard revenue would have <Col N="479" /> to be fixed when taking into consideration any loss accruing from badly-run motor services under the control of the railway company.  The Railway Tribunal, in fixing the standard revenue and charges, would have to consider what could have been earned if the services had been properly run.  The reaction of Section 53 of the Railways Act on this section ensures no entering by the railway company into competition with established road services unless they see that they can derive revenue from it.  With regard to the safeguarding against monopoly, that arises in various ways through the Bill. First, through the approval of routes, and on that there are certain safeguards against lowering railway revenue and the necessity that might arise thereafter for increasing rates.</P>
    <P>The approval of routes, with other matters, secures against any monopoly that might be apprehended from the operations of this Bill.  The routes over which the service is run must be approved by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, after consultation, as the section stands, with the Minister for Local Government.  In addition to that, there has to be a series of maximum charges placed before, and sanctioned by, first of all, the Rates Advisory Committee, and, secondly, the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Thirdly, there is the stipulation that once a road motor service has been instituted by the railway company, it cannot be withdrawn except with the approval of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain the reason that that is put into the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is put in to prevent monopoly.  The fourth point is that, if the railway company has established road motor services and the maximum rate is charged on a particular road, that rate cannot be increased without the approval of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  These last two sections, to which I have referred, are meant to have this effect.  They are meant to guard against a very obvious danger, namely, that the railway company might put on the roads a service of motors to beat competition in a particular <Col N="480" /> district and, having beaten it, either withdraw the road service, leaving the area no longer served, or raise the charges to the maximum, as fixed by the Rates Advisory Committee. Two points have to be guarded against, namely, a lowering of rate and running at a loss over a particular period in order to ensure the defeat of some competitor on the roads and, having secured his defeat, either withdraw the service under the auspices of the railway company or raise the rate which was at first instituted.</P>
      <P>These two things being guarded, in addition to the approval of the rates, I do not see that there can be any apprehension as to what is being described as the monopoly that is certain to be granted to the railway companies by reason of this measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that can be done either.  If there is a gap in the Bill in that respect we can amend it to meet the point.  Certainly our desire is to ensure that it will not be possible for railway companies to enter into a district simply for the purpose of beating competition, and having done that then to diminish the railway service or raise the rates or withdraw the service altogether.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I had thought that the question of the withdrawal of service altogether would have given me power to deal with such things as the nature of the service that is referred to in the section dealing with the approval of routes.  There has to be given to the Minister particulars of the routes over which it is proposed to run a service as well as particulars of the nature of the service. If that section seems to be too vague and does not include such things as would be included in relation to railway companies&mdash;sometimes described as the running of a Parliamentary train with the minimum number of services per day or for a particular period&mdash;then the Bill can <Col N="481" /> be made more explicit on that point. I put it, however, that both these things are safeguarded and that it is the intention to do so.  If these two points are safeguarded: That the railways themselves shall not be allowed to lose money by reason of competition which they cannot meet, and secondly that the public are protected against a monopoly, then I say there is no reason whatever for refusing to allow the railway companies rights which everybody else in the country has with the solitary exception of the railway companies.  If, in addition to that, the result of this Bill is to give the public a chance of a better service, either by rail or by road or both, than what they can get at the moment, then there is the positive reason why that advantage should be allowed to them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>They have very limited powers which are derived from certain old Acts.  One is the Act of the old Great Southern and Western Railway, and the other an Act obtained by the Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway Company&mdash;one in 1900 and the other in 1903.  These Acts gave them powers to run as between their hotels and their stations and to places of interest in the neighbourhood.  The Midland Great Western Railway Act of 1903 also gave those powers, and, in addition, contained a phrase to run a motor service in extension of the road service. That power has been very definitely limited.  Such powers as the railway companies at present possess are old powers that came over to them, and are not sufficient to enable them to meet the competition that they are now up against.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any prohibition in any of these Acts against the running of buses by railway companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because the railway people definitely got the power only to run the buses for specific purposes and along specified roads, and until positive power was given <Col N="482" /> them by some Act they were definitely precluded from the roads.  It is to be observed that a proposal in the Bill under Section 12 is to bring to an end whatever existing statutory powers the railway companies have at the moment. Then there is a small point.  It is in order that when instructions and orders are given with regard to the keeping of accounts in the future, the road accounts must be kept entirely separate from the railway accounts. If the present powers that the railway companies have with regard to roads were continued it would mean that the accounts could not be definitely segregated, and there would be a great deal of mixing up with the road services which were not previously allowed.</P>
      <P>If the public get the extra benefit by reason of these powers, then there is all the greater reason why the powers should be given.  There are two reasons why the powers proposed can serve the public.  The first is that they will enable a district not at present served by any sort of railway, not directly connected with a railway system, to be connected hereafter with a railway system by means of a road service operated under the railway companies, so that a through rate can be given from districts now unserved as far as railway service is concerned.  In that way a district can be brought closer in touch with the railway systems of the country.  The second point is that giving the railways those powers will mean in the end, I do not say it will mean at the beginning, the elimination of all unnecessary overlapping.  It will also take away any competition which is not advantageous to the public in the long run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be an apprehension that the railways will be enabled to give a motor service, after getting those powers, against which the present private motor owners cannot compete. That seems to me only to indicate the fear that the railway companies will, in fact, be able to give a cheaper service under the heavier conditions laid on them under this Act&mdash;heavier conditions than any private motor owner has to submit to at present.  I think that it will be able to give a service better than the private motor owners at the moment <Col N="483" /> can give.  If the railway companies are enabled to do that, then the public will be protected against a monopoly, while the railway companies themselves would be safeguarded against a lowering of their revenue by reason of injudicious action.  The public have the right to get the benefit of the cheapest possible transport.</P>
    <P>There are two other matters that I would like to refer to.  One is the competition that is going on at the moment, competition between a system which has to finance completely the upkeep and the maintenance and repair of its own permanent highway and which cost the Great Southern Railways a sum of nearly £700,000 last year, and in competition with that particular type of service you have a road service, not having to pay the complete cost either of the building or the upkeep of its permanent way.</P>
    <P>There was a line of policy indicated here last year which, subject to modification and according to circumstances, amounted to this: that the contribution from the general rates towards the roads was to be stabilised at a particular percentage addition over what was paid from the rates in 1914; that the expenditure on roads over and above that figure should, for the future, be met by taxation on motor vehicles, and to that extent, and only to that extent, to which roads are not subsidised by the general rates, private motor owners have to bear the cost of their highway.  The amount of the subvention to the motor owners for the upkeep of their particular track is a very big thing, and it seems unfair that the railway companies should have to pay a sum amounting to £700,000 for the upkeep of their highway, and then be put in competition with people who have not to pay for the upkeep of their particular highway more than fifty per cent. of the cost of building and upkeep, and that at the same time the railway companies should be prohibited from using the highway of their rivals, towards which they pay a certain amount by way of rates.  Objection may be raised that the railway companies, by running a motor service over the roads, will add to the <Col N="484" /> wear and tear on the roads, and that this will involve extra cost as regards their upkeep, and that this wear and tear is going to increase road expenditure, and further that that expenditure will have to be met by motor taxation. In so far as that works out to be true, a proportion of it will fall upon whatever road vehicles the railway companies put on the roads, so that they will be given no superiority over their rivals in the matter of easy terms. On the other hand they are being bound by certain conditions which no private motor owner at present is being subjected to.  You start off with certain general conditions with regard to licences, the speed per hour, and with regard to certain types of vehicles.  All that is common both to the ordinary road motor vehicle and those to be used by the railway companies.  Outside that the ordinary private motor owner is free from restrictions.  The railway company is being put in a freer position than it exists in at the moment, where it is entirely prohibited from the road.</P>
    <P>It is given power to compete with the others, subject to these conditions: approval of routes, maximum charges, rates once charged not to be raised without the approval of the Minister, and a service once instituted not to be withdrawn without the approval of the Minister.  They are onerous conditions, but are put in to prevent any monopoly accruing to the railway companies on account of their big financial resources, their terminals and their general services. I think it is a matter of most elementary justice that the railway companies should be given this right, particularly at a period when they are subject to such keen competition from road motor users, and if there is not sufficient safeguarding in this measure with regard to the thing that seems to be feared and ought to be protected against, that is the question of monopoly. I would be very satisfied to have any further checks pointed out which can, with reason, be put on the railway companies.  I ask those who are afraid of monopoly to take into account and to look at the other side of the question, and that is, what position the railway companies will be put in in comparison <Col N="485" /> with their rivals, having those conditions imposed upon them, and to see if the conditions imposed do not go as far as is practicable to remove the fear generally expressed with regard to monopoly.</P>

      <P>I do not think any Deputy will complain if we are asked to take into consideration the position of these railway companies.  I quite agree it is a serious one which requires to be met, but I am not going to suggest, and I have no hope of suggesting anything convincingly to the Minister that would make him believe that this is the wrong way of dealing with the situation.  It was, and is, unjust that railway companies should be compelled to pay rates to support roads which are being used by their competitors and from which they derive no benefit.  If the Minister proposed to relieve them of that liability I would support him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>It is frequently complained of if it is not very heavy. If the Minister proposes to compel the other companies, who are using the roads regularly, by placing motor services on the roads, to pay by increased taxation, and I think petrol taxation would be the best way to make them pay, I would support that.  But I suggest we should not be too quick to give the measure a Second Reading.  The implications are greater than one would gather from the Minister's speech. To begin with, many more interests are affected than those suggested by the Minister.  For instance, apprehension is being created in the minds of those who, either for pleasure or profit, remove furniture.  They anticipate that the railway companies will place on the roads a fleet of motor furniture vans and compete with the ordinary furniture remover, whose capital is comparatively small.  That is a question which requires looking into, and I have not had time to look into it. As Deputies know, this Bill was only printed on Friday, has been available to the public only for two days, and they have already begun to shower protests on it.  Other bodies have to be considered when we are making provision for increased motor traffic, and <Col N="486" /> those are the county councils and local authorities.  When the Dublin United Tramways Company were promoting a Bill in order to enable them to run motor buses, the county councils of Dublin and Wicklow both appeared before the Private Bill Committee and secured concessions, but by legislating in this manner it is not open to the county councils to make any representations. They have to shoulder the burden of increased motor traffic, because otherwise it will be ineffective and nugatory, without any power of placing their views.</P>
      <P>The Minister dealt with safeguards. I think he has been so anxious to safeguard that he has made the Bill a dangerous gift to the railway companies, for some of those safeguards imposed in the Bill may be used by a Labour Minister for Industry and Commerce, and some day there will be a Labour Minister for Industry and Commerce, as a means of exercising pressure on the railway companies for concessions as regards wages and conditions of labour.  The Minister can, if he chooses, without any appeal whatever, compel railway companies to continue to run services that are not paying at rates that are not economic.  There is no provision to prevent that.  Of course, I know Ministers assume, as Ministers always assume, that their official life is eternal.  In this case we are legislating for all time, and we must make allowance for possible changes in the Executive Council.  I think railway companies themselves would be well advised to reflect whether it is wise to accept this gift, shackled down by these provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I am anxious if possible that we should have a little more consideration before we come finally to a decision on this subject.  What is the most trouble in the Saorstát to-day is lack of business enterprise, that people will not invest their capital in new enterprises in their own country.  It is necessary, therefore, for the State to step in by subsidy in one or another case which ought to be left to the normal working of private enterprise.  One of the few directions in which business enterprise has been exemplified is in the matter of the owners of lorries and motor buses. They have invested their capital.  They <Col N="487" /> have struck out in a new direction, and now this is the State's reply to them. I admit that not a great deal has been done, and that motor road transport is in its infancy here compared with Northern Ireland.  I do not know Northern Ireland as well as the Minister, but I was very much impressed the last time I was in Belfast with the number of motor buses and char-a-bancs going to all parts of the country.  So far as I know no similar measure has been introduced in Northern Ireland where, undoubtedly, motor competition is much keener.  The same state of affairs exists in Italy.  I think it exists in France, and yet we alone, where motor transport is comparatively in its infancy, are legislating to set up and to allow competition of a powerfully endowed competitor.  I want to impress on the Dáil, not only in this specific instance, but as a principle, that government interference with private enterprise is going eventually to kill private enterprise.  How are you going to overcome the reluctance of capital to come forward and of Irishmen to invest money in their own country when there is an impression abroad that the Government is ready, without adequate consideration, to interfere with and alter the conditions under which that capital was invested?  It is a real danger, and I think the Ministers, in their desire to do well, for I have always credited them with the desire to do well, are sometimes slow to realise that their rebukes of Irish investors and Irish business men are not fully justified because they themselves are contributors to the state of affairs in which the investor of capital or promoter of industry is bound to think, not once or twice, but half a dozen times before he takes a decisive step.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cooper seems to have got the impression that this measure is making provision for railway legislation for all time.  I sincerely hope and believe that that is not the intention, for the reason that the Government do not appear to have given that amount of consideration to this or any other measure dealing with the transport problem which would lead one to think that they were legislating <Col N="488" /> for all time.  I may say, for Deputy Cooper's information, that this is the fourth measure dealing with railways and introduced since 1924.  In addition to that, the Minister for Justice stated the other day that there was an inter-Departmental Committee at present dealing with the traffic problem as a whole.  Therefore we may anticipate that if the Minister for Justice remains here until the report of that Committee appears we shall have another measure introduced.  I believe that this measure is merely fooling with the problem of regulating the development of road motor services and, generally speaking, is only tinkering with the general transport problem.  In my opinion the Bill will lead to more chaos in the transport industry.  You have here a Bill that, generally speaking, is necessary, giving authority and power to the railway companies to run bus services in order to meet competition brought about by modern transport requirements. Very extensive and autocratic powers are being sought in this measure by the Minister fixing maximum charges and regulating approved routes, but the people who will compete with the railway companies in the future may run buses without any of the restrictions laid down for the railway companies in this Bill.  I want to know if the Minister or his Department have given any consideration&mdash; perhaps the Minister for Local Government might be interested in this too&mdash;to the problem of transport as a whole.  The Department of Industry and Commerce, more than any other, should be responsible for this.  I should like to know why the railway companies in the consultations which they must have had with the Minister and his officials in 1924 did not then seek the powers now being sought by the Minister on their behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Did this question arise when the whole problem of railway legislation was under consideration in 1924?  Did the railway companies previous to this make any representations to the Minister on the matter?  Why has he delayed so long in view of the growing competition from private bus services before bringing in a measure of this kind?  I believe, and it is the general <Col N="489" /> opinion of experienced railway men, that the railway managements have not given that careful consideration to modern transport requirements which they should have given in view of the growing problem that faces them. There may be some reason for it.  We all know that previous to 1924, there was a certain amount of domestic disturbance within the various railway boards which made them think more about the pending railway legislation than about the growing competition with which they were faced as a result of the increase in motor bus services which has been gradually decreasing the revenue of the railways for the last four or five years.  The fault to a great extent for the position as it exists to-day and as it concerns the railway companies lies with the railway boards, but the Minister has a responsibility which he cannot disclaim. As I said, this measure is only one of four introduced since 1924, and perhaps we will have a fifth later on, and is leading to more chaos which shows clearly that the Minister's Department has not given any careful consideration to the whole transport problem, and the problem as a whole is bound up with the rights and powers sought in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as I have stated, is singularly autocratic.  The Minister is to decide whether or not a particular railway motor service is to be run. He is to consult, but he need not secure the agreement of the Minister for Local Government.  He need not consult anybody else.  How is it that words are put into the Bill which mean nothing: &ldquo;in consultation with the Minister for Local Government&rdquo;? The Minister himself is the final authority in deciding what is to be the approved route.</P>

I believe the position to-day would justify the establishment of some such body, at least in an advisory capacity.  Personally, I believe that a small representative body, with or without direct interests in the question of transport, would be more competent to give consideration to the matter than the Minister would. I want to know definitely from the Minister whether he is prepared to admit that a railway company has under its existing powers the right to close down a section of the line if it is not paying.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Have they not, under their present powers, the right to close down any section of the Great Southern Railways?  Is that the reason why the Minister puts into the Bill a section to the effect that a railway company running a bus service over an approved route cannot withdraw that bus service without certain penalties being imposed on them by the Minister?  If the railway company can make use of that for the purpose of closing down a <Col N="491" /> branch of its line and substitute a bus service, what provision is the Minister making for the staff who may be displaced or become redundant as a result of such decision on the part of the company? I believe the company have power to do that.  If they have not, the Minister can contradict me.  This Bill makes provision for buses to be run under the supervision of the railway companies.  I want to know why a section has not been inserted making it obligatory on the part of a railway company proposing to run a bus service to have the buses built in this country.  Questions have been brought up here from time to time regarding the importation of railway material and the Minister declined to interfere with the railway companies in importing rolling stock.  I understand the Dublin Tramways Company have built buses here and have found it profitable to do so.  Therefore, there is no justification for the railway companies importing buses into the country.  The Minister may be aware&mdash;he can find it out if he is not&mdash;that the workmen in the workshops at Inchicore have only been working four days per week for a considerable time past.  I want to know if the Minister is going to allow the railway companies to import those buses while three or four thousand men have been working short time over a long period. I should like to know if the Minister is prepared to introduce an amendment to provide against that, and thereby provide employment for the railway employees who are at present working short time.</P>
      <P>I should also like to have an explanation with regard to sub-section (7) of Section 4, which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in this section, a railway company shall not, without the permission of the Minister, demand or take in respect of a road motor service run by it under this Act any charges for any traffic exceeding the lowest charges theretofore demanded and taken by such company for such traffic on such services.</P>

These rates in operation when the introduction of this bus service took place were, for third-class return fare from Cavan to Dublin, 27/8, and 14 days after the introduction of the bus service this was reduced to 10/-.  I want to know from the Minister whether the railway company will be prevented from reverting to a rate other than the 10/- here for Dublin to Cavan as a result of the powers sought under this particular sub-section of the Bill?  The fares referred to are not properly understood by ordinary persons.  The fare of 10/- that came into operation as a result of the Dublin to Cavan bus service being instituted, and which is referred to in this particular document, is only a temporary railway fare, a one day rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will answer it.  The Minister has referred to the fact that the railway companies spent upon maintenance works last year the sum of £710,000. He is also aware that, in addition to that, they had to pay rates for the upkeep of the roads used by the bus services in competition with the railways to the extent of £150,000&mdash;I am speaking here from memory&mdash;and that includes rates on buildings as well as rates for the upkeep of the roads.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The rates applicable to roads are very much less.  The amount is under £45,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand also the amount of money set aside for construction and maintenance of roads in the Free State for the financial year ending on the 31st March this year is £1,250,000 from rates and £1,250,000 from State sources.  Therefore Deputies will quite clearly see the huge amount of expenditure that has to be provided in present circumstances for the construction and maintenance of roads, and that amount has largely increased during the past three or four years by reason of the abuse of the <Col N="494" /> roads by heavy motor lorries, and also by the increased number of motor cars.</P>
      <P>I believe personally this measure is only tinkering with the whole problem; that the Minister himself or some other Minister or Executive Council in the near future will have to sit down and grapple with this transport problem in a much more careful manner than it has been dealt with.</P>
      <P>I am not personally opposing this measure, because I believe the railway companies at any rate are at least entitled to the same powers to use the roads for which they have to provide a certain amount of money for upkeep in the same way as the motor people are entitled to use them without restriction of any kind.  The fact is that if this Bill passes bus services can be instituted by private companies or individuals without any restrictions as to routes or any limitation as to maximum fares.  But here in this Bill the Minister imposes on railway companies that intend to run bus services in future very severe restrictions with regard to routes as well as maximum fares.  Why does not the Minister face the whole situation and take control of the fares and routes at present used by private companies?  If he did that he would give some indication that he was making an honest attempt to deal with the transport problem as a whole, and not impose severe restrictions on railway companies proposing to run buses, while having practically no restrictions whatever upon other companies at present using the roads without any limitation with regard to maximum fares and, further, no supervision as regards the routes being used.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture if he is aware that acute congestion exists in the Balla district, County Mayo, and what steps, if any, have been taken by the Irish Land Commission to acquire the large grazing ranches on the Blosse estate, held by Messrs.  Cassidy and Browne, Poolavaddy, Balla, for the relief of the holders of uneconomic holdings in that district.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture whether he is aware that the lands in the townlands of Carrownagleragh and Carrareagh, on the Ormsby estate, Kiltimagh, County Mayo, were acquired by the Congested Districts Board in 1910; that the lands are not yet vested, and that the tenants are unable to get loans for building houses, etc., because of the failure of the Irish Land Commission to have the holdings vested; if he will state what steps, if any, have been taken to vest those lands, and if all moneys paid in excess of annuities since 1910 will be refunded to the tenants on that estate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The lands of Carrownagleragh and Carrareagh referred to situate on the estate of Anthony Ormsby were acquired by the late Board and vested in them on 1st January, 1917.  The Board also acquired in December, 1918, the tenancy interest in a small holding on these townlands and a large holding in the townland of Coolaght situate on the same estate, and afterwards had the lands striped and allotted.  The allottees, who had surrendered lands and were given new holdings, were not allowed by the adjoining landholders to occupy the portions of the new holdings in the townland of Coolaght.  This matter was settled quite recently, when lands on the Ormsby Demesne, acquired under the Land Act, 1923, were being divided, and the Land Commission is now in a position to proceed with the sale.</P>
