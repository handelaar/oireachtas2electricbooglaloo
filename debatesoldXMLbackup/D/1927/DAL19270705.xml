      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether the expenditure of the Limerick County Council functioning from 1920 to 1925 exceeded its receipts, and, if so, (a) whether such excess was greater or less than a quarter of a million pounds, and by how much; (b) what preventive or corrective measures were adopted by the Department during such period to check such administration; (c) what was the financial situation, in form of balance-sheet or equivalent, of the Limerick County Council as at the end of March, 1925; and (d) what steps has the Department since taken for the relief of the ratepayers from such situation, and what measures, if any, are now proposed.</P>

      <P>From inquiries made from the County Council the excess of expenditure over receipts for the period 1920-1925 was £142,078. From this figure there must, however, be deducted the sum of £47,632, being the total amount of rates uncollected at 31st March, 1925.  The Department has no statutory authority to apply preventive or corrective measures to the administration other than the measures concerning audit of the accounts and the powers conferred in Section 72 of the Local Government Act of 1925.  As regards the third portion of the question the excess of cash liabilities over <Col N="364" /> cash assets on 31st March, 1925, was £59,993.  The impasse caused in the affairs of the Council is receiving the anxious consideration of the Council, who are acting energetically in the matter under legal advice.  I am satisfied that everything possible will be done by them to retrieve at the earliest possible moment the unusual situation which has been created, and the Department will co-operate with the Council in every way possible.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture whether he is aware that Inspectors of his Department will not allow eggs to be exported in boxes made from home-grown timber; whether this regulation will have serious effects on the sawmill industry in the State, and whether he is further aware that as a result of the rejection by his Department of egg boxes made from home-grown timber at Lord Sligo's Sawmills, Westport, these mills are about to be closed down and fourteen men, several of them with families, disemployed.</P>

      <P>Under the Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Act, 1924, there is no bar against the use of native timber in the manufacture of standard egg cases.  The only stipulation set out in the regulations made under the Act with regard to the class of timber to be used for the purpose is that the wood shall be well seasoned, clean, dry and free from bark, wane, feather and knots.  These requirements are directed against the danger of injury to the quality and flavour of the eggs to be packed, and with a view to securing good marketable appearance.  Large numbers of standard egg cases, constructed from native timber, which conform to the afore-mentioned requirements, <Col N="365" /> have come under the observation of the Department's Inspectors. Many small saw mills in the country have not sufficient facilities to allow of the thorough seasoning of timber, and cases made from native timber are, therefore, often unseasoned, or only partially seasoned, and when eggs are packed therein the latent dampness of the case contaminates the packing material and causes the eggs to become straw-stained and musty.  If all case-makers who use native timber in the manufacture of standard egg cases could arrange to allow the timber to become thoroughly seasoned, egg cases constructed therefrom would be quite as suitable for use by exporters as those made from foreign timber.  Quantities of egg cases made at Lord Sligo's Sawmills, Westport, have been examined from time to time by the Department's Inspectors and found not to comply in many respects with the requirements of the Regulations made under the Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Act after consultation with representative egg shippers.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Dentists Bill, 1927, be read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill had gone through its second stage prior to the dissolution of the last Dáil.  To get the full effect of the proposals now being brought forward, the Bill has to be read in conjunction with the Medical Act, the international side of the proposals there being very much in line with the proposals here. Inasmuch as there is a reaction between the General Medical Council and the Dentists' Council in England, it is proposed to have the same sort of relations established between the Free State Council and the Free State Dentists' Board, and there is necessity to have understood what the Board is, and what the practice heretofore governing the methods of the two bodies has been. Although there are likenesses and similarities between the two pieces of legislation, there are certain differences which should be adverted to at the start.  They can be very easily summarised. In the first place, in regard to a person who is unregistered, and who practises dentistry, or dental surgery, and who commits an offence, the same thing does not hold as in the case of medicine.  A person who is not a registered medical practitioner, and who continues to practise medicine in this country, does not commit an offence, but is subject to certain disadvantages in the matter of securing fees, but there is no such thing as an offence.  Offences for the first time were established in the Dentists Act of 1921, and that particular situation is being continued by the proposals here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from that difference, there is a difference with regard to the register and with regard to the payments for the compilation of the register.  A medical man pays one fee for entrance on the register and thereafter pays nothing for the continuance of his name on it.  Dentists, on the other hand, in return for the definite setting up of practice by unregistered persons, pay yearly for the keeping of that register. Consequently, those who are registered may practise dentistry without <Col N="369" /> committing an offence.  When the 1921 Act first set up, or rather continued, the separation of the dental profession from the medical profession, it made that change with regard to offences that might be committed.  It was recognised that there were actually practising in the late United Kingdom a great number of people who could not be described under the terms of the new legislation as qualified persons, but they acquired a right by the fact that they had practised for a certain period. and had been allowed to practise, and had also been allowed to go through a period of training with a view to securing a certain status in the country which, at that time, entitled them to practise.</P>
    <P>Consequently, provision was made by which people, ordinarily referred to as &ldquo;1921 men,&rdquo; people who were in a particular state with regard to the practice of dentistry, or dental surgery, in 1921, were permitted to continue, but any new recruits to that class were definitely precluded in the future.  We have to view that situation here, and although demand has been made that inasmuch as our legislation is introduced in 1927 we should not have a 1921 class, but a 1927 class, and that we should admit to certain rights, in regard to the practice of dentistry, people who had been not merely registered in 1921, but who may have entered the ranks of the unregistered since 1921, and also that we should guarantee them the same rights as those guaranteed to the 1921 people in England.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed to do that for two reasons.  One reason is that the intention of the Act of 1921 would have applied here.  I do not mean that there were legal doubts as to whether that Act did apply here, but those concerned with the interests of the two professions had an idea that whatever enlargement was made in the 1921 Act by the inclusion of the 1921 men in England, there should be no further enlargement, and sufficient notice was given to those intending to enter the profession that the 1921 class was going to be confined to those who entered that class prior to 1921.  It is proposed here <Col N="370" /> to limit, I do not like to say the completely unqualified men, as they have some titles to qualification, but those who have not the particular type of qualification necessary for admission to the profession of dentistry.  It is proposed to limit them to those in practice prior to 1921.  There is a further reaction from that on the position of the Council.</P>
    <P>The composition of the Council or Dental Board is to be of nine members, of whom one is to be a representative of those 1921 dentists, and four who are to be representative of the profession other than the 1921 men.  It is clear that these 1921, more or less unregistered, people will be a diminishing class, and that, whatever their importance is at the moment, an importance which entitles them to one representative on the Board, it will become less and less.  It is considered as being absolutely essential that some time hereafter there will have to be a readjustment of the Dental Board to meet the new situation, and that, without any great doubt, the nominee of the 1921 men will sooner or later disappear from the Board.  At the same time, these people are rather numerous in the ranks of dentists at the moment, and their numerical strength entitles them to representation, that is, if the Dáil proposes to admit the contention that the 1921 men should be given the right to practise dentistry in this country at all.</P>
    <P>The duties of the Board are to a great extent lessened from what those of the Medical Council set up under the Medical Act will be.  The Council functioning under the Medical Act has to attend to everything in relation to the practice of medicine in this country&mdash;to medical education, to the entry of people on the register, to the keeping of that register, and to the discipline and control of the profession, leading in the last resort to expulsion from the register.  The same does not hold with regard to the Dental Board, which will have nothing to do with education.  As far as discipline is concerned, it will have a certain control and is enabled to institute inquiries into the conduct of people practising dentistry in the country where anything requiring attention is brought before <Col N="371" /> it.  The Board, of course, will have the duty and the right to keep the register, but when it comes to the determination as to what course must be set out so as to lead to a licence to practise dentistry, and when it comes to a final determination as to whether his conduct is sufficient to warrant the then qualified dentist being struck off, in that respect there has to be the same relationship between the Irish Council and the Medical Board as under the 1921 Act exists between the Dental Council and the Medical Board in England. When dental legislation in regard to education or penal cases in England is before the Medical Council there has to be associated with the Council a certain number of representatives of the dentists, and that will hold here.</P>
    <P>The Medical Council in Ireland will have supervision of dental as well as medical education, and will have pretty well a decisive say in striking people off the Dental Register.  Those are the main differences, as well as some of the similarities, existing between the proposal with regard to dentistry and the proposal with regard to medicine.  The Bill in its numerous sections deals largely with the position of the Council, how the appointments are to be made and what happens when resignations from the Board take place or occur in any other way, and also makes the usual arrangements the House will be familiar with from the other Act.  Regarding the meeting of the expenses of the establishment of the first register, and as to how the expenses of all further registration have to be met, there are two schedules.  One is the international agreement.  In so far as it is to govern the relationship between the Dental Board in England and the Irish Dental Board it follows the same lines as the medical agreement.  I will stress only one point, inasmuch as it has been misunderstood.  I have noticed a remark referring to a similar agreement with regard to the medical proposals, that the old powers of the General Medical Council have been and are at this moment continued in force by that Act, and that as far as the General Medical Council is concerned <Col N="372" /> there has been no change between 1909 and the present year.  I would like to call attention to a phrase in the Dentists Bill similar to that used in the medical agreement.  Clause 3 of the First Schedule refers to powers and jurisdiction continuing as heretofore and is limited by one phrase, the preparation and keeping of the Dentists Register, and any other purpose.</P>
    <P>If that is understood, the full meaning of the agreement will be understood in so far as any domestic change affecting dentists is concerned.  There is the fullest control and authority vested in the Dental Council of the Free State, or the Irish Medical Council, to act jointly so far as the control of people who have got their licence to practise in this country, either in dentistry or medicine, and who are in practice in this country, and whose conduct while in practice comes under review.  The sole control as far as these people are concerned with regard to practice in this country lies with the Dental Board.  The Medical Council and the Dental Board in England are completely precluded from jurisdiction, so far as matters of that domestic type are concerned.  I will direct attention to another point.  If the Dentists' Board had been continued with full control and authority as previously, this case might have occurred: that if a dentist qualified to practise here, and also has his name entered on the register in England, and his conduct has called for criticism by both these controlling bodies, it might happen that the Irish Dental Board, or the Irish Medical Council would consider his conduct sufficiently grave to warrant him being struck off the Dentists' Register here. The corresponding council in England, examining the man's conduct from the point of view of the man being on the register in England, might consider his conduct not sufficient to warrant deprivation of his licence, and might allow him to continue in practice.  There would then be a conflict between the two Boards, and if the old state of affairs continued the over-riding authority would be the English Board, whose decision would be decisive, and the prohibition of the Irish Board would not be of avail.  That is definitely precluded <Col N="373" /> by Section 4 of the First Schedule, which ensures that where there is any conflict of the sort, that where what has to be determined is the right to practise in this country, it is what the Irish Board says, and not what the English Board says that holds.</P>
    <P>The Second Schedule deals with a list of 12 names to which reference is made in an earlier section of the Bill. Section 24 says:&mdash;&ldquo;The several persons named in the Second Schedule to this Act shall on passing an examination in dentistry prescribed and held by the Board for the purpose within seven years after the passing of this Act and on making the prescribed application and paying the prescribed fees be entitled to be registered in the Register.&rdquo; These 12 individuals are people who did not come in under the 1921 Act, as it was drafted and passed in England, and who, if we simply applied the 1921 conditions to them, would not be entitled, even on passing an examination within seven years, to practise dentistry in this country.  Their cases are considered to involve sufficient hardship to warrant this particular exception being made in their favour.  They are not actually qualified at the moment and are not entitled to practise, but if and when they pass within a seven year period an examination which shall be prescribed for them by the Dental Board, then and only then can they practise dentistry in this country.  The reasons why these 12 people have been segregated cannot be detailed here at the moment, but if there is any desire to know when we reach the Committee Stage why one more than another has been put on, or why these 12 have been put on when certain others might have been put on who have not been admitted to the same type of favour or exception, we can discuss that in Committee of the Whole House or possibly better still, at a Special Committee.  We can see whether these 12 people are better entitled to this exception being made in their favour than others whose cases may be raised.  We can also see whether any addition should be made to the list, because each case hangs by itself.  They are simply individual cases, and not all ruled by the same <Col N="374" /> consideration.  These are 12 people whose cases have been examined by a variety of authorities, and the consensus of opinion is that their cases warrant an exception being made in their favour.  It will be for the Committee to consider whether the list should be cut down or enlarged or left as it is. I move the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JAMES CRAIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I expressed my approval of this measure in the last Dáil, and it is therefore not necessary that I should say very much on the present occasion.  I want to say, however, that there is no direction in which legislation is more urgently required than in that indicated by the present Bill.  For the last two or three years there has been absolute chaos as regards dentistry in this country.  The Free State has been a happy hunting-ground for all sorts of quacks, and there has been no registration and no control, and nothing to prevent the public from being humbugged.  This measure is an attempt to protect two classes of people. It is an attempt to protect dentists from these quacks and to protect the public, and the only thing that we must take care of, is not to rush too far from one direction to the other.  While protecting the dentists we should take care that we do not deprive the public of any means by which they can get relief. That is one of the most important points that I want to lay stress upon. The only other thing I have to say is that any changes that may seem necessary here can be carried out on the Committee Stage.  There is just one word I would like to say in connection with the 1921 men.  They have one representative on the Dental Board.  As the Minister has pointed out, the number, which will probably be about 300, will begin to diminish almost from the time that the Act comes into force, and if a change is not made eventually, then the last man will be electing himself to represent himself on the Board.  I think for that reason there should be a time limit placed to the function of this particular class in the Act.  That is to say, we should fix 15 or 20 years, probably 15 years, in which this particular representation should cease, or at all events that the matter should be reconsidered <Col N="375" /> at that time.  I give my very hearty approval to the measure, and I am very glad that the Minister is pressing it on, so that the country may not be kept any longer without what they so urgently need.</P>

      <P>I rise for the purpose of getting a statement from the Minister with regard to Sections 24 and 25.  Apparently the Minister, under Section 24,is prepared to admit an addition to the names already set forth in the Second Schedule.  I take it that will be a matter for consideration for any particular case put before him in Committee.  Section 25 seems to deal with people of the same character, and seems to me to be somewhat ambiguous.  I do not understand whom they are to admit to the Dental Register on special terms.  Does it cover people of the same kind, or is it intended to apply to people who, when almost qualified to get in under the British Act, were not fully qualified?</P>

      <P>I do not think there is very much to be said on this Bill.  Like Deputy Sir James Craig, I am strongly in favour of it, and I think it should get a Second Reading.  I just want to add what I said on the last occasion, that there are some points, and not without importance, too, which will be referred to on the Committee Stage, but it seems to me unnecessary to go into them now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather expecting that we should have a speech from Deputy Gorey or his successor in the Farmers' Party as to the general merits of the Bill.  It is well, inasmuch as the Minister has not given the House any information to point out that the purpose of the Bill is to give legal authority to control the profession and occupation, if one may say so, of dentistry to a body which might be designated the Amalgamated Society of Dentists, Irish Section, and to give that society statutory authority enabling them to blackball any other person who attempts to practise this trade or profession without having paid his contribution to the society, without having passed the examination the society fixes <Col N="376" /> and giving the society this disciplinary authority backed by law.</P>
      <P>I wonder if Deputies would be prepared to extend that principle.  I think, for instance, there is not a very considerable stretch between a person who is engaging in fitting a denture to a toothless gum and a person fitting a pair of boots.  I wonder would Deputies agree to establish a society of boot operatives, with power to fix conditions of entry into the trade, and to make it a penal offence for anyone to practise bootmaking in respect of any person who is not a member of the trade union.  That is quite a close analogy, and Deputies should understand what they are doing when voting for the Second Reading of this Bill.  I say it is a fair and close analogy, and that is particularly the case when you reckon that it is not merely the dentist proper, the dental surgeon, that is referred to, but the person who makes a pair of artificial teeth and attempts to fit them.  I cannot, for the life of me, see why that particular operation requires the qualification that the practice of surgery involves or quite reasonably requires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a suspicion that in this Bill, probably following the 1921 Act, the dentists' profession is really taking to itself a good deal more than is necessary. Deputy Sir James Craig has, quite rightly and fairly, pointed out that there are two interests affected by this Bill, the dentists who are seeking to protect their monopoly, and there is also the public.  I would like a little more information as to what is expected, or claimed, to be the benefit to the public from the passing of this Bill.  It may be said, and I am sure it will be, by physicians and doctors when they speak, that it is intended to protect the public against the practice of dentistry by unqualified people and the dangers that may accrue to the public from them.  But I think that part of the work of the dentist as defined by this Bill is rather the work of the craftsman than the physician or surgeon&mdash;the making and fitting a denture or the giving of any treatment, advice or attendance to any person preparatory to or for the purpose of or in connection with the fitting, insertion <Col N="377" /> or fixing of artificial teeth.  It seems to me that is going a considerable distance beyond what is necessary for the protection of the art of dentistry.  I would like a good deal more of enlightenment and argument on this matter before I am satisfied that all that is in this Bill is needed for the protection of the public.</P>
    <P>Touching the question of the protection of the public the Minister for Industry and Commerce has said, perhaps frequently&mdash;the President certainly has said frequently&mdash;quite good things about the value of advertising and how, the public benefit by advertising.  One of the results of this Bill, I am informed, is going to be prohibition of advertising.  The dentist who is able to make and fit artificial teeth to toothless gums, and who would do it cheaply because he has a big practice, is going to be prohibited from extending that practice, and the inevitable consequence will be a rise in the fees for dentistry and increased charges upon the public.  I do not know whether it is possible within the scope of this Bill to make provision for qualification and to ensure that only qualified people shall practise on the body of the patient.</P>
    <P>While that should be done, I am not inclined to agree offhand with the prohibition, or, rather, with giving the power to a Board of this kind to prohibit what is deemed in other directions to be a most admirable development of modern publicity.  If there is anything at all to be said for advertisement, if the public ever benefit by advertisement, then surely they may benefit by a dentist advertising his qualifications and powers to sell artificial teeth at a lower price than his neighbours.  That is an aspect of the Bill that the House should be warned against, because what you are really asking now is that the Dáil should legislate in such a fashion as would prohibit a dentist who has peculiar ability from advertising that peculiar ability, and serving the public by such advertisement.</P>
    <P>The Minister has removed the obligation that rests upon me to deal with certain characteristic cases where I think hardship would seem to be involved in the Bill by saying that it <Col N="378" /> might be discussed in Committee.  I think the Committee Stage suggested by the Minister, that of a Special Committee rather than a Committee of the Whole House, is quite a desirable thing in the case of this Bill, because the Bill, apparently, precludes from ever being on the Register, unless by special grace of the Board, persons who have been practising for quite a long time.  I have, for instance, a case where a man was refused entry into the 1921 Register because he was three months short of the statutory age.  He has been practising ever since.  This Bill, as it is at present framed, would prevent that man coming upon the Register although he has had six years' experience, and was then qualified except in the matter of age.  There is another case of where a man was actually engaged by the National Army in attendance on hundreds, almost thousands, of soldiers and prisoners, and who in every respect appears to have been qualified to practise his art, but he would be prohibited under this Bill.  These are instances that seem to show the necessity for a thorough overhauling once the principle has been accepted.</P>
    <P>I am not going to vote against the Second Reading, but I do feel it is desirable that there should be a much more convincing case made for this Bill in its present form than has been made.  As I say, I think it is very desirable that there should be qualifications required, but I am not so sure that the prohibitions that are involved in it in regard to the methods of extending one's practice are justified at this stage.  I think it is not reasonable to compare the dentists to the medical profession.  One can foresee that the cost of dentistry to the public is going to be increased, and a considerable increase is going to place it beyond the power of the average man or woman to meet.  It is already beyond the power of very many thousands who would need the attention of dentists, and I hope it shall not be long before we have a universal system of school inspection and examination of the teeth of the children, so that when that is well established <Col N="379" /> there will be no dentist required to attend to the adults.  I have not heard very much of the advocacy from the dental side of preventive measures, but I have a suspicion that Deputy Sir James Craig could give advice which, if followed, would pretty well ensure that the dentists of the next generation would have nothing to do. But I suppose, strictly, many of the dentists who will come on the Register under this new scheme will have no need to understand anything at all about the constituents that go to make a human tooth or the method whereby food once taken eventually finds its shape in a human tooth.  But I say that the position of the dentist does not seem to be at all comparable with that of the medical man, and we are now on the way to establish this register monopoly&mdash;this Vocational Council&mdash;having authority which may be justified, but which I think ought to be coupled with representation on the Council of the public as well as the profession.</P>
    <P>I think that the patients, the people who are eventually to be operated upon by the professional man, ought to have some representation on the Board which is going to control this Vocational Council.  We have had, as some Deputies will have remembered, already an application for an extension of this scheme to the optician.  It seems to me that whatever justification there is for dentistry, it is, at least, equally strong in regard to the optician.  When we go a little further and when Deputies become thoroughly acclimatised, we from these benches may bring forward proposals in regard to other professions, other trades, other occupations, so that the country will be thoroughly honeycombed, if I may say so, with a system of Vocational Councils governing the operations of industry, trade, and commerce, and thereby perhaps reconstituting the social system.  That is where we are going by this Bill, and it is well that Deputies should realise it.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will tell us that it is his intention to move for the reference of the Bill to a Select Committee, so that the Bill can be examined more <Col N="380" /> thoroughly than it could be by a full Committee of the House.  That was done, I find, in regard to the 1921 Act in the British Parliament, and because of that fact we are not able to look up the report of the discussions in the British House.  I think it is necessary that there should be a pretty full opportunity of discussing the merits of this schedule and every case or class of case that ought to be brought within the scope of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am led to believe by the latter portion of the Minister's speech that he is aware that some injustice is likely to be inflicted on certain parties if the Bill is passed in its present form.  He practically gave an invitation to the House to set up a Special Committee.  I heartily approve of that suggestion.  That would give an opportunity to some parties, whose cases I am aware of in the City of Dublin, to come before the Committee, state their case, and give reasons as to why they should be admitted and allowed to practise as they have been practising for the past 25 years.  I believe that if the Bill becomes law in its present form Deputies from many parts of the country will discover that they have deprived many deserving citizens of their means of living.</P>
      <P>With a view of giving these men an opportunity of being heard by the Special Committee, I think the House would be well advised in accepting the invitation of the Minister to set up a Special Committee.  I have in my hand particulars of the case of a man who has been practising dentistry for the last 25 years.  He has been doing his work well, and satisfying his patients. If this Bill is passed in its present form, that man will not be able to follow his profession.  Therefore, knowing, as I do, that there are many cases similar to his in the Free State, I ask the House to accept the invitation of the Minister to refer the matter to a Special Committee before whom these people may be heard.</P>

      <P>I think the unregistered dentists should be very grateful to Deputy Johnson for his advocacy of their claims.  They will be more grateful to him, I think, than <Col N="381" /> the outside public will, because it is a well-known fact that there is a large number of so-called dentists going about the country who are not qualified at all.  These men are not only putting in false teeth, which is not such a very dangerous operation, but they are practising methods that are extremely critical, and that sometimes have very disastrous results, that one does not hear very much about except in certain cases.  I think in these days the public have a right to be protected against anybody practising any species of medicine&mdash;and this is a species of medicine&mdash;without proper training and qualifications.  One might think that we are getting back to the days when the village blacksmith extracted teeth by putting his patient on the floor with a chair on top of him and extracting the teeth with one of his implements.  I think that in the 20th century it is time that people who undertake to cure the ills of mankind should have some proper qualifications. The public, I think, if they thoroughly realised, as a great many of them do not, that a number of these persons have no qualifications at all, would be exceedingly alarmed and would insist, as this Bill will insist, on their qualifications being of a proper standard. For my part, I am certain the majority of people outside will have the same view of this Bill as the majority here have, that the sooner it is passed and stringent regulations made and carried into effect to control this profession the better it will be for everybody concerned.</P>

It would be too bad to prevent this man of thirty years' standing from being registered.  He would have qualified under the other Act were it not for the fact that the man with whom he served his time thought he might start in opposition to him, and he refused to recommend him.  I would ask the House to take the claims of this man into consideration in this Bill, and I intend to move an amendment to that effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not dare to answer that question.  Deputy McMenamin referred to Sections 24 and 25.  Section 24 deals with the Second Schedule, and it is the only section dealing with the Second Schedule.  The names there are the names of people who are dental mechanics.  After investigation by the old Dental Board, those people were allowed a period of ten years in which to pass a modified examination.  They are dealt with in the English 1921 Act.  What we are doing here is simply taking over the twelve cases about which there was agreement that there would be hardship if the persons concerned were prevented from obtaining a qualification which could be registered and which would entitle them to practise.  These are the names of the twelve persons whose cases were previously considered, and they are the only persons whose cases seem to warrant this exceptional treatment.</P>
      <P>Section 25 deals with an entirely different thing.  It provides that the Board, by its own special direction, may, on account of special circumstances, register any person who, in their opinion, has received training and possesses qualifications not inferior to the standard of training and qualifications required under this Act. The object of that is to allow people who might be qualified in some other country and whose diploma seemed to be sufficient and satisfactory, but where agreement had not been made with us by the country concerned for reciprocal recognition, to be registered. The two sections are distinct.  Section 25 has no reference to the schedule. Section 24 has reference only to the schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not invited any additions to the list.  I have seen a lot of cases, and I am convinced that no injustice is being done to anybody.  As to the claim that it is putting a man out of employment, the same plea might be made on behalf of a coiner.  But nobody would allow the coiner to continue his operations simply because you would <Col N="383" /> be depriving him of lucrative employment.</P>
    <P>I have seen cases of individuals and, so far as my examination went, I was not impressed.  There was no hardship, and I was definitely convinced that if one or two of those cases were allowed in, the door would be flung open for such a tremendous number that the public and the public health would be jeopardised by the admission.  That was the special matter on which I thought this Bill might be referred to a Special Committee&mdash;not the Bill itself but the Second Schedule.  Section 24 of the Bill can be amended here in the House if it is thought that there should be any better exception made in favour of a certain number of people; or it can be narrowed by amendment in the House in respect of the people to whom in refers.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is desirable that we should have individual cases talked of openly here.  It is not desirable, I think, that Deputies should bring forward here individual cases for discussion. I should prefer to have those discussed by Special Committee, and the House could discuss the terms on which certain people, like those twelve dental mechanics, should be admitted. Additions to the list might then be made on report from the Special Committee to the House.  I do not mention that by way of inviting additions to the list.  I am convinced there should be no additions to it.  I cannot say, of course, that I have had all the cases put before me.  I do not make any such claim.  But once the Special Committee has examined privately the cases brought before it, on report from that Committee to this House, there may be fitted in an enlarged or diminished schedule in the Bill.  But I think we should have the discussion on the whole scheme of the Bill in the ordinary way here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister desire that only individual cases shall be dealt with by the Committee, or is he prepared to agree that the classes of persons that should come on the Register might be discussed by the Committee, apart from the general plan of <Col N="384" /> the Bill?  I refer to the elements that might go to make up the Register.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy could, of course, enlarge on my proposal. My proposal was going to be that the Second Schedule be referred to a Special Committee for examination, with a view to seeing whether any additions should be made to the list, whether the names should be left as they are, or whether there should be any subtractions from the list.  The rest of the Bill would, according to my proposal, be discussed in the ordinary way in Committee here.  When we come to the Committee, Stage, it will be for Deputy Johnson to see if he can get any amendment to the definition section dealing with the &ldquo;practice of dentistry or dental surgery.&rdquo;  The section may be too widely drafted, or it may unnecessarily limit the operations of people who, hereafter, will not be registered dental practitioners.  If he can persuade the House that, in the interests of the public, it is better to allow them a cheap service, which may be dangerous, in preference to the possibility of there being a dear service which will be definitely and clearly safe, that is his option.  But that should be argued in the House here, and not before some small committee.</P>
      <P>The point as to fees and advertising are also matters which Deputy Johnson can argue.  Personally, I should prefer to hear Deputy Johnson argue in this House that it should not be a matter for the House to frown upon&mdash; this matter of not allowing people to sell their wares or their labour unless they do it under certain trades union regulations.  The Deputy might like to hear here the arguments put forward against his view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the feeling of the House is obviously that a Bill to make provision for the registration and control of persons practising dentistry or dental surgery is necessary.  The Second Reading has not been objected to by anybody. We then come to the details.  I ask the House to consider the details in the usual way on Committee Stage, which I would move ordinarily to have fixed for Friday.  The second portion of the Bill&mdash;that is the Second Schedule&mdash;I <Col N="385" /> ask should be referred to a Special Committee.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister think of adopting the principle of defining the qualifications of exceptional persons who should be admitted instead of putting their names on the schedule?  By the present method the House may do a grave injustice to individuals in the country who have the same qualifications as the persons whose names are in the schedule but whose names are not before us.  I think that would be a better principle than the setting out in a schedule of particular names.  It would be better procedure for the House, because it might well be said otherwise that the House was partial to these particular named men. It would be better on the whole, I think, to adopt a definition of the persons concerned instead of setting out their names in a schedule.</P>

      <P>To refer Section 23 would be, I think, referring the whole international agreement to a Special Committee, because Section 23 and the international agreement are closely bound up.  There is also a close relationship between the agreement and Section 24, but I am not prepared to say that the agreement would be broken by the addition of names to the Second Schedule.  But any big change in Section 23, if it were enlarging the number who might go on, would definitely be a breach of the agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. MURPHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the Minister has not made a more elaborate statement in connection with the administration of this very important service. So far as we are concerned, this subject is a hardy annual, and is likely to be so for some time.  On the last occasion when it was discussed here we had a rather definite promise from the Minister that the regulations in connection with the administration of the Act would be relaxed to some extent. That was also the feeling we had when we discussed the report of the Committee set up by the Minister. It seems to me that the attitude of pensions officers is that of endeavouring to oust every possible claimant.  I endeavoured on one occasion to persuade the Minister to put the House in possession of the instructions issued to these officers, but the Minister could not see his way to do so, and perhaps his reasons were very good.  The Act is being administered by the officials in a manner entirely hostile to pension claimants.  The manner in which the <Col N="389" /> question of means is dealt with is unsatisfactory, and the over-estimating that takes place puts claimants at a great disadvantage.  I am not entitled to refer to the reduction in old age pensions, but when this matter was discussed some weeks ago in various parts of the country, the argument was advanced that no change for the better could be made, because it would be said if any change were made by the Government at that time, that it was merely playing for the support that they would get as a result of it.  Now that there is no question of temporary popularity involved, I suggest that the Government might take up this question of the restrictions surrounding the administration of the Act, and have them relaxed in a reasonable and equitable way.</P>
      <P>Small farmers in particular are hit very hard by the present method of administration.  That point has been stressed here on two or three occasions. The Farmers Party will bear me out when I say that the difficulty of obtaining an old age pension for a person with a small patch of land is so great that it is almost impossible for such a man to get a pension.  The estimate that is put upon a few pigs, or a few hens, or a cow in some cases, is such that it does not represent their actual value.  Owing to the way in which the Act is administered, thrifty people who keep their houses clean are penalised for their thrift and cleanliness when the pension officer comes to investigate their claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Government candidates during the recent election promised the electors that their efforts would be directed towards an improvement in the administration of this Act, and that they would press for the introduction of legislation making other beneficial changes in connection with old age pensions. I should like to know what will be their contribution to this debate to-day. That will be a test of the sincerity of their promises to the old age pensioners, who proved rather awkward interrupters during the election.  I think the Minister does not realise the manner in which the Act is being administered <Col N="390" /> and the difficulties that are thrown in the way of bona fide claimants. Even if we do not make much progress, we would not be doing our duty if we did not raise this matter at every available opportunity, because it constitutes one of the most unsatisfactory phases of the administration of the Minister's Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LAW</NameTxt>
      <P>My withers are unwrung by the concluding words of the last speaker, because, so far as I recollect, I made no promises whatever during the elections.  I do not imagine that any Deputy could have felt otherwise than sympathetic with the general tenor of the Deputy's speech, nor do I imagine there will be any disinclination on the part of any Deputy to oppose the increased estimate which the Minister has introduced.  I do not propose to go into the larger question which the last Deputy touched upon.  We are precluded on the Estimates from dealing with any question that requires legislation. Even if it were not so, I feel that matters of that kind must be left to Ministers who have the whole facts before them, and bear the whole responsibility. I suppose nothing has gained more praise for the Government, certainly nothing else has gained more for them the respect of people like myself, who were outside the movement when the Government came in, than their extraordinary courage in facing responsibility, and their willingness to incur unpopularity in a direction where they thought the good of the country demanded it.  My own respect, particularly for the Minister for Finance, is very great.  I have a special reason for that, because any man who can add up two or three columns of figures three times, and make them twice agree, is a person who appears to be endowed with absolutely miraculous gifts.  In addition to that, he has shown such austerity of righteousness that I am afraid some of us would almost say, &ldquo;These things are too high and excellent for me, I cannot attain unto them.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It almost seems as if a Latin poet had foreseen his coming, as Virgil is supposed in the Middle ages to have seen another.  I think it must have been the <Col N="391" /> present Minister for Finance about when Horace wrote:</P>

      <P>The Minister deserves too well of his country.  Admiring him as I do, I do not plead for anything like lax administration of the Act.  But there is a great difference between strict administration and unsympathetic administration, and even a further difference between strict administration and obstructive administration. I am quite sure that the very last thing the Minister for Finance desires is that any old person should be deprived of the benefits which the law allows him or her by any twisting of the regulations.  I am quite certain that is the very last thing the Minister would desire.  I wish I were quite assured that some of his officials understand the matter in the same way.  I wish I were quite as sure that some of them do not feel, when they are putting difficulties in the way of some old person, refusing information, or doing their best to cut off portion of the pension already granted, that they are doing God and the Minister service.  I doubt very much if the Minister is aware of the spirit in which the Act is sometimes administered, if my information is at all correct, in certain areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I only ask the Minister one little thing, and it is so small that it may seem almost superfluous.  I ask that he shall make his own mind very clearly understood in the matter.  I am sure he has done it, but I do not think repetition will do any harm.  He should <Col N="392" /> make this perfectly clear to his subordinates, both publicly and privately. He is responsible for this Act, and he has to bear any odium that may be incurred. He is a loyal chief and bound to defend his staff.  That is all the more reason why he has a right to see that they do his will.  I am convinced that is not always done.  In a small way I have some knowledge of public Departments, both from the outside and, for a little while, also from the inside, and I know that officials of all grades, both high and low, are exceedingly sensitive to what they believe to be the wish of their immediate chief.  They take their cue always from the man immediately above them.  The Minister occupies a very high position, and he is a very long way from the humble gauger in the country who comes into contact with the applicants for old age pensions.  It should be thoroughly understood right down the whole hierarchy, from top to bottom, that a person who was unnecessarily obstructive and refused information which pensioners have a right to, or who signalises his zeal by having as few old age pensioners in the district as possible, was not acting in the interests of the country, or with the approval of the Minister.  It is certainly in the power of a Minister, gifted with sympathy and imagination, without straining the law in the very least, endangering the public finances in any way or going outside the authority of the Dáil, to affect the administration of this Act in a very remarkable way, as well as, incidentally, to do a very charitable act to a great number of poor people.</P>

      <P>Before I raise any jarring note on this question, I would like to say that I appreciate the action of the Minister for Finance in meeting a difficulty that was brought up when this matter was being discussed last year.  I refer to parties who were unable to obtain their baptismal certificate, and where there was extreme difficulty in securing pensions for such people.  I must say that after the matter was referred to I found it much easier to obtain pensions for people concerned in such cases.  Like Deputy Murphy, coming from a constituency <Col N="393" /> comprised mostly of farms of ten or twelve acres along the seaboard, I have a grievance, that the basis of assessment of income of the holders of these small farms, to my mind, is altogether wrong.  The valuation of their holdings probably is high owing to their proximity to sand and seaweed, which is of no advantage to them now. I would like that the Minister would consider that the assessment of income that obtains in Northern Ireland under the Act of 1924 should apply here.  If the assessment were brought to £26 5s., as is the case in Northern Ireland, I think it would be of great benefit to our small farmers.  As Deputy Murphy stated, the pension officers at present are penalising thrift.  When a pension officer sees a thrifty, well-put-together little homestead&mdash;when he sees a pig or a few fowl&mdash;he deprives poor people of the pension.  On the other hand, when he sees a slovenly, badly-kept house he is inclined to minimise the income, and the claimants, as a result of their carelessness and neglect, get the pension.</P>
      <P>There is another matter that I would like to refer to.  It is the case of people who are being maintained by their friends.  I have endeavoured to secure pensions for some of them&mdash;people who have nobody to care for them.  I know of one case where the son of an old man married into a farm.  He is in fairly good circumstances, having seven or eight cows.  He took in his father, who was 70 or 72 years of age.  The old man had been living in a small hovel and he had not a penny to buy a bit of tobacco or whatever little necessaries he required.  Because he came to live with his son, who had seven or eight cows, he is deprived of the pension altogether.  This is no isolated case.  I hope that the Minister will see that these old people who have been taken in by their friends and who have not a penny to fall back on will get some consideration and perhaps more equitable treatment.  I do not want to see any laxity in the administration of the Pensions Act, but I would be very keen on equitable and just administration.</P>

      <P>I feel that I would not be doing justice to the people <Col N="394" /> who sent me here if I did not register my protest against the manner in which the administration of the Old Age Pensions Act is carried out in parts of Roscommon, at all events, if not in all.  As some other Deputies have said, no people suffer so much in this respect as the small farmers, and particularly in the county from which I come.  Our county was largely composed of ranches.  Some years ago the Congested Districts Board split up these ranches and brought people from the counties Mayo and Galway and settled them on the land.  They brought them from very poor places and put them into good land.  That land is of very high valuation. Some of these people were, as they say, &ldquo;like ducks out of water.&rdquo; The place was as strange to them as if they had been transported to Montana. They did not know the system of farming there.  The result is that at present many of them have no stock on the land, and, on account of the bad prices that are prevailing at present for stock, there is nobody to take the grass.  I know that many of these people let their land go into meadowing last year, but they could not get anybody to purchase the hay, with the result that many of them are in a very poor state. A case of one family in particular was brought to my attention.  After these people had come on to the new land whatever stock they had died of the fluke.  The family consists of a grandmother, her son, his wife, and three children.  The grandmother is now 72 years of age.  She applied for the pension, but because the valuation of the place is high the application was turned down.  When the pension officer came there he found upon the land one cow, two calves, two yearlings, two sheep, a horse and a pig.  I do not know on what basis he valued her support.  In any case, he refused this poor woman the pension on the question of means.  The man who lived in the house had to go to England to try and earn some money, leaving behind the two women and three children, with no stock on the land except what I have mentioned.  I think that is a very hard case.  To my mind, it is carrying the administration of the Act much too far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was one of those who were called <Col N="395" /> to give evidence before the Old Age Pensions Commission a few years ago. At that time I thought that certain regulations would, at least, be loosened, but I am afraid, as far as our county at any rate is concerned, that the same harshness&mdash;I can call it nothing else&mdash;is to be found everywhere in the administration of the Act by the pensions officers.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of baptismal certificates, I have not found, as Deputy O'Donovan has found, that everything is satisfactory.  In the parish that I come from the register of 1856-1861 was destroyed, and we have considerable difficulty in getting evidence as to age.  Affidavits have been made, time out of mind, by three or four people who were qualified to make them, and yet the claims have been turned down.  It is only by constantly keeping at them that claimants have been able to get the pension.  If we are to have a Pensions Act at all, I think it ought to be operated to the advantage of every person who is entitled to the pension.  I hope that the Dáil will see that those restrictions and obstacles that are deliberately placed in the way of the fair administration of the Act will be removed as early as possible.</P>

      <P>During the last election campaign a ray of hope went to the hearts of the old age pensioners through the length and breadth of the Free State, because of the statement that the Minister for Finance would, as soon as he could see that the financial position of the State had improved, give back the cut to the old age pensioners. During that campaign a most frightful propaganda was raised against the Government in regard to the old age pensions cut.  Every speaker who was against the Government and its candidates attacked them mercilessly on that point.  They never had the manliness to say what, in the first instance, was the cause of the cut.</P>

      <P>As one sitting on an Old Age Pensions Committee for seventeen years, I must say that we always found the manner in which the means of the pensioners was estimated most unsatisfactory and unfair.  There was no uniformity.  You would have one case you thought was just as bad as another.  The first case got the full pension of 9/-, while the other was cut down.  Furthermore, the surveyors are stepping in, where the old age pensions officers are fair.  I must say from my experience in Skibbereen that we have a fair and honest old age pensions officer there, but his estimates at times are cut down by the surveyors, those in authority over him.  Consequently, the old age pensioners do not get the benefit of the estimate of the pensions officer in direct contact with them. Also, there is a great cause of complaint with regard to appeals coming up to Dublin.  The appeals in almost every instance go against the committees, and as a result the committees. are almost in despair with regard to their administration.  I hope the Minister for Finance will go deeply into this question&mdash;it affects many households through the Saorstát&mdash;and see that justice and fair play will be meted out to the veterans of the country.</P>
      <P>I must certainly congratulate the Government in as far as they are anxious&mdash;I know it from the Minister's statement&mdash;to come to the rescue of the old age pensioners.  I am sorry I cannot go into the thing and prove, as far as my experience and knowledge go, that the Government during the last campaign under this heading was grossly maligned and slandered.</P>

      <P>In the County of Cork, which you just mentioned, subcommittees are very carefully constituted. The parish priest and ministers of all denominations have invariably been placed on them.  The other members of the committees have also been very carefully considered when appointments are being made.  Despite that fact, their recommendations are very often turned down, and I think more care should be exercised before recommendations, coming from such men, are turned down.  I am a member of the Old Age Pensions Committee.  I admit that I am a bad attendant, but I know some cases of very great hardship. Perhaps it may not be very desirable to discuss individual cases here, but I will mention one.  It is a case of a woman who has not reached seventy years of age.  Though not totally blind, she is so blind as to be unable to carry on her trade as a dressmaker. She is very old; as well as I can remember, she is well over sixty.</P>
      <P>In addition she has lost a leg, is quite helpless and unable to support herself. The recommendation came from the local Committee which included the parish priest and the rector.  It was turned down.  A second recommendation was sent up which was again turned down, and in a very long experience I have come across very few persons who I thought were more deserving of receiving this pension.  As I said, it is perhaps not desirable to discuss other individual oases more than to enunciate one case of very great hardship.  I think it is regrettable that the pensions officer and the other higher officials who examined this woman were not more sympathetic.  I hope the Minister will take a note of my remarks and perhaps some little benefit might be derived by this woman as a result.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJinks" hpid="Mr. JINKS Mr. JINKS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JINKS</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the previous speakers with regard to the tightness of the Department in granting pensions to the old.  I happen to be the Chairman of the Old Age Pensions Committee in Sligo, and I find the pensions officers there more than strict with regard to the granting of old age pensions.  Under the old regime if a clergyman of any denomination testified that to the best of his opinion and <Col N="398" /> belief a person was the age that pension was sanctioned.  Nowadays, they have to get two old age pensioners to come in from the country perhaps; they have to bring them before a peace commissioner and swear solemnly before him that they are the age.  He will not take it that to the best of their belief they are the age.  They must swear solemnly and firmly that they are the age.  Then after making this affidavit the person who is making the application for the pension has to pay for stamps for the affidavit. As a member of this Pensions Committee I would ask this Department to advise the pensions officers in the country to look into the cases more carefully before refusing a case.  We have in the pensions officers young men perhaps of very little experience with regard to the value of the produce of a farm of land.  They make an estimate perhaps at a figure which might be all right in the past, but which is not all right at present.  I strongly advocate here that more care should be taken with regard to applications for old age pensions than is taken at present, and I, therefore, hope that the Minister will advise his pensions officers to be more lenient with the aged and infirm.</P>

      <P>Much as I would like to follow the trend of Deputy Sheehy's speech, I am afraid I also will have to keep to the question of the administration of the present Act.  I would like to protest, with the other Deputies who have spoken on these lines, against the manner in which the cases have been dealt, with by the pensions officers.  The present methods adopted by pensions officers are the methods of income tax collectors.  I hold the methods of the present pensions officers show complete absence of any human considerations or human factors.  We have many instances, as quoted here by different Deputies and by individuals throughout the country.  Members of Pensions Committees could keep quoting individual cases.  Owing to the manner in which pensions officers have dealt with cases there are extremely hard circumstances, and people have been turned down on the most trivial excuses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="399" /> Deputy O'Gorman pointed out the position with regard to Pensions Committees. I would like to support him in that, and I go further and say that because of the methods of pensions officers in appealing against honest decisions of committees we have come to a pass in the country where we find it very hard to get people to attend on Pension Committees.  When people like clergymen and others, who devote almost their whole attention, who are interested locally in their parishes and areas, who know the whole circumstances and position of the different families, find that their honest recommendations are turned down and believe that the spirit as well as the letter of the Old Age Pensions Act is not being carried out, it is no wonder that we cannot get people to attend the Old Age Pensions Committee.  I would like that the Minister in his reply here to-day would concede the point that, at least for the future, we will not have the position that a pension officer will act in the spirit of the detective, or something in the spirit of people who believe that everybody is against them and that nobody is looking for a pension on honest or legal grounds, that every applicant is trying to get a pension by means that are not legal or honest.  I would like that the Minister would make that position clear; and that, as a result, we would not have the regulations administered in a strict and harsh manner as they are at present, and that there would be some consideration and more leniency for the claimants who are entitled to a pension.</P>

      <P>I find myself in full agreement with the other Cork Deputies who have spoken in this debate. When the pension officer goes to a small farmer and sees four or five cows he refuses a claim.  In the majority of cases he can see about ten children, and he ought to allow for these large families.  You will have the farmer with his wife in such a case, struggling, trying to rear those children. The pension officer will make no allowance for the big family.  Still, he will make an allowance for the three or four hungry old cows.  That is a matter <Col N="400" /> that the Minister for Finance should take into account.  I agree with Deputy O'Gorman on the matter of blind pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>It is seldom I do, but still there are some things on which I agree with him.  Now, in this matter of the blind pensions, we have the fact that the special doctor who examines the applicants only comes around annually or quarterly.  I think that the local dispensary doctor or some other doctor should be in power to examine them pending the time when the Act suggested by Deputy Johnson to the Minister for Industry and Commerce is passed.  I suggest that the local doctor's certificate should be taken in those cases and if the local doctor certifies that a man, owing to blindness or partial blindness, is unable to work or carry on his trade or business, that should be sufficient to get the claimant his pension.  It has been pointed out that the pensions committees have very little say in the matter of granting the pensions, because, as a rule, they are flouted.  When they recommend the full pension, it is reduced to 4/-, 3/-, or perhaps 2/-.  The reason given is that the small farmers may have six or seven cows, and if he is a hard-working man he is penalised.  I think all these things should be revolutionised by the Minister for Finance, and that a new rule for assessing pensions should obtain in the future, especially after all the promises made at the late election, and made even by the West Cork Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one grievance I would like to bring forward here, and that is with reference to applicants who cannot obtain their birth certificates.  I <Col N="401" /> do not know if the people in the constituency which I represent have been more unfortunate than others in the matter of their inability to procure their birth certificates, but I know of my own personal knowledge that a very large number of applicants in my constituency failed to obtain their birth certificates.  The next procedure then is that they get persons in their neighbourhood to come in and make a declaration before a Peace Commissioner to the effect that these people have reached the age of 70 years.  I have myself taken innumerable affidavits from very respectable people who, I have no doubt whatever, were proving what they believed to be true.  I am, however, very sorry to say that very few of these have been successful in obtaining the pension.  I think that is a matter which deserves investigation. All these applications are sent on here to Dublin, and they are invariably turned down.  I can verify that, because many of these affidavits have been taken before myself.</P>
      <P>The other matter to which I wish to refer is a very important one.  It is the objection on the ground of maintenance. In the constituency which I represent there is a considerable number of farmers with very small holdings, and in some cases where a man who is holding forty acres thirty acres are practically useless.  A pensions officer, going out there and seeing that a man has a holding of 30 acres, is inclined to think that the man has a fine holding, and that it is one out of which he could make a good living.  In nearly all these cases the claimants receive only three or four shillings a week.  I feel that in these cases the pension officers ought really be directed to be more sympathetic.  Unfortunately, as it happens, their sympathies are more with the Department of Finance than they are with the people who are claiming the pensions.  These are two matters that I wish to stress very strongly, and which I urge should be investigated by the Minister.  Undoubtedly, these two causes have been the means whereby many people who are entitled to their pensions have failed to receive them.</P>

      <P>I think quite sufficient has been said to place on record the feelings of the country, generally as represented by the Deputies who have spoken here to-day as to the dissatisfaction that is felt throughout the length and breadth of the country, with the unsympathetic attitude to old age of the officials administering this Act.  It does not need any further stressing from me to point out the hardships that have been inflicted on small farmers in connection with the old age pensions.  That aspect of the question has been already dealt with fully.  There is, however, one point that I would like to mention, and that is, the matter of the pension from the industrial workers' point of view.  The administration of the Pensions Act has operated as a very definite preventive of thrift, that thrift which is sought to be encouraged by other Government Departments in the country to-day.  The administration of this Act, so far as the industrial workers are concerned, is a sort of wet blanket and a damping down of the efforts of those who seek to provide for their declining years.  The failure to make a fair valuation of the hungry cattle, or the hungry pigs is one thing. You are up against the difficulty of making a correct assessment in the case of the worker working for a weekly wage or who has any kind of an income.  I am afraid I am getting on thin ice, but I think that this is one of the things that calls for the attention of the Minister.  Those who are administering this Act should not act as a damper on habits of thrift amongst the industrial workers.</P>
      <P>I am not going to say anything further, because sufficient, I think, has been said on the point of the administration. I hope the Minister will give his attention to these matters to which I have referred and that he will give some thought to the position of the industrial worker so far as claimants for old age pensions are concerned.</P>

      <P>As a Deputy representing one of the poorest constituencies in the Saorstát, I wish to join with the many speakers in condemnation of the manner in which the Old Age Pensions Act has been administered. <Col N="403" /> I have been a member of Old Age Pensions Committees for many years.  In the earlier stages the pensions officers used to attend all the meetings.  For a number of years the pensions officer does not attend the meetings.  I would say that more mutual intercourse between the pensions officers and the Committees would be advisable.  I would ask the Minister to instruct the officers to attend the meetings of the Committee with a view to more amicable agreement.  In the County of Leitrim, at the present time, there are no such holdings as have been described here to-day.  None of the farmers there has 40 or 50 acres.  It is a case of 15 to 20-acre holdings and in many instances only l/-, 2/-, 3/-, or 4/-, is all that is granted to the applicant. Perhaps in the whole County Leitrim not one in a thousand persons is in receipt of the full pension.</P>

      <P>In common with my fellow Deputies from all over County Cork I feel this is a subject in which we are vitally interested.  I regret I cannot join with Deputy Sheehy in congratulating the Government on its treatment of this subject.  He has mentioned that he sat on an Old Age Pensions Committee for seventeen years. My submission to the House is that that is an operation which might now cease and must cease if the Government wishes to regain its popularity.  Old Age Pensions Committees have been too long sat upon.  I join with Deputy Murphy and the Deputies who followed him; I endorse and confirm every word that he has said as to the manner in which the old age pensions regulations are being carried out.  They are being carried out in a spirit of marked hostility towards the old age pensioners. That is not the spirit that should prevail. On the contrary, the regulations ought to be carried out in a spirit of friendliness and kindliness, in a charitable spirit, towards the old men and the old women who have reached a late stage, of life.  I expect it is not open to discuss any reduction at this stage, but another time will come when that matter will be open to discussion. <Col N="404" /> Until it is open to discussion, and until the regulations are carried out in a far different spirit, the Government will remain, as it is to-day, in a minority.</P>

      <P>When he is replying, I would like the Minister to indicate what amount of discretion is allowed to the local pensions officer in the matter of appeals.  It seems to me that practically every case in which there is the slightest element of doubt is appealed against by the local pensions officer, and it would look as if the local pensions officer is anxious to shove on the responsibility to those above him, to throw the onus on the Department in deciding for or against a particular pension.  Replying to me last December relative to the recommendations of the Committee set up to look into the administration of the Old Age Pensions Acts, the Minister stated that many of those recommendations were being substantially met by administrative Acts or modifications of procedure. I do not know if it is the experience of other Deputies, but so far as I have been able to discover there has not been very much of a change.  Undoubtedly there was some change, but it is not very substantial.  There is one recommendation which, if carried out fully, would be useful.  It is that which states that when the Department are not satisfied with the replies sent up touching on evidence of age, the case should be referred back to the Pensions Committee with specific questions referring to matters upon which they are not satisfied.  That is not generally done, and if it were it would help very considerably in the administration of these cases in which there is difficulty or an impossibility in providing definite documentary evidence of age.  The Committee recommended certain alterations with regard to forms and this was one.  Another was connected with cases where the Committee differed from the pension officer, and it was suggested that a detailed statement of the facts on which they based their decision should be submitted.  They should specify the nature of the efforts made by the local Committee to procure evidence, and the nature of their general investigations.  I do not know that that <Col N="405" /> has been carried out.  It would be helpful if it were.</P>
      <P>As regards blind pensions, the Minister might tell us what exactly are the statutory conditions.  It seems to me that they are almost impossible of fulfilment. A case came under my notice recently where a person got a certificate from the Eye and Ear Hospital, Dublin, in which, after setting out in technical language the state in which he found the man's eyes, the doctor mentioned that glasses were no improvement and that eyesight was essential for the nature of the work in which the man was engaged.  The local dispensary doctor examined the applicant and mentioned that he was totally unfit to earn a livelihood owing to defective vision and that he had only a bare perception of light in each eye.  A month afterwards the man was again examined and the report then made was that he did not fulfil the statutory conditions as to blindness.  I understood the statutory conditions were such that a person would not be able to earn his or her livelihood owing to blindness, and that particular condition was definitely stated in the certificates of two doctors in relation to the case I have mentioned.  There has been a good deal of complaint in the country as to the administration of the Blind Pensions Act.  One of the recommendations of the Old Age Pensions Committee had to do with this matter.  I would like to hear from the Minister what progress has been made towards giving effect to that recommendation as contained in paragraph 50 of the Old Age Pension Committee's Report.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister to let the House know&mdash;Deputies are entitled to know&mdash;exactly how much or how little of the report submitted by the Committee has been given effect to.  From time to time the Minister has told us here that certain recommendations had been given effect to. We do not know what the recommendations were.  One of the recommendations which to me, as a member of the Old Age Pensions Committee, was most important, was the recommendation <Col N="406" /> that the pension officer should attend the meetings of the Pensions Committee and give the Committee his reasons for allowing or disallowing a claim. The Committee recognised that if this were done it would facilitate the matter a great deal and bring about a better understanding between the pension officer and the Committee.  So far as we could gather at the meetings of the Committee, there is practically no contact between the Pensions Committee and the pension officer.  It seems to me the pension officer is more of an excise officer, and he looks on pensions as merely part-time work; he only gives his attention to it when he has time from his duties as excise officer.  Most of the points that one could touch upon have already been mentioned.  What has been said so well and often as regards the conditions in Cork would apply equally to most other counties. Will the Minister tell us how much of the Committee's report has been given effect to?</P>
      <P>I would like if the Minister would also say when he proposes to honour a promise he made in the last Dáil with regard to introducing legislation to alter the law in regard to blind pensions. The Minister will recollect that he admitted here over twelve months ago that the regulations were unduly harsh, and he expressed the belief that they should be changed.  He promised to do so, and I hope another twelve months will not elapse before that very desirable change is made.  The Minister ought to be in a position to say when he will be able to introduce the necessary legislation.</P>

      <P>I would like to add my voice to the statements of other Deputies in reference to the matter before the Dáil.  No more beneficial Act was ever passed for the benefit of the poor people of this country than the Old Age Pensions Act, and the people are deeply grateful for the benefits conferred by it.  Many poor persons are in their homes to-day who would be in the throes of great distress and misfortune were it not for the relief given to them by that Act.  It is a pity that anything should mar its effect on the minds of the people.  Undoubtedly <Col N="407" /> the way in which it has been administered by the local officials representing the Government of this country has to a great extent limited the benefits which it was supposed to bring into the homes of the people.</P>
      <P>Local pensions committees have given deep and serious consideration to all that could be said in favour of applicants when they came before these committees.  The members go to considerable pains in order to attend the meetings; they make a sacrifice of time to attend there; clergymen leave their ministerial duties, public men leave their shops, and farmers leave their farms on the appointed day to make a genuine investigation into the merits of the claims which come before them. It strikes me, as it must strike all people who have given thought to the matter, that it is extraordinary that so many decisions given in favour of applicants after careful consideration by the committees have been upset afterwards on the flimsiest grounds by the officers representing the Government. The grounds advanced by these officers in upsetting decisions of local committees have been dealt with here to-day, and I am not going to traverse that ground again.</P>
      <P>There are many poor people whose places of residence have changed during the course of recent years from one part of the country to another, and, because in the transfer, the valuation of their holdings was considerably enlarged as compared with that of the land they previously occupied, they were disqualified to receive an old age pension.  That is most unfair.  The basis of these complaints has been dealt with, and I hope that the Minister at the head of that Department will give grave consideration to the matter. There are many poor people who have lost their eyesight and who have attained the age which would qualify them for a pension, but for some flimsy reason the local officer overrides the decision which the local committee had given after due consideration.  I desire to protest against that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Serious complaints reach all public men in regard to the way in which the decisions of local committees have been <Col N="408" /> treated.  Things have reached such a pass that to my knowledge a number of people who have sacrificed their time to attend such committees, are considering whether it is worth while losing their time in that way, in view of the fact that their decisions are subsequently overruled.  I take advantage of this opportunity to impress on the Minister the seriousness of this question. It is one of the most serious questions that could come before the Dáil.  Large numbers are in enjoyment of the pension, and others in the same neighbourhood consider that their claims are equally worthy of consideration, yet, by reason of a small or technical point, their claims are frequently overruled.  That creates a feeling of dissatisfaction, whereas I think it is desirable that a spirit of gratitude should reign in the minds of the people in regard to the benefits conferred by the Act.</P>

      <P>Frequently during the last four years, when the Estimates have come before us, members in every part of the House have protested against the continuance of the method adopted by the local officers in estimating the income of claimants to old age pensions.  The methods that have been adopted are the most unfair that have ever been put into operation by any Government or Government department. Everything that is humanly possible to do to whittle down the miserly allowance to three or four shillings is being done every day in the week in the case of almost every claim.  I drew attention some time ago to a case in which a young man took an old man, a relative, out of an institution and gave him a bed in his house. When making a claim for an old age pension, in order to get that old man some little comfort, he found that a pension of five shillings a week was allotted, as the officer said that the claimant had four shillings a week income, owing to the fact that the bed which his relative gave him could not be secured under four shillings a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that the Dáil, the Minister, or his officials, when allowing these regulations to go through, thought for a moment that such <Col N="409" /> methods would be adopted to whittle down allowances.  I will continue to protest against these methods at every available opportunity.  Like other Deputies, I think that the time has arrived to alter the regulations and to see that some fairer treatment is given to our aged citizens than that meted out to them at present.  Regarding blind pensions, I was informed some time ago that there is a rate for local authorities which it is at their option to fix for the upkeep of blind people. I understand that in different districts they adopt different rates.</P>
    <P>That is very unfair to blind people. I think there should be a definite rate fixed by the Dáil or the Minister, and it should not be left optional to one Council to give a small sum, whereas an adjoining Council contributes a larger sum.  That system encourages people to try and find a residence in the area in which the larger sum is paid.  I think there should be a level rate, and I hope that the Minister, in the near future, will see that that level rate is put into operation.  I also hope that he will take an early step to see that the grievances of blind persons are remedied.  They have complained for many years, and the Minister admitted twelve months ago that they had grievances and that steps should be taken at an early date to remove them.  The recommendations of the Commission are in the hands of the Minister for something over twelve months, and I think it is time he should put forward his proposals to deal with them.  If he does, I am satisfied he will be supported by every Party in the House in putting them into operation. Quite recently the blind people made up their minds to draw attention to their grievances by nominating candidates to contest constituencies in the Saorstát.  It was considered by many people that they were right in that action.  The Minister, I understand, is aware of the grievances of the blind. Last year he was most sympathetic, and told us that at an early date he would have these grievances attended to.  I hope he will speed up a settlement in the matter and see that further cause of complaint is removed.</P>

      <P>So much has been <Col N="410" /> said on every phase of the administration of the old age pensions that there is no occasion for me to detain the House more than for a few moments. A great deal of stress has been laid on the high and erroneous assessment made by some pensions officers. I am not surprised at this, for these pensions officers are mostly from the towns and never had the opportunity of living in the country and so being enabled to place a proper value on the small farmsteads, cattle, etc.  It may be said that in most cases inspectors follow with more knowledge, but an inspector does not follow in every case. In some instances, an applicant is turned down on the valuation of the pensions officer.  In some cases that I know, I would say that the erroneous and unfair assessment made by the pensions officers is merely due to an incapacity to value.  That is a phase of the question that has not been touched on.  I hold that in nearly every case where there is an appeal on assessment some inspector should follow. I wish to emphasise the remarks of Deputy O'Donovan relative to unfortunate people who are taken in by friends to relieve them and to keep them from pauperism.  Many of these people have followed trades and other occupations as long as they were able to.  When they had spent their little earnings or savings and were practically on the verge of pauperism, they were taken in by some friend or relative who, perhaps, had no obligation whatever in regard to keeping them. The value of the assistance given to these people by their friends is sometimes valued to the full amount of the pension they would be entitled to, and in this way they are deprived of a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know cases where this has been done.  I know people who were forced to take lodgings in some small hovel and keep away from their friends in order to get pensions.  I do not think that is the spirit in which the Act should be administered.  That is an aspect of the question that should be taken into consideration by the Minister. When people are maintained by friends who have no obligation to do so, but just in order to keep them from <Col N="411" /> the taint of pauperism, they should not be deprived of their right to a pension. It is extremely difficult to get the blind pension.  We had a case in County Wexford that we could prove up to the hilt.  Two dispensary doctors certified that the applicant could not do any work for which eyesight was required, and that was backed by an eye specialist.  An inspector from the Department came along, but he would not agree that the person was entitled to the blind pension.  I think a case such as that shows unfair treatment.  A second attempt was made in the case of this person to secure the pension and the same evidence was again brought forward, but the pension was refused, although the person was on the verge of 70 years of age and, as a matter of fact, she is now drawing the old age pension.  I hope the Minister will take into consideration the remarks I have made.</P>

      <P>I desire to be associated with the other Deputies in the remarks they have made on this subject.  I come from a county that does not claim to be very rich, and in which there are many poor and infirm people, but at the same time I do not want to parade our poverty or the poverty of the people generally.  On behalf of the people who sent me here I join with the other Deputies in entering a protest against the administration of the Old Age Pensions Act.  I wish to impress on the Minister the desirability of taking the earliest opportunity of effecting an improvement in the manner in which the Act is being administered.  It is an excellent Act, but we have reason to complain of the manner of its administration, which is certainly not the kind one would desire. One can only conclude from the way it is administered by the pensions officers that they are sent around the country, not for the purpose of doing justice, but to deny to the people the rights to which they are entitled.  That is my experience as a member of more than one Pensions Committee, and it is the feeling of those who have had experience of the Committees that they might as well not exist at all.  As a <Col N="412" /> result of our experience from representations made to the Department and the different officials concerned we can only conclude that a deaf ear has been turned to our representations and that they have been treated almost with contempt.  That is the reason why I stand up to enter my protest with the other Deputies who have spoken on this matter.  Members of these Committees have had painful experiences indeed from time to time at their meetings. It is doubtless recognised that the Committees set up and selected are from the most representative and most respectable people in the community. The representations made by them should certainly carry weight with any department.  From the experience we have had in the west of Ireland we can only come to one conclusion, that it is for the purposes of economy this is done.  But it is at the expense of a most deserving section of the people that that economy is carried out, and carried out regardless of the consequences to these people. I hold in my hand a resolution which has been forwarded to me as a representative of that constituency, desiring me to take the earliest opportunity of entering my protest against the way the Act is administered.  I do so this evening, and in joining with the other Deputies in the House in making that protest, I hope it will have the desired effect.  We hope that when we appeal to the Minister for Finance that we shall not be appealing to him in vain, and that our appeal will not fall on deaf ears.  Otherwise I fear that the experience of the Government in the future will be something that will teach them that the people cannot stand indifference all the time.  On that point I might say that we are looking for nothing except for fair administration. We do look for that, and we appeal for it.  I venture to say that if the public do not feel convinced that the Department is determined to receive its recommendations with consideration, then it would be better that the Old Age Pensions Act should be known by some other name.</P>

      <P>The methods in connection with the administration of <Col N="413" /> this Act have been criticised fairly generally.  Personally, I am rather glad that that criticism has not been confined to these benches solely.  The officers have been criticised, and it has been suggested that they are out of touch and sympathy with the spirit that animated the passing of this Act.  It has also been suggested that the Minister himself would not stand over this kind of thing or this class of conduct on the part of certain people who are administering the Act.  I do not want to throw doubt on that suggestion, but, at the same time, I feel that the officers of the Department would not continue to pursue a class of conduct which they believed would, in any way, warrant admonishment on the part of their superior officers.  Now these methods have, by general agreement, been such as to negative much at least of the good in the Act.  I do not want to take up the time of the House criticising, at further length, its administration, seeing that nearly all that could be said has been said.  I would ask the Minister, however, to give the House an assurance that the point touched upon by Deputy Keyes will be borne in mind, namely, that some legislation will, at an early date, be introduced ensuring to a thrifty workman or woman full pension, irrespective of anything in the nature of superannuation that may have accrued to them through contributions to their trades union or other institutions, insurance offices, etc., for the rainy day.  Can the Minister assure the House that at an early date he will see that legislation is introduced to that effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. CONLON</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with everything that has been said by a number of Deputies with regard to the administration of the Old Age Pensions Act.  A great complaint is that the pensions officers are very strict.  I <Col N="414" /> would say that they are necessarily very strict, and that it is very essential that they should be very strict.  We ought to be honest about this thing and realise that if you had not strict pensions officers the estimate we would be considering to-day would be one not for two and a half million pounds, but probably one for ten million pounds.  All the people of the country are not as honest as some Deputies here would have us believe. A very considerable amount of deceit would be practised if the pension officers were found to be in any way soft.  The same thing, I think, applies to the Pension Committees.  Complaint is made that the recommendations of the Pension Committees are not given the consideration which they deserve. There may be some Pension Committees that act reasonably in connection with these claims, but I think it will be agreed that, taking them all round, if you had not a check on the recommendations of the Pension Committees, the Estimate we would be considering to-day would be even more than ten millions.  I would not like that it should go forth that the pension officers should be encouraged to become lax in the duty which they have to perform. I agree, at the same time, that the question of estimating means is not exactly as I would like it in some cases.  At the same time, I know that the desire of the Department is to be absolutely fair in connection with this matter.  As regards some cases to which I drew attention myself, the Department sent down special inspectors, and in a number of these cases the result was satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the proof of age, I know that affidavits have been sent up to myself in connection with cases that were not affidavits at all, but the people believed, and genuinely believed, that they would be of some use, whereas they really did not prove anything.  Subsequently they were instructed how to draw up affidavits properly, and when these were forthcoming, wherever a proper case arose out of them, I never found any difficulty in having the cases thoroughly investigated and fair play given to particular applicants. It is only fair and just <Col N="415" /> that we should not allow it to go forth that the pensions officers are all that has been stated, and that they are all anxious to deprive claimants of what they are justly entitled to.  If that were so no one would think of saying anything except in condemnation of it, but I think it is only fair that we should give them certain support in the Dáil in the very unpleasant work which they have to perform.  A great many of them are not what they are painted.  They really do their best in the interests of the people, but, of course, they have also to look to the interests of the State and to see that people who are not really entitled to pensions under the law do not get them.</P>

      <P>I hope that when the Minister comes to reply he will give the House some information with regard to the recommendations of the Committee that was appointed to deal with this old age pension question. There was one recommendation made by the Committee, which in my opinion, would largely solve many of the difficulties that now exist for claimants who are illiterate, and that is that the local Pensions Committee be compelled to state, in writing, the grounds upon which they give a pension, when it is given; and, secondly, that after correspondence when a decision is given that it should be sent to the Committee and not to the claimant. It is a fact in West Donegal, and I believe in some other places, that the question upon which most of these pensions are submitted on appeal, is on the ground of age.  We all know the difficulties surrounding age, and I suggest that no person is in a better position than the members of the local Committee, to give the reasons which induced the Committee to say that the person claiming was the age.  There is then another recommendation of the Committee; it may be that in some respects it is being carried out, but it would be well that it should be entirely carried out and that is that the pensions officer should attend meetings of the local Committees so that he should have definite knowledge of the grounds on which the claims are made and upon which the Committee acts.  Outside of <Col N="416" /> these things the work during the last twelve months, so far as I know it, and I certainly have had wide experience., has been carried out efficiently by the pensions officers and by the decisions of the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMENAMIN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is almost superfluous to add anything to what has been said by Deputies who have spoken.  One has only to crystallise everything said to arrive substantially at three facts.  The first is that apparently there is only one burning question at the moment in Cork, and that is the old age pension question; the second is that so far as any grave question for decision with regard to the local committees is concerned, they might as well not exist at all, because, apparently, when it comes to any sort of a grave issue of fact between the Committee and the pensions officer and the Department, the opinion of the Pension Committee is always turned down. I think it was Deputy Shaw said that in these appeals the general rule is that the appeal goes against the applicant. The next thing is that it is apparently clearly admitted from the discussion that there is conflict in the administration. We have heard a speech from Deputy Law that would make anyone blush, that, so far as the Minister was concerned, he might go to his subordinates and tell them to be more generous in the administration of the Act.  From the same benches we had the speech of Deputy Sheehy, which was an energetic defence of the administration of the Act.  You have only to take these two speeches to arrive at a clear conclusion that there is difference in the administration of this Act.  I think it would be a good thing for the Committee and for the country to be assured by the Minister that there was a definite formula and programme of administration that was being applied by the officers carrying out the Act in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may well be that the complaints that were made by numerous Deputies this afternoon are due to the fact that there is no co-ordinate and uniform system of instruction given to the pensions officers as to how they should administer the Act&mdash;for example, how they should value certain farms and <Col N="417" /> certain stock.  Is it that it is left to each officer to form his own opinion and form his own conclusion as to the question of means?</P>
    <P>Now there is another matter; it was dealt with practically by every speaker, and I wish to deal with it lastly; that is the question of age.  Apparently there are very numerous complaints upon this matter.  I know that applies not only to certain counties, but apparently is general.  I am not to be taken as stating that there should be wholesale admission of people to the pension about whose ages there is doubt, but surely it is a great hardship that persons who are clearly over the age of 70 are prohibited from getting the pension, because owing to, some technical defect they cannot produce the document or documents to prove their age.  I think it would be very satisfactory and eminently desirable that we should know, and that the country should know, what precisely the decision of the Minister and the Department with regard to the administration of this part of the Act is. Further than that I have nothing to add.</P>

      <P>I should like to say one or two words in appreciation of the efforts made here to-day by Deputies to see if some improvement could be made in the future administration of the Old Age Pensions and the Blind Persons Acts.  I should like to mention a very definite case, and I trust the Minister will reply and say what his intentions are in the matter I am about to mention.  I take the case of persons who are engaged in an avocation, say, for forty or fifty years.  The result of continuous labour in that avocation entails an extreme strain upon the sight so that after a long period they are unable to continue further in employment. Such a person seeking a pension because of blindness is refused by those in authority because of the fact that probably or possibly they could obtain employment in some other avocation.  I think a more sympathetic view ought to be taken of a case of this kind.  I have in mind now the industry of tailoring, where the continual strain on the eyes for a period of many years <Col N="418" /> renders them seriously defective.  I think of all the statements made to-day in connection with pensions the one that seemed to me most hopeful was that made by Deputy Law.  He exhorted the Minister to allow those in authority to understand that he was sensitive and very sensitive to have the Act administered in a sympathetic manner.  While Deputy Law was cutting that new ground it was a great pity the Government benches were so empty, because if Deputies were present they might have taken courage and proved to the Minister that his party were of the same opinion as that expressed by Deputy Law which might have encouraged the Minister to convey to his officers the desires expressed by Deputy Law: I trust the Minister will take into consideration the hardships which have been briefly exposed here to-day.  I have heard of only one Deputy in the House who finds no difficulty in the working of the Old Age Pensions Act.  His case is not only unique in the House, but it is unique in the country.  Up and down the country every person one meets has found difficulty in getting a proper administration of this Act with the exception of Deputy Conlon.  I am quite sure the difficulties are appreciated.  I hope that new ground is being broken by members of the Government party, and that in future the Government will arrange for a more reasonable and more sympathetic administration of the Act.  I hope that the point of view will not always be that of the estimated cost, that the eyes of the Government will not always be fixed on the one-and-a-half millions to meet claims, but that a more generous treatment of claimants will result, because economy that has cost as its only consideration is mock economy.</P>

      <P>I rise to speak very briefly to the Vote before the House.  I do so mainly for one reason, and that is to suggest to Deputies on the opposite benches that we on the Government side of the House are as deeply sympathetic to the needs and wants of old age pensioners as they are.  If there was one subject during the recent election on which there did <Col N="419" /> seem to be unanimity, it was that something should be done at the first available opportunity for the old age pensioners. We, on the Government side, express our sympathy with the old age pensioners, and each Deputy on this side whom I have met suggested at the earliest possible moment we should impress upon the Government the necessity of dealing with old age pensioners as sympathetically and as liberally as possible.  I think that anybody who has listened to the various Deputies who have spoken on this subject must agree that there is an almost unanimous feeling that the Act has been too rigorously administered.  I think I might join with my friends on the Labour benches in impressing on the Minister that that opinion is shared by many of the Deputies on the Government benches.  We also join with our friends on the opposite side, in expressing the hope that when the Minister comes to reply the House will hear that there will be in future a less rigorous administration of the Act, and that where possible it will be administered with more sympathy than it has been administered in the past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been something like 26 speakers on this particular Estimate, only two of whom have had a good word for the administration of the Act.  I do not think that practically any of the condemnation that has been heard of the administration is deserved.  If Deputies condemn the administration, I think it is because they have not examined the matter sufficiently.  A Committee of Inquiry was set up less than two years ago to examine the machinery for the determination of claims, questions, and appeals, regard being had especially to the desirability of the just and expeditious treatment of all applications. The different sides of the House were represented on the Committee, and there were also certain outsiders on it. The Committee, having heard witnesses, and having fully discussed the matter, reported that &ldquo;the Committee are satisfied that pensions officers do their work with fairness, efficiency and consideration.&rdquo; They added there was a certain feeling of dissatisfaction, but <Col N="420" /> that &ldquo;the feeling mentioned cannot be ascribed to any default on their part.&rdquo; I think that is not only the conclusion of the Committee, but it will be the conclusion of any Deputy who will really consider the matter.</P>
      <P>One never gets complete satisfaction in matters of this kind.  There will always be doubtful cases.  There will always be a certain number of what might be described as border-line cases, but there is no desire either on the part of officials or on the part of the Government to administer the Act with undue rigour or with any harshness.  So far as the appeals officer is concerned, as I explained to the previous Dáil on the Debate on the Old Age Pensions Act of 1924, which reduced the amount of the pensions, the Minister for Local Government and myself, jointly, saw the appeals officer, and the point we put to him was that consistent with the honest conscientious discharge of his duty, he should give the benefit of the doubt to the old-age pensioner.  I have no reason to believe that our words did not have due weight with that officer.  He had nothing to gain&mdash;either in reputation, in favour, or in money by being harsh in his treatment of the pensioners.  The officer who is doing that work is paid a fixed salary and it does not matter whether he grants many pensions or grants few pensions.  He has nothing to gain except by doing his duty with justice and absolute fairness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies have asked about the various recommendations of the Commission. We have not come to final conclusions with regard to every matter, but in regard to the matter which two or three Deputies have mentioned&mdash;the attendance of officers at Committees and Sub-Committees&mdash;we are carrying out the recommendations of the Committee, and an instruction has been issued to the officers to attend these Committees whenever the Committees desire them to do it, so that there may be actual verbal discussion of cases.  As a matter of fact, the Committee dealt with this matter, and I might, perhaps, quote from their report:&mdash;&ldquo;We have come to the conclusion that the main cause for such a feeling lies in the want of confidence and co-operation between <Col N="421" /> pensions officers and Committees.  This want is mainly due to the non-attendance of pension officers at Committee meetings.&rdquo;  We are carrying out, as I have said, that recommendation of the Committee and we are instructing all pensions officers, where the Committees desire them, to attend meetings.</P>

      <P>Yes, that instruction has gone out.  With regard to the improvement of the appeal system, we are accepting the recommendations in paragraph 30 of the report to which Deputy O'Connell has referred, and the alterations in the forms are being carried out.  We do not think it is necessary actually to make new regulations for the carrying out of paragraphs 2 and 3 of recommendation 30, but what is suggested there will be done by administrative action.  We have taken steps&mdash;and I do not know that anything more can be done&mdash;to secure expedition in the determination of appeals.  With regard to the suggestions in paragraph 37 of the Committee's report, which dealt with the variety of ways in which claimants for pensions might be assisted, we have substantially accepted the recommendation and a leaflet of amended regulations and amended forms have been prepared.  We are increasing the length of notice to a claimant from two days to five, not seven days, as suggested by the Committee.</P>
      <P>Legislation will be introduced to enable points of law to be brought to the High Court for determination, as recommended by the Committee.  We are taking steps to carry out the various recommendations of the Committee in regard to the selection and control of pensions sub-committees.  A regulation is being prepared to enable the Central Authority to deal with clerks to pensions committees who are negligent, as was suggested by the Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to blind persons, the matter <Col N="422" /> has been further considered by the Department of Local Government and the Department of Finance.  We hope it will be possible to introduce legislation at a very early date.  We are not satisfied that we should adopt the wording suggested by the Committee. We agree the wording of the present Act is too narrow, but it is thought that the wording suggested by the Committee might, on the other hand, be too wide.  The standard laid down in existing legislation is that the person must be so blind as to be unable to perform any work for which sight is essential.  The suggestion of the Committee is that the Act should apply to persons who, owing to defective eyesight, are unable to follow their usual employment or any other employment for which they are fitted.  That might enable a person to get a pension who, by a short course of training or without any great difficulty, might be fitted for some employment of a different nature from that which he is following. Consequently, we think the wording suggested by the Committee is somewhat too wide.  However, we accept generally what we consider was the intention of the Committee&mdash;that persons should be entitled to get the blind pension if they are unable to follow either their usual occupation or some other occupation for which they might reasonably be expected to become fitted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite aware of that.  I need not go over certain of the details that were referred to by the Commission.  I think there are only about two recommendations that we will reject.  The first is in regard to the publication of instructions to pensions officers.  We do not reject that recommendation because there would be anything that we might hesitate to publish on account of its character.  We reject it simply because the work of public officers would be made difficult if the instructions to those officers were to be published.  In some cases, the work of officers would be made almost impossible. Our objection is grounded on a <Col N="423" /> question, of general administrative principle. The other recommendation is in regard to the retrospective effect which should be given a pension if admitted secondly, having been rejected in the first instance because age was not proven.  We are trying, generally speaking, to carry out the recommendations of this Committee, with these exceptions&mdash;either in the form put forward by the Committee or in some modified form.  In some cases, where the Committee suggested a regulation, we think the object could be effected simply by an administrative instruction. In general, we are trying to carry out the recommendations of the Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pensions officers have a great deal of freedom in regard to the estimation of means of applicants.  They are expected to keep themselves in touch with the changes in prices.  They have the power of consulting with their immediate superior, who is older and more experienced, and who is dealing with a number of pensions officers.  I do not think it is possible to lay down any very rigid regulations that would guide them, because agricultural conditions differ so much in different districts. The quality of land, the productivity of land, the proximity of markets&mdash;all these things vary so much that it would be impossible to lay down any rigid regulations.  The only thing that can be done is to instruct the pensions officers to be as careful as possible to make a just estimation, and to have their surveyors keep in touch with them and assist them in doing so.  Nothing more occurs to me that could be done in regard to means.  We cannot send out an instruction to officers that they are to estimate means at a lower figure than they have been estimating them at.  We can send no other instruction to officers than to find out the facts as well as they possibly can, taking every care to be fair to the applicant.  I do not see that we can do more than that.  We cannot say, &ldquo;Your estimates of means have been too high hitherto; you must estimate them lower in the future, and you must give more pensions.&rdquo; It would be wrong for the Government to say that too few or too many pensions are being given.  We <Col N="424" /> must take the law as we find it, and we must administer it as fairly as we possibly can and with reasonable sympathy. At the same time, we must not have the idea getting abroad amongst either the people or officials that public money may be splashed about.</P>
    <P>In regard to proof of age there are also difficulties, but where reasonably definite affidavits are received I think they are generally accepted.  In many cases I have personal knowledge of, reasonable affidavits have been accepted. There never was a time, except at the very beginning of the Act, when the word of a clergyman or of somebody like that, who believed the applicant was of age, was accepted.  In the first year of the operation of the Act, that may have been the case, but it has not been the case since.  It must be recognised that, in regard both to age and means, there are many people who will misrepresent the facts of the case in order to obtain pensions for themselves. We have in recent months been able to bring actions against people who had considerable sums in bank and who had obtained old age pensions. We took steps for the recovery of the pensions which had been paid.</P>
    <P>To illustrate the need for being careful, I might mention a couple of cases that came to light in a certain part of the country quite recently.  Two parish clerks had been, apparently, for a considerable number of years, in the habit of receiving bribes.  They prepared false certificates, and these certificates, without investigation, were signed by clergymen, so that what the pensions officer got time after time was a certificate from a clergyman that the register showed the person to have been a particular age.  As I say, these were false certificates, and in two adjoining parishes it was found that the Exchequer had been defrauded to the extent of £14,000, although every pension was given on the certificate of a clergyman, who, of course, did not take proper care to verify it.  Another case in another part of the country is under investigation at present, where the same sort of thing has happened.  That indicates that it is not all a one-sided business&mdash;that it is not altogether a matter of the pensions officer being <Col N="425" /> strict and careful in demanding proofs and keeping poor people who ought to get the pension from getting it.  The pensions officer has no such instructions; he will get no credit for doing anything of the sort.  But he is expected, as far as he can, to see that everybody who is entitled to get a pension gets it, and that persons who are not entitled to get a pension do not get it.</P>
    <P>I am quite willing to do everything possible to see that the people are dealt with not only with civility and consideration, but with reasonable sympathy, but we cannot really go further than that.  Some of the matters that Deputies complained of are necessary under the law.  As I understand the case referred to by Deputy O'Gorman, it was undoubtedly one for very great sympathy, but I do not see that the pensions officer could have done anything else than he did.  Apparently the person was not qualified for a blind pension as the law stands at present, either on account of age or on account of blindness, in spite of her need.  I do not think that we can let the idea get out that officers might close the other eye, and because a case is a hard case allow the pension to go through, although it was not legal.  If such an idea were allowed to go out, I believe it would spread corruption through the public service, and that is a thing we have to beware of.  While we might desire that the law should be altered&mdash; and I agree in regard to blindness that the law does require alteration&mdash;as long as the law stands the officers must have regard to its provisions, and cannot be allowed to step outside it for reasons of sympathy or because of the hardness of a case.  In regard to means, the same sort of thing arises.  Undoubtedly, if a person is maintained, whether those maintaining him are legally bound to do so or not, the value of his maintenance must be taken into account.  That is how the law stands, and no pension officer can be blamed for carrying out the law.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister propose to bring in any legislation to alter that provision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think that is a <Col N="426" /> much more difficult matter, and the removal of the present provisions might be very costly.  In regard to the discouragement of thrift, I think I might say the same thing.  Undoubtedly, it may be justly argued that the present old age pensions code is to some extent a discouragement of thrift&mdash;that a person who has saved or who has been industrious may fail to get a pension, or have his pension reduced, because of his thrift or his industry.  But if we removed the means disqualification, our old age pensions bill would be doubled, and perhaps trebled.  I do not see that, on the whole, people would be so much better off if we had to raise anything from £3,000,000 upwards extra in taxation for the purpose of paying old age pensions.  It might be even as high as £5,000,000.  Undoubtedly, the removal of the thrift disqualification would increase the pensions bill enormously. Whatever may be our theories about the matter, I do not think that, as a matter of practical politics, we could contemplate doubling or trebling our old age pensions bill, and facing the increase in taxation which that would involve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to suggest to Deputies who are interested, and who may have been approached during the elections about the administration of old age pensions, that they should get a copy of this report&mdash;I could arrange to have copies made available&mdash;that they should examine it, and having examined it, I would be very glad to hear from any Deputy any suggestions that he thought fit to make.  I am not anxious to keep anybody from getting the old age pension who should have it, and I am not likely to gain anything, any more than the appeals officer, to whom I have referred, by keeping the pension from anybody.  I simply have the responsibility of seeing that the law is evenly administered, and that, as far as possible, fraud does not take place. I am not anxious to do any more than that&mdash;simply to prevent the taxpayer being imposed upon by the grant of pensions to people who are not entitled by law to receive them.  If our code can be altered without increasing appreciably fraud or misrepresentation, then I would be glad to make the alteration <Col N="427" /> and to have suggestions from Deputies. I simply ask Deputies to realise that there are two sides to this question. There is the difficulty of the pensions officer in determining the good case from the bad; there is the difficulty sometimes of the genuine claimant proving his case.  We try to meet the genuine claimant as far as we can. Even in cases where no affidavits can be obtained, we allow pensions to be granted on the opinion that the inspector forms after seeing the person.  The only thing that I can think of that might be considered at the moment would be whether, in view of the fact that a great number of parish registers are defective and that some of the census returns have been destroyed, the number of inspectors who interview persons whose age cannot be proved might not be increased somewhat so that it might be possible for districts to be visited more frequently than at present.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £456,000 <Col N="428" /> be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1928, to provide capital for the Local Loans Fund and to make repayment to the British Government in respect of local loans outstanding.</P>
    <P>I think Deputies on the Labour benches complain that the amount under sub-head A is reduced, and that consequently the money available for giving employment is also reduced.  The practice in regard to the Local Loans Fund is not to sanction any loan except the money is actually available for the amount of the loan, so that the amount to be voted in any particular year is what will be necessary with the amount already available in the Fund, in order to enable sanction to be given to the loans that will come up during the financial year to which the Estimates relate.  This is one of the Estimates difficult to frame because of the factors that have to be considered.  You have not merely the amount you actually want to spend in a particular financial year, but you have to consider the amount that is available in the financial year in which the Estimates are being prepared; the amount that is likely to be sanctioned in that year, the amount of any repayments that may come into the Fund, and the amount that will remain at the end of the year.  The amount of money sanctioned for loans does not depend on any particular department.  It depends on other people.  The amount sanctioned in land loans depends on the number of people who apply for such loans; the amount sanctioned for public health loans depends on the number who apply for these loans.  The amount asked for this year, together with the amount that was outstanding in the Local Loans Fund at the end of the last financial year, will enable approximately the same amounts, or in some cases greater amounts, to be sanctioned in the coming year as were sanctioned actually during the past financial year.</P>
    <P>For instance, it will enable land loans to the amount of £100,000 to be sanctioned.  These are loans given for farm buildings, for drainage, and work <Col N="429" /> of that nature.  It will enable drainage maintenance loans to be given to the extent of £30,000.  The amount is somewhat less than that sanctioned last year.  But the work under the Drainage Maintenance Act is drawing to a close and the money will suffice for all that could be done this year.  It will enable arterial drainage loans to the extent of £100,000 to be sanctioned. It will enable public health loans to the extent of £175,000 to be sanctioned. The amount of public health loans sanctioned in the previous financial year was £146,000.  A new sub-head, sub-head B, has been substituted, because under the annuity agreed to be paid to the British Government of £600,000 it is not possible to distinguish between the amount that will be payable in respect of each of the two previous subheads&mdash;Local Loans or Local Loans under the Land Acts.</P>

      <P>The Minister indicated that under the Arterial Drainage Act of 1925 £100,000 is available for the purpose of carrying out drainage. As far as I know, nothing has been done under this Act in any part of the country.  From what I know of the problem of drainage for the better administration of the Acts it is essential that the Arterial Drainage Act of 1925 should be amended.  The difficulties of administering the present Act are so great that work which might be carried out in one or two years will take perhaps ten years to complete.  The present Act places all the responsibility on the Board of Works for the construction of drainage works.  I think this question was raised during the election.  I am not sure if it was not in the Minister's constituency.</P>

      <P>I do not know if I would be in order in asking the Minister's intentions with regard to an amendment of the Act.  This is a very important matter.  I do not know if the Minister would object to letting the House and the country know his intentions. In every county there are a number of very small schemes which come within the purview of the 1925 Act.  These are schemes which could be carried out for £50, £100, and, perhaps, £300.  If local authorities, such as county councils, were empowered to do the work it could be done in a year or two.  I would like to know from the Minister if there is any intention to introduce, at an early date, any legislation enabling county councils to do constructional work of a small kind, where the amount of money to be spent would be from £30 to £500. I do not know if the Minister will be able to inform the House where the £100,000 is to be spent, and what new drainage works are to be carried out. I am afraid, from the speech that the Minister has made, the constituency I represent will not be able to obtain much of that money during this financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has been done in the matter of drainage so far has really been done in two or three areas.  Sligo has been very well looked after; we are having the Barrow attended to, and there is another river somewhere in the South, in Cork or Kerry, that is being attended to.  While no Deputy should urge that the money should be spent unless there was justification for it, at the same time I think the country as a whole should be considered.  The money should be spent as far as possible over the country as a whole.  If a particular area is not in a position to benefit under the 1925 Drainage Act, you may <Col N="431" /> find that under the Drainage Maintenance Act of 1924 practically nothing has been done in that area.  I want to ask the Minister to give consideration to the point of view that, while drainage is very important in practically every part of the Saorstát, it is doubtful if it is justifiable to spend very considerable sums in certain limited areas, whilst drainage problems of the same magnitude are left unattended to in other parts of the country. I would ask that consideration be given to that point of view.</P>
    <P>As regards the £30,000 that is to be spent under the 1924 Drainage Maintenance Act, I would ask that the Minister would give an indication as to where it is to be spent during the financial year 1927-1928.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first question put by the Deputy in reference to legislation, perhaps he would allow me to say that it is the intention to introduce an Act to enable County Councils to deal with any scheme that would cost less than £1,000.  We hope that we will be able to introduce the Bill after the summer recess.  As regards where the money under the Drainage Maintenance Act will be spent, work is at present in progress in Turloughmore district, Co. Galway&mdash;it will cost about £7,400&mdash;Hind River, County Roscommon, £4,000; Kilmastulla, County Tipperary, £5,800; Milford, County Cork, £1,530; the River Suck, Galway and Roscommon, £16,000; Lough Mask and River Robe, Mayo and Galway, £1,100.  It is not so easy to tell where the money under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, will be spent, because here the consent of the owners of the land must be obtained.  So far, although we have a number of schemes ready to submit to the occupiers, only two have actually been submitted&mdash; Multeen River, Co. Tipperary, and Paddinstown, Co. Westmeath.  There seems to be a good deal of local opposition, we are informed, to the carrying out of these schemes.  There are other schemes ready to be submitted&mdash;Awbeg in County Cork; Carrowreagh, County Roscommon; Tievebrack, Co. Tirconaill; Clonlisk, Co. Offaly; Riverstown, Co. Westmeath, and Akeragh <Col N="432" /> Lough, Co. Kerry.  There are some others that are almost at that stage, but it is quite possible that in some of these cases people may say that they are not going to bear the cost that would fall on them.  Again, there are other cases where we can only agree to go on if County Councils will agree to some contribution, because without a County Council contribution the schemes would not be economic, and the progress will depend on what is decided on by the County Councils.</P>

I must admit that we have received some particulars&mdash;perhaps exhaustive particulars&mdash;but it is very difficult to understand the delay that has occurred from the time the scheme was formulated by the County Council down to the present time.  We are not prepared to proceed with the scheme in one portion of the county until every portion of the county can receive the same treatment.  So far we have not been able to make any progress.

Unless I have notice from the Deputy I cannot answer him as regards the particulars of any special scheme, but the Deputy, I think, will have to make up his mind to be content with having one scheme going on at one time in County Mayo.  If we have to get five or six schemes to satisfy every part of the county, it seems to me that the only thing to do would be to leave Mayo till the last, and the Deputy would not like that.</P>

    <P>Deputies will see that there is a considerable decrease in this Vote.  It is down by something like £13,658.  The reduction is due to the winding-up of various Committees.  The Banking Commission, the Commission of Inquiry into the Preservation of the Gaeltacht, the Committee on National Health Insurance and Medical Services, and the Greater Dublin Commission of Inquiry have concluded their work.  Only a small provision has been made for the Board of Assessors under the Military Service Pensions Act of 1924.  The work of that Committee is almost completed. There is a small provision for the Food Prices Tribunal, and for the Committee on the Relief of the Destitute Sick and Poor, including the Insane Poor.  There is fairly full information in regard to the various Commissions in Part 3 of the Estimates. The Bankruptcy Laws Committee was set up on the 8th March, and it is impossible to say when that Committee will finish its work.  It was regarded as essential that there should be a full verbatim report of its proceedings, and so provision was made on the Estimates.</P>
    <P>The Central Savings Committee, for which, perhaps, the biggest provision in the Vote is made, is carrying on a great deal of very useful work for the State.  In addition to the Central Savings Committee, there are Committees in Cork City, Limerick and Rathmines. A great number of Savings Societies have been set up, most of them in schools, but also in Army units, in commercial firms, and in various Government Departments.  Altogether the number of such associations is 1,935.  The sales of Savings Certificates, <Col N="435" /> up to date, amount to £2,457,249.  There is a very steady sale of certificates, a certain decline during the holiday period in the summer, and a decline also about the Christmas period.  For instance, in March, 1926, the sales were £14,000; in April £12,000, and in July and August they went down to £9,300. In October they were up again to £11,000.  In December they went to the lowest point&mdash;£7,600.  Then in January they went up to £15,000; in February to £18,000, and in the month of May last they went down again to about £9,500. It is regarded as very beneficial work. It is useful to the community.  It does, actually, encourage habits of thrift and saving.  It provides the State with a source of borrowing, which is not the cheapest source of borrowing, but it has certain advantages.  It does mean that a great number of people are interested in State stability.  As a matter of fact, we saw, during the recent elections, that people who do not think much of the Constitution, or of the State, as at present established, found it necessary to state that they would not think of repudiating any obligation which the Government had incurred in respect to savings certificates.</P>

The Minister has suggested that it is likely to be covered by the increase in activities.  I would like an assurance from the Minister under sub-head C (1) that those are all the expenses that are likely to be involved in respect to payments for certificates&mdash;that is speaking with a reasonable amount of elasticity.

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand it is the view of the House that they are not anxious for long opening statements from Ministers on the Estimates on this occasion.  I expect that if there is to be anything in the way of lengthy discussion it will arise on Vote 11, which deals with the practical side of the work of this particular department. The only question that obviously arises on the face of those Estimates is an increase in respect to sub-head A, providing for salaries.  This is accounted for mainly by the temporary increase in staff to deal with works of an exceptional character.  There is, to begin with, an increase in the staff of the Engineering Branch.  The temporary engineers, arterial drainage, account for approximately £2,000 of an additional increase.  Then the expenses of land valuers in connection with arterial <Col N="437" /> drainage account for another £2,300. Temporary junior engineers, arterial branch, account for possibly another £400.  In the architectural branch there are two additional assistant architects for new buildings and works.  That accounts for £500.  Then there are also two additional architects' assistants for new building works, approximating to another £400.  In addition there is the automatic increase in the bonus, which accounts for £2,000.  The difference between the other casual increases and decreases on the sub-head goes to make up the balance of the total increase.</P>
      <P>There is only one other point that may arise on the estimate, and that is the question of filling the vacancy which remained over some time before. That is the appointment of a commissioner. That office was not filled until recently, and a question may be asked as to why the vacancy was filled at all.  The late commissioner resigned, having reached the maximum age.  He was succeeded by another commissioner, who is also near the maximum, and it was considered advisable that the new commissioner, who will probably succeed him when he vacates this post ultimately, should have some experience in the position before the full responsibility is thrown upon him.  So that really the filling of this office is only temporary, and I anticipate that in the future we shall only have two commissioners, as in the past.  I do not think that on this particular Vote it is necessary to say anything further in my opening statement.  I may, perhaps, have something more to say on the following Vote.</P>

      <P>There is one question that I wish to raise.  If the Minister will turn to the Engineering Branch, page 37, he will find, down near the foot of the page, there are 14 temporary drainage engineers, junior, salary £200 per annum (inclusive).  I want to know from the Minister what work are these men engaged in?  I want to know what class of work they are at?  Are they qualified engineers? Are they outdoor men or men doing work in an office?  The salary is £200 per annum inclusive.  If they are qualified engineers the Minister will say <Col N="438" /> that he is able to obtain qualified engineers at £200 per annum, doing what we assume is certainly responsible work, and work requiring men with experience and qualifications, and particularly outdoor work.  If men can be obtained for this work at that rate of remuneration it would be advisable, if men who are able to achieve as much would be sent to other departments at once, and if we could get something like the same standard of salary for efficient work in all departments, we would have brought about a condition of things that a good many people in the State want to see, and a consequent reduction all round in the cost of administration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise, on this Vote, a question of policy, and I think it can appropriately be raised now.  I refer to the policy of the Office of Works in refusing to allow an inscription to be placed on the pedestal of the bust of the late T.M. Kettle that has been erected in Stephen's Green. From the newspapers I gather that the Board of Works object to three lines from one of T. M. Kettle's poems, written on the eve of his death in France, on the ground that they would cause contention and possible hostility to the memorial.  I have always tried to seek peace and ensure it, but I have ventured to hope that that decision of the Office of Works may be reconsidered, because I think when it is looked at in a right light the policy of the Board of Works will be found to be a mistaken policy.  The lines that were objected to are these:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;These poor dead</P>
      <P>Died not for flag or king or emperor,</P>
      <P>But for a dream born in a herdsman's shed</P>
      <P>And for the simple scripture of the poor.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think they expressed what was in Kettle's own mind when he joined the British Army and went to the war. Tom Kettle was a friend of mine.  I had a friendship with him such as I have with many Deputies of this Dáil, based not on any common ideal or on any identity of opinion, but based on a recognition of those qualities that <Col N="439" /> make for friendship, and I believe that I might interpret his mind thus:&mdash;He did not go to fight and die in France for love of England.  I do not think he ever entertained that feeling; he did not go for hatred of Germany.  He loved German music and he loved Germany. He may have gone in part in the spirit of the Wild Geese of old:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&nbsp;War dogs battered and grey,</P>
    <P>Gnawing a broken bone:</P>
    <P>Fighters in every clime</P>
    <P>And every cause but our own.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>But in the main I believe he went, because in the early days of the war he was sent by a newspaper to Belgium as a war correspondent, and there he saw the refugees driven from their homes, drifting down the roads.  Anybody who has seen the war refugees knows that there is no sadder sight in the world; carts hastily piled up with all the treasures the household held dear, old women and little children forced from their homes.  I believe that the paramount impulse of Kettle's poem was the desire to see these people put back into their homes.  Is there anybody who will say that that was not a kindly and Christian impulse? Is there anybody, I do not care how bitter party feeling is in this country, will take exception to the dead man having the words which he wrote, the thoughts of his mind on the eve of his death, inscribed on his own memorial? The Parliamentary Secretary approaches this question anew.  He is not responsible for any previous decision.  I know he has ideals.  I believe he has a generous enough mind to respect the ideals of others.  I would appeal to him, not in any hostile or polemical spirit, to reconsider this question, and to say if a young man cut off in the prime of life, may not be remembered by the words which he choose himself and wrote down on the eve of his death.  I do not believe that any susceptibility or any feeling in the State will be injured if the Parliamentary Secretary of the Board of Works gives way on this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the point raised by Deputy Cooper, I would be long <Col N="440" /> sorry if any wrong impression were to arise in the country as a result of action taken in this particular case.  It is not for us to inquire into the motives that induce any individual to fight for any cause that might appear dear or important to him.  We all respect the memory of brave men, no matter for what cause they die.  In this particular case the motives with regard to retarding the inscription on this monument were certainly not of the kind that might possibly be adduced from the Deputy's statement.  It was merely with the object of preventing any possible vandalism that might arise as the result of heat engendered in the election campaign.  There was no intention to continue that attitude after that particular phase had passed.  I understand that no objection will be raised in future to the inscription.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Baxter's point about engineers, those men are fully qualified.  They are young men only recently qualified, the majority of them, and, unfortunately, in this country we have not got many openings for engineers.  As a result of that we are perhaps able to get them at a lower figure than might otherwise be anticipated.  They are doing very important work in making preliminary surveys in connection with the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925.  I understand they are giving complete satisfaction in that very useful work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>On two successive occasions there was criticism levelled at this Vote on the grounds of a persistent tendency towards over-estimating on the part of our Department. One Deputy argued against this practice that it resulted in a very heavy loss to the Exchequer.  That, of course, is not correct.  It is a fallacy.  That would be the case if the amount estimated for the spending Department remained at current account to the credit of the spending Department.  But that is not the case.  It remains to the credit of the Exchequer Account, and it only remains on current account so long as the credit balance is under £100,000. When it exceeds that amount it goes on to deposit.  In the case of the Board of Works the demands on the Paymaster-General for issues on Votes administered by the Board are made about every alternative week so that the question of loss of interest scarcely arises.  Even if the Votes were overestimated the issues would be restricted to the immediate needs of the Department, and no more would be drawn on the Paymaster-General or returned by him from the Exchequer Account than would be required to meet current commitments. I am not saying that as a plea in favour of the practice of overestimating, but it is just as well that we would have clear ideas on this particular point.  It was the policy of the British Government, and I believe it <Col N="443" /> still is, to favour the practice of over-estimating rather than take up parliamentary time with Supplementary Votes.  That, of course, was an argument that counted for more in the British House of Commons, where the pressure on time is greater than it is here, than it does with us.  It is now the policy of the Minister for Finance to lean against the practice of over-estimating, and an Order has been issued to the various Departments to that effect.  So far as we can, we have fallen into line with the view expressed in that Order.  I would like to point out in view of possible contingencies in the future that owing to the very nature of the work with which we are dealing in those Estimates it is a very difficult thing to estimate closely.</P>
      <P>This Department deals largely with constructive work, and we are often at the mercy of third parties in the shape of contractors who have naturally a certain amount of discretion as to when their contracts will be fulfilled.  In work of this character also, contingencies are continually arising which it is impossible to foresee.  For instance, in the construction of the Post Office we were held up for a considerable length of time as a result of the coal strike.  In the new plans for the Post Office a good deal of the work will entail the erection of steel framework.  As a result of the coal strike, steel was held up.  The same to a lesser degree is true of the work carried on in the Four Courts. Also in the case of the Post Office, the completion of the work is dependent on the carrying out of work under certain conditions of sub-lessees who had undertaken to construct shops on the Henry Street portion of the site, and it was necessary for those shops to be erected before the superstructure could be erected by the Board of Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again in the case of the Four Courts, there were long discussions between the Board, the Benchers of King's Inns, and the Incorporated Law Society with regard to the accommodation of these bodies, and work was delayed until these matters were finally settled.  We also have on hands a very big programme for the reconstruction of Civic Guard and other barracks.  Often it is <Col N="444" /> found that barracks which were estimated for become redundant or unnecessary, either because other barracks or alternative accommodation of a more suitable kind could be purchased or rented at a more economic figure than that at which the proposed buildings could be erected.  These sort of difficulties continually arise and hamper the work of the Department. For that reason I would expect Deputies to be a little lenient in regard to this practice of over-estimating.  We have the same thing in connection with the Arterial Drainage Act.  The Department has lost no time in putting that Act into operation.  We have made preliminary investigations in a great many cases, but the circumstances of the time are against us.  The operation of that particular Act is to a great extent dependent on three factors which are not constant.  To begin with, there is the factor of the immediate value of land to the occupier.  It is easy to understand that it would be profitable for farmers to drain land which might be let at £10 an acre, but it would be a very uneconomic proposition if it could be let only at five or ten shillings an acre.  Another important factor is the cost of drainage work.  The cost at present of such work is two-and-a-half times what it was pre-war.  A third factor is the high rate of interest.  In our Estimates we are allowing £50,000 for this particular work.</P>
    <P>If those factors remain constant it is not likely that we would be able to utilise that money in this particular scheme.  We cannot be sure that they may alter to our advantage.  If that were the case we would probably get ahead very rapidly with the work. These are the sort of difficulties with which we have to contend.  I do not intend to delay any longer with this opening statement, but I thought it just as well to deal with this particular point, as it has been raised on two previous occasions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'CONNELL Mr. T. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to call attention to a matter which is of general interest, not to any particular area, but to the entire State, namely, the want of adequate school accommodation. I think that the Board of Works, <Col N="445" /> who are responsible for the erection of these buildings, deserve to be criticised for their failure to grapple with this pressing problem, a problem to which their attention has been drawn repeatedly during the last three or four years.  The operation of the School Attendance Act during the past year has made the problem more pressing than ever.  On page 49 of the Estimates we have the usual sum of £75,000 provided. That, I understand, is the sum that has been granted year after year to provide new schools and to enlarge existing ones.</P>
      <P>The Ministry seem to go ahead as if this problem did not exist, or as if their notice was not drawn to it here in the Dáil by people interested in education and in the welfare of children all over the country.  The statement is sometimes made that the amount voted is sufficient to meet the demands put forward for the erection of new schools. I believe that the method of administration of these building grants is largely responsible for the lack of demand on the part of localities and managers of schools for the erection of new buildings, because, according to present arrangements, the Board of Works will in ordinary cases only provide two-thirds of the amount required to erect a new school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what sanction there is for that arrangement, but I know it is a long standing arrangement.  I know that it is a question of departmental policy, but, such as it is, I have no hesitation in saying that that arrangement has completely broken down. Under present conditions it is not possible to have anything like an adequate number of schools erected, because a locality without any machinery is not in a position to raise six or seven hundred pounds, as the case may be, as one-third of the amount necessary to erect a new school.  The managers of schools have, as I say, no machinery. They must raise the money by loan. There is no machinery, however, by which a loan may be raised.  It is not fair that the present generation should have to pay down this full capital sum required as one-third of the amount necessary to erect new schools.  It should be the policy of the Department to <Col N="446" /> give the whole grant for the erection of such schools.  Where the money has to be spent as capital expenditure it should be forthcoming by the State, as it is in a better position to borrow than a locality which has no machinery to do so.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary that this is a very urgent question.  Complaints are continually being made all over the country as to the want of adequate school accommodation, and no effort has been made to deal with the situation. It is not to any great extent a question for the Ministry of Education. Their duty in the matter, I take it, is to point out where the necessity arises for school buildings, but further they have nothing to do; unless the money is provided for them nothing can be done. I do not want to go into this matter at any great length.  I just wish to point out that nothing appears to have been done this year any more than in previous years to deal with this urgent problem.  I hope we will have a word from the Minister as to the possibility of abandoning this old-time custom of demanding from a locality one-third of the sum required for a new school.  I see no reason why that should be done in the case of a school any more than in the case of a police barrack.  This is in the nature of capital expenditure, and the State is in a better position to provide that than any other body.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question of arterial drainage, I want to know from the Parliamentary Secretary what stage has been reached in the discussion between the Government of Northern Ireland and his Department, or the Department of Finance, as to the drainage of the River Erne.  On this Vote I wish to raise the question generally of the drainage of the River Erne.  This may be said to be a question of public policy, because the drainage of the area affected by the Erne includes <Col N="447" /> the greater portion of five counties. Certain action has been taken by citizens of Northern Ireland with regard to the drainage of this river.  I have been trying to get information on the matter, and some time ago I was informed in this House that communications have passed between the Government of Northern Ireland and the particular Department here concerned.  I do not know, nor can I know, the policy of the Government of Northern Ireland with regard to this drainage work. What takes place between the respective Governments as regards this particular drainage scheme affects drainage in Cavan, Longford, Leitrim, and Tirconaill in the Saorstát, as well as Fermanagh in Northern Ireland, and, in fact, drainage of the greater portion of the four counties I have mentioned hinges on the carrying out of this drainage work, discussions on which are proceeding between the two Governments. It is the duty of our Ministry to hasten these discussions and to have something done as soon as possible.  I know the area concerned, and I know that the whole problem of drainage as affecting them cannot be fully or properly considered, nor can any drainage scheme in these areas be properly undertaken, unless this bigger scheme is first started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know quite well we will be told that we are going to flood thousands and thousands of acres if the Erne, the main river, and the lakes are not tackled.  There is in existence the Lough Erne Drainage Board.  This body is composed of ratepayers representative both of Northern Ireland and the Free State.  There is danger of a certain policy being pursued with regard to this particular drainage scheme and there is a feeling that some of the people of Northern Ireland are desirous of having set up a kind of Commission to carry out this drainage work and to maintain it after.  The feeling of our people is that that will not be satisfactory, and I want to know from the Ministry how far these discussions have proceeded, and along what lines, and has anything definite been decided?  I wish also to impress how important it is that the Ministry on behalf of the <Col N="448" /> people concerned in the Free State should do everything possible to get this work started at once, inasmuch as the drainage for the four counties is entirely dependent on what is done under this drainage scheme.  We feel we are going to be held up not only in the counties mentioned but in the County Monaghan as well until the main work is undertaken.  In saying that, we expect, even though certain interests, as we know, in Northern Ireland have put certain obstruction in the way of those anxious to carry out the scheme, that our people here in defence of our own citizens should press the point as strongly as they can.  We recognise that there are difficulties, but if we are going to see anything done as regards drainage in the counties I have mentioned inside the next five or six years, then our Ministry will want to exercise all the pressure possible to get this done.  I hope this evening to hear a statement of policy on the matter.</P>

      <P>I rise merely to express disagreement with the appeal made by the Parliamentary Secretary as regards showing leniency to over-estimating by his Department, or departments in general.  There is nothing more fatal in administration in this or any other country than to admit the doctrine of loose estimating by departments. It has been stated, and perhaps with a good deal of truth, that much of the over-taxation complained of has arisen from the fact that there has been loose estimating on the part of the departments.  The Parliamentary Secretary has stated that it did not matter whether or not they were over-estimating, because nothing would be issued except what is required.  But we all know, and the Department knows, that when it has a balance of a Vote to play with it can afford to be generous in its demands, whereas if there was rigid estimating departments would be careful in their demands.</P>

      <P>I notice the sum of £6,000 in connection with the Governor-General's Department; £1,000 for furniture and fittings, and £1,400 for light, water and cleaning.  One would suppose <Col N="449" /> that the Governor-General's establishment would be already sufficiently well furnished.  We all read that quite recently there was a very large expenditure in providing new lighting. Having regard to the salary paid to the Governor-General, I think it is unfair for the Government to demand additions by way of maintenance and supplies. Everybody knows that the whole country is crying out against the expenditure of £27,000 in connection with the Governor-General.</P>
      <P>I was much struck, and rather amused in reading the election speech of one of the Ministers&mdash;I think it was the Minister for Finance&mdash;who got heckled a little about this expenditure, and his defence was: &ldquo;Oh, that salary is what they pay in Australia.&rdquo;  That makes my case.  To compare the Free State with Australia is to compare a fly with an elephant.</P>

      <P>Yes, I am speaking with regard to this expenditure of £6,000 on the Governor-General's establishment, and I suggest that there is no necessity whatever for such expenditure. I say that the salary of the Governor-General should place him in a position to carry out any necessary maintenance, and I repeat that it is unfair to the country to try and supplement that salary by this allowance.  The country at large is crying out for a reduction of this Estimate.  I am pointing out that a great many references were made on the Government side to election promises.  I now ask them what about their promises of economy?  In this matter they may rest assured that I represent the feelings of the country, and if comparisons are to be made as to what would be proper expenditure on such a position, I would refer the Government Party to the expenditure in such a country as Switzerland, and not to Australia.  I will not, on this occasion, move for a reduction in the Vote, but I certainly will hold, and the people of the country will hold, that the expenditure is unjustifiable.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question raised by Deputy O'Connell and also by Deputy O'Gorman, both Deputies agree in this respect that it is scarcely a question for me to answer. It is a question of Government policy as to how much should be expended on national schools, and as to how much is to be expended in keeping up the Governor-General's establishment.  I was rather surprised to hear Deputy O'Gorman coming out in this fashion.  It is, perhaps, the first time in my experience that I have heard one gentleman hailing from the County Cork speaking so bitterly against another.  As I have stated, the expenditure on the Governor-General's establishment is quite normal. At the time when the Lord Lieutenant was here it was very much higher. There are valuable buildings there to be preserved, and we cannot allow them to go into disrepair.  With regard to the question of national schools, we have an estimate here for £75,000.  As the Deputy has informed the House, we are prepared to contribute at the rate of two-thirds to the expense of erecting these schools, and one-third has to be found locally.  The Deputy objects to this policy, and says it is very difficult to find money locally.  I think the Deputy should regard that as an indication of how much can be expended by the National Exchequer.  We are all part of the same financial unit, and this idea that when the country locally cannot afford to expend large sums of money the Central Government is in a position to do so, is entirely fallacious. I think if the Deputy looks at the amount in the Estimates for education he should be quite satisfied.  It amounts to almost a quarter of a million pounds. Rome was not built in a day, and we cannot expect to deal with all the problems arising in connection with education and other matters in a minute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Baxter raised the question of the Erne.  I am glad to be able to inform him that we already have had conversations with representatives of the Northern Works Department.  We have arranged that a scheme should be prepared by the engineers of the Northern Government and examined by our engineers, so that both Governments <Col N="451" /> may be satisfied as to its feasibility.  At this moment surveys are being carried out by the engineers of the Northern Government.  It will, of course, require legislation by both Governments to put any scheme decided on into operation, but the Deputy may rest assured that we are not allowing any grass to grow under our feet in dealing with this important matter.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of drainage generally, as the Deputy is aware, there are two Acts in operation at the present time, as well as some of the older Acts&mdash;the Drainage Maintenance Act of 1924, and the Arterial Drainage Act of 1925.  Most of the work under the Arterial Drainage Act is already well under way.  In fact, the greater part of it has been carried out.  The expenditure under the Act at the 31st March, 1927, was, approximately, £120,000. In forty-nine districts work was started, and in forty-two of these work had been completed at the close of the financial year 1926-27.  Of the 178 existing drainage districts 128 have now been inspected, and it would appear that the majority of these requiring restoration have already been dealt with.  Consequently, in the present year it is expected that there will be a considerable falling off in the number to be dealt with, and that a sum of £30,000 should cover the expenditure on restoration work for that period. With regard to the Arterial Drainage Act, for the reasons that I have already stated, the prospects are not quite so rosy.  Up to the present 448 petitions have been sent on by the county councils to the Commissioners of Public Works.  Preliminary inspections by engineers have been made in 162 cases. Schemes hitherto examined have been disappointing in the financial sense. Not one has been found which appears likely to pay expenses in the sense that the money value benefit derived by the lands will be sufficient to pay the expenses of the scheme, and to pay for the necessary works of maintenance. That is due, of course, to the great cost of engineering works, and to the depression in agriculture, which makes it less profitable to expend money on the improvement of land.  Any works that <Col N="452" /> will be carried out in connection with this Act will probably require pretty substantial grants from the Exchequer. Under the Act, it is the policy to make a grant of one-third of the cost, and if the local people are satisfied, and the county council in the particular area is also satisfied that the work should go ahead, and are prepared to back up their opinion by making grants, we are also prepared to make additional grants to the same amount, provided that that additional grant does not amount to more than one half of the total cost.  At the present time, our engineers are busily engaged in surveying these various drainage areas. At the moment we cannot say definitely that the prospects are rosy, but as we advance we may possibly be able to see a brighter future for this particular Act.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, a great deal of work has been carried out in connection with the Barrow drainage.  The draft scheme has not yet come into operation, and until it does we have no compulsory powers for the acquisition of land and other rights in connection with that river, but although not having that power we have been able to get under way, and are doing some very important work along the river. The most important work, at the present time, is above and below the town of Athy, where there is some very heavy work being carried out in connection with the removal of sand reefs and rock reefs.  It is expected that within the next few months we will have adequate power to carry out the more important work along this particular district.</P>

      <P>I am entirely dissatisfied with the reply of the Parliamentary Secretary on the question of school buildings.  I am quite prepared to make allowance for the fact that he has only been in his new post for a week or two, and that, probably, he is not acquainted with the subject very well.  I would like, however, to ask the Minister for Finance whether the Government has any proposals to make to deal with this question in a big way. He must know that this question of school accommodation is a matter of very great urgency throughout the <Col N="453" /> country.  He surely must have had complaints and the matter must be brought to his knowledge by the Minister for Education.  There is great complaint as to the inadequacy of school accommodation in the country.  As to local expenditure, the point I make is this: there is no machinery at present available to the managers of schools whereby the amount to be raised can in fact be raised.  There is no machinery; it is all a voluntary matter. According to the managers themselves that system has practically broken down.  At a meeting called on the 15th February to deal with this matter they passed a resolution stating that they were of opinion that the funds necessary for the building and enlarging of schools should be supplied from Government sources.</P>
      <P>This is a matter that the Government cannot afford to let drift in the manner in which it has been drifting for the past three years, especially owing to the operations of the School Attendance Act.  Many of the schools are overcrowded.  If schools were built where they should be built according to the modern ideas of education, it would be a very big programme.  I am only urging that in cases where there is no accommodation for pupils at the present time something should be done.</P>

      <P>I may say, in reply to the Deputy, that this matter has been the subject of conversations and conferences between myself and the Minister for Education.  Perhaps if we had not the distraction of an election we might have got further with it, but the whole matter of schools, both the provision and maintenance of school buildings, is under consideration.  I would just say this: I do not think it is a fair comparison that the Deputy makes when he says there is no more reason why the State should require local contributions for the erection of a school than for a police barrack.  A police barrack is a Government building, housing actual Government servants. That is not the position in any primary school except the model school in this country.  I would not like to indicate that we would adopt any plan that would mean the whole cost being <Col N="454" /> defrayed by the State.  As a matter of fact, it is not easy to get a satisfactory solution either in regard to the building cost or to maintenance.  If the charges for meeting all school maintenance were made upon the Central Fund the Deputy would see it would be a very expensive matter.</P>

It suffered cruelly last winter, and I am informed by persons who have visited it recently that unless some steps are taken at once it will suffer more.

I believe there are over 200 of those monuments in charge at present. We realise that our powers are not altogether adequate for dealing with this situation.

    <P>There is very little difference in this Vote as compared with last year.  There is a nett decrease of £133.

In the State Laboratory there are analyses of something like 30,000 samples, most of which are for the Revenue Commissioners for the purpose of assessing duty or for the purpose of enabling drawbacks to be made on certain dutiable goods to be paid on exportation.  There are analyses for the Department of Lands and Agriculture, including samples of dairy produce, margarine, fertilisers, and feeding stuffs.  The total number in the last year for which I have figures was 27,405; for the Department of Lands and Agriculture 6,919, and smaller numbers for a great many of other Departments including the Department of Justice, because analyses necessary in connection with criminal prosecutions <Col N="456" /> are carried out in the State Laboratory.</P>

(Civil Service Regulation Acts, 1924 and 1926) and of the Local Appointments Commission (Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase which is shown in this Vote this year is due to the fact that provision for the work of the Local Appointments Commission has to be made for a full year, whereas in the last Estimate there was only provision for a part of a year.  The work of the two Commissions is carried out by a joint staff.  In was found necessary on setting up the Local Appointments Commission to create a new post, that of Secretary to Selection Boards.  The creation of this post means that there is a certain continuity, and that there is at every Selection Board an experienced officer, who can see that the members of Selection Boards do not through lack of experience fall into any pit-falls.  There has been a good deal of Selection Board work, particularly in connection with the Local Appointments Commission.  A great number of citizens have given their services on these Selection Boards, free of any cost to the State.  I would like to take this <Col N="457" /> opportunity of expressing appreciation of the public-spirited action of a great many people, including a number of doctors and others, who have undertaken very arduous work in connection with Selection Boards.  There was one case, for instance, in which recommendations had to be made for doctors for five dispensaries.  I think there were 125 applicants.  The qualifications and the testimonials of all those doctors were examined, and the applicants were all interviewed.  The same thing happened in other instances, so that the work of the Selection Boards is in some cases very arduous work, and involves the sacrifice of a good deal of time. Those who have helped in the work of those Selection Boards out of a sense of public duty are certainly deserving of some appreciation.</P>
    <P>The Estimate shows certain sums expected to be obtained by way of extra Exchequer receipts.  A sum of £650 is put down as the amount estimated to be received from County and County Borough Councils under sub-section (4) of Section 12 of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act. 1926.  That is estimated to be the excess of the cost of the Commission over the receipts from the candidates' fees. Every effort is made to make the cost to the local authorities as small as possible. Outsiders have acted on those Selection Boards, and the services of many civil servants have been given incidentally in connection with the Boards.  There is no charge in connection with them.  I do not think that I need say anything with reference to the general work of the Civil Service Commission. It is well known.  For all appointments in the Civil Service, competitive examinations are held.  Where the appointment requires experience, and where the candidates cannot be tested by written examinations, Selection Boards are set up.  In addition to work for the Civil Service proper, examinations for army cadets, police and other examinations have been held.</P>
    <P>The Local Appointments Commission in certain cases hold examinations, and in other cases set up Selection Boards. The type of people who have been appointed to the Civil Service by means of Selection Boards, includes the following:&mdash;Assistant <Col N="458" /> Parliamentary Draftsman, Medical Referees for the National Health Insurance Commission, Dairy Produce Inspectors, Technical Appointments in the Stationery Office. National Education Inspectors, Architectural Assistants in the Board of Works, Drainage Engineers, Chemist in the State Laboratory, and appointments in the Broadcasting Station.  Appointments made on the recommendation of Selection Boards, for Local Authority, include&mdash;Medical Officers of Health, Dispensary Doctors.  Doctors for Institutions, Nurses, Midwives, Town Clerk, and other officers.  The cost of the work is met, to a substantial extent, by the fees of candidates.  In the case of dispensary doctors, the fee charged is £1, and the fee for solicitors to County Councils would be £1.  In the Civil Service, the fees paid by candidates vary from £4 in the case of an examination for Junior Administrative Officer or Assistant Inspector of Taxes to £2 in the case of an officer of Customs and Excise down to 10/- in the case of typists and shorthand-typists, 5/- in the case of Post Office Learners, and 2/6 in the case of Boy Messengers and Girl Probationers in the Post Office.</P>

      <P>The Minister has told us a good deal of the Appointments Commission, of Selection Boards and of the saving to the Local Authorities.  My experience of the Appointments Commission and the Selection Boards is not the same as that of the Minister.  The delay which is caused in making the appointments necessitates considerable avoidable outlay on the part of the local authorities. While agreeing with the Minister that the gentlemen who give their services gratis on these Selection Boards deserve our gratitude, I should like to point out that the local authorities are losing by the system.  In some cases which I know they have lost hundreds of pounds by the delay in making appointments.  I do not think that that can be described as economy.  The Minister said that everything was being done to lighten the expenses of local boards.  As a fact, the salaries paid to doctors doing locum tenens work are double the ordinary salaries. In some cases the delay in making <Col N="459" /> appointments has been six months greater than it would be under the old régime.  In respect of every appointment that delay involved a loss to local boards with which I am connected of £150.  I do not think that is a great economy.  So far from being economic I think this system is quite the reverse so far as the local boards are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must realise that, in connection with this new system of making appointments, there were a great many difficulties to be overcome in the first instance.  To decide on procedure and on the method on which the Selection Boards would be constituted took time and everything connected with the matter presented very great difficulties, in the first instance.  Perhaps in relation to the first appointments there were delays. These difficulties have been to a very large extent overcome.  While you cannot get appointments as quickly as you could in certain circumstances under the old system, I think it can be promised that they will be got in the future without any serious delay.</P>
      <P>Under the old arrangement, it was possible to give very short notice by way of advertisement and to have the appointment made at the next meeting of the Board after the applications had been received.  So far as the Local Appointments Commissioners are concerned, advertisements are issued and there is a reasonable time given for all likely applicants to apply.  After they have applied, the Board is set up.  The number of applicants is very great.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, undoubtedly, a much wider choice than there ever was under the old system.  You used to have two or three persons with some local &ldquo;pull&rdquo; applying for local appointments.  In one case, under the new method, there were as many as 25 doctors applying for each position.  Five posts were advertised and 125 doctors applied.  It takes some little time to have the qualifications of 125 candidates scrutinised.  Interviewing the candidates occupies a few days.  It is not possible to set down a selection board and let it go ahead for 24 hours, <Col N="460" /> without rising.  When the report is presented to the Local Appointments Commission, a medical examination of the recommended candidates has to take place and, after the medical examination, the Local Appointments Commission, having got the names of referees, has to make its inquiries in regard to the character of the applicants. All that has to be done before the names are sent down to the local authority as being fully qualified in respect of professional knowledge, health and character to fill the post. I think in future there will be no cause of complaint in regard to delay.</P>

I should be very glad if the Minister would take some steps to remedy this defect.  I have one case in mind which bears out my contention.  I do not think that full consideration is given to the local needs and requirements, apart from the qualifications and fitness of the candidates.  In a particular district, which is very difficult to administer, a lady doctor was recently appointed.  I am afraid that that appointment will not be a success.  I think if the local needs and requirements were considered&mdash;I do not know if any representations were made&mdash;a lady doctor would not have been appointed to that district.  This is a matter which I think requires some attention.</P>

I am not sure whether or not that covers the advertisement of vacancies.  Does this refer to the advertisement one reads that, say, five nurses are required in <Col N="461" /> certain places and that applications are invited, or is there another advertisement which is not included in this Estimate and which is paid for by the local authority?</P>

      <P>I question the wisdom of these frequent advertisements for minor appointments.  They do not seem to be required by the provisions of the Act.  It seems rather trivial to publish advertisements in half-a-dozen papers in respect of positions worth from £50 to £100 a year.</P>
      <P>In addition, I want to protest&mdash;I have done so once already&mdash;against the fees charged before applications are considered. I think the fees are too high. They are too high particularly in the case of an applicant who is seeking time after time for a post.  The Minister has told us that 125 doctors applied for five positions.  If those 125 doctors are continuing to apply, the last man will have paid £100 before he gets the post.  We know, as a matter of fact, that plenty of people are making applications repeatedly for appointments and each time they are expected to pay a fee of from 5/- to £1. These people are not in a position to pay that fee.  It is only the employed person who can readily afford that fee and, sometimes, even he cannot very easily afford it.  The unemployed person, whom one should think about when publishing advertisements of this kind, cannot legitimately be asked to pay repeatedly this fee of from 5/- to £1.  I submit to the Minister that it is necessary there should be a considerable reduction in the fees if fees have to be repeatedly charged.  I do not know whether or not it would be possible to have an arrangement whereby a fee would be valid over a period.  The fee is too heavy a charge for the unemployed person to bear and it is too heavy a charge even for the lower-paid employed person to bear I do not suppose there are many doctors seeking this particular class of appointment who are in a position to pay repeatedly £4 for a stamp.</P>

      <P>I was not clear as to that.  However, I am rather concerned with the fee of from 7/6 to 15/-.  It is the class of person affected by that fee to whom my attention has been directed.  He is invited to send in an application two or three times a year.  After the first application, there may be no results and although he will have a right to try again, he cannot afford to throw away another 7/6 or 15/-.  I make the appeal that the fees should be revised and the rate reduced.</P>

      <P>I desire to point out, in the first instance, that the Estimate on this occasion exceeds the Estimate for 1925-26 by £3,600.  The actual expenditure then was £7,243.  I do not think that that increase of expenditure is justified by the Local Appointments Commission.  I also want to comment on the fact that in 1923-24 there were seven officials in this Department, thirteen in 1924-25, eighteen in 1925-26, and for 1927-28, twenty-five.  If the Department continues to grow at that rate it will soon be one of the largest in the State.  I do not think the amount of work to be done justifies such an increased expenditure and such an increased staff.  The Minister will have to justify the expenditure before it is passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Doyle, and supported for various reasons by Deputy Brennan, I do not suppose that complaints against the existence of the Civil Service Commission are half as strong or as forcible as the complaints against the existence of the Local Appointments Commission. Deputy Brennan complained about the existence of the Commission for one reason, and Deputy Doyle for another.  Deputy Doyle's complaint is a very justifiable one, and if the Local Appointments Commission is to continue to function, and be looked upon as an authority competent to make appointments, it will have to speed up <Col N="463" /> matters and do the work.  It will have to make appointments in a reasonable time.  Deputy Doyle raised this matter in the House a few months ago, and he informs me that these appointments are yet unfilled.  There are demands from various parts of the country for the repeal of this Statute.  If the law that exists causes dissatisfaction on the one hand, and on the other hand, because of the reasons referred to by Deputy Doyle, then it is going to become very unpopular.  Other counties can make the same complaint that Deputy Doyle makes.  I have some experience of the slow methods of the Local Appointments Commission with regard to the filling of posts in my constituency.</P>
    <P>If the Commission is to command any confidence at all&mdash;I do not know if it will ever be really satisfactory&mdash;it will certainly have to recognise that local authorities want the appointments to be filled in the shortest possible space of time, so that they will not have the onus cast on them of paying higher salaries to substitutes.  If the present machinery is not giving satisfaction, and I believe it is not, then I strongly urge the Minister to revise it.  On consideration of the difficulties, if more satisfaction cannot be secured, then I predict, as I did when the Bill was going through, that the Act will have to be repealed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is no reason to be dissatisfied with the Act. I think the passage of the Act was the beginning of one of the greatest reforms yet introduced.  It is an Act that is going to purify public life so far as local authorities are concerned, and I find that intelligent members of local authorities are very glad, so far as some appointments, at any rate, are concerned, that they are free from canvassing, and the efforts to enlist their support, to which they were subject. There is no reason why the appointment of, say, a dispensary doctor should not be made by the machinery of the Commission within four or five weeks.  That is perhaps a fortnight or three weeks longer than was taken under the old method.  I do not think we could get appointments made as <Col N="464" /> quickly as under the old method.  Any additional expense that may fall on local authorities, as a result of employing locum tenens a little longer, will be made up, undoubtedly, by having a new tone given to local administration, by having people appointed who are much better qualified, by giving a chance to people who had no chance in the past, because they had no influence, and by getting the best people that are available for the money for the ratepayers.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan spoke about the appointment of a woman doctor in a particular district.  I am sorry the Deputy was not in the last Dáil when the last Civil Service Regulation Act was before the House.  I do not know if he would have agreed with the stand that I was taking then, but I suspect he would have helped me somewhat.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister has not missed the point.  The point I raised was: Was due consideration given to the local needs and requirements and the fitness of the candidates to carry out the work in that district. I have not objected exactly to the lady doctor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is a matter that will have to work itself out.  If the lady doctor in a place is notable to do the work, then a case can be made, but until she has had a try at it there is no use in discussing it. Deputy Johnson said that the fees were too high.  I already indicated that in one particular case where there were five appointments for doctors there were 125 applicants.  That was a very heavy task to set the Selection Board. If we had no fees perhaps we would have had more applicants.  It will not facilitate the working of the Act to cut down the fees too much.  In fact, if we cut them down too much, the Act might break down.  At any rate, you might be driven to the position of having paid selection boards, and probably people of not as high standing on them.  Supposing there are five dispensaries vacant at one time, a candidate could apply for them all and pay only the one fee, so that it is not so very heavy.  I do not think there are so many doctors unemployed as to make it impossible for them to raise even £1.</P>

      <P>Take nurses.  The number of nurses applying for any position so far has not been very large. It is not at all likely that any nurse who is at all qualified will find that the payment of a fee is a heavy charge on her.  It has happened that there were only two or three applicants for the position of nurse, so that I do not think it is likely that any one of them will pay fees again and again.  Out of a total of about £10,000 expenditure, only about £2,500 was recouped by fees.  As far as examinations are concerned, there is an age limit generally, and the candidate has only two or three chances, so that you will not have so many persons paying fees again and again.  I do not think that the sort of situation that Deputy Johnson indicated exists, or is likely to arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister that it does, in fact, exist with people who are ordinary workmen and women.  Take the case of nurses, which the Minister spoke of.  Some of the advertisements have been for posts at £25 a year, and applicants are expected to send in fees for such posts.  There are, in fact, cases of workmen that have come under my own notice who would have liked to have applied for certain posts.  After sending in one application and paying a fee, they heard no more.  They know they are competent for the job, but they are not going to do for the Civil Service Commission what they would not do for a private employer, and perchance the Civil Service does not get the best choice.  I really do not think that for ordinary avocations, for ordinary workmen, working more or less for the equivalent of a weekly wage, which might be paid monthly, there is any reason why there should be such fees even as 5s., 7s. 6d., and 10s. charged with each application. No private employer requires such a payment, and the old municipal system did not call for any such payment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is recognised that in certain appointments of a low value the fees should be small, but it is really a question from the point of <Col N="466" /> view of the State of getting the best people available as regards qualifications, and if, through having no fee, or having fees that are too low, we make it easy and tempt people who are not really qualified to apply, we may hinder the working of the system.  However, if the Deputy would some time indicate to me a case by way of illustration&mdash; if he were able to say that he knows so-and-so who would have liked to have applied for a job, and did not because he had applied previously, I might get some investigation of the matter carried out.  With regard to advertising, we are already examining that question, and considering the policy that will get us candidates while lessening the cost.</P>

      <P>I do not think that any comment is necessary.  It is obvious that a whole new range of work has been opened up by the setting up of the Local Appointments Commission that was not in existence in 1925-26.  As for the figures of 1923-4, there is no need to talk about them.  The Commission was just beginning&mdash;it had not by any means got into its stride.  Now the Commission is in full working order and has a staff that enables it to do the work required to be done.  There were great complaints that years after people had been appointed certificates had not been issued to them.  They were not issued because in the early years there was no staff to issue them.  Now we have a staff that is able to do the work of the Commission, and unless there were increases, such as might be occasioned if the Minister for Local Government issued Orders bringing other classes of local employees within the Act, the present staff might be regarded as the staff that is competent to do the work that has been shown to be the work that will fall on the Commission.</P>
