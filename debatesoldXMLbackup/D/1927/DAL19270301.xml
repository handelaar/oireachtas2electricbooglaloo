      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will lay on the Table a return showing (a) the number of &ldquo;on licences&rdquo; in each licensing area and the estimated population in each area; (b) the number of licensed premises in each licensing area with a valuation (i) under £10, (ii) at or over £10 but under £30, (iii) at or over £30 but under £50, (iv) at or over £50 but under £75, (v) at or over £75 but under £100, and (vi) at or over £100.</P>

      <P>The return asked for by the Deputy will be laid on the Table as soon as possible.  To obtain the material for the preparation of the return it will be necessary to get particulars from the local records of the officer in charge of each Excise General Station, and as these records do not show the licensing area in which a particular publichouse may be situated and as the officer's station may contain parts of several licensing areas it is expected that some time must elapse before the information will be available.</P>

      <P>I do not want to impose a great deal of trouble on the Department.  The value of the return would be in relation to the Intoxicating Liquor Bill.  If the Bill is to be passed before the return is available, unless the Department requires it.  I do not think it would be worth the trouble.</P>

If the Deputy will send me fuller particulars I will have further inquiries made.</P>

      <NameTxt>EOIN MAC NEILL</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether there is any foundation for the allegation in a notice which appeared in one of the Dublin newspapers during the past few days that the prominence given in examinations for the administrative class of the Civil Service to a knowledge of Irish has resulted in a neglect by students to enter for these competitions; that the course in Irish is likely to be revised in the near future; that the Civil Service Commissioners have under consideration some modification and alteration of the very high standard of proficiency in Irish hitherto required; and that qualification in the subject is all that will be demanded in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention has been called to the article referred to in the question.  There is no foundation of any kind for the suggestion made in the article as to the position of Irish in the administrative examination. The Civil Service Commissioners have no reason to believe that the fact that Irish is compulsory in part A of the examination has resulted in neglect by students to enter for the competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1025" /> No lowering of the standard required in the subject has taken place, and the Commissioners have no intention of making any change in that direction in the examination for the administrative or any other class in the Civil Service. The only change recently effected in regard to Irish in Civil Service examinations is one which raises the standard of proficiency required from appointees, and no suggestion has been made from any quarter for the lowering of the standards that have been in operation.  Irish has been and remains a compulsory subject in all open competitive examinations for the Civil Service.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce what rates of wages are being paid, in the various districts concerned, for unskilled labour in the erection of masts for transmission lines for electricity from the Shannon; whether the rates have been approved by him; whether they are based on information as to current rates of wages for analogous work supplied by his Department, and, if so, what was that information; whether the wages are supplemented by free or cheap housing, food supply or other facilities, and, if so, what are those facilities; whether he has made any suggestion or recommendation to the contractors as to a preference to be given to any particular class of men in engaging employees for the work; and whether applications for employment on the work are dealt with in the first instance by the Employment Exchanges.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The general rate approved by me for unskilled labour on the erection of poles is 8½d. per hour or 35s. 5d. per week for 50 hours.  The comparison made is with the rates of wages prevailing for labourers in the rural districts which are the districts where the poles will mainly be erected.  The general rate paid for the erection of poles is considerably in excess of the rates prevailing in those districts.  The <Col N="1026" /> wages are not supplemented in any of the ways mentioned in the question; it is not necessary since the men are working within reach of their homes. For labour required in the neighbourhood of cities or towns the Employment Exchanges are being used so far as practicable.  Elsewhere there is in many cases a branch employment office sufficiently near and in those cases resort is made to that office.  Owing to the nature of the work and its wide distribution labour may have at times to be obtained otherwise than through the employment exchanges or branch offices.  Preference is given to ex-army men and to local labour in the district in which the work is being done: as the work progresses labour from the district where the work has been completed will be discharged and labour from the next district will then be taken on.</P>

      <P>Generally the position is that on Second Reading objection may be taken to a Bill on the grounds that it does not contain certain provisions that a Deputy thinks it should contain to meet his requirements.  Amendments, so far as relevant, may be moved to the Bill in Committee.  On Report Stage, objection can be taken to a Bill only on the grounds of what it contains, not what it does not contain.

      <P>I move to delete sub-section (4).  I do so partly with the object of eliciting information and partly because I do not see the need for the date the 1st October, which is the final date after which there is no reference to a Pensions Board.  I take it the intention of the Minister is that pensions or gratuities shall be paid in respect of persons who may be killed or wounded on Army service even after the 1st October, 1924.  I do not understand the reason for fixing that date. What is to be the approach if there is no Pensions Board?  Is it to be left wholly to the discretion of the Minister without any independent or semi-independent authority in the case of any person who is wounded in the course of his duty after the 1st October, 1924?</P>

      <P>Sub-section (4) provides for cases occurring after the 1st October, 1924, which was the date on which the Army Defence Forces came into existence.  Any case occurring after that will be on an ordinary peace footing and can be dealt with departmentally.  It cannot be said that a person injured by a mechanical vehicle, or in any other way, should not get proper compensation.  Departmental machinery is in existence by which these cases can be decided on their merits.  A person who suffered an injury after that date would not be debarred from receiving proper treatment according to the nature of the wound he got.</P>

      <P>This Board must terminate some time, and must come to the end of its duties.  If we were going to carry on the Board would have to be in existence as long as the Army was in existence.  If there were only one or two cases in the course of twelve months it would not be worth while to keep the Board in existence to deal with them.  These cases could come before the Minister in the ordinary way and be dealt with departmentally, and they would get as much justice as if dealt with by any Army Pensions Board.  On the whole, it is better when the Board has finished its work that these cases should be dealt with departmentally, and I think machinery can be evolved that will give them justice.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Every person who was discharged from the forces before the 1st day of October, 1924, and was at the date of his discharge suffering from a disablement caused by disease attributable to service in the forces during the period which commenced on the 1st day of April, 1922, and ended on the 30th day of September, 1924, may, if the degree of such disablement was at the date of such discharge or has become or becomes (otherwise than by reason of the serious negligence or misconduct of such person) within four years after such discharge not less than the minimum degree of disablement, be granted a disability pension at the <Col N="1037" /> rate mentioned in the appropriate column of the Second Schedule to this Act opposite to the appropriate degree of disablement mentioned in the first column of that Schedule.</P>
    <P>(3)  Every pension granted under this section shall commence from such date as the Minister, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, shall determine, but such date shall not be earlier than the date of the passing of this Act, nor than the date on which the disablement first amounted or amounts to the minimum degree of disablement.</P>

      <P>It would be impossible to say in what state of health certain persons were when they came into the Army, and the amendment proposes to give a man four years from the date of his disablement or one year from the passing of the Bill to apply to get the minimum percentage.  If this amendment were not made it would be impossible in some cases to determine whether a man had disease on entering the Army or was free from disease.  The four years that run from the date on which he alleges he contracted the disease, or a year from the date of the passing of the Bill, will give the Board an ample opportunity to find out whether the man has attained the disability mentioned in the Bill at the expiration of the four years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3), line 53, to delete the words &ldquo;than the date of the passing of this Act, nor.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This seems to be rather an important question, though it refers to persons discharged before October, 1924.  If granted pensions, their pensions would not begin until, let us say, April of this year.  There would be no payment, no allowance whatever of any kind, for all the doctors' fees and expenses that have been incurred treating this disease, and every day that the Seanad or that the Dáil is not sitting means damage to the interest of the particular patient.  That seems to me to be unfair. If we decide that pensions should be payable in these cases, I think we should not make them dependent on the date of the passing of this Bill.  I think that there should be some provision dating back, or making it possible for some payment to be given in respect of the period during which the expenses have been incurred on account of the disease.  I think this is too stiff and too hard against the patient, and I would like the Minister to deal with this matter from the point of view of the Department as to what it means, whether it is simply on the ground of economy or whether there is any administrative difficulty.  It will undoubtedly mean that for every day's delay in the passing of the Bill the prospective pensioner will be damaged, and I am therefore moving the deletion of these words.  Then if the Pensions Board decide that the minimum degree of disablement occurred immediately on discharge the pension would be dated back.  That might be subject to some modification.  I think there should be some provision in the Bill to allow of a gratuity, shall I say, by way of commutation, as between the date of the minimum degree of disablement <Col N="1039" /> and the date of the passing of the Bill. As it stands, I think it is too hard upon a sick man.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be impossible to do both the things that Deputy Johnson mentions, to give a gratuity in one case and then to give a pension afterwards.  I do not think that would be at all possible or feasible. The reason this other amendment was put in is because we are giving four years to come up to the degree of disablement from the discharge from the Army.  There may be some few cases, of course, where men actually left the Army with 80 per cent. disablement. But if the ordinary disease started while the man was in the Army, we give four years from the date of his discharge for the degree of disability to reach the minimum allowed in the Bill.  Nobody could tell four years afterwards what a man's condition was at that date.  It might have been 20 per cent. disablement.  So that on the whole I believe we have put in a reasonable amendment.  But if the Deputy insists upon that point I would be quite willing to give the matter further consideration before the Report Stage.  I am really of opinion that it will not do much good however. I do not think it can be improved to the extent of giving a gratuity for one portion of the period and a pension afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I only used the word &ldquo;gratuity&rdquo; to indicate a kind of financial method of paying the pension retrospectively.  I do not mind how it is done.  Probably the Minister is aware of cases which would have come at any time within the last two years within the terms of the Bill only that he has been debarred by the absence of statutory authority from paying such a pension. I do not know whether there are many cases.  Probably there are not very many, but it seems to me unfair that we should now be passing this Bill for the purposes of providing pensions in cases of disease, as it appears in this case, and be deliberately saying that every day that we delay in passing the Bill will be a saving to the Exchequer and a loss to the recipient.  On the face <Col N="1040" /> of the Bill itself, we are admitting that the man is entitled to the pension by virtue of the disease contracted during his service.  When the case is clear and the minimum degree of disablement has been on record, it seems to me fair that some payment should be made to that man to meet his actual pecuniary losses during the time he has been disabled through disease.  Perhaps if the Minister would look into the matter closely, between now and the Report Stage, it would meet the requirements.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 11.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Every person who was discharged from the forces before the 1st day of October, 1924, and was at the date of such discharge suffering from a disablement due to a wound <Col N="1042" /> received on or after the 1st day of October, 1923, while he was a member of the forces and in the course of his duty as such member may, if the degree of such disablement was at the date of such discharge not less than twenty per cent., be granted a wound pension at the rate mentioned in the appropriate column of the Second Schedule to this Act opposite to the appropriate degree of disablement mentioned in the first column of that schedule.</P>
    <P>(2) If a person to whom a pension is granted under this section was married before the date of his discharge from the forces and is at the date of the commencement of such pension a married man for the purposes of this Act then he shall for so long after such commencement as he continues to be a married man for the purposes of this Act be entitled to be paid and receive a married pension at the rate mentioned in the appropriate column of the Second Schedule to this Act opposite to the appropriate degree of disablement mentioned in the first column of that schedule.</P>
    <P>(3)  Every pension granted under this section shall commence from such date as the Minister, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, shall determine but such date shall not in any case be earlier than the day next after the date on which the person to whom the pension was granted was discharged from the forces.</P>
    <P>(4)  Every person who was discharged from the forces before the 1st day of October, 1924, and was at the date of such discharge suffering from a disablement due to a wound received on or after the 1st day of October, 1923, while he was a member of the forces and in the course of his duty as such member may, if the degree of such disablement was at the date of such discharge less than twenty per cent., be granted a gratuity of such amount as the Minister having regard to all the circumstances of the case shall with the consent of the Minister for Finance determine, but no such gratuity shall, <Col N="1043" /> in the case of a person who immediately before his discharge from the forces was an officer, exceed one hundred pounds or, in the case of a person who immediately before his discharge from the forces was a soldier, exceed sixty pounds.</P>
    <P>(5)  In the case of a person who at the date of his discharge from the forces is suffering from any of the disablements mentioned in the first column of the Fourth Schedule to this Act, the degree of such person's disablement for the purposes of this section shall be the degree set out in the second column of that schedule opposite to the disablement from which such person is so suffering.</P>
    <P>(6)  In the case of a person who at the date of his discharge from the forces is suffering from a disablement not mentioned in the first column of the Fourth Schedule to this Act, the degree of such person's disablement for the purposes of this section shall be the degree assessed in that behalf by the Army Pensions Board.</P>

      <P>A number of amendments are governed by the first amendment in the name of Deputy Davin to this section.  They all refer to &ldquo;in the course of his duty.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Deputy Davin, I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), lines 30 and 31, to delete the words &ldquo;and in the course of his duty as such member.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is really preparatory to a further amendment, I think.  The section reads that every person who is discharged within a certain date suffering from a disablement due to a wound received on or after 1st day of October, 1923, &ldquo;while he was a member of the Forces and in the course of his duty as such member&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; I think the intention should be that unless there is evidence of misconduct or deliberate negligence wounds received by a man while a member of the Army should make him eligible for a pension.  The term &ldquo;in the course of his duty as such member&rdquo; might, I think, be interpreted as cutting out cases which would reasonably, taking the cases of <Col N="1044" /> workmen's compensation as a parallel, be brought within the scope of the Bill.  I think that the eliminating clause should rather have reference to negligence or misconduct and that when a man is a member of the Army, is under the command all the time of, and is responsible to, superior officers for every act of every hour of his service, the risks attaching to that should be subject to liability on the part of the State.  Unless there is deliberate misconduct or negligence he should not be excluded.  It is on these grounds I move, on behalf of Deputy Davin, that the words be deleted.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will make it clear whether this amendment is necessary or not, because another argument is that a soldier on active service is always on duty.  A case might be shut out from the consideration of the Pensions Board on the grounds that the soldier was not on duty.  On the other hand, we know that in other Departments in this State, in the case of a Gárda for instance, it has been held that the Government was not liable for injuries to the member of the Gárda when the Gárda was not on duty.  I hope the Minister will make the position clear. I think there is a great deal to be said for Deputy Johnson's argument, but it might not be necessary to make the amendment if a soldier on active service is always on duty.  If it is to be construed that at any time he was not actually on parade or was not actually engaged in military operations, under the order of his superior officer, he is liable to be excluded from a pension, by reason of an accidental wound received possibly while ambushing&mdash;I do not know if ambushing is excluded&mdash; or that he received an injury from a bomb or from a land mine while going on leave&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like to know if this phrase is to be construed as excluding such men from pensions. I think that is a wrong principle. I should like to know whether it is the contention of the Department of Defence that a soldier on active service <Col N="1045" /> can be off duty, or if they accept the principle that has been established elsewhere?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>A soldier on active service is always on duty and must be on duty.  It is only in the case of volunteers it was decided that a man should have received wounds while he was performing duty.  He was not in the same position as a man in a properly organised army.  The whole basis of the legislation we are bringing forward is that a man must have been on duty.  If a man was wounded in some way or other&mdash;it is very hard to say how a man might get wounded or get disease&mdash;he might not have been on duty at all and might have been out of the organisation.  Anything might have happened to him.  The basis of our legislation is duty, and as far as this Bill goes we must have that provision in it.  As I pointed out, you are not dealing with a regular army during the whole of the period.  You are dealing with the volunteer period, and volunteers will constitute the great majority of the cases coming under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to note that, in this particular section, we are dealing with wounds received after the 1st October, 1923. Therefore, these must have been Army cases.</P>

      <P>We are legislating for cases for the year up to the 1st October, 1924, and the question is whether a man was on duty in that period.  If a man were not on duty in that period and received an injury, it would not be right that the State should have to pay him for that.  If the man proves that he was on duty as a soldier or a volunteer he is bound to get a pension if he fulfils the other requirements.</P>

      <P>What would happen in a case such as I brought to the Minister's notice where a man was on duty and a rifle went off by accident and he lost his leg as a result of that?  That <Col N="1046" /> man has already been refused any compensation on the grounds that the accident was due to his own carelessness. Will that man be debarred under this Bill from getting any consideration for the loss of his leg?  He lost his leg during the period of his service in the Army in handling a rifle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>If an accident occurred through a man's own wilful misconduct he cannot get a pension.  In the case that Deputy Byrne refers to, if it has been proved to the satisfaction of the people who examined him that the man was criminally negligent he could not get a pension, but on the other hand if the rifle went off accidentally, and if it was shown that the man was not negligent in the handling of it, that man would clearly be entitled to a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has missed the point.  It has been pointed out that the section deals with wounds received on or after the first October, 1923.  Consequently we are dealing with soldiers in uniform.  Let us assume that 95 per cent. of the cases would be men in uniform and members of the National Army.  As the section reads, if a man were on leave and in uniform, and if he were attacked and suffered as a consequence, it is conceivable that this limiting section would rule him out, because it might be said that the wounds were not received in the course of his duty.  I want to make it possible that he will be bound to receive it if all the other circumstances in connection with the case bring him within it.  Supposing that this is deleted what harm will come to the purpose of the section? The man was a member of the Forces and was on active service at the time, and I think that all the requirements of the Minister would be met if, instead of these words &ldquo;and in the course of his duty&rdquo; some phrase such as that the man had received his wounds by gross misconduct or culpable negligence <Col N="1047" /> or something of that kind were introduced showing that he had brought the injuries on himself by his own actions.  In the case of a man attacked at home who was still a member of the Army, I think the section as it reads would leave it to the Army Pensions Board to rule him out, and I do not think that is the intention of the Minister or of the Dáil.  An interpretation of the section is possible which would put him outside of its provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>A man on active service and wearing uniform, whether he was at home or on a day's leave, wouldarly come within the section, but if he went away and that something happened to him in the ordinary course, such, for instance, as an accident while engaged in kicking football, well he would not come within the section and would not be entitled to a wound pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>We are prepared to look into it to see if the case Deputy Johnson makes is right, but I should say not.  In the case of a man wearing his uniform and carrying out orders it could be claimed for him that he was on duty and was discharging his duty as a soldier.  There is the other case, that any accident that happened to a man outside of his duty as a soldier would be covered if the amendment were carried.  I do not think it is Deputy Johnson's intention to give greater consideration to the soldier than is given to a man in the Civil Service.  I am sure it is not the Deputy's intention to cover cases where a soldier, say, met with an accident by slipping on the footpath or where he was run down by a tram or something like that.  These cases are altogether different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I realised from the beginning that the mere deletion of the section would not be enough.  I think, however, it would be unsatisfactory if it were left in its present form, because it leaves the possible interpretation which would rule out a man who was wounded, even wounded by an attack of the enemy, although he was a member <Col N="1048" /> of the National Army.  I ask that the matter should be further considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out that a man who handles his rifle negligently is extremely unlikely to shoot himself, but he is likely to shoot one of his comrades.  You may have the case where a man handles his rifle negligently in the barrack room and wounds a man who may be asleep in bed.  That man may not be in uniform at all.  I do not know if you could say that that man was on duty.  I think all that Deputy Johnson is suggesting is that there might be some reconsideration of the wording of the section so as to make it plain that it will apply to any man serving as a soldier: that he was on duty and was wounded by reason of his service as a soldier without there being culpable negligence or wilful neglect.  That is the principle that Deputy Johnson is arguing for, and perhaps the Minister would agree to consider it before the Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the case that Deputy Cooper has cited, if a man was in barracks and whether he was in uniform or not you would have to regard him as a soldier.  If he was wounded there, you would, of course, have to take all the circumstances into account.  I will look into the matter and see if I can get any other form of words to make the matter clearer.  I am satisfied, however, that the section as worded is all right without any amendment, but I am prepared to look into it further.</P>

      <P>The case I have in mind is that of a young soldier in Amiens Street Post Office in 1923 or 1924.  There was a raid on the Post Office.  This young soldier was in the basement, washing at the time, when the signal went that brought them together.  He rushed to where his rifle was on a rack.  He was not aware that his rifle was loaded; he turned the rifle down to get it ready for loading, and the shot went through his leg, which had to be taken off as a result.  Later he got a letter stating that there was no fund at the disposal of the Army to <Col N="1049" /> meet such cases, and that the loss of the leg was due to his own carelessness. That young boy is going around the streets of Dublin to-day.  Is there nothing to be done for him?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said at a previous date that it was his intention and that of the Ministry to deal with all cases of hardship.  I think that being so, he might revise the wording of the clause so as to cover all cases of real hardship.  I will give a case in point.  During the 1922-23 period, in a portion of Offaly, soldiers on their way to Mass were attacked; two were killed and a couple wounded.  I wonder would the board under the wording of this particular clause say that that was in the course of the soldier's duty?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I brought a couple of cases before the notice of the Minister, and I agree in one case it could be argued there was negligence.  The reason why I brought these particular cases to the notice of the Minister at the time was that after the soldier was shot nothing whatsoever was done to investigate the matter at the time, and it was only when a demand was made for funeral expenses, or for some gratuity by the widowed mother, that an Army inquiry was held.  Seeing the soldier was shot dead in the circumstances I previously recited, I hold that was a case for a coroner's inquiry.  No military investigation was held into the matter until a demand for a gratuity was made.  I believe if the Minister had discretion with regard to that matter he might review the circumstances of the particular case and the deletion of the words referred to here.  I will agree to a form of wording which, if the Minister can suggest it, will give the Minister absolute discretion and enable him to deal with all cases of real hardship.  If the Minister promises to look into the wording of it, I hope he will take into consideration that I am claiming nothing, more or less, than that these words <Col N="1050" /> should be deleted to give him a discretion to review cases which have been turned down and which are cases of real hardship.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not go to the length of saying that it should give the Minister absolute discretion.  In Deputy Byrne's case a military inquiry must have been held, and they must have felt that this man was negligent in the handling of the rifle when he met with that unfortunate accident. No one deplores those things more than I, but, after all has been said and done, you must draw the line somewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>The circumstances were a raid on the post office and a rush to get a rifle that was in the post office; the rifle goes off by accident and the man loses his leg.  Is not that a case for sympathetic consideration? Think of the circumstances of the time before using the word &ldquo;carelessness.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us see what the Minister's position is.  If a court of inquiry gives a decision that there was negligence, the Minister has no discretion; he is bound by it.  The question is whether you are going to give the Minister power to rule out military decisions come to by military officers; that is an extension of the purposes of the Bill.  It means that the Minister would be pilloried here unless he turned down every disciplinary decision given.</P>

      <P>The case I mention was of a young man who was shot; no inquiry was made at the time until a claim was put in for some gratuity by the widowed mother of the young fellow.  I would have been satisfied if an inquiry was made at the time, and if soldiers in a particular barracks were called to give evidence.  I do not think the President would take exception to a form of wording which would give the Minister absolute discretion and leave it in his hands to say whether it was a case of negligence or not.</P>

A soldier will not get it, notwithstanding that he may have a wife with two or three children, if he loses a leg or an arm whilst in your employment.

      <P>On the section, I want to ask the Minister for a little light, because, I think, this section is liable to interpretation in more ways than one.  So far as I have been able to find, there is no definition of &ldquo;Irish Volunteers,&rdquo; or of when the Irish Volunteers ceased to exist, or what constituted the Irish Volunteers.  I take it that it is entirely within the <Col N="1055" /> discretion of the Minister for the time being to determine whether a person was a member of an organisation called the Irish Volunteers.  I do not know whether it is argued that the Irish Volunteers ceased to exist, let us say in 1922, or whether the Irish Volunteers continued to exist, and even yet have not been disbanded.  I do not know whether this really interprets the Minister's mind, because, as I read it, pensions might be paid under this section to members of the organisation known as the Irish Volunteers in any circumstances, say, during the last few years.  I do not think that is the intention. If it is, I think it should be made more clear.  If it is not the intention, there should be some definition clause. &ldquo;Irish Volunteers&rdquo; is interpreted as the Irish Republican Army in some cases, I think.  At one point the Irish Volunteers became the Irish Republican Army.  Is the Minister making any strict line of demarcation, and is there any definition of what constituted the Irish Volunteers, or is it to be left to a future Minister for Defence to determine whether a particular man was a member of an organisation called the Irish Volunteers?  I should like to have it clear what the Minister's mind is in the matter and then we can consider whether, in fact, the section carries out what the Minister's intentions are.  For instance, there are men who have received wounds or suffered disablement due to service in volunteer forces in England or Scotland, or in other parts of Ireland.  Are they intended to come within the scope of the Bill?  I think that the whole matter requires elucidation and clarification.</P>

      <P>So far as the Irish Volunteers are concerned, they were in existence until the 1st April, 1922, when the National Army came into existence. Any man, to be qualified, must get a certificate from the Minister for Defence. The Minister must certify him as being a member of the Volunteers prior to that date, after due inquiries have been made.  If there is not an official record, due inquiries are made from people in a position to give any evidence about the case.  The certificate <Col N="1056" /> is based on that evidence.  If he gets a certificate from the Minister he is entitled to recognition as a member of the Volunteers.  There is no limitation as far as the North of Ireland is concerned, or England or Scotland, or any place.  If the man was in the Volunteers he gets a certificate as such, and he will be entitled to get a pension.</P>

The National Army was in existence then until the 1st October, 1924, when the Defence Forces came into operation, so that the periods are pretty clear cut.  A man who was in the Volunteers, if he so desired, came into the National Army. If he did not come into the National Army he ceased to be a Volunteer, so far as this Bill is concerned, on the 1st April, 1922, when the National Army was formed.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment 26.</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 8, to delete lines 1 to 6 and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  The Minister may, on or on account of the death of any person to whom this sub-section applies, do either but not both of the following things, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  grant to such one or more as the Minister shall determine of the dependents mentioned in the appropriate Part of the Fifth Schedule to this Act of such person a gratuity of such amount as the Minister shall, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, determine, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  grant to the widow and children of such person the several allowances and gratuities specified in the appropriate Part of the Sixth Schedule to this Act in respect of widows and children.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This new section makes it possible for us to provide an allowance as well as a gratuity.  Under the sub-section as it stood in the Bill it was only possible to provide for a gratuity to be paid.  We have changed that, and we make it possible to pay an allowance in substitution for a gratuity, and we think that is the proper procedure. The new sub-section makes it possible to grant an allowance or a pension in some cases which was not possible under the old system.</P>

      <P>I think this new sub-section is a great improvement upon the section as originally drafted, but I think it might be further <Col N="1060" /> improved.  The amended section provides that the grant must be either and not both, that is to say, either a grant or a pension can be given to the dependents or the widow and the children.  I can imagine that a better service would be rendered if it were possible to say so much in the form of a grant to the individual and so much in the form of an allowance to the dependents. That is done in the case of awards under the Workmen's Compensation Act, and I think it is practical and would be beneficial.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment 27:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 10, to delete the word &ldquo;solely.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This raises a question which runs right through sub-sections (1) and (2) and in regard to which there are several amendments on the Paper, but I think all these amendments might be decided on this one.  The sub-section applies to &ldquo;every person who died before the 1st day of October, 1924, while serving in the forces and whose death was due solely to disease attributable to service in the forces during the period&rdquo; aforesaid.  The introduction of the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo; in other sub-sections seems to me to be even more unfortunate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question whether the disease was solely attributable to service in the forces is, I think, almost impossible to decide.  It would make it possible for the Minister to refuse a pension or gratuity unless a doctor or doctors could give an absolutely clean certificate that no complication of any kind entered into the applicant's disease.  A person suffers from sickness, say measles in childhood, and certain organs of the body are weakened thereby. Service in the National Army causes a <Col N="1061" /> different complaint, but there is a complication due to the fact of this other organic weakness.  Unless the doctor can certify that there is no such complication it is possible under this section to eliminate the applicant.</P>
    <P>That is not the intention, but it seems to me it is unnecessarily and unduly limiting the scope of the Bill and that if we said &ldquo;whose death was due to diseases attributable to service in the forces&rdquo; it is quite sufficient and all you want to cover the matter.  Putting in the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo; seems to gratuitously suggest to the Army Pensions Board that they have no need to give a verdict in favour of the applicant unless they get such a certificate from a doctor as would preclude the possibility that there is any complication due to earlier disease.  It seems to me that there is no value in the word for the purpose of securing the Minister's object.  The value of it or the inutility of it lies in the fact that it is going to make it possible to wipe out perhaps three-fourths of the applicants.</P>
    <P>Very few men die from one organic trouble.  There is complication in the case of most men, and as far as I have been able to see, nearly all the doctors certify in the case of death a multiple number of causes.  I think it is an undue restriction and limitation of the applicant's right to put in this word &ldquo;solely.&rdquo;  I do not think it is desirable, and I think it goes much further than the Minister's intention.  I hope he will agree to its deletion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree to this amendment, because it is taken for granted that a man who gets his pension suffered from a disease which must be solely due to his service.  Take the case of a man who may have come into the Army with 10 or 20 per cent. disease without being examined.  That disease becomes aggravated, and then he gets some other disease while serving in the Army.  It would be possible, if we did what Deputy Johnson suggests, that the Army Pensions Board could tot up these two forms of disease and make it 80 per cent., and that would not be fair to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>The real question that we have to face is that which has agitated us since the forces came into being, namely, that there was no medical examination at first when people came into the service.  If there was an examination at all it was only very cursory.  Nobody disputes the fact that there was no real examination and that several people came into the forces that would not have been taken into the forces in the ordinary way, and to ask that we should be responsible for everything that happened to them after that date is too much.</P>
      <P>Where a man comes into the defence force at the present time and is properly examined and a medical officer certifies that he is fit he will be entitled in the ordinary way to a pension under this Bill, but in the case of people who came in without any examination at all the State must really guard itself.  To do what the Deputy asks in this amendment would be to open the door very wide.  I am sure Deputy Johnson would not like to bring in under it classes of people that he does not intend.  We must be as careful of the money of the State as we would be of our own, and as far as I can see, if we were to accept this amendment we would be incurring a very grave commitment.  I do not believe that the retention of the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo; will embarrass any person if the disease was attributable solely to service, and we are not catering for any disease except what was &ldquo;solely&rdquo; attributable to the service.  A man might have disease of any kind and he might grow worse as time went on. Military service does not, except in exceptional circumstances, tend to accentuate disease.  Army life is a healthy life.  A man suffering from disease would probably become worse in ordinary civilian employment than he would as a soldier under normal conditions.  He would probably be better houses in the barracks and, in many cases, he would be better fed and have a better chance of recovery than if he followed a civilian occupation. I cannot agree to the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be very difficult for the dependents of a deceased man to prove, under this section, that the disease which caused his death was solcly attributable to service.  Take the case of a man who, in every other respect, seemed healthy but who, at the time of his joining the forces, had a tendency to rheumatism.  If, during the course of service, that tendency is aggravated by adverse weather conditions or otherwise, and if that man dies of rheumatroid arthritis, it will be very difficult for his dependents to prove that his death was solely due to service. At the time he entered he might have been prone to such a disease, and the service that he was engaged in might possibly have aggravated it.  I think the wording of the section is particularly harsh, and that it makes it almost impossible for the applicants who, in these cases, will be the dependents of the deceased man, to prove that death was due solely to conditions of service.  I think the Minister might unbend a little and be somewhat more lenient, having regard to the fact that applicants will be bound strictly by the wording of the section.  I think the Minister has gone a bit too far in framing this section and that it would not be asking too much to omit the word &ldquo;solely,&rdquo; as suggested in the amendment.  If the section remains as it is, it will undoubtedly rule out a large number of cases where men died through causes mainly attributable to service, but not solely attributable to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>We ought to get this matter into perspective.  The point to start from is that, in view of the circumstances, it is a very big step for the Government to provide for disease allowances at all.  We had an Army which was flung together hurriedly.  It was not a case of bringing men into a frame already in existence.  The organisation was not already there.  The Army was hastily brought together. Men were brought in after little examination, or without medical examination at all.  They were not subject, during their course of service, to normal medical supervision.  The result is bound to be&mdash;as I indicated at an earlier <Col N="1064" /> stage&mdash;that a great many people will manage to establish claims whose applications, if all the facts were known, would be rejected.  They will be able to bring forward a volume of personal testimony which it will not be possible to reject, though, if all the facts could be brought to light, it would be found that the members of the Army concerned had previously suffered from disease which was bound to become aggravated even apart from military service.  If you strike this word out in the section you will be simply giving an invitation to your Board to pass all sorts of applications, even where there is the gravest possible doubt.  There is bound to be grave doubt in almost all these cases.  In all the circumstances, to ask applicants to establish that the disease was due solely to military service is the least that can be done.  It is not right that we should pay because a disease became worse during military service.  In ordinary civil life, disease commonly becomes aggravated, although the diseased person has to endure no hardships. We should remember that there were not great hardships suffered in the National Army at all.  We cannot compare them with the hardships suffered by troops in the trenches during the Great War.  There was a period of general active service, but it was active service under guerilla conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the troops were not housed in ideal conditions, they were generally provided with shelter and reasonably fed.  It is most probable that where disease became aggravated during military service it did not become aggravated to any greater extent or any more rapidly than it would have become if the person concerned had remained in civil life.  It is unreasonable that the taxpayer should be asked to pay for illness which occurred in the Army but which would equally have occurred if the individual concerned had not joined the Army.  All these applications are bound to be enveloped in a good deal of doubt.  It was with considerable hesitation that the Government, having regard to their duty not merely to the individual who suffered illness but to the taxpayer, <Col N="1065" /> finally agreed to include disease cases at all.  I feel that we ought not to be pushed into the position of paying for disease unless it is established that it was solely due to service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>We speak at some disadvantage here because I do not think there is any Deputy present who served in the National Army.  I must, however, take up the challenge of the Minister for Finance about the hardships suffered by men in the National Army.  If I am correctly informed, during the greater period in which active operations were in progress, these men had only one uniform and, sometimes, only a civilian suit of clothes.  They were operating very largely in the West of Ireland in a wet climate.  Day after day, they got wet through.  Day after day, they came into any shelter their officers could find for them and they lay down in these wet clothes until the wet clothes dried.  Next day they went out and got soaked again. Their clothes had to dry on them again. The men of the National Army did not have some of the amenities that the British troops in France had.  They did not have the brazier and other arrangements that the British troops had in France.  They did not have arrangements for being taken back for rest, bathing and re-fitting.  The medical service was in a more rudimentary condition than in the case of the British Army.  If continually getting wet and sleeping in wet clothes is not conducive to rheumatism, I do not know what is.  I know of no disease that unfits a poor man for employment more than rheumatism.  I think it is a mistake to ride off with the suggestion that it is a great concession to give a man a pension because he has contracted disease in the Army.  As a matter of fact, this section deals with gratuities, but the Minister for Finance has led me away.  I can conceive a man setting up the seeds of tuberculosis under these conditions.  I can conceive a man even dying of tuberculosis under these conditions.  I do not think we should take up the position that it is a great concession on our part to do anything for the dependents of such a man.  I have known cases of British pensioners who have suffered far more <Col N="1066" /> from disease than a man who loses an arm or a leg.  Once the claim can be established we ought to treat these men generously and not say: &ldquo;You were driving a hackney car before you enlisted and you were liable to get wet. That occupation was liable to set up the seeds of rheumatism and your Army service only aggravated it.&rdquo;  I hope this amendment will be forced to a division.</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Minister to reconsider his decision, and to accept the amendment in the form suggested by Deputy Redmond, deleting the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo; and inserting instead &ldquo;mainly due.&rdquo;  The Minister referred to cases where men were suffering from disease before they joined the Army and who in the ordinary way might have died from the disease, even if they had no military service.  It is, however, hard to conceive how a man in civil life would go out night after night and lie down, exposed to rain, as our young soldiers did.  I know the case of a young soldier who was repeatedly asked to go to the base but would not do so, because he was afraid he would be thought a coward.  The officer had to bring him to the base.  That soldier contracted inflammation of the kidneys and was a very bad case.  When I put the facts before the Minister he could do nothing for him.  Fortunately the man is not dead.  If a man was suffering from some slight disability due to disease before joining the Army, surely that would be aggravated by Army service, such as there was during the troubled time here.  To adhere to the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo; in the section means cutting out the dependents of men who died for the State.  I do not think that is the intention of the Minister, and, for that reason, I ask him to reconsider his decision and do justice in these cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister says, it is true, generally, that the experience of the soldiers who served in the National Army was more or less a holiday experience compared to the hardships that were endured by men who served on the western front during the European war.  That does not mean, as the Minister knows, that <Col N="1067" /> hardships were not encountered which led to the death of men who served in the National Army.  Two types of cases came under the notice of Deputies in connection with the previous Acts, and were turned down.  I know one case where a man joined the National Army and met with an accident on the western front during the civil war, 1922-23.  His stomach was injured and he was eventually taken to St. Bricin's Hospital.  He was subsequently brought to Peamount Sanatorium, where he died.  The local people put forward proof to show that none of that man's relatives suffered from or had died from tuberculosis.  If the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo; is left in the section it will prevent the dependents of that man getting any gratuity.  This was a case for gratuity only.  Another case is that of a young man in Deputy Cooper's constituency.  He was an old I.R.A. man.  He joined the National Army in 1922-23 and was sent with other soldiers to Thompson's Garage in Pearse Street.  I understand that for a few days there were no beds provided. This young soldier contracted rheumatism, which led to his death.  In that case I heard that it could be stated some of the man's relatives had died from tuberculosis.  These two cases are directly opposite, but it could be argued that the deaths were not due solely to military service.  To any average Deputy I think they are the kind of cases in which something should be done where there are direct dependents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Dáil agreed to give good pensions to young men who are now in other employment, who served in pre-truce days and in the National Army, but came out physically fit, I think a case has been made for the granting of a gratuity in the type of case to which I have referred, where death was due, not solely but to some extent to activity in 1922-23.  If the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo; is left in the section cases of that kind will be cut out.  I do not believe it is the intention of the Minister to be unjust to the dependents of men whose death was brought about under the circumstances referred to. The principal opposition I believe <Col N="1068" /> arises from the fact that a number of cases will be brought up where young men suffering from tuberculosis joined the National Army.  They were allowed in without medical examination, and their deaths occurred during service or after leaving the Army.  I wonder how many people died during service from tuberculosis, or after discharge from the Army, from the same disease.  I would be surprised to hear that a great number did.  I know ex-British Army men who joined the National Army and who were actually in receipt of wound pensions when they joined.  They were suffering from wounds and probably in some cases disease.  Cases of that kind could be brought forward if the Bill was not tightly drawn, but I suggest that the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo; would cut out every case for a gratuity.  Every Deputy will admit that that would be a great hardship.  The Co. Dublin case to which I referred is that of an old I.R.A. man from Dun Laoghaire who joined the National Army.  He died and left a widow and two children, one being posthumous.  Is a case of that kind to be cut out?  If the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo; is left in it will.  I ask Deputies to vote for the deletion of that word, as otherwise cases they would like to see fairly dealt with will be cut out.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the supporters and opponents of the amendment are arguing for something different from its intention or effect.  If the amendment is carried the sub-section will read: &ldquo;Every person who died before the 1st day of October, 1924, while serving in the Forces, and whose death was due to disease attributable to service...&rdquo;  It is incumbent on the applicant or his dependents to satisfy the authorities that the death was due to disease attributable to service. That is if the amendment is carried. But if the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo; remains in, there must be no possibility of other complication, any organic weakness, which might be a factor in bringing about the man's death.  Two men equally good as soldiers, one having had a certain weakness which would never be evident but for service, or for some additional disease contracted during service, dies in consequence. <Col N="1069" /> The doctor gives a certificate showing that death was due to so and so, plus so and so.</P>
      <P>There is no direct relationship.  One has nothing to do with service in the National Army, but there are two things, one added to the other, causing death.  Now, when you leave in the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo; you make it impossible for that man or for his dependents to receive any allowance or gratuity.  The acceptance of the amendment would not satisfy Deputy Redmond or the others who have supported the amendment, because it would not make it possible to pay a pension or to give a gratuity to the dependents of persons whose death was due to disease, mainly due to service, or in cases where there was an aggravation of the existing disease at another point.  It may be argued that it is not the case in question here where death was due to disease attributable to service.  It may be said that such a person's disease may have been aggravated by service, but it was not due to service.</P>
      <P>The result of the amendment I am proposing to insert would not bring that person in.  However desirable it may be is a matter for argument at another time.  The amendment I am moving is designed to remove this limitation whereby it would have to be made clear on the death certificate that there was no other organic combination or combination of organic illness that led to death.  It is a medical matter and I am, perhaps, presuming too much to talk in this way; but as a layman, looking at the matter from the ordinary understanding of the written word, when we put in the words &ldquo;death due solely to disease attributable,&rdquo; it is going to make it impossible to pay a pension to the dependents of a man whose death is due to disease attributable to service in the Army, but possibly complicated by another disease or weakness which was the result of some childish ailment and yet would not leave him a clean bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister is unwise, and he is meeting a different case from that which I am making.  The case which he is meeting is one that is not involved in this particular amendment.  I ask <Col N="1070" /> the Minister to read the paragraph with the word deleted and he will see that it still remains that death must be due to disease attributable to service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps if you take this word where it appears in the paragraph, there is not so very much in it, but it goes right through the whole of the Bill.  Now, take the case of a man who has been dead for three or four years.  His dependents would come in to get a gratuity or pension under this Bill.  You must take the evidence. You have not the subject before you. No doctor can examine him.  You have the death certificate on the one hand, and you will have the evidence, perhaps, of the doctor who attended him. You will have the evidence of any medical officer in the Army who attended him or came in contact with him and you will have the Army records. Different classes of cases are bound to crop up of people who cannot be examined themselves, and it will be a question of what evidence can be produced that will satisfy the board that the man, whose dependents are claiming, died of a disease that was solely attributable to his service in the Army.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is misinterpreting his own section.  He says &ldquo;dies from disease solely attributable.&rdquo; These words are not in the section at all.  The words are &ldquo;due solely to disease attributable.&rdquo;  There is a shade of difference there.  The death is due to one cause, and one cause only. It is not a disease due to one cause only, but death due to one cause only in the section as it reads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if you take it that way, you must come down to the plain fact that you cannot have a multiplicity of diseases that, perhaps, the man has been suffering from for years, for these were not diseases that were attributable to his service in the Army and in the end caused death. Surely the Deputy does not expect that a pension should be given in a case of that kind.  When they look at the broad facts of the case, I think Deputies will agree that it is quite legitimate that the amendment cannot be accepted <Col N="1071" /> because it would undoubtedly bring in a great many cases and open the door very wide, and it would be impossible to administer the section properly.</P>
      <P>We are all human enough, every one of us, and the board of doctors will be quite human, too, I am sure.  As far as I know about them, in cases where they come to hear pension claims or anything else, they do not strain the Act or the section.  If there is a benefit to be given, they will, I believe, always give it to the applicant, and on that account alone I think it is quite right and wise to have the section drawn as tightly as possible.  The applicant will get whatever benefit there is to be given out of it.  I am sorry that so many Deputies have taken a different view from my view, but I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister speaks about a board of doctors giving the applicant the benefit of the Act.  If the Minister will look at the section he will observe that it refers to persons who died before 1st October, 1924.

      <P>Let me draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the State is offering the dependents of its servants who incurred disease and died in its service very much less generous terms than the law imposes on private employers under the Workmen's Compensation Act.  Under the Workmen's Compensation Act&mdash;there is a British decision which, I think, is binding on us&mdash;if the death of the employee is accelerated in the smallest degree by his service to the employer, the employer becomes liable; but here death must be due solely to disease attributable to service of the State.  Here we are treating the dependents of servants of the State less generously than the private employer will treat the dependents of his workmen.</P>

    <P>I take it that the decision come to in regard to this amendment will cover <Col N="1078" /> subsequent amendments in my name. The idea is to make provision for this particular type of case that might arise in this way.  Take the case of a man who gets wounded and, subsequent to his discharge from the Army, gets a severe cold.  The state of his health which has been caused by a bullet wound leads to disease and he dies.  The difficulty in that case would be that it would be almost impossible to prove that the man died solely from wounds.  If that type of case is not met by the Bill the dependents will get no compensation.  It is a reasonable type of case and one that will be met with frequently when this Bill becomes an Act, so that it should be provided for. If the Minister presents this Bill as an attempt to settle the whole question on broad lines I do not think that he can resist the amendment, which simply provides means for meeting an ordinary case that is bound to arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to make an appeal to Deputies to consider the effect of the rejection of this amendment. They have already decided that the disease from which a person dies must be due solely to his service.  If a man got disease through service but did not die of it, if he got wounded in service but did not die of the wound, and if it took the combination of wound and disease to bring about his death, you would be depriving his dependents of a gratuity, allowance, or pension.  A disease must be solely attributable, or death must be solely attributable, to wounds, but if a man got disease through service and also a wound through service, and the combination brought about his death, you are going to refuse the dependents any gratuity, allowance or pension.</P>

      <P>Anything that could be said in favour of this amendment was said under the previous section.  Since we have thrashed the matter out I do not think that we could accept this amendment.  A wound is a clear-cut thing and is not like disease.  You can see it, and know whether death was due to a wound.  If death is due to a wound, it is clear that the dependents must get gratuities or allowances in certain cases.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister deny the fact that in the operations of this Bill, or in any other Bill which provides for Army pensions, he will not meet a number of cases in which people will be brought to a certain state of health, or rather ill-health, and will die as a result of wounds?  Men who receive wounds during hostilities very often become subject to disease as a result of their condition of health consequent on such wounds.  If the Minister wants to make provision for such men he cannot resist my amendment. Such a type of case will arise every day.  If the Minister wants the Bill to apply to as few men as possible he ought to be honest and say so, and not try to get out of it in this fashion.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister say whether there is any amendment on the Paper he is going to accept if put forward by Deputies?  When Deputies have made a good case in support of an amendment and the division bell rings the Minister can bring 40 or 50 Deputies to vote down the amendment without giving any consideration to the case made.  So far as we have gone, has it not been a waste of time in bringing forward amendments, as the Minister in every case refuses to give way or consider them?</P>

      <P>Deputy Byrne made the charge that there is no use in private members bringing forward amendments as they would not be accepted.  I have accepted amendments, and I have introduced amendments myself in the vital part of the Bill.  I do not think that the castigation from Deputy Byrne was deserved.  I am willing in this case to consider a combination of disease and wounds and, if possible, to bring in an amendment that will take in both&mdash;say a case where a man might have a disability of 20 per cent. from wounds and 50 or 60 per cent. from disease&mdash;so as to make up the minimum of 80 per cent. disability.

    <P>&ldquo;(5) Every allowance granted under this section to the widow or a child or dependent of a person who died or was killed before the 1st day of April, 1926 shall commence on that date and every allowance <Col N="1081" /> granted under this section to the widow or a child or dependent of a person who dies or is killed on or after the 1st day of April, 1926 (whether before or after the passing of this Act), shall commence on the day after the day on which such person so dies or is killed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That empowers us to pay from the 1st April, 1926, and it meets to a great extent Deputy Nagle's amendment (No. 53).  It certainly is in favour of the applicant, and it is one that in all the circumstances of the case should be accepted.</P>

      <P>This provides that an allowance and a gratuity cannot be drawn at the same time.  We want to make that quitear.  If there is any difference in the amounts the applicant will get the benefit, and that will be taken into consideration when he is being paid.</P>

It would be very hard to get the money back if a pensioner died on the 10th of the month, or at any time previous to that.

    <P>There was a good deal of comment on the Second Reading of the Bill on the Schedule as it stood, and as a consequence I brought in this amendment. It sets out the non-commissioned officers and men under five heads, and we have considerably augmented the money values per week in all these cases.  In the first instance we had the 100 per cent. pension at 20/- but we now make it 26/-.  There is a graduated scale for the various ranks up to 42/- per week.  Deputy Johnson and several other Deputies stressed this matter very much on the Second Reading debate and this concession has been made.  I think it is right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have it made clear that the scale as printed is not inclusive and that the last paragraph of the original scale regarding a marriage pension to the soldier still remains.  That states that the married pension shall be at the rate of 5/- per week.  The Bill as printed contains columnar statements of figures and has two paragraphs.  The amendment, apparently, only deals with the table, but it may be taken, unless it is madear, to be the whole of Part II. of the Schedule and that the reference in the paragraph on page 18 of the Bill is deleted. I take it that still remains?</P>

If the Committee gives me leave I propose <Col N="1097" /> to alter the figures &ldquo;25&rdquo; and &ldquo;35&rdquo; to &ldquo;30.&rdquo;  That change will bring the matter into balance with the remainder of the section.  If the Committee is not agreeable to allow the change to be made now, then I shall move to have it made on the Report Stage.  I think myself that &ldquo;30&rdquo; is the proper figure.  It is a little bit in favour of the applicant, but if the Committee is agreeable I am prepared to accept the figure &ldquo;30.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>There is just one point that I would suggest to the Minister he should take into account.  In the case of the indices, something, I think, should be done to make them really valuable in indicating what particular section is referred to.  The matter is of importance to future readers of the Bill.  There is, for instance, a reference to &ldquo;disability pensions in certain cases under Section 10,&rdquo; and then there is a reference to &ldquo;disability pensions in certain other cases,&rdquo; but this last reference points to nothing.  I think it would be quite a simple matter to indicate in the marginal notes what the sections refer to.</P>

    <P>That it is expedient to authorise the payment out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas of any expenses incurred in carrying into effect any Act of the present Session to amend and in part consolidate the law relating to the sale of intoxicating <Col N="1099" /> liquor, to enable the number of licences for the sale of intoxicating liquor to be reduced by the abolition from time to time of certain such licences, and to amend the law relating to the registration of clubs.</P>
    <P>There will be expenses under several heads incurred in carrying this Act into operation.  In the first place, assessors will have to be appointed in the matter of fixing the amount of compensation to be paid when a licence is extinguished.  That will not be a serious drain on the resources of the State, because the process of extinguishing licences will go on over a period of years, and the amount involved will be comparatively small.  In seven or eight years' time it might amount to, say, £20,000.  When a licence is extinguished, certain liabilities will fall on the remaining licensed holders in particular licensing areas.rical work will be involved in the management of the compensation fund. That will not be a very expensive thing because the number of licences to be extinguished will only gradually rise to any considerable amount.  It can only happen over a period of years, not merely for financial reasons but because of the formalities that will have to be gone through and of the proceedings that will be necessary before the courts. It is provided in the Bill that the amount of compensation awarded is to be repaid by the remaining licence holders in the area over a period of 20 years by means of an annuity of £7 10s. per cent.</P>
    <P>It has been remarked that an annuity of £7 10s., with the present rate of interest, would not amortise £100 in 20 years.  It would only amortise £94 10s. 4d.  We are at present paying 5¼ per cent. or slightly over that, but it is not anticipated that during the period in which this Act will be put into operation that the rate of interest which the Government will have to pay will remain as high as that.  I feel satisfied, and it is the conclusion that anybody would draw looking at the present price of National Loan, that when the State next borrows it will be able to borrow at a figure under 5¼ per cent. <Col N="1100" /> I do not say that it will be able to borrow at 5 per cent., but it would be able to borrow at less than 5¼ per cent. We may take it, I think, that over a period of seven or eight years from now the rate of interest payable on Government borrowings will average, say, 5 per cent.  I do not think that we can anticipate an average of less than 5 per cent.  An annuity of £7 10s. over twenty years will not amortise £100 even at 5 per cent.  It will amortise £93 9s. 4d., so that assuming that the main work of abolition contemplated under this Bill, and contemplated under the Report of the Liquor Commission, takes place within the next seven or ten years, we may take it that for every £100 paid in compensation the annuity of £7 10s. over twenty years will only pay back £93 9s. 4d. That means that there will be, in effect, a State contribution into the Compensation Fund of a sum of £6 10s. 8d. That figure of £6 10s. 8d. is agreed to for a variety of reasons.  It is regarded as absolutely fair that the remaining licence holders should pay for the compensation of the licences that are abolished.  It is recognised that the person whose property is acquired compulsorily gets a good price, and sometimes he gets a trifle over a good price by reason of the fact that the compensation is compulsory, but certainly if he never gets too much, if you take the number of people whose property has been acquired compulsorily, the average price is perhaps better a little than a good average price.  There is also the fact to be borne in mind that the compensation awarded will include not merely actual compensation for the loss of the licence both to the occupier and the lessor, but it will include a certain sum in regard to costs.  In paragraph (c) of sub-section (3) of Section 36, it will be seen that the compensation payable shall include:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In any case such additional sum as the compensation authority shall consider reasonable in view of the fact that the parties receiving the compensation have to bear their own costs of all proceedings in relation to the compensation and, in the case of the holder of the licence, of the reference <Col N="1101" /> order and the abolition order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now in the ordinary way if a person were selling voluntarily he should bear his costs of sale, but where a person is not selling voluntarily but where his property is taken compulsorily it is reasonable that some allowance should be made for his costs so that the amount of expense he has to incur in connection with the matter shall be taken into account.  On the other hand while it is fair that the remaining licence holders should pay for the value of the licences it is perhaps asking a little too much to require them to pay for the legal and other costs of the person whose licence was abolished in the various proceedings leading up to abolition and the award of compensation.</P>
    <P>This Licensing Bill represents a social reform, and if some little expense falls on the State it is fair enough that the State should bear that.  It is felt therefore that this contribution, as I might call it, of about £6 10s. in every £100 is reasonable, that it is not a gift to the remaining licence holders, that considering all the circumstances, considering the somewhat good price that is pretty sure to be awarded in proceedings for compulsory acquisition, having regard to the legal costs which will be incurred and which will be included in the compensation, it seems to be not too much that this £6 10s. should be paid.</P>
    <P>The licences which will be abolished compulsorily will be, broadly speaking, licences of small value.  Considerations are laid down in the Bill as to the selection of licences for abolition, but generally speaking they will be of comparatively small value, and it has been estimated tentatively that if we extinguish, during a period of years, say seven or ten years ahead, something like 4,000 licences that the average compensation for those 4,000 licences ought not to be more than £300 a-piece. There will be many licences extinguished which will not be valued for anything like £300.  Others will be valued for considerably more.  For this we assume a figure of £300, which, I think, is a reasonable figure.  It means that the 4,000 licences could be extinguished <Col N="1102" /> at a cost of £1,200,000.  If the State has to assume liability for the repayment of, roughly, £6 10s. in every £100 it means that something like £78,000 or a little more is the amount that will fall due to be paid by the general taxpayer.  With those figures in mind, and the figure I indicated of the costs that will fall on the State in connection with the payment of assessors, I think the liability to the general taxpayer&mdash;of course the liability will be spread over a great many years, it will not fully mature until twenty years after the 4,000 licences have actually been abolished&mdash;would be something in the nature of £100,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has made a great deal about his generosity to the licence holder whose business he is about to acquire compulsorily in allowing him costs and not mulcting him for the same.  The Money Resolution that we are discussing seems to be drafted in terms sufficiently wide that the Minister, if he so desires, might be a little generous in other respects.  I have got a series of amendments down dealing with Section 40, the first amendment suggesting that the licence holder, whose business is to be confiscated by the State for purposes which are supposed to be in the interests of the State, should not derive whatever compensation is awarded to him entirely at the expense of the remaining and more fortunate licence holders.  In effect, my proposal is that, this being a matter for the State and for the benefit of the State, some of the compensation should be borne by the State.  I should like to have, at this stage, your ruling as to whether I shall be entitled on the Committee Stage to move amendment No. 76, which stands in my name, because although I am aware that it is not within the purview of a private member to seek to impose extra charges on the State, at the same time I would submit that this Money Resolution covers the amendments which appear to Section 40 over my name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I would desire to have your ruling upon the point now is, that if you decide that I shall not be entitled to move that amendment in Committee, I submit that I am entitled at <Col N="1103" /> this stage to suggest that the Money Resolution should be, if it is not already sufficiently wide, so altered as to enable a proposal such as mine to be dealt with on the Committee Stage.  I should like to have your ruling on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Money Resolution is undoubtedly drafted in very wide terms, but it appears to me that another question, which has no reference whatever to the Money Resolution, really arises in connection with the amendment which Deputy Redmond speaks of&mdash;that is amendment 76, to Section 40.  The amendment, in effect, seeks to place half the burden of compensation on the State.  The Bill, as read a second time, provides for the extinction of certain licences under certain conditions, and for the payment of compensation.  I think it would not be in order to move an amendment in Committee to the effect that one-half of the compensation should be borne by the State, seeing that Section 40, as drafted and embodied in the Bill as read a second time, does not contemplate any such contribution from the State.  I think that if such a contribution by the State, such a burden upon public funds were to be imposed, it should appear in some place in the Bill and should not be introduced on the Committee Stage of the Bill, which, as read a second time, contemplated no such proposal.  I think, therefore, that the amendment Deputy Redmond speaks of will not be in order on the Committee Stage of the Bill, but not for the reason that it is precluded by the Money Resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  I bow to your ruling on that matter, but as a result of your ruling, am I in order in suggesting now that the Minister should so enlarge the Money Resolution as to enable the amendment I have tabled to be moved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The objection which I have taken to the amendment of Deputy Redmond is not based upon the fact that it is a Deputy, not a member of the Executive Council, who seeks to move the amendment.  I think the objection would be as valid <Col N="1104" /> if the Minister for Finance were seeking to move such an amendment.  A Bill of this kind having been read a second time, it would be very improper financial procedure to endeavour to insert in it in Committee a proposal that half the compensation should be borne out of public funds.  The Minister, with the resources at his disposal, might be able, by means of an explicit Money Resolution and a special direction to the Committee on the Bill, to accomplish that purpose.  But I would still be constrained to state my opinion, that if it is intended to extinguish licences and to place upon the State half, or any considerable portion of the burden of that compensation, that principle should be embodied in the Bill as read a second time.</P>
      <P>That being the case, and since the question of amendment of the Money Resolution does not seem to me to arise, I think that the opportunities for urging that the State should bear the compensation occur in two places&mdash;on the Second Reading, when Deputies could object to the nature of the Bill before them, and in Committee, when Section 40 is being moved, or possibly on another section, when objection could be taken to the section on the grounds that by its nature it is undesirable and should not stand part of the Bill.  I think these are the opportunities for the raising of those particular points&mdash;either on Second Reading or on the operative section of the Bill, when taken in Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quite follow your point of view but of course, the Second Reading has been passed. May I say in passing that it was not really a Second Reading of this Bill? It was the Second Reading of a Bill which had been introduced as such, but which was considerably amended by the speech of the Minister for Justice in asking for the passing of the Bill on Second Reading.  However, the question will, as you say, be open to discussion on the Committee Stage when considering the section.  It really comes to this, that things have reached such a pass that it is now almost impossible for anyone, Minister or otherwise, to propose in this Bill that any <Col N="1105" /> portion of the compensation should be borne by the State.  I take that to be the meaning of your ruling, and if that is so, it comes to this, that any Deputy who desires that the remaining licence holders should not be the sole contributors to the compensation of those whose licences are extinguished, will have to vote against this section in toto. They will not have any other alternative. It will simply mean, not that he will be able to propose an amendment whereby the remaining licence holders should pay something, but that he will have to vote against the section providing that the remaining licence holders shall pay everything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit to the House, on the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle, that the only course for the Government is to provide a proper compensation in another Bill. It certainly seems rather hard that no Deputy can now either propose or support a proposal in connection with this Bill that the State should bear something. This Bill as introduced is gone and we are now about to discuss what is practically a new Bill.  It is possible for the Minister to bring in a separate Bill dealing with the matter of compensation. That seems to be the only course left open, if Deputies are precluded from proposing in Committee on this Bill that the State should pay any contribution whatever towards that compensation.  As far as I am concerned I am precluded evidently from doing anything except on the discussion of the section merely expressing my own pious opinion, but having no recourse whatever to any parliamentary procedure whereby I could get this opinion put into effect.  It certainly seems rather a strange state of affairs in an assembly such as this that here we are not in a position so to alter or amend the Bill because the Bill, as originally introduced, has been drafted in such a way.  I doubt very much if any members who voted for the Second Reading of the Bill were aware, when they voted for the Second Reading, that the Bill, having passed that stage, they would be precluded from doing anything like justice to the remaining licensees by asking the State to pay some contribution towards the compensation <Col N="1106" /> of those who are about to be extinguished.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been made clear by the speech of the Minister for Finance that there is to be a small State contribution towards certain types of expenses, what might be called machinery expenses, involved in the process of the extinction of licences, but the Bill as read a second time does not, on its face, contain any provision for the payment by the State of any part of the compensation to the owner in respect of his interest in the abolished licence.  The introduction, therefore of a charge of the latter nature cannot be permitted in Committee whether by the Minister or by an ordinary Deputy.  When it is proposed to place a certain new type of charge on public funds that should be done in the clearest possible manner and not by way of an amendment introduced in Committee on the Bill.</P>
      <P>The principle of payment by the State in whole or in part of compensation to owners in respect of their interest in abolished licences should bearly affirmed in a Bill on Second Reading.</P>
      <P>When a Bill is being read a second time Deputies have great latitude in making their arguments and must make their minds clear as to what the Bill actually contains.  Afterwards in Committee we have to deal with proposals for placing charges upon public funds with the greatest strictness, and we have, in fact, agreed to do so.</P>

      <P>I was rather amused by the attempt Deputy Redmond is now making to introduce into the discussion <Col N="1108" /> a claim that the taxpayers should be called upon to bear portion of the cost for the licences to the number of four thousand, which it is proposed to abolish.  I was much more amused when I heard Deputy P. J. Egan on the Second Reading of this Bill declaring his intention of voting for it in the hope, subsequently, of being able to secure an amendment of the same kind.  I thought when I heard the Deputy making a claim for such compensation that he was going to vote against the principle of the Bill, which laid it down very strictly that the licences to be abolished must be paid for by the people who remained in the trade.</P>
      <P>I think we must thank the Minister for Finance for giving more information in the short speech he made on the financial resolution than the Minister for Justice gave on the Second Reading of the measure, which is not the one before us now.  The real reason why I voted against the Second Reading of the Bill as printed was because I think the basis of the compensation for the abolished licences in rural areas is absolutely unfair.  While the Minister may contend and argue on Committee Stage that that is in effect compelling the remaining licence holders to pay for the people who go out, we all know that on the basis of the Bill, assuming it is administered on the lines of the Liquor Commission's recommendation, many hundreds of licence holders whose licences are the most valuable will escape all financial responsibility for the licence holders whose licences will be abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said that the estimated compensation to be paid for about 4,000 licences to be abolished in the course of six or seven years will amount to about £1,200,000, out of which the State, for reasons given by him, will pay £100,000.  He stated&mdash; in this I am not sure that he is correct &mdash;that the licences to be abolished will be the licences of lower valuation.  Sub-section (3) of Section 33 of the Bill, as introduced, specifies far more serious reasons which would serve as justification to the District Justice for abolishing licences.  The question of the volume of business transacted in the <Col N="1109" /> premises to which the licence is attached undoubtedly comes into consideration, but there is also the question as to whether the business carried on in the premises is properly conducted. That might apply to a licensed house of high valuation in the city of Dublin. I take it that if a licensed house in the city were not properly conducted, the Superintendent of the Gárda Síochána would be justified in coming before the District Justice, making a claim for abolition and justifying the abolition.</P>

I suggest that under sub-section (3) of Section 33 a licence can be abolished in the city of Dublin.  I understand that it is the intention of the Ministry to do away with certain licences in the city of Dublin.

      <P>The serious part of the Bill, I think, is the provision of a period of seven to ten years for the wiping out of the 4,000 licences.  That is going to affect to a considerable extent <Col N="1110" /> the credit facilities now obtaining in rural areas.  There are many Deputies, including the President and the Minister for Justice, who look upon licensed traders as people who sell over the counter a certain number of barrels of stout for consumption on the premises. That may be the case in the city of Dublin, but in the country it is quite different.  The beer or porter sold over the counter for consumption on the premises is only a negligible part of the business of the country trader.  The principal portion of the trade carried on in rural Ireland is the sale of groceries and such commodities, which are not consumed on the premises. It is only possible to carry on that trade, as business people know, because of the credit given by bankers or wholesalers.  The position in the country, unfortunately, is that the trader is really the poor man's banker. Anybody who knows anything about business in rural Ireland must know that rural traders&mdash;they are mixed traders for the most part&mdash;are owed thousands of pounds by small farmers and poor people who were given credit in recent years to a measure which could not be justified.  By the passage of this Bill and the consequent restriction of credit to poor people, you are going to do untold injury.  I should prefer that the 4,000 licences it is proposed to abolish should be abolished right away, so that those who are to remain would know their position, and that bankers and wholesalers who would be applied to for credit would know what to do.  Wholesalers and bankers will restrict credit facilities to a considerable extent immediately this Bill is passed into law if it remains in its present form.</P>

    <P>Take the case of Ballaghaderreen, which is often cited as proof of the superfluity of licensed houses.  In Ballaghaderreen there are 75 licensed houses, the population being 1,317. There is a licensed house in Ballaghaderreen to every 18 inhabitants. Immediately this Bill is passed into law, as Deputy Wilson explained, it would be only a fool or a lunatic who would buy a publichouse put up for auction in Ballaghaderreen.  A publichouse will be unsaleable in Ballaghaderreen <Col N="1111" /> or in any area in which there is an excess of publichouses as found by the Liquor Commission if this Bill be passed.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is discussing the Bill.  He is even using the words &ldquo;the Bill.&rdquo;  The Deputy is only in order in discussing the Money Resolution at present.  The point he is dealing with will arise on the section in Committee and there is no longer any time limit in Committee, under Standing Orders.  The Deputy can make his points on the section of the Bill or on his amendments.  It is not desirable that he should initiate a second reading debate on the Money Resolution.  If I allowed Deputy Davin to initiate a second reading debate on the Money Resolution, I could not stop any other Deputy from pursuing the same course.  I suggest to the Deputy that he should keep to the financial aspect of the measure which, as he is aware, is very wide.</P>

      <P>A number of traders will have to forfeit their licences in accordance with legislation introduced in the Irish Free State.  To my mind, if you are going to place the whole responsibility on existing publicans you are going to put them in a very awkward position financially&mdash;a position which they cannot possibly meet. I would appreciate the idea of introducing a Money Resolution provided the State was going to advance £200,000 or £300,000 for the purpose of giving compensation to traders who are requested to give up their licences.  The Minister for Justice declared in the Dáil that publicans who succeed in maintaining their licences will have to pay at the rate of £7 10s. per £100 for 20 years as compensation for those who went out of the business.  I do not think that is right.  If you want to get a temperate Ireland, if it is the idea of the Government, or if the Government is led by that great organisation known as Maynooth College, as I believe they are, then it is up to that organisation to give the Government some advice whereby they will be able to compensate the publicans.  I do not wear a black shirt.  I stand here as a representative of my people in Westmeath and Longford.  I voice their opinion here. Some people may think I am wrong, but I say this present Government is led on and driven to the last extent by the College of Maynooth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say one or two words more on this Money Resolution.  If the Irish Free State is <Col N="1113" /> going to wipe out a certain number of licensed traders they should be compensated by the State for the loss they sustain.  There are amendments to the Bill whereby employees are also to be compensated for loss of employment. When these amendments come forward we will be able to discuss them.  I appreciate the object of the Minister for Finance in bringing forward a Money Resolution asking for permission to compensate publicans who, through the administration of the Bill introduced by the Minister for Justice, will lose their licences.  In the country districts there are traders who only sell 2½ barrels of stout in the week.  Still they have an asset in their licences.  I admit publicly, and I admitted it in 1923, that there were too many publichouses in the Saorstát.  I admit that now, but I want the Minister for Finance to find funds to compensate the publicans who are going to lose their licences, so that the charge will not be placed on the existing publicans in country districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Second Reading of the Bill the Minister explained that compensation was to be paid by an entire parish or district.  I say that is wrong.  If a publican lives six or seven miles away from a publican who is to be put out of business why should the former be asked or be expected to pay towards compensating the other man?  I do not think that is right.  If necessary, the Government should raise a fund or float a loan for the purpose of compensating licensees who have to forfeit their licences during the next five years.  In many cases it will be found that the idea in the minds of the District Justices is that they are to endorse licences.  The Minister has given an idea of what he considers a technical offence.  One justice may say that an offence is a technical one, and another may say that it is not.  The owner of the licence loses it if it is endorsed three times.  I do not think that is fair.  I appreciate the fact that the Minister has given way on the point that endorsements shall not apply to the house when there is a genuine sale.  Even from the Labour point of view I think the Minister is to be congratulated for doing that.  I now want the Minister <Col N="1114" /> for Finance to supply sufficient money to compensate the 4,000 traders that he expects will be affected by the Bill within the next five years.  The Bill requires 4,000 people to give up their licences, and the Irish people should pay the compensation rather than the existing publicans.  Do not Deputies agree that it is right that the whole community should bear portion of the compensation, even if an extra halfpenny was put on tea, sugar or flour? Of course Deputy Johnson would not agree with that.  If publicans are to be compensated is it not right that it should be done directly by the State, and the cost got back from the community, instead of from a particular class?  In a village where there are twenty publichouses, with a population of 700, ten of the publichouses are to go, and they are to be compensated by the remaining ten, who will pay at the rate of £7 10s. per £100 for twenty years.  I cannot understand how that can be done, as one trader in that village may get the entire business of the outgoing ten.</P>
    <P>The other nine achieve nothing whatsoever, financial or otherwise, through the licence being refused in the case of the tenth.  Then why should nine pay for one?  I think that is wrong.  I think the State should come to the rescue and bear, at least, some portion of the compensation to be given to the outgoing publicans.  I appreciate the action of the Minister for Finance in bringing forward this Resolution.  I sincerely hope that he will see his way in the remote parts of the country to give some compensation directly out of the Exchequer and not place responsibility upon the existing publicans to pay for the men who go out.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments to this Bill are of a very complicated character.  I propose a particular procedure should be adopted in Committee which we have not been in the habit of following, but which we did, in fact, follow on one occasion, on the occasion of the Committee Stage of the Liquor Bill, 1924.  This is, I think, the only method by which we can arrive at a proper decision on the various points to be raised at particular parts of this Bill.  For example, to Section 1 of the Bill there is no amendment, but to Section 2 there is a very considerable number of amendments, and the question is complicated by the fact that there are three periods involved, ordinary week days from Monday <Col N="1118" /> to Friday, Saturdays and Sundays, all of which have separate hours of opening and closing.  Then there is the hour of opening, the hour of closing, and the question of the break from 3 to 5.  I suggest that we consider the procedure we will adopt before we actually enter on the Committee Stage. Amendment 1, by Deputy Redmond, to Section 2, is an endeavour, with regard to subsection (1) (a), to continue the existing law, I take it, relative to hours of opening and closing.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment 2, by Deputy Lyons, seeks to substitute for &ldquo;ten,&rdquo; as an opening hour, the hour of &ldquo;half-past eight.&rdquo; Deputy Redmond's amendment 1 means an opening at nine o'clock.  What I propose, therefore, is that if we take Deputy Redmond's amendment we would not take the amendment to delete sub-section (1) (a), but simply the question of the opening hour in the morning, and instead of taking any amendment to what is in the Bill, to propose the question that the word &ldquo;ten,&rdquo; the word proposed to be deleted by Deputies Redmond and Lyons, should stand part of the section.  On that motion Deputy Redmond's amendment could be discussed and also Deputy Lyons' amendment to put the hour back to &ldquo;half-past eight.&rdquo;  If the word &ldquo;ten&rdquo; is allowed by the Committee to remain as part of the sub-section, then both amendments fall. If the word &ldquo;ten&rdquo; is deleted, a motion will be made to insert the words &ldquo;half-past eight,&rdquo; that being the biggest change.  If that were carried it would stand, but if it were not carried then a motion would be made to insert the word &ldquo;nine.&rdquo;  This procedure would also be followed in the case of similar amendments regarding hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is any other method that will enable Deputies to get a decision.  In that way we will take a decision with regard to the opening hour.  Then there is an amendment by Deputy Heffernan dealing with the break, and there are subsequent amendments dealing with the closing hour. The object of my proposal throughout the Committee Stage would be to segregate <Col N="1119" /> proposals so that the Committee could discuss each proposal by itself.</P>

      <P>There is only one point on this section that I desire again to call the attention of the Committee to.  Mention was made of it, I think, on the Second Reading, and that is on the interpretation of the word &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; in line 37.  The word &ldquo;restaurant&rdquo; is defined.  &ldquo;Restaurant&rdquo; means &ldquo;licensed premises structurally adapted for use,&rdquo; etc.  The word &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; occurred also in another part of the Bill, and I think it might be advisable, I do not say that it would be possible actually to draw a line, to have some explanation given in the Bill as to what is meant by the word &ldquo;substantial.&rdquo;  We have had a description given by Deputy Cooper and others about the sandwich in days gone by where a person was entitled to a drink if he partook of a sandwich, and it was suggested that the same sandwich lasted for more than one beverage.  I think that it would be advisable if some means could be devised by which a definition would be given of this word.  I am not prepared to offer a solution at the moment.  It is not my Bill.  I would like to have defined more explicitly what is meant by a &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; meal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is provided in other parts of the Bill that a person shall be entitled to consume intoxicating liquor on partaking of a substantial meal.  Of course I shall have an opportunity later on to refer again to this term.  In the meantime. I ask the Minister to look into the matter and to see if there could not be some more definite meaning given to the term &ldquo;substantial,&rdquo; because, <Col N="1120" /> of course, that would naturally give rise perhaps to considerable litigation. It would be the subject matter for litigation if the question arose as to whether a person was entitled to a drink when he was having a &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; meal.  The question would arise &ldquo;What is a &lsquo;substantial&rsquo; meal?&rdquo;  I think there should be some attempt at any rate to define what is in the mind of the Minister when he inserts the word &ldquo;substantial.&rdquo;</P>

The paragraph reads: &ldquo;For the purposes of the application of this Act (except part 5 thereof) to the Dublin Metropolitan area.  That area shall be deemed to be a county borough,&rdquo; and so on.  I do not quite follow at the moment what is meant by the Dublin Metropolitan area.  The Dublin Metropolitan Police District, by Section 61 of the Dublin Corporation Act of 1900, was extended to include certain outside areas such as Clontarf and others, except in regard to the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor. I do not know whether what is meant here is the Dublin Metropolitan Police District.  In fact, I would like if the Minister could explain the meaning of the term &ldquo;Dublin Metropolitan area.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The proposal now is that in Section 2 the word &ldquo;ten,&rdquo; in line 29, stand and to allow a debate on the whole question of the opening hours in the morning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite agreeable to your suggestion that this section should be taken in the manner you have indicated, and I think it will <Col N="1124" /> tend to clarity of expression in the debate. On your ruling, therefore, the question that we have to decide now is that the word &ldquo;ten&rdquo; stand part of the section, meaning thereby that the opening hours for county boroughs in future shall be ten o'clock upon week days instead of nine o'clock as they are now according to the present law.</P>
      <P>My two amendments to this section tend to leave the present law as it is in regard both to the opening and closing hours.  With regard to the opening hours in county boroughs, I see no reason for further curtailment in the morning.  Many arguments may be put forward for curtailment of hours in the evening.  It may be said, with a certain amount of reason, that public-houses should not offer inducements to people, especially to working men, to stay away from their homes during the late hours in the evening and, perhaps, spend their money in a manner not best calculated to serve the interests of their homes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not, however, think that the same arguments can apply in the case of the morning. In many county boroughs, particularly the one I represent, the city of Waterford, it is of considerable importance that working men should have facilities for obtaining refreshment, at least, at 9 o'clock in the morning.  Ships constantly come into that port at early hours and they are either about to discharge or have discharged their cargoes at that time or are, perhaps, about to sail away.  I do not think that any cogent arguments can be advanced whereby it can be shown that the fact of licensed premises being open at 10 instead of 9 o'clock in the morning is going seriously to conduce to the further sobriety of the people as a whole. In reality, the general bulk of people cannot get drinks in the morning because they are otherwise occupied, and those who are in the position to get it, such persons as dockers and quay workers, should not, I submit, be deprived of a facility which they would not be in a position to avail of later.  I think it would be very difficult for any <Col N="1125" /> genuine temperance reformer&mdash;I am not speaking of fanatical teetotaller&mdash; to show that by curtailing the hours in the morning they are going seriously to advance the cause of temperance. It will be undoubtedly a hardship on a few and it will not affect the many, and to leave the hours as they are at present, namely, 9 o'clock in the morning, seems no extravagant demand.  It is not asking for any concession.  It is not demanding further facilities.  It is merely, in effect, stating that the present hour of 9 o'clock is not too early and that the difference between 9 and 10 o'clock in the morning in the amount of liquor consumed between these hours will be so small as to render the effect nugatory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister on the ground that the curtailment of this hour will not affect the multitude, but it will, perhaps, inflict an unnecessary hardship upon a few.  I do not know that the same applies so much to the city of Dublin, but I certainly can speak for my own constituency, and, I think in this respect, for every county borough where the people, perhaps, come in early in the morning from country districts and may require refreshment sooner than they might if working in the city of Dublin.  I think it is no extravagant demand, therefore, but merely a reasonable proposition, to say that the hour of 9 a.m. should remain as it is and not be curtailed by one hour further.  The Commission reported, it is true, that in their view there should be a curtailment of the hour in the morning, but they really gave no weighty reasons for it, and I think it was on the general principle that it would be a good think to cut down hours.  The question of cutting down the hour in the evening will arise later, but what we are dealing with now is the question of opening in the morning. I submit it is unnecessary, in the first place, that it is unreasonable in the second place, that it would do no great good to the cause of temperance in the third place, that possibly it would inflict, hardship on some deserving cases in the fourth place, and, therefore, I ask the Committee to alter the hour of 10 o'clock in the Bill to the <Col N="1126" /> present hour of 9 o'clock under the existing law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment on behalf of the people I represent. Deputy Johnson represents official labour and I represent independent labour, but as labour men we may agree to differ on this, that when a trader has employees whom he wants to start work at 9 in the morning he should be allowed to do so.  No man bothers about a drink between 9 and 10 in the morning, and the takings of the publicans for that hour amount to nothing whatever, but it is necessary that the employees should start work at 9 so as to have everythingan and ready for the customers when they come in at 10 o'clock.  If that will not be allowed you will certainly be doing a great injustice to the people who are primarily responsible from a financial point of view for the upkeep of the State.  It is alleged, and I hope it is correct, that all the wealthy men in the city are publicans.  If they are, as I said it here last Thursday week, it is through their own efforts.  By making the opening 10 o'clock instead of 9 you are going to prevent these people from utilising their wealth in giving employment.  If the Bill is allowed to stand as it is we are going to compel those publicans to dismiss a number of their employees.  I wonder how the advocate of temperance would like that, considering the contributions of sixpences of these employees are keeping men like him in their positions. I put it to the Minister for Justice that if he intends to adhere to the principle of the Bill with regard to the opening hour he will be doing a great injustice to the people who have elected him, and if he goes back to them in the comingctions&mdash;back to the Unionists or Freemasons&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not pretend that the workers bother about a drink before 10 <Col N="1127" /> o'clock, because at the rates they are paid they cannot afford one.  If Deputy Redmond's amendment is not accepted the Minister for Justice is going to cause a great deal of unnecessary trouble, but I recognise that it is not his intention to cause trouble in the Free State because he fully realises we have had quite enough of that.

      <P>Well, in the case of county boroughs, I suppose it would apply in some degree, but not to the same extent as it would apply in the rural areas.

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will pardon me for interrupting him.  I think what he is driving at is that mixed traders will be allowed to open at 9 o'clock.  That is provided in Section 3.  They will be allowed to open from 9 until 10.  Probably what the Deputy is considering is the impracticability <Col N="1128" /> of having mixed traders open for the same hours&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGOLDRICK</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say that I am much impressed by the difficulties as regards supervision, or any other difficulties.  The mixed trader who opens his door at 9 o'clock in the morning, although his house is not open for the sale of intoxicating liquor, will be liable to prosecution.  That is the only point I am concerned with.  I do not mind whether it is 10 o'clock or 9 o'clock, whichever might be considered wiser in the interests of the trade and the community.  But I think we are taking an example from other places, and I do not think we should go very far with regard to copying some examples in relation to this particular trade.  I think they are too much disposed to side-track and to try to restrict unduly the interests of the people engaged in this business.  The people engaged in it are undoubtedly among the best elements of our community, people whom we should consider, and we should not be at all disposed or tempted to go to any extremes in order to impose penalties upon these people, and at the same time in the interests of what will not, or perhaps cannot, even be envisaged as a service to true temperance.  After all, these are really pin-pricking methods, irritating a body of traders who are fully alive to their responsibilities, and who are a very worthyment in our community, and I do not think it is worthy of a Government that stands for all that we stand for in this State.  As I say, I am not concerned as between 10 and 9; it makes very little difference to me; but I really think if you are going to allow a man to open his house for one thing at 9 o'clock, and for the other thing at 10 o'clock, it will make it very awkward, and it will be somewhat difficult to see that it is properly carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the Minister for Justice will give favourable consideration to the arguments <Col N="1129" /> put forward by Deputy Redmond.  I think I see in the statement he made some hope of serving all concerned in this disputed Bill.  I think it would be fair to say, on behalf of the temperance people&mdash;and I know it is right in respect of the vintners' assistants&mdash; that they would favour an alteration of the hour in this section from 10 o'clock to 9.  I gather from Deputy Redmond that he is more or less able to speak the voice of the vintners themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, all the arguments lead to the conclusion that the vintners would favour exactly what the vintners' assistants favour, and I have a letter before me which suggests that the hour of 10 should be altered to 9 and that the closing hour should be one hour earlier in every case. There seems to me the basis of a compromise. The Bill as a whole is a compromise; the bad and the good seem to have got together.  But here is an opportunity for the three sections that are interested to agree that the hour shall be 9 o'clock in the morning and that there shall be closing an hour earlier at night.  That I take to be the conclusion to be drawn from Deputy Redmond's argument; it is the view of the vintners' assistants, and I think, while I have no authority to speak for them, the great majority of temperance advocates in the country would approve of that amendment.  I would urge the Minister to agree to this proposal, on condition that the parties concerned will agree to the hour earlier closing at night.  I think that that would be a distinct change in the direction of reform.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I would be allowed to remind Deputy Johnson that the trend of my argument could never, by any stretch of the imagination, be taken as coming from the point of view of the vintners. I dealt entirely with the point of view of the general public, and I went so far as to say that this was a matter <Col N="1130" /> of such small concern to the general public that it did not affect the many but only inflicted an unnecessary hardship on the few.  Of course what we are now discussing, according to the Speaker's ruling, is that the word &ldquo;ten&rdquo; stand part of the section with regard to the opening hour in the morning, and with respect to Deputy Johnson I suggest that he was entirely out of order in making any suggestion in regard to the closing hour.  But what I did say was, and what I venture to repeat is, that there might be arguments for closing in the evening an hour earlier, a very different thing from saying that I was in favour of these arguments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that there might be arguments for closing an hour earlier in the evening, but I said that these arguments did not apply to opening an hour later in the morning, and I think it would be well for Deputies to realise that what we are now discussing is not the curtailment of the hour in the evening, because that is not proposed in the Bill, and it was not even proposed in the original Bill.  What is proposed is that an hour should be taken off in the morning.  I would desire to substantiate further the case that I have endeavoured to make by elaborating the argument put forward by Deputy McGoldrick in regard to the smaller towns.  We are now discussing county boroughs, and though Section 3 does provide that mixed traders may open from 9 until 10 in the morning for the sale of commodities other than liquor, I say that that provision will be practically impossible to carry out, or that you will require at least one Civic Guard to every two or three licensed houses, if not to every licensed house. To suggest that licensed houses should be closed for the sale of liquor until 10, and should be allowed to open for the sale of other commodities up to 10, and that proper supervision could be exercised over the conduct of these houses is to suggest the impossible, and I would add that to the other arguments <Col N="1131" /> that I have endeavoured to make on behalf of the general opening of all houses, mixed and otherwise, at the existing hour, 9 o'clock in the morning.</P>

      <P>I submit, sir, that they are even more so.  On this question of 10 o'clock opening as against 9 o'clock opening I have not very much to say.  The present hours are in the county boroughs from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. The proposed hours are from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. and from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. In the one case you have a thirteen hours day; in the other case, two spells of five hours, with a two hours break.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Redmond has told us that it would be a hardship if licensed houses were not allowed to open at 9.  I think the word &ldquo;hardship&rdquo; should be reserved for genuine cases.  It is a word that has considerable currency, a considerable false currency, in my opinion.  One hears that this is a hardship, and that that is a hardship; and the net effect of the misuse of the word is to weaken it in its application to matters which do constitute a genuine hardship.  Let us examine this hardship of a 10 o'clock opening. Throughout the greater part of Great Britain the opening hours for licensed houses are from 11.30 in the morning to 3 in the afternoon, and from 5.30 in the afternoon to 10 at night.  There is a hardship.  There is a genuine hardship&mdash;only an 8 hours' drinking day, with a 2½ hours' break in the middle of it; but the proposal of 10 hours is a great hardship here.  The hardship of being without drink between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. is stressed by Deputy Redmond. I am not prepared to accept his case.  I think that we must prune, and prune substantially, the drinking day that exists here&mdash;at least that we <Col N="1133" /> should do it if we have the interests of the State and its people at heart; and that if we do not do it, there will be only one reason for it.  That is: that we were cowed and demoralised by the opposition of a particular vested interest.  Deputy Redmond said that there might be arguments for taking off an hour in the evening, but that there are none for taking off an hour in the morning.  There, like Deputy Johnson, I will meet him.  If he will tell me that he will agree to take off an hour in the evening, we will leave that hour on in the morning, but otherwise we will not.</P>
    <P>Even 10 o'clock is too early.  If we had here, as they had in Great Britain, the licensed house that is a licensed house only, and if we had not here the factor that by far the great majority of the licensed houses do a mixed trade, I would be proposing to the Dáil even a later hour than 10 o'clock, but you have the mixed house which some provision is made for in Section 3.  I do not want more than an hour at any rate in which the house will be open for one side of its business and not open for the other so there is the difficulty in getting the hour for the commencement of the licensed business as late as it really should be, for I think it should be as late as eleven o'clock. If one has to prune the day it must be by pruning at both ends with perhaps this break in the day that is also suggested for the four county boroughs but I am not prepared to accept any modification or any departure from the 10 o'clock opening in the county boroughs.  I ask the House to take the view that it is not in fact a hardship on anyone, either on the licensed trade or on the general public or any section of it that the hour for opening in the morning be 10 a.m. rather than the present hour of 9 a.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'DOHERTY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have intervened in this debate were it not for the remarks of my colleague from Tirconaill.  He made some observations which really do not affect this amendment. With regard to the Minister's observations I think that in this discussion to-day he has behaved with the greatest consideration.  I know Dublin fairly well and I think he has made a <Col N="1134" /> very fair offer&mdash;that if the proposed hour of opening in the morning be changed from ten to nine there should be an hour earlier closing in the evening. I think probably that will meet Deputy Johnson's point.  I do not know whether Deputy Johnson or his Party might not care for refreshments at a later hour but we are discussing the proposals in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The only objection that I take to the Bill is in regard to the closing hours from 3 to 5, but we have not reached that yet.  So far as the Minister's observations go in regard to the four county boroughs, I think he has acted not only well but generously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister endeavoured to cast a doubt upon the effect of my original amendments if they had been put, and possibly carried. All I have to say in regard to that is, that I am perfectly satisfied that the effect of those amendments would have been that, except in regard to Sundays, St. Patrick's Day, Good Friday or Christmas Day, the law would have remained the same as it is, but that is rather beside the question we are debating.  I do not think the Minister has altogether justified the change that he has proposed.  He is proposing to curtail the hours of opening by one hour in the morning.  He went so far as to say that he would be prepared to curtail the hours of opening further in the morning only for the difficulty in regard to mixed trading. Of course, he may consider that an argument.  I do not know that it will be any easier to supervise the mixed houses for one hour or two hours.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider that very much of an argument. The Minister said he would be prepared to propose a further later hour. I take him at his word.  I imagined from the original text of the Bill, that the Minister himself would be prepared to go the whole hog and propose that there should be no such thing as the consumption of liquor in the Saorstát in houses open for that purpose, but he has had to cut his cloth slightly, even since the introduction of the present <Col N="1135" /> Bill, according to the measure laid down by the members of his own Party.  However, I think there is no justification for depriving people, between the hours of 9 and 10 o'clock, of partaking of refreshment by way of intoxicating liquor if they are in such a position that they shall not be enabled to take it at other hours, than there would be for depriving them of doing that at any other period during the day.  Admittedly, there is not anything like the same drinking in the early hours of the morning.  I do not think that can be controverted.  It is, therefore, penalising the very few who would be entitled owing principally to their position as workmen or others engaged in business for not being able to avail themselves of other hours.</P>
      <P>The question of the closing hour does not arise on the amendment we are discussing.  Up to this the Minister has not even attempted to alter those hours on ordinary week days in any portion of the Bill, and to construe my words into suggesting that there were arguments in favour of closing earlier in the evening when what I merely said was that there might be arguments for earlier evening closing but that there were no arguments whatever for an earlier closing in the morning is, I think, to misrepresent what I actually said. Arguments may be brought forward for closing in the evening earlier, but to say that they are arguments does not mean that they are good or sound arguments.  I say that no argument of any sort or kind can be brought forward, and certainly no argument has been brought forward by the Minister this evening for curtailing the hour of opening in the morning.  I hope when this motion is put to a division that I will get support for this amendment, which is not asking for a change, but is merely asking that the existing hours in the morning, which have not been seriously attacked by the Minister as injurious to the general welfare of the people be allowed to remain for the opening of licensed houses in the county boroughs on the ordinary week days.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Justice.  He has <Col N="1136" /> resumed his original rôle of strong man.  He refuses to be cowed by a section of the community.  Deputy McGoldrick is under the impression that those of us who stand for the temperance cause asperse the members of the licensed vintners' trade and that we do not regard them, as he wishes us to regard them, as respectable elements of society.  That is no part of the temperance case.</P>
      <P>We know from experience that there are men engaged in the liquor trade who may yield to no one in point of excellence in citizenship, but there are three interests as regards the liquor trade, not merely the employees of the licensed houses, for whom, in some subtle way which I am unable to follow, Deputy Lyons is so much concerned this evening; there are also the licensees, but before and above all those are the interests of the public at large, of the social fabric itself, and of the reputation and well-being of the State.  Now the hour of nine o'clock, we have been told by various speakers, differs very little from ten o'clock. This hour is inconsiderable in the calculation. I hold that every hour makes all the difference.  It is the breakfast hour for a great many people, and those who take intoxicating liquor instead of the normal breakfast are put on the inclined plane, down which the descent is easy for the remainder of the day.  Deputy Redmond, to my amazement, spoke of providing facilities for workmen on their way to work to procure drink.  Surely, no one desires that.  Surely, the very object of this legislation in which we are engaged is to save men of that type from themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>And other types.  I do not at all suggest they are the only type.  When we come to deal with the clubs I shall have something to say about the gentleman drinker, the gentleman soaker.  I am dealing with the specific point made by Deputy Redmond now.  If there are citizens at the hour of nine who require refreshments, they are travellers&mdash;people who have arrived in the <Col N="1137" /> city.  I want the House to remember that the clause we are dealing with now is county boroughs, cities, not the country.  A different case can be made for country districts.  I am speaking of the city, where great masses of men are congregated, and where there are already sufficient facilities for drinking; where temptations are in every corner in the workman's way to the place of his employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say, as regards the traveller who arrives in the city, that it may be necessary that he should be provided with refreshments of this kind but his case is met, as Deputy Redmond will realise on reflection, by arrangements for bona fide travellers.  Consequently the hardship, to which allusion has been made, does not arise with regard to that class.  It is quite right that everything should be done that will prevent the growth of intemperance.  There was a period when political enthusiasm <Col N="1138" /> for certain ideals was so widespread and keen that temperance and patriotism went hand in hand for a time.  Unfortunately, for some reason which it is difficult to understand, intemperance has begun to revive and I think where we are concerned for the stability, well-being and future of the Free State we should see to-day so far as we can help, that we will react against these influences making for intemperance. I would not approve of the <i>quid pro quo</i> of the hour in the evening. That is a separate question and should stand by itself.  I contend for dealing with this on its own basis, for what it is.  I do hold and insist that the difference between nine o'clock and ten o'clock in the morning is a very material difference.  I am very glad that the Minister for Justice is going to stand firm upon this point.</P>
