      <P>asked the Minister for Finance (a) whether he received a deputation from the Cinema Exhibitors <Col N="2040" /> and Theatres Association on the question of the abolition of the Entertainment Tax; (b) whether he promised to consider the matter and to receive the deputation again; (c) whether a further meeting did not take place in spite of requests therefor; (d) whether he received a copy of a resolution which was passed unanimously at a meeting of the above association to the effect that any relief granted by the Government regarding this tax would be passed on to the public; and (e) whether in view of this, and to prevent the closing down of a number of cinemas in the Saorstát during the summer months and the consequent unemployment, it is intended to make a revision in the scale of entertainment tax in the forthcoming Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>(a) A deputation representing the Theatre and Cinema Association (Ireland) was received on the 16th March, 1926, in connection with the proposed abolition of entertainments duty.  (b) A promise was made that the representations of the deputation would receive consideration. (c) A second deputation from the association was received on the 27th November, 1926, when an undertaking was given that the question of regrading the tax so as to lighten its incidence on the lower-priced seats would be looked into.  Two requests for a further interview were made subsequently, but it was not considered necessary to receive a deputation, as all the relevant facts had already been presented.  (d) No copy of a resolution to the effect that any relief granted by the Government regarding the entertainments duty would be passed on to the public was received by the Minister for Finance. (e) It is not intended to provide for a revision of the entertainments duty in the forthcoming Finance Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for POSTS and TELEGRAPHS (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received a resolution in the sense indicated in the Deputy's question, and I am aware that there is regret, a regret which I share, amongst the Dublin Postal Staff, that it has not been possible to make appointments from within the Post Office to the three posts recently filled from outside.  The primary consideration in matters of this sort must be the general interest of the public service, and it was necessary on this occasion, in the interest of efficiency and economy, and on the strength of official reports made to me after a special examination of the work of the Dublin Office, to find officers from outside the Dublin postal staff for these posts.  I am not aware of any reasons in this case for departing from the usual procedure of judging the qualifications of officers for particular posts, and I am unable, therefore, to adopt the Deputy's suggestion to set up a Committee.  I can assure the Deputy that officers will not be imported into the Dublin postal district over the heads of better qualified officers in that district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may add for the Deputy's information that in the last five years there have been 271 promotions (out of a sorting staff of 391) to higher posts from within the Dublin postal district, as against 17 for the previous five years.  I may state, further, that while six officers from outside the Dublin postal district have been promoted to posts in the Dublin postal district since the change of Government, 69 <Col N="2043" /> Dublin postal district officers have been promoted to higher posts outside the Dublin postal district.</P>

    <P>That the Dáil concur with the Seanad in their Resolution communicated to the Dáil the 24th day of February, 1927, that it is expedient that a Joint Committee of both Houses be appointed to consider the Dublin Port and Docks (Bridge) Bill, 1927.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion on which this Bill was before us it was suggested that a Committee of members of the Dáil should consider the matter.  A Committee was appointed, consisting of Deputies Corish, Esmonde, J. Good, Dr. Hennessy, B. O'Connor, and Thrift.  They were asked by me to assemble and consider whether the erection of a new bridge in place of the proposed widening of Butt Bridge would prejudice any proposals made in regard to the traffic problem.  They held a number of meetings, examined a number of witnesses, and their recommendation is that the Butt Bridge proposal should stand, and that a transporter bridge connecting Guild Street with Cardiff Lane should be constructed to deal with traffic which would otherwise pass over Butt Bridge.  The committee generally approved of that proposal.  The Port and Docks Board agreed to take such steps as may be necessary to extend the scope and financial provisions of the present Bill so as to include the erection, maintenance and working of a transporter bridge. <Col N="2045" /> The Board go on to say: &ldquo;If, for any constitutional or other reason, it should be found impossible to incorporate in the present Bill the necessary additional provisions to give effect to this undertaking, the Board agree to lodge a new Bill at the first available opportunity, which will have for its object a like purpose.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In view of the recommendation of the Committee and of the undertaking of the Port and Docks Board I would waive any objection to the Second Reading of this Bill.  I would like to say, from the information at my disposal, that it is considered necessary that the transporter bridge should be capable of dealing with 1,000 vehicles per hour, and also that the bridge should run diagonally to link up Guild Street and Cardiff Lane, with the avoidance of two corners which might constitute a danger to traffic&mdash;one out of Guild Street and the other on to the bridge.  It is further stated that considerable benefit would be derived if it were found possible to widen the corner of Guild Street, and it is also suggested that the Port and Docks Board should agree to give facilities for the construction of the continuation of Amiens Street down to the quays.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that Deputy Thrift is not here to explain this matter, but I wish to draw the attention of the Dáil to the fact that the terms of reference were very narrow.  The only matter we had to consider was the question of traffic, and any question as to the general appearance to the city of Dublin was not within our terms of reference, and we could not consider it. We had evidence from the Chairman of the Architects' Association objecting to this proposal, without a general town plan for the city of Dublin being agreed on.  Owing to our terms of reference being confined solely to the question of traffic, we arrived at the conclusion which the President has just announced.  Possibly it may work out all right in the end.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of the Finance Bill, 1927.  As Deputies will see, the Bill is of much smaller proportions this year than in previous years.  There is a number of remissions which were not before the Dáil already because it was not necessary to have resolutions in regard to them.  The first is in Section 3, which provides for the exemption of the emoluments of representatives of other Governments of the British Commonwealth of Nations from income tax. The position at the moment is that the High Commissioner and his staff in Great Britain are exempt from British tax.  We have no representatives in other British Dominions, but if we had them they would be exempt from tax, and it is desired that we should be in a position to give exemption to representatives of other Dominions who are or may be here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2047" /> Section 4 provides for the giving of relief from double income tax in respect of profits from the business of shipping.  It is desired to be in a position to enter into agreements with a number of Governments in this matter. There is, in fact, a special case for relief from double taxation of shipping profits because a tramp steamer might call at ten different countries in the course of a round voyage and be liable to income tax in each of them.</P>
    <P>The basis of taxation of British dividends was changed when we adopted the new system of relief last year.  We have departed from the three years' average and we charge them on the actual year of assessment.  The result is that assessments have been made in certain cases which are in excess of the amount of the income, and there is at present no means of giving relief.  It is proposed that power should be given to the Revenue Commissioners to give relief in respect of any excess in assessment.</P>
    <P>Section 6 covers cases which have caused a good deal of trouble.  During the disturbed years a great number of people were prevented from using or remaining in possession of their land. In many of those cases income tax was not paid, and in equity, the tax should not be paid.  The tax has not been paid, and because it is still outstanding considerable difficulty has been caused in dealing with the land.  The Land Commission have been up against various sorts of difficulties as a result of it.</P>
    <P>Section 7 also deals with cases which have caused a good deal of trouble. Certain lands were bought all over the country by co-operative societies, and being held in trust by the co-operative societies for individuals they were liable to income tax, although if they had been divided none of the individual owners would have been liable to income tax.  The tax has not been collected, and at present there is difficulty in dividing the lands; tenants are not willing to accept possession because they fear their stock would be seized for any tax owing.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in section 8 to make it possible to discharge quarterly assessments <Col N="2048" /> irrecoverable without an unnecessary amount of clerical labour and consequent expense.  Section 9 is, to some extent, complementary to Section 5, and it enables the Special Commissioners to direct payment on account of income tax where some point in regard to the assessment remains outstanding.</P>
    <P>Section 15 enables us to give relief in cases where legacy duty or succession duty is charged here and in Northern Ireland.  The arrangement will be the same as the arrangement with Great Britain.  When the general double taxation arrangement was being entered into with Great Britain, the Government of Northern Ireland declined to accept the basis of relief then agreed on between the Saorstát and Great Britain.  That Government is now willing to accept the same arrangement as the arrangement between the Saorstát and Great Britain.  It is proposed that the relief should be given.</P>
    <P>Section 16 proposes to reduce the penalty for having an unlicensed dog from £5 to £1.  That will mean the effective penalty will be 5s., because the District Justice will be able to reduce the fine to 5s.  Heretofore he could only reduce it to 25s., and that meant that a great number of appeals for remission of taxation had to be considered by the Revenue Commissioners. It is felt it is proper to reduce the penalty.  I think these are the only points to which I need refer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>Before going into the main questions raised in this Bill, I would like to refer to a point connected with Section 3, which was not mentioned by the Minister previously, and which has reference to the exemption of representatives of the other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  I understand this exemption will only apply to representatives of those Governments which offer a similar exemption to our representatives in their countries.  This would only apply to the representative, when he is appointed, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. We have no representative in Canada, and consequently any representative of Canada will not enjoy the privileges of this section.  I do not know exactly, <Col N="2049" /> as a result of the Adaptation of Enactments Act, what is the position in this country with regard to the exemption of representatives of other countries outside the Commonwealth of Nations. I presume, by some enactment the Minister of the United States would be exempt from all income tax and, I hope, all rates and taxes of every kind. I presume that is the case with regard to our Minister in Washington.</P>
      <P>I do not know, and I am not aware if the Minister knows, what is the position with regard to Consuls-General of countries that have not got diplomatic representation in this country, but that have Consuls-General who perform a quasi-diplomatic function in relation to the Government of this State.  I do not know whether their goods, their effects, are free from customs duty when they come into this State.  It would be advisable if the Act were extended so as to include the representatives of other nations besides those included in the British Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
      <P>The main point with which I wish to deal touches on a question which has not yet been discussed in the Dáil, or, so far as I know, in the Press.  I refer to the question of the continued operation of Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1919, and similar sections in other Finance Acts of the British Parliament; in other words, the operation of imperial preference in this country.  I have no desire to raise any general discussion. In view of the terms of the Finance Bill and the Budget statement, which does not impose any fresh customs duty, it would not be advisable to start a general discussion on tariffs at this point.  I think it would be advisable if the Minister made some statement with regard to the position as respects imperial preference.  So far as I understand, the 1919 Act and the other sections of other Finance Acts are still in operation as a result of the Adaptation of Enactments Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 1919 Finance Act it is stated that imperial preference on certain goods will be given from certain countries in the British Empire.  It is defined in that Act that the British Empire means any of his Majesty's dominions outside Great Britain and Ireland. Many tariffs have been imposed since <Col N="2050" /> the Saorstát came into being, subject to the 1919 Act.  That is to say, that the manufacturers in Great Britain and other parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations and the British Empire enjoy a preferential rate as compared with the rates charged on goods from other countries.  There are other tariffs which have been imposed, and which, apparently, are not subject to imperial preference.  For instance, in the last few Budgets the Executive Council has removed the imperial preference on sugar and tobacco, and the duty on tea has been removed.  I think it is important that the country should know exactly what is the position of this State with regard to Northern Ireland and Great Britain in the matter of imperial preference.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to believe, as far as I have been able to read the figures, that we are giving a far larger preference to Great Britain and Northern Ireland &mdash;we are giving a far larger reduction in customs duties to goods from Great Britain and Northern Ireland&mdash;than Great Britain and Northern Ireland give to goods from the Irish Free State. I was particularly struck, in the course of the Parliamentary tour in Australia, with the importance which the Australians attach to the question of imperial preference.  The British members of the delegation repeatedly protested, either in private or in public, against the imposition of tariffs by the Australians against British goods.  I remember a very forcible speech that was made by the Premier of Victoria, Mr. Allen, or as he is better known, Mr. &ldquo;Cocky&rdquo; Allen.  &ldquo;Cocky&rdquo; is the Australian term for farmer.  He is head of the Farmers' Party and Premier of Victoria.  He made a very forcible speech, pointing out that Australia was giving about £9,000,000 a year to Great Britain by way of remission of customs duties through the operation of imperial preference, while the imperial preference given to Australian goods in England was comparatively negligible.  Deputies, I am sure, would be interested to hear what is the corresponding figure in the Irish Free State to that sum of £9,000,000 a year which the Australians give as a free gift to British manufacturers.  Unfortunately, <Col N="2051" /> we have no statistics.  The statistics published by the Government do not clearly differentiate between those imports which are liable to full duty and the imports which are liable to preferential imperial duty.  In this connection we should not forget that it is not only a cash remission which we give the British manufacturers: we also give them an increased market.  A reduction in the customs duty gives them a greater capacity for selling their goods in this country than they would have if they had to pay the full duty, and therefore the benefit to British manufacturers must be considered not simply as a cash reduction in the customs duty, but also in reference to the increased facilities they get for the sale of their goods in this country.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister would do good if he made a statement giving the general figures with reference to the operation of imperial preference in this country.  There has been a lot of very loose talk, particularly in the Press, with regard to our best customer. It is important for us to know in terms of pounds, shillings and pence what benefit exactly we give to our best customer.  They apparently give to us, according to the leader writers of the &ldquo;Irish Times,&rdquo; that venerable organ of classical reaction, their good-will. We give them, apparently, imperial preference.  I think, in order to get a clear understanding of the political and economic relations between this State and Great Britain and Northern Ireland, that we should have definite figures on this matter, and perhaps it is more important that we should have these with regard to Northern Ireland than with regard to Great Britain.  We give, apparently, imperial preference on some articles.  There is nothing to prevent this House from giving a national preference, by agreement, to Northern Ireland.  There is nothing to prevent us, as a sovereign Assembly, from giving a national preference to goods certified by the Northern Government as having been produced and manufactured in Northern Ireland.  I do not say that this would be advisable or feasible, but there is nothing certainly to prevent us from doing it. <Col N="2052" /> There is a danger, although perhaps this does not come exactly within the terms of this Bill, of Northern Ireland drifting economically away from the Irish Free State.  There is a danger of Northern Ireland seeking more and more its markets in England and Scotland and neglecting the markets of the Irish Free State, and it is quite possible that the establishment of a national preference would be a valuable means of keeping close economic relations between these two sections in this country.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which, I suggest, the Dáil and the Government and the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; should favourably consider. As far as I know, it has not been discussed or considered previously. I think it would be a mistake if this matter was not mentioned before this Dáil ceases to exist.  There has been amongst the Press, and particularly in that venerable organ to which I have already referred, a persistent wail as regards the imposition of new tariffs in this country.  If one reads the financial articles published within the last few years one will see that many of the tariffs which have been imposed have conferred a preference on British manufactures in the Irish market, a preference which they did not previously possess.  I do not wish to delay the House further, but I think these are matters that should be mentioned before the Dáil comes to an end.  I hope the Minister will make some general statement as regards the whole position in this country as far as imperial preference is concerned, as to the possibility of developing the idea of a national preference with regard to Northern Ireland, and as to how far this matter affects our economic and commercial relations with Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister, when he comes to reply, will give us some additional information with regard to the changes it is proposed to make under Sections 2 and 15.  I was not able to gather from the brief speech which the Minister made on the Second Reading of the Bill what exactly he had in mind in making these proposals, and therefore I think a little more information <Col N="2053" /> from him would be extremely useful.</P>

      <P>Some time ago I asked a question about visitors coming to the Free State.  I referred in particular to the case of Stanley Howard Harrington of Killarney.  I would like to know if any change has taken place since I put that question that would encourage visitors of Mr. Harrington's type to remain for any portion of the year in this State.  Stanley Howard Harrington gave very good employment, but only remained for a short time in this country, because, as I understand, as a result of his failure to get some concession.  I would be glad to hear from the Minister if any change has since taken place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask for some further information on the points that Deputy Good has raised, particularly in respect to Section 15 dealing with the Saorstát and Northern Ireland.  It was explained by the Minister that Northern Ireland did not take advantage of the opportunity before, and now we are asked to enact that as soon as they are willing our authorities here may be entitled to give them that advantage.  I think, before we make such a provision in our Finance Bill, that we ought to have information as to what has been the effect, if it is known, of the relief given in previous Acts.  I think that until we get that information as to what has been the effect of legislation in this respect that we should not go any further in the matter, and that if there is any loss to the Free State by enacting this relief scheme we should not increase that loss.  On the other hand, I do not think that we are called upon to go out of our way at this stage until we have had information as to the effect of previous enactments, to pass this legislation in respect to Northern Ireland alone.  I take it that they believed, when they refused before, that it was of no advantage to them and unless some change has since taken place they will continue to believe that. Consequently there would be no advantage to anyone in our passing this provision.  But in any case whatever may be the ultimate result of making <Col N="2054" /> this special provision, we ought to have some information as to the effect upon our own Exchequer and of the relief given by previous Acts.</P>
      <P>Before passing from this, I think the Minister ought to take this opportunity to tell the House what is going to be the effect upon the finances in the current year of the judgment given by the Judicial Committee of the English Privy Council in the case of Wigg and Cochrane.  That is surely a matter of importance as affecting the finances of this year.  Before we pass this Bill, I think it is requisite that we should have some information from the Minister as to his estimate of the cost to the State of that judgment, and how that is going to affect the taxation scheme.  Obviously it will have some effect.  One would think that it would almost require a new Budget statement, and consequently proposed changes in the taxation proposals of the Minister.  I, therefore, invite him to give us this information before we pass the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>

      <P>With reference to Deputy Esmonde's first point, Consuls-General and the representatives of other countries are exempt from income tax at present.  It has always been the custom to exempt such people, and the exemption, which depends rather on international courtesy than on specific enactment, has been continued. In regard to representatives of States of the British Commonwealth, there has been no exemption heretofore. There has been no custom to enable the Revenue Commissioners to give exemption without specific enactment, and that is why the enactment is now proposed.  So far as Canada is concerned, there would be exemption for a representative of ours there, if we had one.  Consequently, a representative of Canada here would receive exemption immediately, apart from our actually having a person there to take advantage of the exemption.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>They do.  It gives it. We may not be there to receive it. With regard to imperial preference, the position so far as we are concerned is <Col N="2055" /> that we have effected very little change. As the Deputy said, we abolished imperial preference as respects sugar and tobacco.  We have imposed a number of new customs duties, and there is no provision for imperial preference in any of them, except the sugar confectionery duty and the cocoa preparations duty.  Otherwise we simply have let the position remain as it was.  I could not give any information at present as to what it costs the Exchequer to give this relief, and what is the actual gain to Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  In many cases there is no real loss to the Exchequer, because the abolition of imperial preference would be simply tantamount to an increase in the duty, and whatever the Exchequer gained would be borne entirely by the citizens of the State. There may be cases in which the citizens, if imperial preference were abolished, would not bear the whole cost of the increase of revenue, because it may be that in certain instances British manufacturers, because of the imperial preference, have not to cut their prices as finely as they would have if there had been no imperial preference. It is a matter on which it would be difficult to get accurate figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Imperial preference exists at present in regard to cinematograph films, clocks and watches, motor cars and motor cycles and their parts.  As far as the last is concerned, we get reciprocity, because motor car parts are manufactured in Cork and get the advantage of the imperial preference in going into Great Britain.  The other articles are musical instruments, cocoa preparations and sugar confectionery. So far as cocoa preparations and sugar confectionery are concerned, the effective competition with the home manufacturer is the British competition and there is no doubt that, if we abolish imperial preference, if any additional revenue was obtained the burden would fall entirely on the taxpayer. In the case of spirits the imperial preference is 2/6 per gallon. There again, if we abolished the imperial preference, the increase would fall on the consumer.  The Deputy will see that the list is not a very formidable <Col N="2056" /> one.  In respect to the articles which are of any importance we have protective tariffs, and the abolition of imperial preference would simply mean that the tariff would increase.  I do not propose at present to take any steps in the matter of abolishing imperial preference.  On the whole it costs us very little&mdash;that is, it costs the people of the country very little&mdash; and the abolition of it might cost them a good deal more, even if no drastic steps were taken&mdash;as I do not believe there would be&mdash;in response to the abolition of imperial preference. With regard to national preference&mdash; preference for goods manufactured in Northern Ireland&mdash;I do not think such measure would do any good&mdash;that it would produce any different attitude.</P>
    <P>Deputy Good asked about Sections 2 and 15.  Section 2 was the subject of a resolution, and when that was before the House I explained that it was to prevent certain super-tax payers who were doubly resident from getting relief largely in excess of the relief they would have got if they had been resident solely in Great Britain or in the Free State.  It is simply removing a flaw in the legislation giving effect to the double income tax agreement of last year.  It will mean additional revenue of between £100,000 and £150,000.  If we did not adopt this it would mean that certain people would, in effect, in respect to the year of transition, to a very large extent escape taxation through getting excess relief.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Otherwise I take it the present basis of assessment is not altered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  This is only as regards that particular class of people and it only affects the transitional year. In regard to Section 15, the position is that when the general arrangement about relief from double taxation was being entered into the Government of Northern Ireland accepted the arrangement proposed in regard to estate duties, but in regard to succession and legacies, which are of very much less importance, that Government was not satisfied that the proposed basis was a fair one, and refused to enter into the agreement in respect of that.  Since <Col N="2057" /> that time certain people have been subject to double taxation.  They have had to pay double succession duty in the Free State and Northern Ireland, and were unable to get the relief that they would have obtained if it had not been a question between Northern Ireland and the Free State, but between Great Britain and the Free State.  The amount of money involved is very small, but it is a hardship that taxpayers should be doubly taxed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Johnson asks what has been the effect of previous enactments. That sounds more like a conundrum than a question in the ordinary way, and I simply give it up&mdash;I could not answer it.  But I say that if there had been no arrangement for relief it would have inflicted grave injustice and hardship on considerable numbers of people, and by the infliction of that hardship, even although the Exchequer of this country and the Exchequer of Great Britain might have benefited, the community would not have benefited, and I do not believe, owing to the disturbances that would have arisen and the attempts that people would have made to shift property and domicile in order to escape double taxation, it would have produced any advantage.  Deputy Johnson also asked about the effect of the judgment in the Wigg and Cochrane case.  I have not had time to inquire into the full effects of that particular judgment yet, and consequently I am not in a position to make any statement about it.</P>

    <P>That, for the purpose of any Act of the present Session to make provision for the formation and registration of a Company having for its principal object the giving of credit to persons engaged in Agriculture <Col N="2060" /> and businesses ancillary to Agriculture, to authorise the giving of guarantees by the State in relation to the Capital of such Company and securities issued by it, and to provide for certain other matters relating to such Company, and to facilitate the borrowing of money by farmers on mortgages of their farming stock, and to regulate the operation and effect of such mortgages, it is expedient to authorise:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I.  The charge upon the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  all moneys required to meet:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  payments to be made by the Minister for Finance in respect of shares of such Company subscribed for by him under such Act,</P>
    <P>(ii)  sums required to be paid by the Minister for Finance to the liquidator in the winding up of such Company,</P>
    <P>(iii)  sums to be advanced by the Minister for Finance for or towards the payment of dividends to members of such Company,</P>
    <P>(iv)  sums which become payable under any guarantee given by the Minister for Finance in relation to Certificates of charge issued by such Company;</P>
    <P>(b)  the principal and interest of any securities issued by the Minister for Finance for the purpose of borrowing under such Act.</P>
    <P>II.  The payment out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas of any expenses incurred in carrying into effect the provisions of such Act relating to the establishment and maintenance of a Register of Chattel Mortgages.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Credit Bill is designed to give effect to the recommendations of the Banking Commission. The Agricultural Credit Corporation is being organised as a limited liability company.  The charges that may fall upon the Central Fund <Col N="2061" /> in respect of the liability which the State will undertake, in regard to this Company, are set out in the resolutions under four headings.  Under the first heading, we have the payments that the Minister for Finance will make in respect of the shares of the Company subscribed for by him under this Act. The amount the Minister will have to provide under that heading will depend upon the response of the banks and the response of the public, in the first instance.  Two hundred thousand shares will be offered to the banks, and if the whole of that amount is taken up by the banks the remaining 300,000 will be offered to the public.  If less than 200,000 be taken up by the banks, then the amount by which the subscription of the banks is less than 200,000, plus the 300,000, will be offered to the public.  The remainder will then be taken up by the Minister for Finance.  It is easy to see what the maximum requirement will be, but what the requirement in actual fact will prove to be is quite a different matter.</P>
    <P>Under the next heading of paragraph I, the Minister is to provide any amounts required by a liquidator to meet the Company's liabilities in the winding-up of the Company.  Under the next heading there will be liability in respect of dividends.  The dividend is limited to five per cent., and it is anticipated that the Company will be able to provide that dividend out of profits.  However, it might happen, as a result of a series of bad agricultural years, or something of that nature, that the Company would fail to earn profits, and might not be in a position to provide dividends.  Under the fourth heading, there is a liability by the Minister in respect of the certificates of charge.  Care will be taken to see that the certificates of charge are backed by adequate securities.  There is an amendment down which proposes that not merely should they be backed by first mortgages on land but that other securities which the Minister would regard as satisfactory should be permitted as well.  As the Minister for Agriculture said, in moving the Second Reading of the Bill, the Company would be seriously tied up if it could <Col N="2062" /> only issue certificates of charge against first mortgages on land.  It would never be able to issue certificates of charge to the extent that is contemplated in the Bill and that would be required to meet the agricultural credit needs of the country.  Consequently, it is proposed by an amendment that other security should be permitted, including, perhaps, charges on the general assets of a creamery, personal guarantees and, to some extent, even chattel mortgages, though the use of chattel mortgages for these particular purposes would involve great care on the part of the Minister in issuing a guarantee of any certificate of charge, and great care on the part of the trustees.  The other sub-head of charge refers to the payment of principal and interest on any securities issued by the Minister for Finance for the purpose of borrowing under the Act.  That explains itself.  There will be a minor charge in providing for the establishment and maintenance of the register of chattel mortgages.  That will not be a heavy expense.  It will be particularly light in the earlier years, because it will probably take the people a considerable time to get used to chattel mortgages.  It is probable that, in the first few years, the number of chattel mortgages registered will not be high.</P>

      <P>At the end of sub-section (1) add the words &ldquo;nothing contained in the forgoing portion of this sub-section shall be construed as permitting banks to subscribe for shares other than those offered for sale to the banks.  In the event of the two hundred thousand shares offered to the banks being subscribed for by them, persons holding positions as directors or paid servants of banks shall not be permitted to hold shares in the Agricultural Credit Corporation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Second Reading of this Bill Deputy Johnson called attention to the fact that it was in the power of the banks to obtain control of the capital of this Corporation.  Shares to the amount of £200,000 are to be offered to the banks, and if the banks buy up this amount, shares to the value of £300,000 are to be offered to the public.  There is nothing to prevent a bank, either as a corporate body or through individuals or officials, going into the market and buying up such a number of shares as would give them the greater part of the total share capital.  While it is not intended that this Corporation should be in direct competition with the banks, matters may so develop that there will be a certain amount of competition between them.  At this stage, it is impossible to foresee what the developments <Col N="2066" /> will be, but we should take precautions that the banks shall not be in a position to acquire the greater number of shares in the Corporation. This, of course, may be a mere bogey. There may be no real danger, but I see no harm in endeavouring to guard against it.  This amendment was rather hastily drafted, and I am not sure that it will fulfil the purpose intended. If the Minister accepts the principle of the amendment, he could have it re-drafted so as to meet the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to accept the amendment.  I would say, again, with reference to this amendment, what I said with reference to Deputy Byrne's amendment&mdash;that if the Deputy has a certain object in view he ought to go along a straight road towards that object.  If he wants to arrange that there should never be a majority of directors elected by the banks, he ought to put down an amendment providing for something like that on Report Stage.  It seems to me that this is not the right way to accomplish that object, even assuming that the object were a desirable one.  If we want people to invest money in the shares of this Corporation, we must not prevent them having a free market in the shares.  There would be no use in preventing the banks subscribing for the shares when first issued if we are going to allow them to acquire them afterwards.  If we are not going to allow them to acquire the shares later, then we are limiting the market for those shares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would be limiting their use in the case of individuals who own them, and who perhaps wanted to borrow on them, and I think the result of an amendment such as this would either be that it would have no effect at all, because the banks could afterwards get all the shares they wanted, or if we extended it to prevent the banks later on from getting shares it would discourage the general public from applying.  I think, therefore, that even if what Deputy Heffernan desires to do were a right thing to do, this amendment proposes to go about it in the wrong way. I may say that I am not a bit alarmed <Col N="2067" /> about the prospects of the banks acquiring a majority of the shares.  Supposing the banks applied for a majority of the shares, supposing that they took up all the shares, all that they would have accomplished would be this, that they would have attached a Government guarantee to £500,000 of their own money, which they could apply to certain purposes specified in the Act.</P>
    <P>But that would be the limit of what they could do, because if the Corporation were not behaving satisfactorily the Minister would not guarantee any service to the charge, and the matter would simply stop at the investment of £500,000.  I do not think that there is any likelihood of that occurring.  I do not think that the banks, for the trivial advantage it would be to them to be able to invest a certain sum of their own money with a Government guarantee in a certain way, as laid down in the Bill, would do a thing, perhaps quite legal, but that would be rather crooked. I do not think that we need anticipate anything of the kind.  This Corporation will be a great help to the banks.  Anything that will enable agriculture to prosper will be of great assistance to the banks.  This will enable loans to be given that the banks find difficult to give at present, that are not really ordinary bankers' loans, and I believe that we may anticipate cordial co-operation between the Credit Corporation and the banks, and unless there is cordial co-operation the Credit Corporation to a large extent will fail in its purpose.  If the Corporation is to be conducted on economic lines we must be able to avail of the services of bank managers as agents for the purpose of carrying out certain of the duties, and apart from the way in which Deputy Heffernan proposes to do this&mdash;I think it is wrong to do something that assumes that we cannot look for co-operation, and that in fact the banks may resort to unscrupulous methods to defeat the purpose of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I maintain that I really have taken the most direct method of dealing with this question. <Col N="2068" /> The suggestion made by the Minister that we should insert a specific clause forbidding bank directors to be directors of the Corporation would not, in my opinion, be equitable or fair if the banks or their directors are allowed by the Articles of Association to acquire a majority holding of the shares.  If such an amendment were accepted it would mean that those who might hold a majority of the shares could not have a majority of the directors, and I suggest that that would be a wrong way to deal with this.  I suggest that my way, although perhaps appearing to be indirect, is really the only way in which it could be dealt with.  In my opinion there would not be the slightest danger that the small limitation that would be put on the purchasing of these shares would have any real effect in preventing the shares from being taken up by the public.  I am quite convinced that the public will take up the shares freely, because as I see them they will be quite as good as the National Loan.  The interest will be 5 per cent.; they will be issued at par, I presume, and as the National Loan at present exceeds par, and as these loans will bear the guarantee of the Government, they will be, as far as I can see, on a level with the National Loan, and in addition to having the security of the State they will have the security of the assets of the bank. Therefore, I do not foresee the slightest difficulty in placing the shares.  I may be unduly optimistic, but I believe that the shares can be placed with the public.  I quite agree with the Minister that if this Bill is to be worked as it ought to be we will require to have co-operation between the joint stock banks and the Corporation. That is the intention, and we hope that it will happen in practice. But still there are possibilities that we cannot foresee; they may be dimly foreshadowed in our minds, but we cannot see what they will be, and it seems to me that it might be possible for the banks to obtain control of this institution and, by carrying it on in a way that the Minister could not disapprove of and which would not permit of his refusing to support the capital that he is asked to guarantee, <Col N="2069" /> might so reduce the competition as to make the Corporation ineffective.</P>
      <P>One of the things that occurs to me is the question of deposits.  Under the Bill, contrary to the findings of the Banking Commission, the Corporation is allowed to take deposits.  In that respect they will, to a certain extent, be in competition with the ordinary banks, and one can foresee methods being used by the bank directors, if they were in control of the Corporation, to minimise the competition that will arise.  It may be quite unnecessary, but as far as I can see the amendment would not do any harm.  I feel in all these matters, from the Banking Commission Report down to this Bill, that there is at the back of the whole thing some kind of a fear of the banks.  That is a situation which ought not to exist.  The banks are important institutions, fulfilling their duties fairly well according to their own lights, but still they are institutions whose purpose is to make profits.  If there is any idea that those institutions have a controlling power over the actions of the Government it is an idea that we should not allow to go out.  The banks are subject to the laws of the State, the same as the individual, and I think it should be made pretty clear to the public that that is so and that no special privileges are being granted to them, and not only that, but on account of the powers which they have because of their enormous control of capital they must be subject to certain restrictions.  I respectfully suggest that the amendment is a good one and ought to be accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McBRIDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is contradictory.  He spoke of the premium at which the National Loan stands.  There is a free market in the National Loan, and he wants to prevent a free market in these shares.  It would really mean a depreciation in the market value of the shares, and why there should be a penal clause in relation to the Agricultural Credit Bank and no penal clause in relation to any other trading institution is something I cannot see.  As to the matter of deposits, I do not suppose that the Bank will pay deposits in exactly the <Col N="2070" /> same manner as the ordinary commercial banks, which pay deposits practically on demand.  I presume that the Agricultural Credit Bank will take deposits for stated periods, in the same manner as they will lend money for stated periods.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with the question of deposits.  It has been put down for the purpose of getting information rather than with a view to fulfilling any definite object.  I believe it is not right that the Credit Corporation should take deposits which would be payable on demand, but on the other hand, I think that a ten days' period is not sufficient.  Ten days' notice is almost tantamount to demand, and my idea of the type of deposits which this institution ought to get would be deposits payable on, perhaps, three months' notice.  An institution of this kind, lending money on a long term, cannot expect to have that money available on demand, and with a restriction of only ten days there is a possibility that in certain circumstances <Col N="2071" /> such a demand might come for the repayment of deposits at ten days' notice, that liquid assets would not be available for the repayment.  I want to get information in that regard, and if I am satisfied with the information I will withdraw the amendment.  I am not satisfied I think the best thing would also be to withdraw it, and put down an amendment for a later stage with a view to extending the period beyond ten days.  My idea is that ten days is not a sufficiently long time.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider this whole question of taking deposits.  Deposits do not seem to me to be necessary for the success of the Corporation.  This will give a good deal of trouble.  You will require to have a far more skilled expert staff to look after that part, it will add very much to the overhead charges, and it will at once set you in direct rivalry&mdash;at least so it seems to me&mdash; with the ordinary banks.  Again, I do not think you are likely to get deposits. The object of this clause is to get some ready money to be used for the purposes of this Credit Corporation, but I do not think you will be likely to get deposits.  From what I know of depositors in this country they are rather secretive.  They like to put their deposits away and hide them, and they would not be inclined to put them into a Corporation like this where they would imagine their deposits could be seen by many Government inspectors.  I think the chances of getting deposits are not very good, and there are several reasons, to my mind, why we should not receive them.  It complicates the work of the Credit Corporation, and means that you will have to establish a full banking staff.</P>

      <P>Arising on the section and the statement of Deputy Alton, I would urge that the Minister should not do what Deputy Alton advocates. I think this question of people having confidence and requiring secrecy in a banking system can be pressed too far. I, personally, would like if it were possible for us to develop a banking system in this country whereby people who are prepared to make deposits would be prepared, not alone to put them in a bank but to put them in a bank where they might be utilised for the progress and development of industry. If men up and down the country &mdash;farmers and others&mdash;have sufficient faith in the agricultural industry, and a sufficiently strong desire to see it developed, I do not think now that we are starting out to set up this new Corporation, that we should limit the activities of the Corporation and prevent them taking deposits from people who are prepared to lodge their money with them.  At the outset, the number of depositors, undoubtedly, would be few.  I would hope that this Corporation would do such good work, and would command such confidence from those who have a little safe money that they would be prepared to put in at least a share of the deposits in the Corporation. We have many people putting in banks money gathered from an industry which at the present time is in sore straits, and in great need, indeed, <Col N="2073" /> of ready money to assist it in its development, and I think it is regrettable that our people could not have more faith in their industry, and that even the banks have not had that outlook that would have made it possible for them to put some of the surplus funds which it has been possible to invest elsewhere into this industry here at home, particularly at a time when it requires it so much.</P>
      <P>Deputy Alton's case is that people will not utilise the machinery of the Agricultural Credit Corporation; they will not use the Corporation as a place to deposit money and that because of that the Minister should alter the section. If they are not prepared to use it, all right, there is no compulsion, there is no obligation on them.  But if they are prepared to use it why not let them put their money into that Corporation particularly when we know that the money that will be available for the Corporation is money to be utilised for the improvement of the agricultural industry?  I do not think Deputy Alton should press that point of view, and I would not like that the Minister should accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestHAlton" hpid="Mr. ALTON Mr. ALTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that people should not put their money into this Credit Corporation, and support it in every possible way, but I am pointing out that when you establish a receiving agency here you must have the machinery to take the deposits. You must have full banking machinery. On the other hand, I said, I do not think you would be likely to get deposits, because depositors like a certain amount of secrecy.  It is a human trait. I think it is common enough.  I do foresee that people will invest their money in this Credit Corporation. There are certificates of charge.  These certificates of charge, I assume, will take up a lot of money that now goes into deposits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephMacBride" hpid="Mr. McBRIDE Mr. McBRIDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McBRIDE</NameTxt>
      <P>The deposits given to a bank are really given on the reputation of the management of the bank.  I presume the management of this bank will be just as reputable as the management of any other bank. The bank will be in an impregnable position.  Its capital will be guaranteed by the Government.  It will be in <Col N="2074" /> a far better position than any other bank in Ireland.  I do not know how many millions of deposits are in the other banks at one per cent.  I presume the Agricultural Credit Bank will give an extra quarter or half per cent., as banks established on the same plans usually do.  I do not really see what is to prevent the bank getting its fair share of deposits.  Otherwise it will not be able to bring all the benefits to the country that it is expected to bring. I hope the Minister will not listen to Deputy Alton's representations.  As far as the extension of the notice is concerned, it is all against the depositor. The depositor may want money as quickly as possible.  If he goes into one of the banks or agencies of the Agricultural Credit Bank he cannot get his money when he wants it.  Certainly the extension of time would not be in favour of the client; it would be in favour of the bank undoubtedly.</P>

      <P>I dare say I am making a mistake, but I was fully expecting that there would be an amendment down by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, limiting the amount of these deposits, at any rate.  To my mind, this idea of the Credit Corporation taking deposits is based on a mistake.  It is not its business.  The deposit business is especially the business of the bank.  The issue of long-dated loans will operate seriously against the obviously desirable object of getting the banks and this Credit Corporation to co-operate on different lines.  As I said, I think this will tend to prevent co-operation.  I believe this giving of power to the Agricultural Credit Corporation to receive deposits is definitely against the Report of the Currency Commission.  It was specifically stated in that Report that this Credit Corporation was not to have that power.  In fact, I have reason to believe that there would have been much greater difficulty in getting the agreement of the bank representatives to that Report if that provision had not been inserted in the Currency Commission Report.  I strongly hope the Minister will reconsider this whole question.  I admit that it will be modified to a certain extent if the deposits <Col N="2075" /> are only deposits to be withdrawn after considerable notice.  Further, it will be modified if the amount of the deposits are limited.  But, in its present form, it seems to me to be wholly objectionable, and I hope that we shall have an important modification of the provision made before the Bill reaches the Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess that I do not understand Deputy Alton's point about secrecy.  I cannot see why the Agricultural Credit Corporation cannot take their deposits as the joint stock banks do.  I do not think that point is valid at all.  I think the control of this Agricultural Credit Corporation will be subject to the ordinary understanding with regard to secrecy, just the same as the joint stock bank. I would hope that that is to be the system by which it is going to be worked with regard to deposits or advances of any kind.  I would like to impress on the Minister not to pay any attention to the suggestion that has come from the Independent benches in regard to these deposits.  I think there is a great deal in what Deputy Baxter says, that in an agricultural country deposits which are coming from the agricultural population should, in part at least, be used for the betterment of that population. The banks at the present time are not making use of those deposits for the betterment of the larger portion of the community in this country. The deposits are being invested in outside countries.  I think we should try to change the outlook in that direction. I realise we cannot change it in a day or by an Act of Parliament, but there ought to be an agency to try and direct money which is deposited here by agriculturists to be used to a certain extent for the benefit of agriculturists.  The only competition that I can see that this Corporation would be up against would be the competition of the Post Office Savings Bank, and as regards the Post Office Savings Bank a large portion of the deposits, as far as I know, is being invested in outside securities, when it should be invested for the benefit of the community from which the deposits are drawn.  It has been recommended in other places that <Col N="2076" /> the Post Office deposits should be used, for instance, for the benefit of Agricultural Credit Societies.  I think there is something in that argument.  I do not foresee that there is going to be any real danger of a rush on this Corporation, or that it is going to be in serious competition with the ordinary banks. The period of notice will be extended, and I am willing to have it extended to a minimum of three months if necessary.</P>
      <P>That will mean that nobody will deposit money unless he is prepared to wait for three months to get it back after giving notice.  That would probably prevent any undue rush on the Corporation.  The Government guarantee does not apply to safeguarding deposits that might be regarded as involving a certain amount of risk.  I think that that element of risk, combined with the extended period of notice, will be a sufficient safeguard to ensure that there will be no very large amount of money turned into this form of deposit.  I think it is essential that an institution of this kind should have deposits from people in the country, as such an institution should not be regarded purely as a Government one.  It will, I suppose, be a fact that the investments in the capital of the Company and in the share-certificates will not be by agriculturists, but the opportunity which will be given to farmers to place money on deposit will induce them to take an interest in the bank and make them regard it as one of their own institutions.  They will not regard it as purely a Government institution for giving relief, but they will look upon it as an agricultural institution established for the benefit of farmers by way of reasonable interest on deposits and the giving of credit on long terms to those worthy of credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Second Reading of this Bill I have had several discussions with the Minister for Agriculture in regard to this matter, both in regard to the length of notice that should be prescribed and the limitation of the amount of deposits.  As a result of further discussion and examination we are inclined to think that it is wrong to accept deposits from <Col N="2077" /> individuals, and that it would be better to bring the Bill back into conformity with the recommendations of the Banking Commission.  We believe that the Corporation will enjoy confidence and will do its business as well, and with as much secrecy, as any bank, and would ultimately get a certain amount of deposits, but it will be doing business that should not be financed by money on deposit.  Deputy McBride came to the kernel of the matter when he said that the extension of the period of notice was really against the customer and in favour of the bank.  I doubt whether the bank could get any substantial sum on deposit if it required absolutely as much as one month's, and, in certain circumstances, three months' notice.  As a general rule when people deposit money, subject to three months' notice, they get it back without sacrifice of interest.  A Corporation such as this, to get in substantial sums of money, would require to arrange that people could get their money out without sacrifice of interest. That would mean that the Corporation would have to be ready to pay substantial sums at short notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it did not get the concessions in this Bill, and if it stood by the position that the prescribed notice should be given, then the sum which it would obtain would be much less, and no gain would accrue because there would be expense in working the deposit business. The only object in having a deposit business would be simply to give the Corporation money at a cheaper rate than it could get by issuing certificates of charge.  If the amount was small, the profit would disappear in the overhead expenses.  On the other hand, if the concessions given by other banks were given, and if people were allowed to take out money almost at call without the sacrifice of interest, the position would be that the Corporation would be trying to give long-term loans with money which it had not at its disposal for the same period as that at which it was lent.  I had a certain amount of experience in dealing with a business that was not really liquid banking business, and dealing with it by means of deposits.  I was a director of the National Land Bank, which was <Col N="2078" /> smaller than this institution ultimately will be, and I know it was a cause of constant anxiety to the directors that they had their money in something that was not liquid, and there was a danger that big calls might be made on them for cash at any time.  We were not able to use the money on deposit for good business, because we were afraid that some day, if we went further than we had gone in lending it in various ways in which we could not get it back quickly, we would have to close our doors, although the bank was quite solvent.</P>
    <P>The general conclusion which the Minister for Agriculture and I came to was that it would be no advantage to the Corporation to have deposits from individuals.  We would propose to accept deposits from co-operative societies, but the amount of that money would be comparatively small, and they would be people with whom the Corporation would be dealing every day. Deputy Baxter is right when he says that it is desirable to get the money saved by agriculturists back into agriculture, but the right form in which to get that back is in certificates of charge.  We are loosening up the provisions of this Bill in regard to certificates of charge.  In the Bill, as originally drafted, they could be only issued on first mortgages of land, but we are going to allow them now to be issued against other approved securities. There will be a much more rapid and more extensive issue of certificates of charge than if we allowed them to be issued only in regard to first mortgages in land.  The man who could afford to put money on deposit for a considerable period and who would only require that money back after giving long notice can be induced in many cases to purchase certificates of charge which will bear the Government guarantee, and which will be marketable. They should, in fact, be as marketable as National Loan.  They will bear the Government guarantee for the same rate of interest.  There will be no doubt that the dividend will be paid and that they will be redeemable.</P>
    <P>People, particularly agriculturists, should not deposit money and try to have the Corporation carry on an unsatisfactory <Col N="2079" /> business, but big efforts should be made to get them to purchase certificates of charge and make them realise that in this way they could get their money back as easily as if they had to give thirty days or two months' notice.  The amendment to which I am referring will be proposed on Report, and the Minister for Agriculture will, I hope, be here then to discuss it.  We are not proposing that amendment because we think there would be no deposits or that there would be no reason for confidence in the Corporation, but simply because we fear that it would lead the Corporation into the sort of difficulties which the banks are in.  People blame the banks. I do not say whether they are right or wrong for not giving money for long-term loans, money that they might be called on to pay at any time.  It would be almost impossible to get any real advantage in the way of cheap money owing to the difficulties which would be involved.  A bank could not be expected to lend money on long terms when it has that money only for short terms.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister is arguing the case of deposits as though it were an obligation on the Corporation to accept them.  That is not the position.  The section deals with the Memoranda of Association, which, if this section were allowed to remain, would empower the Corporation to accept deposits, but it does not impose on them an obligation to accept them, and they may well rule out of their ordinary business the receipt of deposits. If the Minister, with his nominees, and the bank, with their nominees, on the Board consider that it will hinder their development or elasticity they will not undertake the receipt of deposits, but are we wise in prohibiting it?  That is, in effect, what the Minister proposes. If the Articles of the Association do not allow receipt of deposits, then it is practically prohibited and I think that is unnecessarily stringent.  The Minister is arguing in favour of making it absolutely prohibitive to receive deposits. If a public body or a wealthy friend wanted to lend money to tide <Col N="2080" /> over a difficulty it might be done by way of deposit and we should not prohibit it.</P>

      <P>The Corporation, if looked on as a business institution, might benefit by receipt of deposits. If it took deposits and purchased, say British War Loan, or some such investment, it might be a very good operation, but the receipt of deposits for the purposes of this Corporation seem to us not to be likely to confer any benefit at all and, if that be so, it seems to us to be better to draw the line.  There is an arrangement in the Bill by which it can get money for temporary needs by the issue of debentures.  If, for some temporary reason, the Corporation needs money it can get it in the way in which joint stock banks can ordinarily get it, but deposits are another matter and they are not a means by which temporary difficulties can be covered.  I do not know whether we should argue the matter at great length as, in my view, it could be argued more satisfactorily on Report when the proposed amendment will be before the Dáil.</P>

      <P>What is forgotten with regard to deposits is this: When a farmer has money to spare he places it in the bank; he would not buy these charge notes that are to be issued because he would consider them too inconstant, and he would lose his money. He would put his money in the bank for a definite object, and perhaps he would need to withdraw it in six months' time.  He would not buy charge certificates because of the likelihood of diminution in value.  He is not a gambler in that respect.  The Minister should take cognisance of that.  I have met people in the country who would not take money out of the bank to put it into the National Loan, although they are only getting 2½ per cent. on the bank deposits.  They will consider charge certificates a fluctuating item, and they will not take the money out to buy them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2082" /> The Articles of Association of the Corporation shall immediately on issue be laid on the Tables of the Oireachtas and if within twenty-one days on which each House has sat a resolution is passed by either House disagreeing with the Articles of Association said Articles shall accordingly be annulled.</P>
    <P>This amendment is simply a precautionary amendment.  The idea is that the members of the Dáil should have an opportunity of examining the Articles of Association and satisfy themselves that they are in accordance with the Act.  I do not want to press the amendment.  There is really no great benefit to be gained by it.  If the Minister will show it is unnecessary in practice, I am prepared to withdraw it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Articles of Association are not in accordance with the Act, the courts are there and it is their function to see that the proceedings of the Corporation are strictly within the law.  I do not see any necessity for laying the Articles of Association on the Tables of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a special point in connection with it.  The amendment provides that the Articles of Association shall be laid on the Tables of the Oireachtas and if, within twenty-one days on which each House has sat a resolution is passed by either House disagreeing with the Articles of Association, said Articles shall accordingly be annulled.  Let us assume the Dáil reassembles in July and rises in September, or at the end of August.  As regards preparing the Articles of Association and doing the initial work, I doubt if it could be done in a month or even six weeks.  It is more than likely you will not have twenty-one sitting days before the Dáil rises again.  The Dáil, in the ordinary course, may not sit again until November or December, and it will be, perhaps, two months before you have twenty-one sitting days of the Seanad. It could very easily happen that the Articles of Association would not be released, with the best will in the world, until February or March.  After that the Corporation would have to be organised, shares issued and capital obtained. That would take a few months <Col N="2083" /> more.  This is not an argument directed directly to the merits of the amendment, but this amendment might mean that you could very easily delay the establishment of the Corporation for nearly a year, and I do not think anybody wants that.  I do not see any likelihood of danger.  The courts are there to ensure that the law shall be kept.  I ask the Dáil not to pass the amendment and I ask the Deputy not to insist on it.</P>

That is what I do not want to do.  I would like to see the Corporation established as soon as possible.  If necessary, I would be willing to change the number of days in the amendment to seven. On the whole, I am satisfied with the Minister's statement, and I desire to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>In line 59, after the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;with the sanction of the Dáil.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is on all fours with amendments which were before the House in connection with the Electricity (Supply) Bill with regard to the directors of the Board of Control. The principle in that case was pretty <Col N="2084" /> well argued.  My intention is to guard, if we can guard, against anything in the nature of political control of these institutions.  Since I put down the amendment I have been reading the discussions which took place in reference to the directors of the Board of Control connected with the Electricity (Supply) Bill.  The arguments there set out show me there are great difficulties in the way of the idea that underlies my amendment.  The difficulties are almost insuperable.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the contingency I want to guard against can be guarded against.  If the Minister will make a suggestion which will meet my point, I am willing to consider it.  It is possible under the Bill that the Government, through the Minister for Finance, can have a majority representation on the Board of Directors.  In such a case this institution would become a Government institution; its directors would be nominated by the Minister and there seems to be a possibility that you may have men appointed on this Board because of political reasons, and for political purposes.  We want to ensure that this Corporation shall not, in any way, be run as a political institution.  We want to see that members of the Farmers' Union will get loans just as well as members of the Cumann na nGaedheal. Perhaps that is an extreme way of putting it, but the amendment is mainly directed to guard against any possibility of political influence, and to ensure that we shall have the names of the directors placed before us for examination before their appointments are sanctioned.  I know it is an extremely difficult matter to carry out.  It is almost impossible for the Dáil to examine the qualifications and credentials of particular individuals.  If there is any kind of safeguard which the Minister can suggest, I would be glad to hear it.</P>

I suggest to the Dáil the proper Minister to appoint for the purpose of this Bill is the Minister for Finance.  If the Minister for Finance is not capable of performing efficiently and properly that executive act he is not fit to be Minister for Finance.  There is no way out of that, I am afraid.  The arguments used by the Deputy could be used in respect of every other executive act performed by every other Minister.  In fact, you have no security against arbitrary acts of a Minister except the power the Dáil has, such as it is, of nominating and approving and appointing Ministers.</P>

      <P>If my memory serves me aright, I think Deputy Johnson argued somewhat on these lines when dealing with the Fifth Stage of the Electricity (Supply) Bill: if the Board of Directors on this Corporation are not acting as we think they ought to act, our only remedy is to try to put out the Government.  That is, we have to take some action here which, if approved, will have the effect of being a vote of censure on a particular Minister, and thereby we shall put the Government out of power.  That would be a very big thing to do for the purpose of achieving one comparatively small end.  In practical politics it is not possible; it is all very well in theory.  Unless there was some actual corrupt practice I do not see how it would be possible.  Ministers do a lot of other things besides looking after the appointment of directors. Although a Minister might be to blame in connection with the appointment of a director, it would be a very difficult thing to undertake putting a Government out of power simply because of&mdash;I will not say a misdeameanour&mdash;a Minister being guilty <Col N="2086" /> of something.

The task of administration is left to the Ministry, and it is the business of the Dáil to criticise the Ministry for their administrative acts, and dispense with them, were we in a position to do so, out of dissatisfaction, but that we ought not to take on ourselves the duty of making appointments of an administrative kind.</P>

This Corporation will undoubtedly have to deal with farmers and with the business of farming, and, therefore, there is a very practical side to this question of the appointment of the directors.  I am not going to attempt to define the qualifications necessary for some of the men who may be appointed as directors on this Corporation, but I feel that it is absolutely essential, if the business of the Corporation is to be well done and if the Corporation is to be helpful to the farmers, as we hope it will be, to have on it men who have other qualifications than those of being very good bankers in theory and in practice.  I think that the men appointed must have an understanding of agriculture, and I am afraid you are not going to get men of that type out of our banking institutions at the moment.</P>

The Minister for Finance will have the appointment, and if he were to ask me what he should do I should certainly suggest that he should appoint directors who would have a special knowledge of agriculture and of agriculture credit.  That presumes a certain amount of special knowledge of agriculture generally.

      <P>It is in regard to the restriction that there is a real danger.  The Minister can restrict as to the persons to whom advances are to be made, and can restrict in regard to the purpose for which advances are to be made.  I do not think we should give this power to the Minister.  If the Minister wants to apply restrictions in the matter of advancing money under the Bill, I suggest the proper course to pursue would be to come to the House and get the powers to restrict.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>My view is that this amendment is in the same position as amendment 4, which provides for the Articles of Association.  The Articles of Association will set out in detail the objects for which money may be <Col N="2092" /> lent, the persons who may get a loan and so on.  Under the Act the Minister responsible is free to go to the extreme limits allowed him by the Act, and on the other hand he can refuse to avail of the powers conferred on him by the Act.  In other words, he gets a discretion. I think it is only right that he should have that discretion, because this is experimental.  Certain powers are conferred on the Minister and on the Corporation.  At the beginning they may decide that it is safer, in the drafting of the Articles of Association, not to include all the powers which they might have within the Act.  They will see how that will work, and then, if they think well of it, can extend the Articles of Association gradually to the full limits allowed under the Act.  I think that course merely indicates common sense and ordinary caution.  I see no objection to the Articles of Association, as originally drafted, restricting the Corporation to lesser functions than the maximum functions they may exercise.  In fact, without doing it deliberately&mdash;I do not suppose it would be done deliberately&mdash;it would be impossible for the Articles of Association to cover every power that the Corporation may have under the Act, because in fact new opportunities for exercising powers will only show themselves gradually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As agriculture develops, as other services come in, and as new forms of organisation come in, there will be new opportunities which the Corporation may, and can, avail of well within the Act, so that even if the Corporation wished, if the person who prepares the Articles of Association wished, it would be quite impossible at the beginning to draft Articles of Association that would cover every contingency and every case in respect of which the Corporation would be entitled to deal under the Act, so that there is bound to be an extension.  It is almost certain that there will be a certain number of restrictions in the first Articles of Association, but there is likely to be an extension of that afterwards as new opportunities for making loans and making credits evidence themselves. The Dáil has agreed that the original Articles of Association should not be laid before the House.  Therefore, I <Col N="2093" /> suggest it would be an extraordinary and an illogical thing to say that whenever there is an extension within the Act that it should be laid before the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement opens up an aspect of this question that has not been revealed in anything said previously on the Bill.  May I call attention to sub-section (1) of Section 10, which states: &ldquo;The Articles of Association of the Corporation shall be in such form consistent with the provisions of this Act as shall be approved by the Minister and the Minister for Lands and Agriculture.&rdquo; I would now ask Deputies to turn to sub-section (2) of Section 12, with which we are dealing.  The sub-section reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Corporation shall also be so framed and expressed that the persons to whom and the purposes for which the Corporation shall be entitled and authorised to lend or advance money as stated in such Memorandum and Articles in pursuance of this section may be varied (whether by extension, restriction, or otherwise) from time to time by the Minister and the Minister for Lands and Agriculture at their joint discretion by orders made by them jointly, but so that such persons and purposes shall not by any such order be extended so as to include&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>and so on.  Section 10 lays it down clearly and explicitly that the Articles of Association shall be consistent with the provisions of the Act.  We are accepting the Bill as it is, and for what we hope it will bring.  The Articles which may be drafted may be of such a restrictive character that it will not be possible for the Corporation to do what we are giving them power to do in the Bill.  We are not going to agree to that.  If the Minister tries to make the case that sub-section (2) of Section 12 is on all-fours with the amendment, I submit he is not correct.  If it is necessary that the Articles should be drawn in such a way that it would not be possible for the Corporation to do what we feel they are entitled to do <Col N="2094" /> under the Bill, it is not extraordinary to ask that the Articles should be laid on the Table of the House for 21 days so as to let the Dáil know that this Corporation is not going to do everything that the Dáil thought it was going to do.  If it is a question of extending the list of things that the Corporation may do&mdash;that is a different thing.  We think that a great deal of good can be done if the Bill is administered as it is, even without further extension.  We recognise that the operations of the Corporation may indicate the necessity for an extension of powers in certain directions.  We are prepared to concede that much.  But if we pass this Bill and the Minister is going to draft Articles of Association which will not make it possible for the Corporation to do all the things that we thought they were going to do when passing the Bill a good deal of the merits of the Bill will be taken away. If it is felt by people who are optimistic about what this Bill will do for them that the Minister is going to draft Articles of Association, so that it is going to be an entirely different thing, a great part of the value of the Bill will be taken away.  The least we can ask is that the Minister will accept the amendment and agree if there is to be restriction in the Articles of Association&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My answer to that is that at present we are not asking more, and I would be loath to press for more than is contained in the Bill. What we are asking is that we should get what is contained in the Bill and that the Minister should not take power to take away what is written in the Bill.  There is no point in the remark that extension is the same as restriction&mdash;it is nothing of the kind. What we fear is too much restriction. I have no delusions about the fact that hundreds of people will be disappointed <Col N="2095" /> as to the credit facilities they expect to secure under the Bill.  I am satisfied that hundreds of people will not get the credit facilities they expect under the administration of the Act.

I am not an expert in company law, but I presume that the person who has the duty of preparing the Memorandum and Articles of Association will have to take Section 9 and Section 12. He will have to amplify (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of Section 9.  Then he will come on to Section 12 and will take, say, sub-section (1) (b)&mdash;just to take one sub-section.  I presume he will insert that word for word in the Articles of Association.  On the other hand, it may be that there will be more detail in the Articles.  They may attempt to define the requisites of agricultural production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing, as it may well have to be, that the Articles of Association attempted to schedule the requisites of agricultural production. If each member of the Farmers' Party here at present attempted to make a list of the requisites of agricultural production they would produce nine different lists, and there might be still other requisites.  There might, for instance, be further developments in agriculture that would require new and unforeseen requisites&mdash;raw materials&mdash;and consequently the Articles of Association would have to be extended to meet that.  Equally the Articles of Association ought to deal. <Col N="2096" /> as I said, with Section 9, paragraph (e) of which states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To do all such things as may be incidental or ancillary to the due performance of all or any of the functions hereinbefore mentioned.</P>
      <P>I presume they will have to invest money temporarily, and that there will have to be some discussion as to what sort of investments money should be placed in, what powers of investment they may have, and that some decision will have to be come to on that matter. It may be as a result of the working of the Corporation, that they will find that different powers should be given to them in regard to the investment of money.  I am just taking that one sub-section so as not to go through all the rest.  There is no possibility that any Articles of Association would foresee every possible contingency.  It is absolutely certain, and was always contemplated, that the Articles would be extended according as the needs for extension showed themselves.  The first Articles of Association will ultimately, as agriculture develops, require extension on the banking side&mdash;small extension perhaps.  There may be financial arrangements that I do not understand &mdash;purely banking matters&mdash;that are not exactly as they should be.  Powers to invest money, provisions in regard to securities against certificates, all of which will be in the Articles of Association, may have to be extended or changed or adapted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to correct the Minister.  My interpretation of this is, that what may appear to be full and complete in the Articles of Association in the beginning will, as development takes place be shown not to be full and complete.  But one need not conclude then that the first Articles of Association will not be complete.  I hope they will be complete, so far as we can see it is necessary to have them complete, to deal with the conditions existing at present.  I recognise that there must be extensions later, owing to possible developments.  What I fear is restriction even on the work that the Corporation can do immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The person who drafts the Articles will have to make them adequate to the needs of the moment. The whole point is, whether they will require extension afterwards&mdash;extension not only as to the objects for which money will be lent, but extension and adaptation so far as financial provisions under Section 9 are concerned.  Deputy Johnson raised the point that there may be restrictions afterwards&mdash;that the powers may be taken under the Articles <Col N="2098" /> of Association and surrendered later on by additional Articles of Association. That might very well be.  For instance, I would say that it ought to be the point of view of the Dáil that the Minister for Finance, who will be guaranteeing all the certificates, and who stands to lose every thing in the long run, should have the power at least to say, in a situation that we cannot foresee now, and that may arise five or ten years hence, that for the present there will be no more loans of a special kind made.  I cannot see anything wrong in that.  If he does, it is known at once.  First of all, the Articles of Association can be obtained by anybody.  Secondly, it will immediately affect some section of the public. It will get to be known immediately, and can be debated in the Dáil in all its moods and tenses.  There is no question of secrecy, about it.  If it is of any importance, it will affect the interests of somebody.  If that somebody, or that class to which that person belongs, thinks that they have a real grievance, or that the Minister is acting unjustly, it will get to the Dáil very quickly.  The Memorandum and Articles of Association as restricted or extended, can be got, and the whole thing can be debated here.  But this is a restriction in regard to the objects for which a loan may be made.  I cannot at the moment outline the actual details with regard to loans that might be restricted later, and I cannot draw a picture of the conditions which would make it necessary to restrict some form of loan.  But it might very well be that it would become necessary in the future.  But there will be restrictions possibly in the administrative and the financial side of the Corporation.  It may be that some provisions with regard to the investment of money or the management of securities, the management of the pool, and so on, would have to be set out, and if the Articles of Association were too wide, the Minister might very well feel that he should restrict these powers and confine investment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Articles of Association will deal with restrictions of all kinds, restrictions on lending, and so on, and one affects the other.  If you have restrictions on investments they may react on lending, and you cannot draw a distinction between them.  On these two points it is clear that there must be power to extend the Articles of Association.  Equally it is clear, in my opinion, that there must be power to restrict them, and there is no argument that I can see for laying on the Table of the House extended or restricted Articles of Association that would not apply with more force to laying on the Table the original Memorandum and Articles of Association.  Deputy Baxter made a long speech which really meant this: &ldquo;The cat is out of the bag.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what it seemed to come to.  He did not put it that way, but we have now discovered that it is the intention to restrict the powers which we are giving the Minister and really to starve the Corporation.  That is not the intention, and a provision enabling the Minister either to restrict or extend the Articles of Association is no evidence of such an intention.  The Deputy ought not to assume that because an ordinary business precaution is taken it is an indication that it is to some extent camouflage and that some of the most important functions of the Corporation are to be cut away immediately by limiting the Articles of Association. There is no such intention.  This right to restrict and to extend the Articles of Association is a right which is dictated by commonsense, and, undoubtedly, the Minister for Finance should have such a right.  It is in details that he will exercise it, and I am sure that there will be ample opportunity for exercising it.  It is to a certain extent tentative.  But there is no argument I can see for placing extended Articles of Association on the Table of the House that would not <Col N="2100" /> apply with greater force to the original Memorandum and Articles of Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the position has been made quite clear; certainly it has not been made quite satisfactory.  Any Articles of Association that may be made must be consistent with the provisions of this Act, but the Articles of Association which are first made may be as wide as the provisions of Sections 9, 10, 11 and 12.  Let us assume that as a possibility.  Then it is provided that the two Ministers may from time to time restrict those Articles by order.  I think that there are provisions in the Companies Acts that require certain procedure&mdash;public notice&mdash;before Articles of Association can be altered.  I do not know what the provisions are, but I am pretty confident that something of that kind is in existence.  The proposition of Deputy Heffernan seems to me equivalent to that public notice of the alteration of the Articles of Association.  If no such provision is inserted it means that the powers which are restricted in respect of the Companies Acts regarding Articles of Association are abrogated and that all the powers for altering these Articles are left to the two Ministers. The remedy, if any remedy is required, lies with criticism in this House of the action of the Ministers after the thing is done.  I do not think that that is quite sufficient.  I think that before the change is made there ought to be some public notice, that the change should not take place suddenly under an arbitrary act of this Corporation any more than in respect of a public company, which has to give notice before its Articles of Association are changed.  Whether the particular method here is satisfactory or not I am not caring, but it does seem to me that some publicity is required before the Articles of Association are changed, and that the mere fiat of the two Ministers is not sufficient, because in effect that gives them power to modify the law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite satisfied as to the variations between the Minister and ourselves.  This is a question of policy in the management of the affairs of the bank.  For example, if in <Col N="2101" /> the course of the operations of the bank too much money has been lent for land speculation and that this would eventually raise the price of land unjustly, it would perhaps be the function of the Minister to say to the directors: &ldquo;Do not give so much on land. Try to divert money into some other channel.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore I do not know what the Minister really wants.  Section 10 gives the Minister power to draw Articles so long as these are inside the Act.  If the Minister and the Minister for Finance agree, then those will be the Articles of Association in the beginning. It says definitely &ldquo;shall be in such form as shall be approved by the Minister and the Minister for Lands and Agriculture,&rdquo; so long as they are consistent with the Act.  That means that the initial Articles of Association may be very much restricted compared with what the Bill would give them. In that case it might be necessary to give them the power to extend, and I think that there might be a case for restrictions if, in the course of time, it was found that things were not going right with the Corporation.  That is the meaning I take out of the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that it is scarcely fair to admit &ldquo;extension&rdquo; and to refuse &ldquo;restriction,&rdquo; and the fact that an order shall be laid on the Table is not so much of a safeguard as it looks. After all, the Minister for Lands and Agriculture and the Minister for Finance must make this order.  It is something that will come about, not from a particular conception of the needs of one department only but of two.  It could reasonably happen that a restriction <Col N="2102" /> was made necessary in the interests of the community itself, if a certain abuse were to creep in, and it is only when the Minister for Lands and Agriculture would agree with the Minister for Finance that a restriction of the sort would lie.  Picture for a moment how this might be taken if there was no power to restrict and only power to extend.  Obviously there is a limitation there.  It would be an extraordinary limitation if no power whatever was given to restrict, no matter what abuse might exist, or what bad investment were made, or anything of that sort that might happen.  It is obviously a necessity to have a restriction if power be taken for an extension, and as far as laying on the Table of the House is concerned it appears to me that that is an elaborate ornamentation in our procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson used the argument that this might have the effect of abrogating the procedure under the Companies Acts, and I think that is possible, in connection with publicity with regard to a change in <Col N="2103" /> the Articles of Association.  But I am rather suspicious of this section because of the very strong case that the Minister, backed up by the President, has made for the retention of the section in its present form.  I am simply asking that any change, whether by way of extension or restriction, shall be laid on the Table for twenty-one days.</P>
      <P>That is not asking for unreasonable publicity.  Restrictions or extensions can be made, but they must be laid on the Table of the House.  That is all we are asking.  The Minister has endeavoured to throw a smoke screen over the thing, because this is only endeavouring to give power to restrict or extend the purposes for which money will be lent; it does not deal with investments or matters of that kind.  I think it is an elementary precaution. I would accept the section if &ldquo;restriction&rdquo; were eliminated and the section were drafted to allow &ldquo;extension&rdquo; to exist, because I say there is a big difference between &ldquo;extension&rdquo; and &ldquo;restriction.&rdquo; They are opposite in meaning. &ldquo;Extension&rdquo; means that they can be extended within the Act, but they cannot go one inch beyond the Act, but &ldquo;restriction&rdquo; means that in practice the Minister, if he so desires, can restrict and restrict until there is practically no Act left, and still it will be within the Act.  He can restrict the Corporation so as only to lend money for one purpose.  We will take good care that that will not happen, but, nevertheless, I maintain that there is no necessity for the retention of this word &ldquo;restriction&rdquo; at all.  In practice, the directors will have power to lend money for any purpose within the Act. They cannot be forced by anybody to lend to anybody if he is considered unsuitable or if the loan be considered bad from the credit point of view.  In actual practice they will have power to restrict credit as much as they like. But we do not want to give the Minister power to whittle down the Act, so as to govern the directors in respect of the powers they have.</P>

      <P>As I understand the Deputy's objection now, it is to the word &ldquo;restriction.&rdquo;  My objection to the Deputy's point is this: I like <Col N="2104" /> some sort of uniformity.  The Articles of Association are not to be laid on the Table of the House.  Now if there is to be any restriction, as set out in sub-section (2), that is to be laid on the Table of the House.  Why?  In order to give the House an opportunity of debating it.  That is simply a debating reason.  If there was any serious restriction at all, that fact would become known in the country.  The Deputy knows very well that the question would be raised in the Dáil at once and. the whole question would be thrashed out as effectively as if the Articles were on the Table.  Yet, that is the reason put forward for laying the extended Articles of Association&mdash;or the restricted Articles of Association, if you like &mdash;on the Table, when, apparently, there is no good reason for laying the original Articles of Association, which are much more important, on the Table.  I do like a little uniformity, and I think it is illogical to place the amended Articles of Association on the Table if you do not make the same provision for the original Articles.</P>
      <P>I particularly object to the Deputy's proposal when arguments are used in its favour which are unsound.  One argument used was that the functions of the Corporation might be so seriously restricted that in the end it would practically disappear.  The Deputy knows that the first sign of serious restriction would be seen at once by the people of the country and particularly by the interested section, that the question would be raised here and that the whole matter would be debated.  If the Deputy's real objection is to the word &ldquo;restriction,&rdquo; he can allow the matter to stand over until Report, and we can then go into it further, but I cannot give any undertaking in regard to it.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (3) (a), lines 60-61. to delete the words &ldquo;or other requisites of agricultural production or marketing.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe these words should be deleted, as they are open to very wide <Col N="2106" /> interpretation.  They might, in fact, be taken to include practically everything used in agriculture.  They might be taken to include such things as cans, pots, kettles and dishes, and other things being sold at present by some of these societies.  If these words are not deleted, these societies may continue, in my opinion, to sell these articles hereafter.  The Dáil, in coming to the relief of a large and important section of the community, should take care that it does not jeopardise the interests of a section of the community just as large and just as important.  I think the main purpose of the Bill is sufficiently safeguarded in the remaining portion of the sub-section, and that we should take these words out.  The words used are too loose and are open to too wide an interpretation.  The Minister and Deputies know perfectly well that the traders in our important towns who deal in these agricultural goods and commodities have a certain fear in regard to this provision.  I think their fear is perfectly legitimate.  Societies which will get money on exceptionally favourable terms under this Bill will be in a better position to compete than the trader who has to stand on his own feet.  The competition would not be equal, and I think the Minister should amend this section so as to remove any legitimate fear which the traders have at the moment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention of this amendment is to safeguard certain co-operative supply associations which are engaged in supplying the requisites of agricultural production&mdash;agricultural machines and other articles.  These articles may not be defined as necessary for agricultural production.  Deputy Hennessy, in dealing with his amendment, mentioned <Col N="2107" /> some articles which are sold by these associations.</P>
    <P>I would not stand against restriction on credit societies which are not engaged in the supply of the requisites of agricultural production if these societies stood alone.  But we find that the accounts of societies attached to creameries are not kept separate.  The creamery accounts and the supply accounts go into a common till.  The effect of the Bill, as it stands, would be that where a loan was made to such a co-operative society it would have to conduct its two forms of activity separately and have a separate system of accounting.  In practice, this provision would restrict to a great extent the credit which can be given under the Bill, and it would not enable the purpose intended by the Bill to be fulfilled.</P>

      <P>There is no co-operative store which deals solely with agricultural requisites.  They always take in household effects.  In the case of creameries having co-operative stores, the manufacturing side is the losing side, and the distributing side is the prop of the creamery.  That is owing to the fact that the supply of milk to the creamery is not economic, and that the overhead charges are heavy.  Under the Bill at present, a creamery having a co-operative store and selling flour, tea or sugar would be debarred from any benefit.  There has been a good deal of talk about unfair competition with traders.  I think that there is a good deal of illusion in that regard.  In the country, the co-operative stores have to employ paid hands, whereas private traders have the benefit of the service of their own families.  I do not see that the competition of these societies is unfair, because, by using the labour of their own families, private traders should be able <Col N="2108" /> to sell more cheaply than the stores.  I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not know exactly what is the way out in this. There is a difficulty here, undoubtedly. I, to some extent, question the possibility of doing everything we would like to do in this Bill.  At the same time you have a number of co-operative societies&mdash;as Deputy Hogan says, distribution societies&mdash;attached to co-operative creameries and doing business in agricultural requisites.  The Bill is going to act unfairly if the whole concern cannot get a loan, because a certain type of business is being done in the same institution, business perhaps that would be a very small proportion of its total business.  Nevertheless, because a trifling business is being done, they are not entitled under this Bill to obtain a loan.  There are difficulties on both sides.  I wonder whether the Minister can do anything to find a way out of the difficulty, because it is going to create a considerable amount of dissatisfaction.  We have up and down the country many societies.  Perhaps the percentage of their business, outside dealing with requisites of agricultural production or manufacturing agricultural products, would not be more than ten or fifteen.  In a case like that, what is to be done under this Bill?  I think the Minister will require to meet that case somehow.</P>

I think that a co-operative society which merely goes in for retailing business, without helping the farmer in any way in the matter of marketing his produce, is not worthy of very much consideration.  I know that in my county there have been three or four co-operative societies which were forced to put up their shutters.  There are two or three working yet.  Probably they are under better management, <Col N="2110" /> or it may be due to the fact that they turned their attention to other matters than selling tea and sugar and that sort of thing.</P>

Amongst the people who deal with that society for other things are some who do not raise eggs, or may require eggs for home use and, as a matter of ordinary convenience, eggs are supplied to them on a retail basis. If a society did such a thing as that they would be precluded from getting any benefit.  I think the objects of the Minister would be covered if it spoke of the main business of the society being retail.</P>

      <P>Everything but clothing and furniture, and do very little else.  I think the Minister, on the last occasion, pointed out, or somebody pointed out, that the purpose of this was to prevent retail trading.  If it is intended that this should be a prohibition of any retail trading in foodstuffs I think it is an undue restriction and should not be allowed to remain in the Bill.  I think there should be some way whereby a society whose main business is not selling by retail, but which incidentally does retail business, should be still free to get these loans or advances. I would point out, too, that there is a distinct economy for the farmer if he is able to get in the one place <Col N="2111" /> the goods for his home use.  If the farmer has to go to the society, the creamery or the agricultural store with certain goods for the purpose of his business, but has to go to the town, perhaps ten miles further, to buy the household commodities there is a distinct loss in the agricultural economy. There is a waste of time.  I have an idea that the Minister is convinced that one of the defects of the economy of agriculture is that there is too much time wasted in the town.  This is going to force the farmer to go to the town oftener than he otherwise would need to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The present position. as far as I know, is that there are four or five hundred co-operative creameries in the country.  Only a small proportion of them do any business other than creamery business, and of that small proportion only a proportion do business other than in raw materials of agriculture.  So the position with regard to the creameries is this.  Only a very small proportion of the total have stores attached to them which deal in the necessaries of life.  I think we would not be far wrong if we put it that 75 per cent. of the creameries have no stores of any kind attached to them. Deputies of the South will probably make a better case, but I think I am not far wrong.  Of the remaining twenty-five per cent. a big proportion deal in the requisites of agriculture. and the remainder deal in the raw materials of agriculture plus the necessaries of life.  So that the Bill covers a very big number of the creameries of the country, whether they be creameries simpliciter or creameries with stores attached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to these retail stores, they are the most unsatisfactory end of co-operation, and always have been, and the really bad creamery is a creamery that is mainly depending on its retail <Col N="2112" /> store.  A creamery that is dependent to any great extent on its retail store is in a very bad position indeed.  You will always find that it is the most slovenly creamery in every sense of the word.  The accounts are not kept separately.  There are all sorts of mixing up between the accounts of the store and the accounts of the creamery. The manager has specialised in everything, and, consequently, has specialised in nothing.  He is hopping from one place to another, and there is considerable confusion.  That has been the normal condition of a very big proportion of the creameries that run retail stores.</P>
    <P>With regard to retail stores which are not attached to creameries at all, they have not been an outstanding success either.  There have been some of them successful, but only a small proportion.  The balance always have been the biggest proportion.  They have always been in a very bad and very shaky condition.  What people forget, dealing with this question, is that it requires a very big degree of special knowledge to run a retail store. Anybody who believes that a retail store can be started and run successfully, in a big way, without a considerable amount of technical skill and special knowledge, is making a big mistake, and that is the mistake that has resulted in the present situation where you have such a very large proportion of the existing retail stores in a very shaky financial condition.  When you think back to the development of cooperation in this country, you had first the co-operative creamery and then the co-operative store.  You have two or three small co-operative creameries in an area that should be served by one. I developed this subject at some length on the vote for the purchase of the premises of the Condensed Milk Company, but I would like to remind Deputies that I showed there that the farmers of the country were to blame. They had certain advantages in other countries which they had not here, but whether these advantages are there or not, let us look at what did happen. You had small co-operative creameries &mdash;two or three organised in an area that should be served by one&mdash;competing <Col N="2113" /> against each other, doing things in a small way, improperly financed, improperly organised, no real efficiency in a great number of them, no real efficiency in the carrying on of the ordinary work of the creamery&mdash;buttermaking&mdash;and no proper supervision of accounts, no real system from beginning to end.  Then the suppliers split up and other creameries were formed.  All this cost money.  They diffused themselves all over the place. Generally they manage to carry on with the greatest difficulty, and they are never in anything like a strong position.</P>
    <P>If there were any sort of proper development during that time, the creameries would have been properly organised, and there would be a sufficient supply of milk.  Large, instead of small, creameries would have been established.  Proper machinery could have been installed.  The places could have been better kept.  The accounts could have been better kept. All that would have resulted in a much more prosperous trade.  The question of marketing clamoured for solution for years.  Every creamery was competing against every other, and no attempt was made to organise a Marketing Board, such as exists in other countries.  No attempt was made to market in a rational way.  While these important essentials were neglected, the societies were diffusing themselves in other activities, and were neglecting their proper business.  There is no use in pretending that the Irish co-operative movement is simply panting to conquer fresh fields.  Before the movement begins to worry too much about the lack of opportunity for going into the distributive business and conquering it, it has a big job to put its own house in order.</P>
    <P>A lot has to be done before the bacon societies are efficient, before the actual producing work is as efficient as it should be, before the creameries are properly organised, before the accounts are properly kept, and before there is proper supervision.  All that has to be done, and, in addition, there has to be built up a proper marketing organisation. When that has been done&mdash;it will take years to do it&mdash;we can discuss <Col N="2114" /> the problem whether the societies should go into the distributing business as well.  In my opinion, in the best interests of the country, we will have to keep the co-operative movement as far as possible out of the retail business. The ordinary retail store has not been a success.  It has only served one purpose.  It has diffused the energies of the farmers of the district.  It has taken them away from what they should be doing, and it has concentrated them on something else.  Generally, it has confused the whole position.</P>
    <P>I regard these two sections as being in the best interest of the farmers themselves, and of the co-operative movement in particular.  There is another side of the question.  This is a bank to provide agricultural credits of a special kind, credits which are not provided in the ordinary commercial way.  To that extent, undoubtedly, the farmers, individuals and organisations, who are getting these credits are in a very special position.  Equally, it must be admitted that the creamery which has a store attached is in a very special position to get the custom of the farmers.  The farmers come there regularly, and it is easy for them to get their goods there.  They are paid a cheque for their milk, and it is a simple matter to stop for the supply of goods out of the cheque.  That is first done, and in that way the creamery that has a store attached is in a very advantageous position as against the trader.  The owner of a proprietary creamery is in an equally strong position. He can also have a store, and can get all these advantages which the ownership of a creamery gives him.</P>
    <P>The mill-owner, or anybody who has a business which brings people to it as customers, can also start a retail shop and can get all the advantages by having it on the same premises as the other concern.  That is quite right, but it is going pretty far in present circumstances to make special credits available to agricultural organisations which already have the advantages. which I have pointed out, for getting customers, while these credits are not available to any other class outside this limited one.  Undoubtedly, in equity, we must take into account the point of <Col N="2115" /> view of a man who has put money into a trade or business and who is trading. He is entitled to fair play.  We have to recognise facts.  These people are there, and in a great many cases their business has been built up by the expenditure of much capital.  They are entitled to fair play from the State, and, when the State is putting facilities in the way of a certain class of organisation, it must take into account its obligations to other classes.</P>
    <P>When you consider these facts on one side you must also consider on the other side that the weakness of the co-operative movement up to the present has been these retail shops, dealing with the necessaries of life and with other articles which are the mainstay of the town.  The creameries that are trading in a wholesale way in such articles as fertilizers, feeding stuffs, implements and machinery are doing good business, and are doing it efficiently. The institutions that are doing badly, institutions which are badly conducted, are, as a rule, those that are doing a general trade, a trade in the necessaries of life.  Take these circumstances together and you have a line to draw.  It is only a question of giving effect to it.  I would agree with Deputy Johnson that this does not give effect to the distinction I outlined, and I propose to make slight changes in the Bill before the Report Stage.  The first change would be in regard to Section 12, sub-section (3) (b). That reads:&mdash;&ldquo;Any co-operative society which at the time of the making of the loan or advance carries on the business of selling by retail any goods which are neither agricultural produce nor requisites of agricultural production or marketing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As Deputy Johnson pointed out, the Corporation might make a loan in that state of affairs to a society dealing in a retail way in, say, sugar, bacon or flour.  That was never intended, and I propose to alter that in this way.  I propose to delete the words &ldquo;neither agricultural produce nor requisites of agricultural production or marketing,&rdquo; and insert the words &ldquo;goods actually or usually produced by that society.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What will the effect of that be?  A creamery with a store attached may <Col N="2116" /> get a loan provided the store is not dealing in the necessaries of life.  The reason I insert those words is this: A creamery which does a business in butter often has in store large quantities of Canadian or New Zealand butter for the winter.  That is done quite openly. It is a common thing with creameries. I know creameries that are butter exporters and which do business in the winter time in foreign butter with retail shops.  I know retail shops in the country which, as a matter of course, deal with certain creameries for foreign butter.  A really good creamery would have shops in Cork and other places which it would supply with butter all the year round on the understanding that, when its own butter was run out, they would take its foreign butter. This proposed change is to meet that case.  It gives effect to what I desire to achieve.  It will enable the Corporation to deal with a creamery which has a store attached and which sells either its own produce or requisites of agricultural production.</P>
    <P>That is the position of, at least, 90 per cent. of the creameries.  With regard to the rest, even though they do a general business, it is a very small proportion of their business.  It represents only a negligible item in turnover. They have an alternative.  Those that do not want long term loans can deal with the joint stock banks.  I should say that with 70 per cent. of the creameries which have a store doing a general business, the general business is only a small proportion of the retail business, and if they require loans they will have to conform with the terms of this Bill.  I would propose to make a slight change also in regard to sub-section (4).  I am quite satisfied that the policy of leaving to the exporters, the produce people, the distribution of the raw materials of agriculture is quite sound, and will remain sound for the next twenty or thirty years.  I am satisfied that they will have sufficient to do to make themselves as efficient in that field as their rivals.  I am satisfied that the best turn which the State can do is to prevent them, indirectly if you like, from going into other fields of activity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that the most of the Minister's argument rather assumes that this is a direction to the Corporation to give credit and make advances to societies whenever they ask for them.  It assumes that the Corporation is not going to have any discretion as to the character of the society, the credit behind it, and its management. I thought that, according to the Bill, the Corporation would have discretion and, if it found a society which was slovenly or careless, it would be thereby damaged in its endeavour to get an advance from the Corporation. But the proposition of the Minister is to prohibit the Corporation from granting credit to a society whose main business is purely agricultural, no matter how strong and well-conducted that society is, if they sell an ounce of tobacco over the counter.  I think the Minister is going entirely too far, and is putting a prohibition upon the Corporation which is quite unnecessary.</P>
      <P>It seems also that the Minister is forgetting that there will be further development in co-operative organisation, apart from creameries.  After all, creameries are not going to be the only direction in which agricultural cooperation will spend itself.  It seems to me the prohibition upon this Corporation in this respect is going to militate against the development of the idea of co-operation amongst farmers, and unnecessarily so.  I see, too, in this prohibition temptation to societies simply to try to get round the prohibition and, unless the Minister is going to make very radical changes in the law regarding co-operative societies, it will be a very simple matter, indeed for any number of members over seven to form such a society for trading purposes, and rent for one shilling a year the premises of the trading or creamery society and do exactly the very thing you are pretending to prohibit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this is unnecessary.  I think the objects might be well safeguarded if the section were framed in such a way as to prohibit credit being given to a society in connection with which any considerable part of the business was retail distribution of general commodities. I can understand that case, but I cannot understand the case the Minister is <Col N="2118" /> making for an absolute prohibition upon the Corporation against making an advance or giving credit to a society which, in a minor way, deals in retail commodities.  I think the Minister is badly advised, and he is merely forcing societies to get around the Act by forming new co-operative societies, which they can do very easily indeed.</P>

      <P>The traders in the towns who are paying rent, rates and taxes, and who have to pay a portion of that subsidy or loan, are in this position; it would be very unfair to deprive these men in the towns from exercising what ought to be their lawful business, purchasing and selling the necessaries of life.  A co-operative society that would be supplying these necessaries of life would be getting, if you like, sheltered assistance from the State.  It would be very unjust to give them sheltered assistance, and so help to deprive traders of their means of livelihood. In a great many cases traders have to seek from the members of the co-operative societies some of the necessaries of life, in order to exist.  They have to get butter, eggs, potatoes, and several other necessities.  It would not be fair or just to the traders to deprive them of the right to carry on their business and to give a subsidy or loan, or a grant, if you like, to the co-operative societies and so put them in a position in which they should not be.</P>

      <P>I think the cat is pretty well out of the bag now.  If the Minister argued on the grounds that there should not be competition between traders and co-operative societies in the selling of ordinary non-agricultural necessaries of life, that is a matter that could be taken on its merits.  The Minister has resorted to a good deal of special pleading to make a case, and I think his arguments are not altogether justified.  If the Minister argued that practically all co-operative societies carrying on the business of retail selling of ordinary commodities have not been a success, that is a debatable point.  I know of one creamery society which has a store attached to it for retailing ordinary agricultural necessities and the ordinary necessaries of life, such as flour, bacon, boots, etc. That society is one of the best in my <Col N="2119" /> county.  It produces the best butter, and it continually gets prizes at surprise competitions.  Great benefit has accrued from that society to the people in the vicinity, because of the retail store and the reduced prices.  It is not at all impossible to have a creamery with a store attached well managed.  In that particular store there is a separate manager for the creamery and a separate manager for the retail department. If the business is sufficiently large, that is how to run it.  The Minister has drafted the Bill so that credit will be restricted in future.</P>

The fact is that these societies are not going to get credit simply because they are selling articles other than actual requisites for agricultural production.  It might reasonably be argued that practically everything a farmer buys is necessary for agricultural production.  The farmer has to live in order to produce, and in order to encourage efficient farming we ought to encourage the farmer to get the articles he requires at the lowest possible price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'DONOVAN Mr. O'DONOVAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'DONOVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the motion standing in my name:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that a conference representative of the flax growers, flax spinners and scutch mill-owners in Saorstát Eireann should be convened as early as practicable for the purpose of suggesting what action, if any, should be taken to ensure the stabilisation and development of the flax industry.</P>
      <P>I ask the leave of the House to amend the motion by inserting after the word &ldquo;convened&rdquo; the words &ldquo;by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture.&rdquo; Some Deputies may think that this is not a matter of much importance, but that it is of importance is shown, I think, by the fact that last season out of the 26 counties in the Free State flax was grown in 13 counties, and in 17 counties in 1925.  It was grown in 20 counties in the year 1920.  That flax was grown in 13 counties in the Free State last season shows that the industry is one of some importance, and I hope the House will give this motion favourable consideration.  The conditions in Ireland greatly favour the production of flax.  It is only in moist and humid climates that flax can be grown successfully, and in a way to produce a strong fibre.  Hence it is that we have only a few countries in the world that can compete with us in the matter of flax-growing.  Ireland has always been prominent in the growing of flax, and in doing so successfully.  Therefore, I think we should not let the industry die out.  We do a lot in trying to promote and propagate some crops which other countries in the world can produce better than we can.  Another aspect of the question to be considered is that in the counties which grow flax we have the machinery and mills and the trained hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mills that we have are as up-to-date as any that are to be found in any of the flax-growing countries in the world.  We have the trained hands, able to take part in the handling and management of the crop in any quantity. Should the industry be allowed <Col N="2122" /> to die out, the result will be that these trained hands will have to go elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I might mention that an acre of flax grown in the Free State gives employment to four hands all the year round, that is, from the growing of the crop on the farm until the linen leaves the weaving mill.  Therefore, if you grow 4,000 acres of flax you can give employment to 16,000 hands.  I am not going to put suggestions before the Minister as to what the result of the conference should be.  I hope he will agree to call the conference together. If a conference representative of all parties really interested in the industry is called together, it will, I am sure, be able to hammer out a scheme that may be of the greatest benefit to this industry and to the country generally. Last season there were practically 7,000 acres under flax in the Free State. Putting the yield at an average of 30 stone to the acre, which is not an extraordinary yield&mdash;that would be much below the average in a good many counties&mdash;and taking the price that we got for it this year, the crop was value for £120,000.  That, taken with the amount of employment that was given in the production of the crop in the Free State, is a very important matter.  I might point out in that connection that, while the prices for all other classes of farm produce dropped last year, the price of flax soared.</P>
    <P>During the past four years I have been asked repeatedly by those interested in flax production in the different counties in the Saorstát to bring forward a motion of this kind, but I did not feel in a position to do so during the period of depression that has continued since 1920.  Now that we see that the tide has turned and that there is a possibility that the flax and linen industries are about to take their rightful place amongst the industries of the country, a place which they held for centuries, I think it is only right that this conference should be called together to suggest ways and means for promoting their welfare.  During the past season the growing of flax was as profitable and economic a project to tackle as in the boom years from the end of 1917 to 1920.  In 1919, we were <Col N="2123" /> getting from 35/- to 45/- a stone for flax.  Every stone of flax that year cost about 32/- to produce.  This season we got on an average 11/- a stone, and every stone of flax was produced at 4/-.  Consequently it was as economical a proposition to grow flax this season, when there was a profit of from 6/- to 7/- a stone on it, as it was in the boom years.</P>
    <P>According to figures supplied to me by the Department of Agriculture, the acreage under flax in 1920 was very high.  It was about 34,000 acres.  In 1926, the acreage was practically 7,000 acres.  Speaking for my own county&mdash; the County Cork, where not only ourselves but our fathers before us were cradled in flax&mdash;we suffered very much more than any other of the flax-growing counties, for reasons which I am not going to mention now.  As I stated before, it cost us 32/- a stone to produce flax in the boom years, in the year 1919-20, but for reasons that I need not go into we were unable to sell the flax until late in the year 1922 or early in 1923.  In the year 1919-20 we could have got an average price of 30/- per stone for it&mdash;the price on the Belfast market at the time was from 30/- to 35/&mdash;but we had to hold it over for two years, and then all we could get for it was from 8/- to 10/- per stone.  The result was that the acreage under flax dropped in my part of the county.</P>
    <P>Another reason for the drop in that year was the closing down of the spinning-mill in Cork.  The City of Cork can lay claim to having erected the first mill in which flax was spun by machinery in Ireland.  It was erected over 150 years ago.  The present structure was built and fully equipped in 1854, and normally employed 900 hands.  In pre-war days it had a turnover of £125,000 a year, while during the boom years the turnover reached practically £350,000.  The value put on a spinning-mill may be gauged from the fact that if you were to put up an up-to-date one now like that, the cost would be at least a quarter of a million. The machinery in the Cork mill is as up-to-date as any to be found in any of the mills in the North or in any <Col N="2124" /> other place where they have spinning-mills. The skilled hands are still in Cork City to handle the flax, just as they are in the country.  As regards the conference that was held by the Department of Agriculture twenty-five or thirty years ago with regard to the revival of the flax industry, what was wrong with it was, I believe, that the spinners, those at the finishing end of the business, were not brought in touch with those at the other end of it.</P>
    <P>There was no cohesion between them. This motion is intended to get that cohesion.  Although this factory is not working, the representatives of it are still there to attend the conference and give us the benefit of their advice, and, I believe, some good would result.</P>
    <P>I have before me the profit and loss accounts of the factory from 1899 up to 1923, when the factory ceased to work.  During that time there were only four years in which there was a loss.  These years included 1920, 1921, 1922, and 1923, when everybody suffered losses.  The losses were small compared with the losses that some of us suffered at that time.  From 1899 to 1920 a profit was shown, and a dividend and bonus paid each year, except in 1901.  I appeal to the Minister to bring this conference into being, so that we may be able to place this industry on a solid foundation.  As a result of the war, the factory lost its market abroad, owing to Government control.  They had formerly Continental and American markets, although the bulk was sold in Belfast.  When the depression came, they were not able to recover their foreign markets.  Our Government has trade emissaries on the Continent and in America, which is the principal market for Irish linen.  Irish linen holds the premier place in the world&mdash;there is no other linen like it. If our trade emissaries were able to provide markets for our linen it would be of great benefit to the country.  The factory used to work about 780 tons of flax per year.  If the factory were working it would mean a second market for the flax-growing farmers.  To-day the one and only market they have is Belfast.  If this factory were working it would supply an alternative market for practically half the flax produced <Col N="2125" /> this year in the southern portion of the Free State.</P>
    <P>I again appeal to the Minister to call this conference together.  If he does so, I am confident it will have good results.  It would not be establishing a precedent.  We had a Flax Advisory Committee under the old regime.  When you are dealing with a highly technical matter such as this, the advice of those who are engaged in the industry would be very valuable.  I hope that the Minister will give favourable consideration to my motion, and see that the conference is called at the earliest possible moment, in order to try and revive one of our oldest industries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. Deputy O'Donovan knows this industry from A to Z.  I confess that twelve months ago I was not very optimistic as to the future of flax-growing in this country.  It is generally recognised that the desperate competition of artificial silk has done irreparable damage to the linen industry.  Twelve months ago I do not think that even the most optimistic were hopeful of an early revival of the linen industry. But I have during the last couple of weeks, in my own county, come across farmers who grew flax last season, and who are as well satisfied with the price they obtained for it as the price they obtained for any other product of their farms.  Undoubtedly the industry is native to the country.  The soil is suitable for growing flax, and the farm labourers and factory workers have the technical skill required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the point of view of industrial revival it would seem that a far better case can be made for the making of an effort to restore this industry than can possibly be made for the building up of new industries for which we have not the skilled hands and the technical knowledge required.  The contention of those engaged in this industry is that it is capable of standing on its own without any financial assistance from the State.  So many committees and commissions have been set up by this Government that quite a good case has been made by the Deputy.  Whatever point of view the Minister may have, I <Col N="2126" /> think it would be a good policy to get the people interested in this industry together, so that they can review the position and see if they cannot hammer out a scheme for its revival.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephMcGoldr" hpid="Mr. McGOLDRICK Mr. McGOLDRICK">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGOLDRICK</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words in favour of the desirability of reviving the flax industry in this country.  As a representative of a county that in the past has been the greatest flax-growing county in Ireland, I can speak with a considerable amount of experience on the matter. Although there are adverse circumstances in regard to the marketing of linen, on the whole I think there is a great possibility of an intelligent effort being able to restore this industry. What has caused the falling off in the cultivation of flax in the first instance has been the quality of the seeds supplied in the past eight or nine years. A defective quality of seed has been supplied.  Whether that was done deliberately or not, or what was the cause of it, I cannot say.  In 1921, 1920, 1919, and even earlier, a statute acre was able to produce 48 stones of flax.  In one or two years that quantity fell suddenly to less than a half.  It could not have arisen from any other circumstances than that there was something wrong with the seed, because the land was as capable as it was in previous years of producing the same quantity and the same quality of fibre.  Not alone did the yield fall off to the extent of one-half, but the fibre was also said to be defective in quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture for Northern Ireland the other day said that he proposed to have an inquiry into the question of the supplying of seeds, as the quality was defective and the supply had fallen off.  The farmer who used to grow flax and make it one of the most profitable of his crops finds it now altogether unprofitable.  It is important that that phase of the question should be inquired into.  If those who inquire into it are able to solve the problem of getting the seed back to its former standard, the crop should be a very valuable one for the tillage farmers, because flax is very valuable in tillage rotation.  There are special processes through which the soil has to go for the reception of this crop which, <Col N="2127" /> combined with the intensive cultivation it requires, make it immensely valuable for tillage.  It also has the merit of removing weeds from the soil.</P>
    <P>With all these advantages to tillage, I think that Government agencies would be very well employed if they directed their energies to the revival of this industry.  Notwithstanding the adverse markets for linen.  I believe that there is a future for the cultivation of flax in rotation, and the additional employment which it will give will be a very valuable item in itself.  At present there is very little employment for agricultural labourers, and flax growing would give a large amount of employment. In fact, it is the crop above all others that gives most employment. In addition, it is a crop that is at all times in demand to a certain extent. No doubt there have been agencies in the Flax Spinners' Association in Belfast that have very rigidly controlled prices.  I cannot see why any body like that should be allowed to control prices to such an extent that flax growing would be uneconomic in our area.  We should have some means of putting ourselves in a better way than we are in relation to the marketing of this crop. Co-operation, of course, is necessary and will be forthcoming.  Surely there is in the future some prospect of the land yielding more per statute acre than it does at present?  It is not yielding anything like what it should yield.  If the yield is not increased, the population will decrease.  If land only produces £2 per acre by grazing cattle on it, our population is bound to decrease, and there is no future for the country.  In every agricultural Bill there should be a bias towards tillage.  In the Agricultural Credit Bill there should be such a bias&mdash;the benefits given should be in proportion to the increased amount of tillage on a holding.  I would, therefore, strongly urge the calling into conference of those who can assist in reviving flax growing, which is one of the best ways of giving employment.  It was the industry in the past by which the tillage farmer was able to live economically. If that is not done I do not see how some of those who are at present living by tillage will be able to meet their <Col N="2128" /> obligations in the very adverse circumstances that prevail.  I think on all these heads that it is the duty of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, who is certainly applying himself with every assiduity, so far as I can see, towards doing all he can to better the condition from the agricultural point of view, to include this particular item in his repertoire, and try to get flax back into cultivation once more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of some of the difficulties that the growers of flax have had to contend with in past years, and the rather rapid rise and fall in the area under cultivation, consequent on the great variation in prices.  But I think, nevertheless, that the claim for special consideration for flax growing is a good one, and I hope that the Minister will agree to the proposition. There is no doubt whatever of the value of the flax crop from the point of view of the employment of labour.  Everything that was said in respect of the beet sugar proposition can be said, and perhaps with added force up to the point of marketing, in respect of flax.  It employs more labour than beet, it is at least as good for the following crops, and the after employment in preparation for the marketing of the ultimate product employs very much more labour than in the case of beet sugar making.  I happen to have at hand a very close analysis of the figures relating to the production of linen cloth, from the point of sowing the flax seed to the production and the sale of the finished linen cloth.  I find that between the sowing of the seed on 714 acres to the spinning into yarn&mdash;these are pre-war figures&mdash;£9,000 was spent in wages. All that can be related to the actual work in and around the flax-growing areas.  Deputy Donovan has pointed out that the work of producing the fibre and spinning it is more or less complementary, and that we have facilities in the Free State for producing to that point.  We have also facilities for going further; we have weaving factories, and I hope that any inquiry that may be made will not leave out that factor.  Following the yarn spinning into the weaving, bleaching and finishing processes, out of the <Col N="2129" /> 714 acres, sown with flax seed worth £710, with the price of seed at that time &mdash;and the price of seed is about the same at present&mdash;the expenditure on wages, pre-war, was £13,000, producing £26,000 worth of cloth.  These are all pre-war figures and would require to be adjusted according to present prices and costs, but they at least give an illustration of the possibilities of utilising soil, machinery and labour in actual production within the country.</P>
      <P>The question of a market arises at once.  There is at least a limited market for linen cloth in the Free State, a market which could very well be increased almost indefinitely.  The proposition, as I would view it, is that this should be taken as part of a national economic policy, and one could see the desirability of encouraging flax growing, of encouraging flax spinning, of encouraging the making of linen and the making up of linen garments to be worn by the people of the country, all done within the country.  But there is another possibility whereby such utter dependence upon the Belfast buyers would be eliminated.  There is the possibility, if we were to specialise in growing flax and spinning, and weaving into linen goods, of making a special market, for Free State linen goods in the United States of America.  It is well known that the greater portion of the Northern market for finished linen goods is in the United States.  I believe that it is not at all outside the bounds of possibility that we could find a special market in the United States for Free State linen goods, and our definite fiscal freedom in this matter could be utilised in time to make a reciprocal arrangement with the United States for our linen goods in exchange for freedoms that United States goods have in this country in respect of certain articles of commerce &mdash;I have motor cars specially in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a distinct possibility of specialising upon the production of linen cloth grown in the Free State, spun in the Free State and woven in the Free State, and getting a market for our surplus in the United States. Therefore, any inquiry that might be made should not be confined to flax-growers, spinners, and scutch-mill <Col N="2130" /> owners, but that also weavers in the Free State&mdash;and there are at least two weaving mills that could deal with linen cloth&mdash;should be brought into conference.  There is a possibility so long as linen is marketable anywhere that we could usefully produce that linen, and there is a distinct possibility, if our economic policy is well directed to a definite end, that the use of linen goods by the people of this State, in preference to cotton and even artificial silk, to a very much greater extent than has hitherto been the case, might be encouraged.  I would urge that that aspect of this question be borne in mind in making any inquiry such as is foreshadowed by Deputy Donovan. There is not the slightest doubt about the value of the industry, both from the agricultural point of view and from the industrial point of view, to the community as a whole, and I hope that the Minister will accede to this proposition with the addendum that I have urged, not necessarily in the form that I have suggested, but that certainly we should have in mind a consultation with the weaving side of this industry.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson's suggestion was that a linen industry could be built up in this country, that flax could be grown, yarn could be spun and cloth could be made, that you could find a market for it in this country and that that would be well worth considering.  He also indicated that a market, presumably for the surplus, could be very well found in the United States of America, and he pointed out, quite rightly that this country was specially suitable for the production of flax, and, generally, for the linen industry.  He pointed out also that flax to some extent was a crop rather like sugar beet, and that if special measures were taken to establish a sugar beet industry in the country some attention should certainly be paid to the flax industry, which brings land under tillage, and gives a very big amount of employment, and in the end there is a factory process employing labour as well.  That is all true.  These are considerations undoubtedly that should be taken into account.  But surely Deputy Johnson realises that his <Col N="2131" /> programme is extremely ambitious, and that a programme of that sort could not be carried out without consideration extending over months and months, without bringing in technical skill of the highest order from outside the country, and without having an entirely different sort of conference from the conference that is suggested here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;And the conference suggested here as extended by the Deputy's own suggestion, to bring in the weavers.  What is the position? Flax growing in the Free State is not entirely unknown.  Farmers in the flax-growing districts know as much about flax-growing as they know about the growing of mangolds and turnips.  The methods of cultivation are well known, the results we have to expect are well known, the weight of the crops, the quality of the fibre, and all the rest of it, is fairly well known.  I do not say that there is not room for improvement in development and research, but there is room for improvement in development and research in regard to the mangold crop, oats, or any other crop.  Flax is in exactly the same position. The process is very well known. equally there is nothing new to be known about the weaving and spinning. So far as there is a problem it is purely a commercial problem, and it exists not only in the Free State, where it is comparatively unimportant at present, but in the North of Ireland, where it is of the profoundest importance. What is the position with regard to our flax-growing?  I suppose one-fourth of the flax grown in Ireland is grown in the Free State&mdash;I am guessing my figures, but they are approximately accurate&mdash;and of that one-fourth I should say that not one-fourth again is grown in the South of Ireland. I should say that three-fourths&mdash;or perhaps five-sixths would be nearer to it&mdash; of the flax that is produced in Ireland is produced in Ulster, including Free State Ulster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The entire market for that flax is in the North of Ireland, and was always <Col N="2132" /> in the North of Ireland, even when we had a spinning mill here.  While a certain amount of flax was spun in the South of Ireland, nevertheless the yarn went to the North.  The price of the yarn depended on the linen industry in the North, and, again, the price of the flax depended on the price of the yarn, and, ultimately, on the condition of the linen industry in the North.  It is suggested now that we should call a conference of the flax growers of the Free State.  There was one spinning mill here and it is closed.  I did not know that there were any weaving mills open in the Free State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, we have it that there is one weaving mill in Drogheda.  We are to call this conference. When these people come together, what are they to do?  Suppose we had them here this moment, what would they say?  The growers would say &ldquo;flax is not a profitable crop; though it is a little more profitable this year than it was last year.&rdquo; The weavers would say: &ldquo;We are getting a slightly better price for linen, but there is no sign of stability yet and no great sign of an economic price.&rdquo; Having said all that, what would they say next, unless they were to attempt to tackle the problem Deputy Johnson outlined&mdash;the problem of establishing a linen industry in the Free State, the growing of the flax, the making of the linen, the finding of a profitable market in the Free State and the finding of a profitable market in America for the surplus.  Surely it would be waste of time to call together representatives of the flax growers of the Free State, of the one spinning mill of the Free State, <Col N="2133" /> and of the Drogheda weaving mill, to discuss such a programme as that.  If you drop that very ambitious programme&mdash;to outline some method of setting up a linen industry which does not exist at the moment, of protecting the Free State market so as to give a profitable price for the linen within the Free State, a price better than that in Belfast or than the Belfast people can get in the world&mdash;what are you going to discuss?  I said that five-sixths of the flax of Ireland is grown in Ulster, and that far and away the biggest proportion of the flax grown in the Free State is grown in Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan.  How can I get a better price for the flax growers of Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan?  Their only market is the Northern market.  The Northern millers know all that is to be known about the flax industry.  They do things really well, and yet the industry is unprofitable.  They are not able to give a decent price to flax growers, and they will not be able to get a decent price for their linen until world conditions change.  Have we any control over those world conditions? Would any such conference as is proposed show us how we could control those world conditions?  Let us turn to the South.  Supposing it became profitable to open, again, this flax spinning factory in Cork, could that factory give any better price than the Northern factories are giving?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'DONOVAN Mr. O'DONOVAN">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The price that the South could give can be got in the North at the moment.  If that were a profitable price, there would be more flax grown.  It is a better price than could be given last year; hence there was a slight increase in the crop.  If the position gets better in the North, the Northern factories will be able to give a better price.  There will be more flax grown.  But how is the opening of the Southern factory, which is now closed, going to get a better price for the farmer?  Will it not always be the same price as the price in the North, and does not that depend on world conditions?  Is it seriously suggested that in a conference of a few <Col N="2134" /> scutch mill owners, and a few growers, with representatives of the weaving mills which Deputy Johnson mentions, anything could be done to get us a better price?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'DONOVAN Mr. O'DONOVAN">

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I could take two views on this motion.  I could save myself a lot of trouble by saying that I agreed with the resolution.  I could then go back to the Department and ask the Chief Inspector, who deals with this particular question, to arrange a conference, call these people together and let them talk for a week.  But that would be mere deception.  If I thought that the conference could achieve any possible good, I would call it.  But what could it do except talk? Do not tell me that this simply means bankruptcy&mdash;that the suggestion is that nothing whatever can be done for the flax industry.  Of course, things can be done for the flax industry if you are willing to pay for them.  I daresay that if you got a really efficient examination of the whole position by first-class men in a conference of this sort, they could tell you (1) what price would ensure the placing of a big area under flax in the Free State; (2) what sort of subsidy would start the spinning mills; (3) what size of tariff would afterwards enable you to protect the Irish market, which is extremely small, and (4) what sort of export bounty would afterwards &ldquo;collar&rdquo; the American market.  If you got four or five really able men together, who had full technical knowledge of the flax-growing side, the spinning side and the weaving side, and if you gave them a year to get all the evidence together, they could give you fairly accurate information on all these points.  Then you could decide whether the moneys necessary&mdash; the direct moneys by way of subsidies, or the indirect moneys by way of remissions of taxation or tariffs&mdash;would be worth expending on this particular sort of service, and whether you would get sufficient result from it.  But to expect a conference composed of representatives of the flax growers of the Free State, of the company that formerly owned a spinning mill in Cork, and of the Drogheda and Greenmount <Col N="2135" /> Mills&mdash;to expect that conference to give you any assistance, to make any investigations that would enable you to express an opinion on the merits of the question, as raised by Deputy Johnson, to expect that, after a conference lasting a day, or two days, is, I suggest, absurd.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may say: &ldquo;Well, get your four or five men and have the question examined.&rdquo;  But you are not going to decide a matter of policy offhand.</P>
      <P>This industry is now at a very low ebb in the particular district which had a monopoly of it&mdash;in the place which used to do the linen business better than any other place in the world.  At a time such as the present, when the industry in that district is sinking, you are to expend big sums of money in stabilising it here which could be more usefully expended otherwise!  If the industry recovers in the North, well and good.  There will always be a market for flax in the North if the market recovers.  If the industry becomes more profitable the spinning mills here will be re-opened.  If the spinning mills have a proposition to put up, let them put it up.  If any of these mill-owners consider that they could be helped through the medium of the Credit Facilities Act, or by any other method, they know how to put the proposition forward.  But merely to call together a conference of the flax growers and of representatives of the spinning and weaving mills, to put these people in a room and say: &ldquo;Hammer out something between you that will stabilise the linen industry,&rdquo; when there is more money and brains and enterprise being used in an attempt to stabilise it in other countries, is absurd.</P>

I was asked three years ago to bring forward this motion.  I waited until I saw that there was a trade revival&mdash;a definite trade revival.

      <P>If Deputy Johnson's suggestions were followed, our representatives in other countries might be as well employed in looking for a market for our Irish linen as they are in looking, perhaps, for hopeless markets in regard to other things.  There are several suggestions which this conference could put up.  In the conference held in the past there was not the necessary cohesion, because there was only one end of the trade represented.  The spinning and weaving end of the trade was not represented.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGoldrick referred to seed production.  Knowing the industry from A to Z, I say that that is the keynote of the whole situation.  If we get reliable seed, as we did get when it was carefully handled, picked and cleaned by the Russian peasents in the old days, and if we have a return of fifty stone to the statute acre as I frequently saw in the old days&mdash;sometimes it reached sixty stone&mdash;the price will not affect the farmer.  It is the yield that counts. If he gets a good yield, flax-growing will be an economic proposition for him.  It will be more economic than any other crop.  The Northern Government are at present subsidising the flax industry, particularly in the direction of the development of pure linseed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have a big area in Canada where they are growing flax solely for the production of linseed, and they expect, within a year or two, to put it on the market in sufficient quantities to revolutionise the flax industry in their province in the North.  I do not see why we could not do it here.  I put it <Col N="2137" /> up to the Minister two years ago to try and get some of this pure linseed for distribution amongst some of our progressive flax growers in the Saorstát. Even if it were done in small quantities it would not be long until we could put economically on the market a seed that would give us an economic return for our labour.  As regards the statement of the Minister that the conference would be an abortive one, there are several matters that could be dwelt on, such as the saving of seed for feeding purposes, which would be of immense <Col N="2138" /> monetary value; the centralisation of rettings and other things that could be suggested and would, if carried, save the industry.  I am very sorry that the Minister has taken this motion in a light vein, because I certainly am confident that if he did accede to my request it would have good results.  I would ask him again to consider the position and see whether a conference could be set up that would hammer out a scheme that would be satisfactory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. NORTON Mr. NORTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice, at question time, that I intended to raise a matter on the adjournment, and that matter is one which very seriously concerns the Irish postal service.  In the past three weeks three of the most extraordinary promotions that have ever been made in the history of the Irish Post Office have been made.  Three officers have been promoted from other offices into the Dublin postal district, to high supervising positions, over the heads of senior, qualified officers, serving in the latter district.  This matter is one which has caused very, very serious indignation and very, very serious disgust in the Irish postal service.  One of the persons promoted happens to be a brother of the Minister, another happens to be the Minister's Private Secretary, and the third happens to be a person named Waldron, who has no record of able service which would entitle him to this extraordinary promotion. The seriousness of this matter to the Irish postal service and the indignation which the promotions have <Col N="2139" /> caused are the reasons which compel me to raise this matter in this House and to enter my protest, on behalf of the Dublin postal staff in particular, against these extraordinary promotions. I must say to the Dublin postal staff, and to me personally, these promotions bear the hall-mark of favouritism. These promotions indicate, in my opinion, and in the opinion of the Dublin postal staff, that this administration of ours is not free from that evil which in the past political period this country was always prone to be charged with.  In the past, it is true, many glaring cases of favouritism occurred under the British administration. The record of the Irish postal service, in particular as far as these three promotions are concerned, shows that they have nothing to learn from the British administration in the matter of the favouritism evil.  I cannot see any justification, the Dublin postal staff cannot see any justification, and I venture to say that an impartial Committee could find no justification for the special selection of these three officers. There are in the Dublin postal district to-day senior qualified officers, with long service and high qualifications and of unblemished character, well qualified to fill the three posts which have been filled by importations.  In reply to my question to-day, the Minister appears to have discovered that there was no officer in the Dublin postal district who could have been promoted to any of these posts, no officer in the Dublin postal district who had sufficient qualification to be appointed to any of these posts.  That contention will convince nobody who knows the position.  That contention will not convince anybody who knows the staff of the Dublin postal district.  That contention will not convince any fair-minded body of people.  That contention is not the contention of a person who definitely set out to find that there were qualified persons in the Dublin postal district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are well qualified persons in the Dublin postal district who would fill these jobs in a more creditable manner than the three people who have been promoted.  What can be said for the promotion of these officers?  What <Col N="2140" /> can be said for the extraordinary course which has been taken in appointing three officers from other offices, bringing them into the Dublin postal district, and promoting them to high supervising posts?  It is quite an abnormal procedure.  The normal procedure, although there may have been one or two exceptions, is for the higher administrative posts to be given to the staff employed in that office.  That practice was not followed on this occasion. It was not merely over-ruled in one instance but was over-ruled in three instances in the short period of three or four weeks.  Whatever case may be made for the Minister's Private Secretary&mdash;and I think, perhaps, the best case can be made for that officer&mdash; I do not think any case whatever can be made for the promotion of the other two officers.  They have absolutely no experience of the work on which they are employed.  They have neither administrative nor supervising experience and, not even in their initial basic training would they give hopes of ultimately becoming fitted for these posts.</P>
    <P>The proposal is to employ them on work calling for considerable tact and ability, to employ them in a department where parcels are opened for Customs examination, and where very careful supervising and administrative officers are required.  As proof of the inability of one of them to fill the position to which he has been appointed, I want to mention that he suggested the other day that more Customs parcels should be opened at one time.  If that suggestion were carried out it would mean messing the table with contents of parcels and, apparently, it would not matter if a man expecting hats got boots, and a man expecting boots got hats.  If that is the type of ability required for these posts, the public have my sympathy as regards the contents of any parcel they may receive in future.  It seems to me, especially as we are approaching the end of the lifetime of this Dáil, and, perhaps, the end of the Ministry which has continued in office here for four years, that this looks like an attempt to place people before the Ministry goes out of power. Within a short period of three weeks, on the eve of a general election, these <Col N="2141" /> extraordinary promotions are made and the Dublin postal staff and, I think, every fair-minded person will require a good deal of persuasion to believe that these abnormal, hasty, and irresponsibly-considered promotions would have been made if the Government were not on the eve of going to the country, and, perhaps, going out of office.</P>
    <P>These promotions are unjust, not merely to senior officers capable of filling posts in the Dublin postal district, but to redundant officers in that district. The only hope which these redundant officers have is that by the occurrence of vacancies they will be absorbed in other posts.  This new departure is going to close an avenue of absorption to these people.  If that policy is going to continue it means that 80 or 90 people in the Dublin postal district are going to find themselves face to face with a stone wall. It seems to me that, in making these three promotions and in the haste with which they were made, the Post Office administration appears to have lost not only its head, but its soul.  I think that the definite effect of this policy will be to swell the pension list and to drive more men out of the service, because they feel that they cannot get justice in it.  A bad day's work has been done for the service by these promotions, and I feel sure that the service will suffer for many and many a day because of the unjust way in which it has been treated on this occasion.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy can be congratulated on having made the most of his material in this particular instance.  He is, no doubt, aware, as an old Post Office official, that the one black spot on the Irish postal service for the last thirty years has been the Dublin postal district. Those members of the Dáil who may not understand the complications of postal work should know that this particular district deals with purely postal work, apart from telegraphs and telephones or anything else, and it is the key position through which the major part of the communications of this State pass.  Because of that position, <Col N="2142" /> it is of vital importance to the administration here to see that it runs with a smoothness and efficiency beyond question. During the last twenty-five or thirty years of British administration this particular section practically ran itself.  The men were the controllers, not the controlled.  In a weak moment in the British administration this staff got completely out of hand, and, notwithstanding several efforts on the part of the authorities at the time to bring it back to some state of discipline, notwithstanding the introduction at intervals of the best material that could be found outside, they never seemed to have succeeded in doing so, with the result that, scarcely had we taken over the administration, when a strike, specially organised and directed from this particular section, was precipitated.</P>
      <P>That was our first experience of this particular section which now pretends to have a grievance.  Consequent upon that strike, and as a result of a Commission of Inquiry into Post Office wages, it was found that much of the work which these sorters were then performing could be done by postmen and, as a consequence, of the 390 sorters in the section at that particular time only 69 remain unpromoted to-day.  Those 69 men are officers of very short service in the Dublin postal district.  I venture to say, from the point of view of grievance, that never in the history of the Civil Service in this country has there been such extensive promotion as in this part of our service, nor in any other part of the postal service have there been promotions approaching in any regard to those in this section. Sixty-nine remain unpromoted after a period of five years' administration out of 390.  That is unprecedented in the Civil Service of, possibly, any country. It is due to the fact that a great many of the men doing postal work could find more suitable employment in other departments of the Civil Service, and their promotion to those departments would be of great advantage to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For my own part, it is no secret to say that I strongly supported that view, and was in a large measure responsible for many of these men finding <Col N="2143" /> outlets elsewhere.  I hoped, as a consequence of the changes which took place as a result of these promotions, that the spirit of indiscipline which actuated this small section would have been dissipated and, in order to make doubly sure, I brought in a couple of years ago what I considered to be three of the best outside men I could find. Last year, however, rumours reached me and reached headquarters that all was not well in the Dublin postal district. We decided that a special investigation was necessary, an unusual thing in my Department.  Officers were set aside for this purpose, one of them being the Assistant Principal Clerk at the headquarters establishment, the other being the Chief Establishment Officer.  Both men, in my opinion, are highly capable and conscientious officials.  They made an exhaustive inquiry into the working of this section, and here, in brief, is the introduction to their report.  It is a very long report, which I will not weary the House by reading.  Here is their introduction to it:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In supervision there is a general weakness and inactivity, some incompetency, much neglect.  There is no evidence of the essential requirements in control, no evidence of any real effort to give effect to the Department's policy or Postal Department requirements.  There is a want of direction about the higher control and the Junior Supervisors do not understand what is required of them. They do not even know the numbers of staff under their charge.  There is clear evidence that even an ordinary effort has not been made to take the obvious and necessary methods towards the maintenance of these fundamentals.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the course of their investigations they discovered that, notwithstanding the repeated efforts that they had made from headquarters to bring about efficiency and economy in this part of the service, in common with all other parts of the service, in one section alone where 101 officers had been employed, 25 were found to be unnecessary. They also found that there was a serious absence of punctuality.  They <Col N="2144" /> found that in the transfer of moneys there was no real effort made at checking. They found, in fact, that the staff controlled by these gentlemen, who, apparently, have a grievance, made no serious effort to do its work in accordance with our instructions; that, in fact, it was the one section in the whole service, a service employing practically anything up to 21,000 people, which refused to carry its weight.</P>
    <P>Fortunately for us, this state of affairs was not permitted to continue very long.  The headquarters staff is a very vigilant one.  Lapses of this kind are very quickly pounced on, and these serious delinquencies were put right. But so little confidence had we in the ability of the existing command to tackle that situation, that its control was passed over to two high officials from the Secretary's Office, a control which continued until new appointments were made, one of these being the Postmaster of Cork, who was put in complete charge and who is now the Comptroller of Dublin.  I have merely touched on the irregularities which prevailed in this service, but I have here from the most reliable men an indictment which surprised even those who were fully cognisant of the ability of this particular section of the staff to cause trouble.</P>
    <P>I have been sometimes accused of wasting public moneys.  I notice that has been stated in one or two instances in the country.  I want to say that without any pressure from the Minister for Finance or the Government generally I have taken the most extreme steps to economise, to make this section of the service a commercial section run by the Government as a model of what employment should be, as a model of what the public should expect in the expenditure of their money.  As a result&mdash;and I have had to fight my corner in doing it&mdash;I have effected, over a period of three years, in a total expenditure of less than two and a half millions, an annual saving of £800,000. That, I venture to say, is an achievement which many people will reluctantly give me credit for.  But it is because of the steps that I have taken, the hard process of forcing men to give the <Col N="2145" /> last ounce of their effort to this service, that I have effected these results.</P>
    <P>I do not promote men for friendship's sake.  I know no friend, either in politics or outside.  That, at any rate, has been one of my characteristics.  But when it came to a question of charging people with the responsibility of putting a section of the service which has caused endless trouble in the past, and which is capable of causing it in the future, on a basis which would do credit to the service, I had no reluctance in doing so.  The officers suggested here were not the only officers I had in mind, but they were the only ones who were prepared to venture on a very thankless responsibility.  They are capable men, and the Deputy knows that as well as I do.  The opposition to their appointment is because of their capability, and for no other reason.  One of them, Mr. Waldron, the most junior of the lot, is the most objectionable, apparently. I venture to say he is the most efficient also.  In the case of my own private secretary, Mr. McMenamin, who has had no promotion during my connection with the service, many members of the House can say whether or not they regard him as efficient.  In the case of the third, the Postmaster at Blackrock, I do not intend to dwell on any qualifications of his.  We are merely accepting the fact that he was the organiser of the forces which remained loyal to the Post Office during the strike.  His basic salary in Blackrock was £4 4s. a week; his present salary is £5.  Mr. McMenamin, I should have said, accepted the position reluctantly. It means an immediate loss of £100 per year in his earnings.</P>
    <P>In the case of Blackrock it is intended to reduce the Post Office to a <Col N="2146" /> lower grade and have it controlled from Dun Laoghaire.  In that way we expect to effect a saving.  We have either to run public services on efficient lines or we have not.  If we choose the latter course it may be the easier for those responsible.  It is sometimes hard to take steps such as I have taken here, such as I took two years ago and such as the British took in their time on several occasions; but when it is a matter of effecting efficiency and economy in the public service I have never once considered shifting my responsibility. I do claim that as regards the steps I have taken in Post Office administration in this country since I took over the service&mdash;and I took over anything but a disciplined service&mdash;I am satisfied that my judgment requires no recantation.</P>
    <P>I have no apology whatever to make for these appointments.  I have made them deliberately and in the interests of the service.  I say further that I had seriously considered, not the question of the promotion of any of these supervisors, but the question of de-grading them.  If their lack of loyalty to their paymasters, the public, does not undergo a serious alteration, and if I am still connected with this service, I certainly shall deem it my duty to take very extreme steps to deal with many of them.  They are not in here for the good of their health.  Their duty is to give a return to the public, and they have not given that return, notwithstanding very liberal treatment on my part, and, sooner or later, they will find results different from what have been in evidence up to date.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 8.45 p.m. until Thursday, 5th May, at 3 p.m.</P>
