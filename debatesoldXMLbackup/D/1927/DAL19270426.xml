      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that employees of the Dublin United Tramways Company have been notified that deductions from their wages in respect of income tax will be made at the rate of £2 10s. 0d. weekly, leaving in many cases a balance of less than £1 out of the weekly wages; whether these instalments have been decided on by the Tramways Company or by the Revenue Authorities, and if the latter, whether the Minister will arrange for the arrears to be collected by smaller instalments.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the Revenue Commissioners have issued directions&mdash; pursuant to the provisions of Section 6 of the Finance Act, 1923&mdash;to the Dublin United Tramways Co., Ltd., to deduct arrears of income tax due by a large number of employees of the Company at a specified rate from the wages payable to the individual employees concerned.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have recently discussed the matter with a deputation representing the men, and a proposal put forward on their behalf is at present under consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill follows fairly closely the lines of the Banking Commission Report.  It provides for the establishment of what is called an Agricultural Credit Corporation with a capital of £500,000, half paid up.  It provides that the capital and the dividends shall be guaranteed by the State; that capital shall be offered at least to the extent of £200,000 to the banks, and that the balance shall be offered to the public. The intention is that in the event of the capital not being subscribed by the public it shall be subscribed by the Minister for Finance.  It is an ordinary limited liability company and the ten directors of the Corporation will be appointed by the shareholders.  The banks will have the appointment of directors corresponding to £200,000; the other shareholders will appoint a certain number, and the Minister for Finance may make four appointments. The functions of the Corporation will be to give long term and intermediate term credits to agriculture.  It is not intended and the organisation is such that it would not be possible for it, to give short term credits.  There is an immediate distinction there between the function of this Corporation and the function of the ordinary joint stock banks.  The division will lie along the lines of the joint stock banks performing their usual functions, which they are most suited for, which they have always been performing, and which their organisation enables them to perform, namely, the giving of short term credits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be the duty of this Corporation to give this sort of credits that the joint stock banks have in the past, at times, attempted to give, and which they never found suitable for them, that is, long term and intermediate term credits.  It is not intended that the banks should not even yet enter the field of long term credits if they wish <Col N="1517" /> to do so.  That would be all the better for the Irish farmers.  The more sources of credit which are provided, and the better credits that are given with due regard to the necessities of each case, the better for them.  The banks may, in the future, enter the field of long term or intermediate term credits if they wish.  There is no limitation to their functions so far as this Bill is concerned, but so far as the Agricultural Credit Corporation is concerned, its organisation is such that it will only effectively function in regard to long-term credits and intermediate term credits.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to define exactly what long term credits are, or what intermediate term credits are.  I do not think I could be expected to attempt these definitions, because the Banking Commission, composed mainly of Irish bankers, was unable to do so. What I can do is that I can indicate certain general considerations that have a bearing upon the question.  I think the paper of the banks, at present, is usually dated three months.  The ordinary loan to a farmer is on a three months' or six months' bill.  Certainly, except in very rare cases, a bill does not exceed in duration six months. Now, the sort of credit that agriculture needs depends entirely upon the particular requirement at the time.  Some credits are needed for certain purposes for, say, ten or twelve years.  For instance, credits to farmers' organisations for the purpose of erecting creameries, to be useful so as to be repaid easily and without making undue calls upon the shareholders, should be for periods of ten years.  Credit for drainage might be for lesser periods.  Credit for farm buildings should be somewhat longer, but, in addition, farmers want credit to enable them to hold cattle or crops for nine months or a year or thereabouts, and that is what is meant by intermediate term credits.  It is these credits, and especially long term credits, that this organisation is expected to supply to the farmers.  Now, the purposes are quite simple.  They are defined in Section 9.  They are, in short, to enable a man to become a farmer; that is, to buy land for the purpose of becoming a farmer, and after that to enable a farmer to perform <Col N="1518" /> any agricultural operation.  C, D and E set out the purposes almost exactly.</P>
    <P>(c)  subject to the provisions of this Act, to lend to any individual, co-operative society, or other person moneys upon such security as the Directors may, subject to the provisions of this Act, think fit;</P>
    <P>(d)  subject to the provisions of this Act, to discount for or purchase from any individual, co-operative society, bank, or other person any promissory note, bill of exchange, or other negotiable instrument;</P>
    <P>(e)  to do all such things as may be incidental or ancillary to the due performance of all or any of the functions hereinbefore mentioned.</P>
    <P>We should read that with Section 12 which sets out&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  The memorandum and articles of association of the Corporation shall be so framed and expressed that the Corporation shall be entitled and authorised to lend or advance money only to the persons. and for the purposes hereinafter stated, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  to any person for the purpose of purchasing land.</P>
    <P>(b)  to any farmer for the purpose of constructing buildings on his farm, or making on his farm improvements of a permanent character calculated to increase or facilitate or conduce to the increase of the productivity thereof or for the purpose of purchasing livestock, agricultural machinery or implements, manures, feeding stuffs, seeds, or other requisites of agricultural production or marketing;</P>
    <P>(c)  to any co-operative society (subject to the limitations hereinafter contained) for the purpose of establishing, carrying on, or extending its business;</P>
    <P>(d)  to any person engaged in or proposing to engage, in an enterprise designed for the service of farmers or of farming communities for the purpose of establishing, carrying on, or extending such enterprise;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1519" /> (e)  to any person (other than a co-operative society) for the purpose of paying off a loan which was originally made to him (whether before or after the passing of this Act) wholly or mainly for a purpose for which a loan could under this section be made to him under this section by the Corporation;</P>
    <P>(f)  to any co-operative society (being a co-operative society to which a loan could be made under this section by the Corporation) for the purpose of paying off a loan made to such society (whether before or after the passing of this Act) wholly or mainly for a purpose for which a loan could under this section be made to such society by the Corporation.</P>
    <P>That is for the repaying of a loan made formerly for a purpose for which the Agricultural Corporation could now make loans.  In that form the objects are expressed in a very wide way, and they cover all agricultural production and marketing, and for any purpose connected with either the one or the other.  It would be very difficult to define, in a more limited way, the purposes of such a Corporation.  On the other hand, we had to be very careful to see that this Corporation does not interfere with the ordinary operations of traders.  Quite frankly, we think we can make a distinction that will be fair to the ordinary trader who is entitled to full fair play and will get it, and also which will meet the needs of the agricultural community, and for that purpose we attempt to define the functions of the Corporation by a limited proviso which is set out at the end of Section 12.  It is sub-section (3):&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Corporation shall not make any loan or advance any money to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  any co-operative society the objects of which do not include at least one of the following objects, that is to say, the giving of agricultural credit, or the production or the marketing of agricultural produce, or the sale of agricultural machinery or implements or manures, feeding stuffs, seeds, or <Col N="1520" /> other requisites of agricultural production or marketing, or the production and distribution or the distribution only of power and light mainly to farmers, or</P>
    <P>(b)  any co-operative society which at the time of the making of the loan or advance carries on the business of selling by retail any goods which are neither agricultural produce nor requisites of agricultural production or marketing, or</P>
    <P>(c)  the Chairman or any director of the Corporation.</P>
    <P>That proviso by defining what the Corporation shall not do makes the functions of the Corporation more precise than we could have made them by any positive definition except a general definition of what it could do.  What it means is this: The Corporation shall lend to the farmer for farming purposes either productive or marketing. It shall lend to the farmers' organisation for farming purposes either productive or marketing.  It shall not lend to a farmers' organisation which deals in the items that are included in the cost-of-living budget.  It shall lend to farmers for the raw materials of their production, but it shall not lend to the farmer or his organisation for articles that enter into his cost of living as opposed to his cost of production. It goes a step further and it says in sub-section (4):</P>
    <P>So long as any portion of a loan or advance made by the Corporation to a co-operative society remains owing to the Corporation, such society shall not give or continue financial assistance to any person engaged in or carrying on the business of selling by retail any goods which are neither agricultural produce nor requisites of agricultural production or marketing and shall not itself engage in or carry on any such business, and if any such society contravenes the provisions of this sub-section the whole of the loan or advance so made to it by the Corporation shall (notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary) forthwith become due and payable by it to the Corporation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1521" /> In other words, an agricultural society getting a loan from the Corporation for the purposes set out in this section shall not be in a position to lend money to another agricultural organisation which could not get a loan from the Corporation.  That is specifically put in to meet a case like this: You have an agricultural creamery in a district and the shareholders are the farmers who reside there.  The Committee is composed of A B C D and E.  You have, in the same town, a co-operative store dealing in tea, sugar, groceries, drapery, etc.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>And machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Not agricultural machinery. I draw a distinction between the articles which a farmer requires in order to produce and the articles which he requires in order to live.  Agricultural machinery is obviously one of the raw materials of agriculture.  The co-operative store in the town would be engaged in the selling of tea, sugar, bacon, flour, eggs and so on.  Its shareholders are the shareholders in the creamery, but the committee instead of being A B C D and E are F G H I and J, and obviously having made a distinction at all it would be absurd to lend money to the co-operative creamery, and then put it in the position of being able to lend money to a co-operative store.  If we are to make this distinction between an agricultural organisation, the object of which is to further agricultural production and which deals in the raw materials of agriculture, and an organisation which exists to supply, the necessaries of life, then we might as well make it definite and not allow any loophole such as might and would occur in this country in the way of an agricultural organisation getting a loan to develop its business, and then making credits available to another organisation dealing in certain activities that this Bill could not finance under this section.  I think that is entirely sound, not only from the point of view of the shopkeeper, but of the farmer.  It may be when we are a lot better organised in this country than at present, that then farmers will be looking for fresh fields to conquer, but at the moment they have their <Col N="1522" /> hands quite full up.  The societies that are doing best at present are those engaged in agricultural production, agricultural distribution and the necessities of agriculture, while those that are doing worst, and that have always done worst, are the ordinary retail stores.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our agricultural policy on the one hand is to cheapen, as much as possible, the cost of the farmer's raw material, and to give it to him at wholesale prices, and on the other hand to improve his organisation and to enable him to turn out a better article&mdash;to increase his return as between the price of his raw material and the price of the finished article.  That is the only possible form of protection that you can give the farmer in this country. The co-operative creamery, as opposed to the system of home butter-making, is an example of that.  The creamery enables the farmer to get a better price for his milk and his butter than he could get if operating as an individual. It also helps him to cut down his overhead expenses by producing in bulk by machinery.  The labour costs on the whole are smaller than they would be if spread over a number of small farmers. Therefore, through the function of the co-operative creamery you are on the one hand lowering the costs of production, and on the other increasing the value of the article which it turns out.  You also enable him, by means of the co-operative creamery, to produce a better article than he could do if operating as an individual.  You cannot stop there, and have too narrow a limit, such as that between milk and butter, and therefore my policy is to endeavour to give the farmer his raw materials as cheaply as possible, to enable him to buy them at wholesale prices, and under the best possible conditions, and help him to organise himself so that he will get the highest possible price for the superior quality of the article which he turns out.  If that policy meets with the approval of the House, then we should agree that farmers' societies formed for the purchase and distribution of the raw materials of agriculture are proper societies to receive credits from a Corporation like this, and the provision in the Bill is to enable the Corporation to <Col N="1523" /> make loans to agricultural societies of the kind that I have mentioned.  We cannot protect the farmer in any other way.  We can only help him to protect himself.  We cannot protect him by tariffs on agricultural imports, or in the way that we might help to protect other industries.  The only way we can protect him is to help him to get his raw materials as cheaply as possible, and to enable him to turn out a better finished article.  That has been the policy of the various Bills introduced within the last three or four years, and in furtherance of that policy this section is inserted in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is, however, a real problem there to be considered.  The trader is entitled to full fair play.  The man who owns his own shop is undoubtedly at a disadvantage as against the co-operative society, because of the large number of people who have a vested interest in it, and an interest in its success. When the State definitely decides to interfere on behalf of farmers' organisations, then the State must define the limits within which it will interfere.  It must see that it will give fair play to both sides.  So far as I have been able to consult them, this suggestion meets with the approval of non-agricultural traders throughout the country, and with the approval of the people most interested in co-operative organisations. This suggestion limits the farmer as regards the cost of his raw material of production.  So far as other matters of distribution are concerned, the Bill gives the trader a free field.  I think that meets the case.  Of course, this puts the farmer in a much better position than he was in before. It provides him with the necessary credit for his organisation, and on the other hand the trader knows for the first time where he is.  He has a clear field, to a certain extent, in a particular line of business.</P>
    <P>That is so much for the objects of the Corporation.  The methods of finance in this are, I suppose, rather novel in this country, but it is quite a common form in other countries where attempts have been made to establish an organisation of this sort.  First of all, there will be the share capital, half of which will be paid up.  That will be <Col N="1524" /> the nucleus of the fund, and with that the bank will start and will make loans against the obligations incurred&mdash;in particular against obligations incurred on, the security of land.  They will be in a position to issue certificates for the first £100,000.  Land loans, which the bank makes, and certificates it issues, must have the approval of the Minister for Finance.  These certificates shall have a maturity of not more than 40 years.  The period may vary from perhaps five years to 40 years.  It is only in very rare cases, I imagine, that they would go as far as 40 years.  A long-term loan would be for 10 years.  The certificate would cover 15 and the intermediate loan would cover two to three years.</P>
    <P>Certificates will be issued when they are required, for varying terms which will suit the particular needs of the country, and of which only the directors of the Agricultural Credit Corporation who are actually administering the Act will be the judges. These certificates will be issued on the security of obligations already entered into in favour of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  The Act provides in the first section of the Schedule, page 12, that the certificates shall be only issued against mortgages on land:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whenever the Corporation holds as security for money advanced by it first mortgages on land to the nominal amount of not less than one hundred pounds, the directors may issue a series of certificates of charge against some or all of such mortgages.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that is not exactly the recommendations contained in the Report of the Banking Commission.  I should say first that mortgages on land would include mortgages on buildings.  While the Banking Commission Report is not quite specific on the question, I think they contemplated that certificates should be issued not only against security on land, but against other obligations incurred in favour of farmers and farmers' organisations.  I think myself it will be necessary to enable the directors of this Corporation to issue certificates, of course, with the consent of the Department for Finance, guaranteeing them against other securities than merely land.  It is <Col N="1525" /> rather difficult to make up one's mind on the question.  It is in this country an experiment; it is new.</P>
    <P>It may well be that land will be offered in sufficient quantity to enable this bank to be fully financed by certificates issued as against mortgages on land, but I doubt it, and I do not think it was intended by the Banking Commission. I think that the Corporation itself should get discretion to issue certificates with the consent of the Minister for Finance, on the strength of any other mortgages or any other securities which they may hold.  That is a matter that can be discussed in Committee. Certificates may be issued up to the amount of £7,500,000.  That is fifteen times the capital of the Corporation. It is considered that that will be sufficient.  The Banking Commission Report made no suggestion that the amount of certificates to be issued by the Corporation should be limited in any way.  The only limitation which they suggested was that the Corporation should not lend more than £1,000,000 on these certificates in any year.  There was no total limitation, and this limitation of £7,500,000 set out in the Bill is inserted by ourselves. If it is found&mdash;I do not think it will&mdash; that that limitation is too narrow, it can be altered afterwards by legislation, but my own view is that it will be a long time before we will find it necessary to put the Corporation in a position to make bigger loans than are allowed under the Bill as it now stands.</P>
    <P>These certificates will be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance both as regards interest and sinking fund and before they are issued&mdash;they will be issued in series&mdash;they must be submitted to the Minister for Finance for his approval.  They will have as their security the general assets of the Corporation and also the specific assets lodged with trustees in that way&mdash;mortgages and other obligations owned by the Corporation and lodged with the trustees.  I do not think there will be very much difficulty in finding money for the Corporation.  The organisation of the Corporation is based, strictly based, on the Report of the Banking Commission.  That Commission contained, I think, seven members, of <Col N="1526" /> whom five were directors of Irish banks.  The Report itself sets out that it is the view of the Commission that these certificates would be entirely suitable security for their assets.  Anybody who has read the Report will see that so far as the public do not take up the certificates or share capital, that the banks are willing to help, so I do not anticipate much difficulty in financing the Corporation.  Certainly we have information as to what is going to happen in future.  We have it straight from the horse's mouth, because the Commission was largely composed of Irish bankers.</P>
    <P>The only difficulty I foresee in regard to financing the Corporation is the difficulty I have mentioned already, that certificates may only be issued as against mortgages on land.  I do not think that was contemplated by the Commission itself and even if it were I do not think it would suit the particular conditions of this country.  In America certificates of this sort, debentures, are issued only against mortgages on land, but America is one country and this is another.  The conditions there are very different.  Land is not found to be the very best security. Of course, it is an ideal security on a certificate with a date of ten years, but it is rather difficult to get suitable security on a loan that is to extend over 10 or 15 years.  On the other hand, the general assets of the co-operative creamery would give a sounder security than any mortgage on land. I could suggest other more unsound securities than mortgages on land.  I imagine myself that that particular section ought to be altered to give the Corporation a discretion as to securities they will wish to hold and securities they will issue certificates against. There will be very little danger of a shortage of capital</P>
    <P>There is one very important innovation contained in Sections 19 to 25 of the Bill.  These sections deal with chattel mortgages which is a very difficult question.  It has been considered by Banking and Agricultural Commissions, not only in this country, but in America, England, Scotland and, I think, every country on the continent, and it has been always felt and in fact <Col N="1527" /> reported on by practically all these commissions that nothing would do more to extend the securities which the farmer has for the purposes of obtaining credit, than some system of chattel mortgage.  A bill of sale is quite useless to him.  We have atempted to deal with that question in those sections in which we follow quite closely the recommendations of the Banking Commission Report.  A mortgage may be a general mortgage on chattels, a floating mortgage or a specific mortgage and the floating mortgage may, of course, in the course of its operations be made specific for the purpose of recovering this mortgage on the personal property of the farmer, his cattle, sheep and the live and dead stock generally of the farm.  Obviously these chattel mortgages would be only suitable for short term credits and intermediate term credits.  Consequently, it is a type of mortgage which is particularly suitable for the use of an ordinary joint stock bank which exists for the purpose of providing short term credit.  The report suggests that the credit corporation should be enabled to take such mortgage, and it also suggests that the mortgage should be secret.  In that the Banking Commission follows closely the lines of the report of the English Ministry in regard to agricultural credit.  I believe that this particular type of mortgage would lose a lot of its usefulness and would not be as widely availed of as it should be, if it were in the open market.  It is true in America and, I think, in England, and, if it is true in England, it is true in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In the event of a secret mortgage there would be a central register in Dublin available to the banks and the Credit Corporation.  It is a difficult question, and one that has been considered by a number of commissions, not only in this country, but in other countries, and they all brought it to a certain point.  They are unanimous that a chattel mortgage would be extremely useful to the farmer, and they all seem to be unanimous that it <Col N="1528" /> should be secret, but they leave it at that.  The opinion set out in the report of the English Ministry has been definitely adopted by our Banking Commission, and we are following exactly the recommendations which they made. It is obvious that a mortgage of that sort, say, a mortgage on live stock is very hard to protect.  The idea is that when a farmer gets a mortgage on live stock he should only sell his stock with the consent of the mortgagee or alternatively, that, after selling the live stock, he shall in accordance with the terms of the mortgage liquidate the debt and pay the money to the bank. That, of course, is essential, and must be provided for.</P>
      <P>It is also provided that the purchaser of goods such as live stock, which are subject to a chattel mortgage in the open market, shall get a good title.  In other words, the goods or chattels, such as live stock taken to a fair, which may be subject to a chattel mortgage, may be sold freely.  That is a good title and any purchaser may buy them.  That is also necessary.  That simple section gets over any difficulty there may be by reason of doubt or hesitancy on the part of a possible purchaser of live stock.  Stock, or anything like that, bought in the open market, bought bona fide without notice, carries with it good title, so that there is no difficulty on that head.  On the other hand, there are provided criminal penalties against a mortgagor who obtains a chattel mortgage by false pretences or statements, or who, after obtaining the mortgage, breaks any of its conditions.  These provisions are absolutely necessary, and without them a chattel mortgage would be useless.  No institution would lend money on a mortgage unless it had such protection. The mortgage on land is all right as the land will always be there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mortgage on stock is different. If a man disposes of his stock the creditor would be in a difficult position.  He has not any other security except it is made a criminal offence for a mortgagor to obtain a mortgage by false pretences or false statements, or after making it, break any of the terms of the mortgage.  These are also the terms of the American Act which deals with agricultural and chattel mortgages. <Col N="1529" /> I regard these provisions as important. I do not say they are in their final form.  They are in their final form so far as I and this Bill are concerned, but it is a subject about which we have very little experience.  You have them in other countries, but the conditions existing there are very different, and it may be that when the Bill is passed, and the Act is in operation, other provisions will be found to be necessary or desirable.  If that be so, the Dáil is always here and legislation can be introduced to give effect to such provisions, but we should make a beginning, and we are following strictly the provisions of the Banking Commission report in regard to this question of chattel mortgage.  I think it is particularly useful in Ireland where, unfortunately, land is not a good security for the banks at present.</P>
    <P>That is due purely and simply to the difficulty of selling land, the difficulty which a mortgagee has of selling land, and, moreover, a mortgage on land is troublesome to the small farmer who wants a loan for a year or so.  The chattel mortgage is particularly suitable to him.  In this country land changes hands often, and I think this system will make it easy for the congest or landless man who is getting land to get a certain amount of stock. It will obviate the shocking necessity he was under in the past of bringing in his neighbours to sign a bill, and repeating the process every three months. It will have other advantages.  It will have the advantage that the transaction will be secret, and, having got the mortgage, it will not be necessary to renew the bills, as he had to do in the past every three months.  He will have no further trouble until he sells the chattels.  It was the view of the Agricultural Credit Commission of 1914, whose report is really a classic on the subject, that the chattel mortgage would be extremely useful to the small farmer.  I hold, while there is a considerable difference of opinion about it, that it should be secret.  There is an added reason in this country for it, and that is that while we have good land with clear titles, everything in fact that would go to make land mortgagable, <Col N="1530" /> land is not a good security with the banks.</P>
    <P>If the farmer is short of credit now there are, of course, a good many reasons for it.  Farmers everywhere are short of credit.  Banks are unwilling to lend, but there is the additional reason in this country, and that is the unwillingness of a mortgagor who happens to be a farmer to let the mortgagee sell him out.  If the ordinary decent farmer cannot get credit at present it is largely because he winks at other farmers trying to cod the banks and other mortgagees.  Agriculture will never be able to get reasonable cheap credits in this country until the whole point of view in regard to the selling out of land, held as security, changes, and until it is looked on as a crime, as a dishonest act, to attempt by force to prevent a mortgagee from selling a farm on which he has a mortgage.  It has got to be looked upon as robbery, just as we look on stealing money from banks, post offices, or individuals. Farmers must realise that it is dishonest, that there is nothing patriotic about it.  It is selfish and dishonest, and injures farmers generally.  Until you have a change of mind in that regard, until the farmers come off the ditch and make it clear that they do not stand for any attempt to cheat creditors and to make an exception, so far as land is concerned, compared with other form of mortgagable property, the farmers will be short of cheap credit and will only get dear credit. Land is not at present as good security as it might be, and these provisions for chattel mortgages will help.  As I have said, we are following the report of the Banking Commission fairly closely.</P>
    <P>I do not know any subject that has been so carefully thought out as agricultural credit.  There have been commissions in the past, and quite recently, dealing with it in every country in Europe and in America. The English Ministry some time ago issued a report on the whole question of agricultural credit.  Probably the most valuable report on the question in England, Ireland or Scotland is the report of the 1914 Commission, which is recognised everywhere as a classic on the subject <Col N="1531" /> of agricultural credit.  All these reports were before the Banking Commission when they were considering this question, and they had the advantage of them.  They also had the advantage of a chairman who had complete knowledge of the arrangements made in America, where agricultural credit has been highly developed.  It was with all this knowledge that they issued their report which was published a few months ago.  We have followed the report very carefully, and we think we can hardly be on firmer ground.  If there is one subject more than another that has been fully thought out, it is agricultural credit, but it still requires further thinking out.  My own view is we will not get very much further in the way of providing really suitable credits for agriculture in this country until we make a beginning, and see that in operation.  As the special conditions of the country show themselves, it may be necessary, perhaps, to extend and modify the provisions in this Bill, but we cannot get any further until we see the scheme in operation.</P>
    <P>In one respect the Bill is slightly different from the report.  It provides in Section 9 that the banks shall take deposits from individuals.  The report sets out that the agricultural societies shall be compelled by law to deposit a major portion of their funds with the Corporation.  We have not inserted that provision in the Bill.  We think the proper place for that would be in a co-operative Act.  In any event, I do not think it is likely that the spare funds of an agricultural society will be very great.  Of course if credit societies increase, as I think they will, I regard that as particularly suitable for poor districts, especially in the West, and on the Western Coast.  There will always be a certain amount of funds in hands which will be circulating, and this bank will act as a clearing house. In the co-operative societies there are not much deposits.  Such societies should keep ample reserves and no more, and not attempt to make a profit, or to have anything in the way of big funds lying idle.  I think it is necessary that the bank should be in a position to take deposits from individuals to a limited extent, and we have inserted <Col N="1532" /> a provision covering that.  This bank will be financed first of all by the share capital; secondly, by share certificates; and thirdly, by right of issue of debentures, which the bank may issue up to the amount of its paid-up capital.  If the bank is to have specially cheap money I think it is desirable, at least to some extent, that it should be able to take deposits from individuals.</P>
    <P>I see no objection to that, and the only objection that could be raised if it takes deposits from individuals is that it would be competing with joint stock banks.  That is far-fetched.  If there is any danger of that, it could be met.  As the Bill stands, I do not think the Corporation could be a serious competitor with the joint stock banks, who have on deposit £125,000,000.  The total capital of this bank will be only £7,000,000, and it cannot make a profit over and above five per cent.  The total funds that by any stretch of imagination it would be able to handle at any time, would be between £7,000,000 and £8,000,000.  This will be found by share capital, certificates and deposits. In that state of affairs it is impossible they would be able to handle, as an extreme amount, £5,000,000 on deposits, and on that amount they could not compete, seriously, with banks having a capital of £125,000,000.</P>

      <P>In my opinion the bank would not be able to get deposits, in view of the fact that it does not do ordinary current business, unless it offers better conditions than the joint stock banks.  The point is, as I have explained, that it could not compete in any serious way with the joint stock banks, seeing that it would not handle more than £7,000,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, up to £7,000,000. That is the limit.  This bank would be merely making short term credits, and only a small proportion of any deposits they get could be used for long term credits.  Taking the organisation of the bank as it stands, it is out of the question that they could usefully handle any large amount of deposits.  At the same time my view is, that it would be able to help the banks to get deposits. They will have to pay five per cent. on their share capital, and presumably the same on deposits, and if they want cheap money there should be a certain amount on deposit.  It would be absurd to prevent them, simply because they might compete with banks who, at the moment, handle £125,000,000 on deposit.  If there is any fear of that it would be quite easy to insert a limitation.</P>

I think it is perfectly plain that the directors cannot possibly take more than £7,000,000 or £8,000,000, to give them reserves on the organisation of tins bank, but if there is any doubt about it, it is easily remedied in Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I approve of the principle of this Bill and of the idea in bringing forward the Bill.  As the Minister points out, the Bill follows the report of the Banking Commission on agricultural credits.  This is a new form of credit, based largely on the systems prevailing in other countries. As the Minister points out, conditions are not altogether the same, and we cannot say at this stage whether the Bill will meet with all the requirements of agricultural credit here.  Personally, I think it will not.  Anyhow, it is a beginning, and, as far as it goes, I think it is sound.  I do not regard the report of the Banking Commission on agricultural credit as deserving a great deal of praise.  The ground was all broken for them before. The report was largely based on the much superior report of the Commission on Agricultural Credit which sat in 1914.  I can claim that I forecasted in this Dáil roughly what would be the main provisions of this agricultural credit report.  I outlined the formation of an agricultural institution of this kind, and I also outlined the possibility of allowing an institution of this kind to lend money on a certain class of mortgage.  I can claim credit that my ideas in that regard have been carried out.  I do not say the Commission adopted my ideas, but their views happened to coincide with mine.  The Commission does not deserve a great deal of credit for the production.  From start to finish, it is an apologia for the failure of the joint stock banks to meet the agricultural requirements of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No doubt, some improved system of agricultural credit is absolutely essential. There has been a tightening up of credit all round at a time when credit is most required, when there is a steady fall in agricultural prices, and when existing institutions should come to the rescue of the farmer.  Instead, we find them tightening up the strings of their purses, and not giving credit of any kind.  That is quite understandable.  The banks were not established to provide agricultural credit, but to meet the credit requirements of the commercial and trading community. On account of their organisation, perhaps, they are not altogether to <Col N="1535" /> blame for failure to meet the credit requirements of the farming industry. In my opinion, they have not gone as far as they ought to have gone in that connection.  They have not endeavoured to keep in touch with farmers in the way in which they might. From a practical experience of banking in two countries, I know that in America and Canada the existing joint stock banks go to more trouble to keep in touch with the agricultural community and to get accurate information as to the desirability of lending money to particular people.  In that regard I fear that the banks of this country, despite the fact that they are rich institutions, have, to a certain extent, failed.  In Canada, for instance, a bank manager has to travel through the country, go to a farm, see the conditions of the farmer&mdash;the number of his stock, etc.&mdash;and make a report of his visits.  I have never heard of that being done here.  I am not sure that it would be acceptable work to the bank managers here.</P>
    <P>I think it is not possible to forecast how far this Bill is going to meet the credit requirements of the farmers. The requirements for credit at present are intense and the workings of this Bill will be slow.  As far as I can see, we will have a single Corporation established, but that Corporation will not have any branches.  The effect of that will be that it will not come into direct touch with the people at all.  It can only come into touch with them indirectly through the existing co-operative societies, the agricultural societies to be established, or the existing joint stock banks.  I cannot see how this is going to meet individual requirements, which cannot be dealt with except personally.  I think there is a weakness there.  Perhaps it will be explained on the Committee Stage, because in a large part of the country they have not got co-operative societies.</P>

      <P>The possibility is there.  Having skimmed the cream of the agricultural credit requirements of the country, they will pass on the skimmed milk to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  However, I am only putting forward that view tentatively. The Minister rightly emphasised the fact that credits to farmers are, to a certain extent, being injured by the farmers themselves, and that the difficulty in selling land because of the foreclosure of mortgages has made it more difficult for the farmer to get credit.  That is so, but I think it is not fair to lay too much blame on farmers because of those conditions.  Those conditions exist, but they are due to the conditions of the past, and it is only another indication of the fact that we always pay the penalty for the evil things we do some time or another.</P>
      <P>In the old days, and up to quite recently, those mortgages were held by people like gombeen men, who got farmers into their clutches by means of shop and other credits.  From the beginning they intended to foreclose on the land.  There was also another difficulty with regard to the land agitation, so that it became an honourable thing to object to the sale of land.  Those things have to be taken into account, and until all the causes for those feelings have been removed, and until we give the farmer a reasonable chance of getting credit at a proper rate of interest we cannot blame him in connection with his existing feelings as to the sale of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a point as to the composition of the board of directors to which attention might be directed.  It is not the intention that this institution should be a Government bank.  It is intended that it shall be a free institution&mdash;not controlled by the Government.  There are certain possibilities that it may, in <Col N="1537" /> fact, be controlled by the Government, because the directors are to be appointed in accordance with the number of shares issued.  The Government will be entitled to four directors out of ten. They will be entitled to appoint the chairman, while they hold these 200,000 shares.  Also the Government will be entitled to apply for shares not bought up by the bank or public.  It is quite possible, therefore, that the directors nominated by the Government may be in the majority.  In such a case, this institution will become really a Government bank.  I am not going to say, at this stage, whether a State Agricultural Bank is advisable or not, but you have to look to the fact that it is possible that this will become a State Agricultural Bank.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Minister's statement regarding loans to the co-operative societies engaged in trading, to my mind there is a certain amount of doubt as to the advisability of accepting a section dealing with that.  While the Minister and the Government may desire not to interfere with the ordinary business people, who are not trading in direct requirements for agricultural production, there are many agricultural co-operative societies the greater part of whose business consists in selling the requirements for agricultural production&mdash;who are engaged in selling articles that are required in order that the farmer may live.  Agricultural societies may sell seeds and manures, but they may also sell boots, clothes, tea, sugar and other goods.  As I read this section, it means that any co-operative society which, as part of its business, sells articles of that kind will not be entitled to get a loan under this Bill.  The effect of that will be to restrict a great number of agricultural co-operative societies.  I am not sure that the principle is a sound one.  If we are helping the farmer to reduce his costs of production, I think we must include in that his cost of living.  There is no reason why we should not help him to reduce his cost of living.  However, that can be discussed on Committee.</P>
    <P>I want to refer the Minister to paragraph 9, sub-section (10) of the report, which provides that the institution to <Col N="1538" /> be established under this Bill should make direct loans in individual cases to farmers, and that it should take over loans which are unsatisfactorily placed. I take it that the intention of the report is that this Credit Corporation shall take over what are referred to in another portion of it as &ldquo;frozen loans.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I read that.  I want the Minister to state more specifically than that what his intentions are as to the workings of the Corporation in that respect.  It is a very important matter.  The Minister referred to it here and spoke of an organisation supporting farmers who claimed that they did not intend to pay back loans they got from the banks.  That is not so. No organisation I belong to has said or done so.  I have not done so, but I say that the enforcement of the claims of the banks with regard to those loans, made during the peak prices of land, if carried to their ultimate extreme are going to have a very detrimental effect upon the farming community in this country.  Not only will there be whole families affected, but whole clans will be wiped out of existence if the banks carry their legal powers to their ultimate end.  I believe those people are, in the great majority of cases, anxious to meet the demands made on them.  In this report there is a way out, but it is not made very clear.  It would be bad business for the Agricultural Credit Corporation to take over those loans at their face value.  In many cases they are only worth 50 per cent., and sometimes 60 per cent., of their face value. The great majority of those loans made on land during the high prices prevailing at the end of the war are not worth their face value.  My idea is that a valuation should be made, that the loans be handed over and that the responsibility <Col N="1539" /> of the banks then should cease.</P>
      <P>The idea of having two parties responsible at the same time, the banks and the Agricultural Credit Corporation, for the overseeing of one class of loan is an impossible thing from the business point of view.  There will be a contingent liability on the banks or some institution of that kind all the time, and from the business point of view that is not the right way to deal with that form of loan.  The way to deal with it is, these loans should be valued in some way and the banks should face up to the losses which they must face eventually.  They should accept composition.  Then the Agricultural Credit Corporation would take over these loans at their actual worth.  We take it the present Corporation will have the power to make a long-term loan.</P>

      <P>The fact is that the banks will be at a loss in any case. They cannot recover the full value of any of these debts.  The people who owe the loans cannot pay the full amount.  By no legal method can they be made pay the full amount of the loans.  If there is any attempt made to make them pay even a considerable proportion of the loans in cash, I do not believe it could be successful; in my opinion it would be quite impossible.  If the Agricultural Credit Corporation takes them and extends them over a long period, with the interest and sinking fund combined, that will be the easiest way out for all parties.</P>

Although this measure has my approval and the approval of Deputies on these Benches, I do not think it will meet all the credit requirements of the present time.  It will not meet the conditions that exist arising from the losses of cattle through disease.  It will be too slow, I think, to meet the immediate requirements with regard to the re-stocking of land due to the recent development in the cattle trade.  I think this Bill will not meet these requirements.  In so far as it goes it is, generally speaking, a step in the right direction.  I believe if we pass this Bill we will be taking a step which will materially help the agricultural community, who fully appreciate the bringing forward of this measure.</P>

      <P>I would like to take up a point Deputy Heffernan has made which, I rather suspect, from the Minister's interjection, he would like to reassure the House upon.  I hope that may be the case.  Deputy Heffernan has pointed to the Banking Commission's report on agricultural credit, and has referred to the proposition in paragraph 9 (d) about the new Corporation taking over loans which at the present time are unsatisfactorily placed; and he has further made reference to paragraph (e) which speaks of some basis of adjustment which could be found, and which would make it possible to effect a release.  The Minister drew attention to the next sentence, which states that the new institution could obviously not undertake to assume any responsibility for losses possibly resulting from unwise loans heretofore made.  I would like to know whether the Minister sat in conference <Col N="1541" /> with the banks in regard to the possible basis of adjustment.</P>
      <P>I think the Deputy is quite sound in saying that the proposed credit corporation is one which should be protected from the banks.  It is not reasonable, I think, that this corporation, financed by the State and guaranteed in this way by the State, should allow banks to get rid of a liability for which they are, at least, half responsible, and which, I think, from all the evidences, they are not likely to get out of very easily at par.  I think all the evidences go to show that here you have a case for either a moratorium or an arrangement&mdash;some basis of adjustment was the term used by the Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The quotation is: &ldquo;It should be carefully observed that in the event of such a transfer&rdquo;&mdash;from the existing banks to the credit corporation&mdash;&ldquo;the new institution would expect those who are already responsible for the loan to continue to guarantee it, unless, of course, some basis of adjustment could be found which would make it possible to effect a release.&rdquo;  From the tone of the Minister's interjection&mdash;the question he put to Deputy Heffernan&mdash;I suspected an opening for him to make an announcement to the House that the banks were prepared to meet the debtors in such cases.  I hope I shall not be disappointed.  If it is not the case, then I think we ought to face the facts of the existing circumstances and make clear our view, at any rate, that the new corporation ought not to be used to enable banks to relieve themselves of a liability of which they may be very glad to relieve themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Sections 9 and 12 (e) it is contemplated, apparently, that the new corporation may deal with any person for the purpose of paying off a loan which was originally made to him, whether before or after the passing of the Act, wholly or mainly for a purpose for which a loan under this section could be made, and that includes the purchasing of land.  I shall come to that again.  I now refer to the <Col N="1542" /> Banking Commission's report, page 10, in which they refer to the position of the banks in this matter.  They say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They&rdquo;&mdash;the banks&mdash;&ldquo;are moreover concerned with the shareholders' demand for a profit, and, like other private enterprises, they naturally feel it a duty to promote the interests of their owners to the utmost degree that is honourably possible.  Irish banks, like banks in other countries, undoubtedly made unduly heavy loans to farmers and farm interests during the inflation period after the war.  At that time land values were high and rising, and there was a prevailing belief all over the world that they would be maintained. Since then they have, in many cases, shrunk by fifty per cent., and bank loans which, in 1920, appeared to be protected by ample margin are now of questionable value.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now that is a report drawn up by bankers, and they tell us that unduly heavy loans were made to farmers at the time of the inflation; that the prevailing belief all over the world was that land values were high and rising and that they would be maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the Report of the Banking Commission.  It seems to me that the proposal in the Bill and in the latter paragraph of the report that the Corporation should relieve the banks is one that should be guarded against.  Bankers are not, quite clearly, very reliable prophets as to the course of industry and the course of values. One wonders, looking back at the Bill, that the bankers all over the world would have imagined that land values would continue to rise and maintain the position of 1920, when there had been such immense inflation in most countries, and that land values depending as they are, to so great an extent on the demand for foodstuffs of the higher qualities, should continue to rise after the killing off of millions of men, particularly men of the wheat-eating countries, and the consequent reduction of population.  To imagine that that kind of situation could happen in Europe and that land values would <Col N="1543" /> continue to rise, and maintain the figure that they then reached, is somewhat extraordinary, and throws a good deal of discredit upon the quality of their advice as to the course of economic affairs.  They took the risks with their clients and quite clearly those risks were bad ones.  I think it is wrong to suggest that the new Corporation should take over from those banks this liability.  Deputy Heffernan's point is that the only way to meet this is through the banks being relieved from this kind of risk in the future, and that in consideration of that they should face the loss and meet by a composition those particular debtors, as the State has had to do in regard to similar transactions.</P>
      <P>The banks in this case are responsible and it would certainly ease the economic situation, as far as I can gather, if there was an arrangement entered into by these debtors who borrowed, and that the new corporation should be protected against having to take over those liabilities.  I say protected against having to take over these liabilities, because there is a possibility, under this scheme, that the bankers on the Board may predominate and they may decide that the terms of the take-over would be such as to favour the existing banks.  I think that there should be some protection for the new Corporation in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to put one or two points to the Minister and ask him to answer them in the course of his reply, and these are on matters of detail.  The Memorandum and Articles of Association propose that the Corporation should be authorised to lend money to any person for the purpose of purchasing land.  There is no restriction, whether it should be land in towns, building land or land anywhere.  It does not specify agricultural land or farming land.  This money may be advanced for the purpose of purchasing land.  That, I think, is not the intention of the Bill.  There is another question which might be faced, though I see the difficulty in putting any restriction in the Bill.  It largely depends upon the policy of the Board, but one could hope that the moneys to be lent <Col N="1544" /> would be not for the purpose of adding field to field by the grazier, but rather that it should be biassed in favour of the farmer who is going to till his land. The difficulty I see is too great, I think, satisfactorily to put it into the Bill.  I think there should be some clear understanding that the Corporation's money should not be used for aiding the addition, by the grazier, of farm to farm and field to field.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not told us whether he intends that there should be a restriction on these moneys for agricultural purposes; that this proposition that the Corporation may advance money for the purchase of land would clearly include the purchase of land in towns.  I am sure the Minister's statement regarding the restrictions on societies which are dealing in articles of production is going to be very difficult for him to maintain.  I do not think it is desirable to make such restrictions. I think the effect of it is going to divide up, to make two societies where one exists at present, perhaps on the same premises&mdash;a creamery society and a general purposes society perhaps, run by the same manager, in the same building, but nominally two different schemes of organisation.  I think it is an undesirable and unnecessary restriction and I point out the difficulty of definition.  The Minister has used the term in the Bill &ldquo;agricultural produce.&rdquo;  Is bacon agricultural produce?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Bacon is agricultural produce.  The society that deals in bacon, say American bacon purchased by the society to sell to the farmer is precluded, but if it is Irish bacon bought for sale, wholesale, then it is not precluded.  I see a very great difficulty in determining how you are going to restrict and determine the end of a particular purchase, whether it is going to be sold in the market for export, or whether it is going to be sent to Dublin or Cork, or sold to the farmers in the neighbourhood. Similarly, in regard to many of these items which enter into the cost of living, there will be a difficulty. That was the phrase used by <Col N="1545" /> the Minister.  Many of these items which enter into the cost of living are items of agricultural produce, and you will have to get a sounder definition. In fact, you have no definition whatever in the definition clause of &ldquo;agricultural produce.&rdquo;  But under that clause you can allow any society to engage in the sale of foodstuffs, because it is agricultural produce.</P>
      <P>Similarly, in regard to sub-section (4), I suggest that the giving of financial assistance does not mean merely handing over money.  I think there is a clear loophole there for the society to deal on credit terms with the customer who is a farmer, supplying milk, let us say, and, at the same time, dealing in some way with the sale of articles, whether through a shop or on the road, as quite frequently happens.  I think it will be found that the clause is not as water-tight as the Minister assures us.  I think it is impossible to make it water-tight, and I think it is quite impossible and undesirable to try to do so.  As far as I understand the Bill, and its likely general effect, I think it is a good one, and should be given the fullest possible trial.  I think it will be good, but I think it is a mistake to try to make these restrictions, whatever the agents of the new banks may do as a matter of business policy. I will give hearty support to the Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this as one of the most important and necessary Bills introduced into this House for some years.  I am sorry to say one of the counties in my constituency is in the second worst position in the Free State &mdash;Meath occupying the premier position in that respect.  I would say that about 25 per cent. of the land in Westmeath is half stocked, and another 25 per cent. unstocked.  The reason is, of course, obvious, because the banks have for some time practically ceased making advances to farmers.  Land cannot be sold, cannot be let, and as a security is valueless.  As a result hundreds of thousands of acres are derelict.  Neither rates, rent nor interest due to banks have been paid. Nothing is being done on the lands, which are simply lying waste&mdash;a prairie.  Persons who received allotments <Col N="1546" /> of lands when the ranches were divided are in a similar position.  They cannot purchase stock and they cannot let the land.  I know several cases where people who received allotments of land sub-let them and are now receiving lesser amounts than the annuities they have to pay.  I hope these people will be taken into account so that they may be in a position to receive the advantages of this money, and have an opportunity of stocking the land that was given them.</P>
      <P>I would like to advocate small advances for people who would purchase pigs.  At present a greater profit can be made from pigs than any other side of farming.  It is not my intention to go into the further details of the Bill to-day, as I will have an opportunity of doing so on the Committee Stage.  I hope the progress of the Bill will be speeded up so that it may be put into operation as soon as possible.  I am sorry to see that there is a certain amount of opposition coming from persons who should know better.  The suggestion is that the Bill should not be put into operation for six months.  If the Bill is adjourned or deferred for six months, in my opinion, the majority of farmers will then be out of business. For that reason I hope it will be put into operation immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the fact that conditions are bad.  With regard to the Bill itself, we wanted credit facilities for agriculture years ago. The Minister has taken the step now, and we approve of it.  At the same time it would be very unwise to herald this Bill as a great triumph, or as an <Col N="1547" /> instrument which would give such a hope to our people that with its passing everything will be all right for the farmer.  Such is not the case.  Everything will not be all right.  The best credit facilities cannot be a panacea for the ills of agriculture.  No matter what money farmers get, if that money is not well handled and used to the best advantage, it may have an effect contrary to that intended by the operation of the measure.  With falling prices, keen competition and many other difficulties with which farmers have to contend, unlimited credit will not do everything.  But better credit facilities for the farmers have been required and are very much required to-day. I feel that the Bill goes quite a long way towards meeting the situation, but I also feel that on its administration&mdash; certainly more on its administration than on the administration of any other Act that the Dáil has passed&mdash;will depend the success or the failure of the effort the Minister is making now.</P>
      <P>I suggest that its administration will be very difficult indeed, and while it may be said that the Bill is sufficiently clear and precise in its intentions with regard to the powers of the Credit Corporation, when the men in charge of it are up against the problems which the farmers have to solve, is when the measure will be put to the test.  I am wondering how far the Bill, as drafted, will go to meet the situation that Deputy Shaw has in mind, and I am waiting for further light from the Minister before being clear as to the usefulness of the measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very many farmers, over a very wide area, were, as Deputy Shaw said, affected, and while it is true that you may, through the instrumentality of a credit society, confer benefits on a number of farmers, through the operations of a co-operative society, and help them in the production and marketing of their produce, to my mind the men who are in the greatest need of help, the men who require credit most but whose credit requirements are most difficult to satisfy, are the thousands of farmers whose lands have been depleted of stock, who may <Col N="1548" /> be said to have very little credit and who may be able to give very little security indeed.  My difficulty in examining this measure is in trying to see how far it offers a solution of the problem that has been debated here on more than one occasion.  How far will it help to restock waste lands in Westmeath and Meath, lands in my own county and in other counties where disease carried off the stock? How far will it serve as an instrument to put farmers in those areas into a position to carry on their normal work, enable them to produce more, so that they will have more to sell and thereby be able to live?  In the administration of this measure the greatest difficulties will be met in connection with re-stocking waste lands. Honest farmers will find it difficult to give security.  If security is not forthcoming will they get credit?</P>

      <P>Then I fear that for very many men indeed this Bill will, and can, bring no relief.  The Minister may suggest as a way out that these men should come together in a credit society and that the necessary capital will be forthcoming on their collective security.  That is possible.  I would like to see such an attitude of mind on the part of farmers as would make it possible for them to work through such an organisation, but I have doubts if it will be possible.  If that cannot be done and if the necessary security is not available, because in fact hundreds of farmers in the same locality are affected in exactly the same way and the credit of all of them is lowered to such an extent that the security they offer is of very little value, what are we doing for them in this measure?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>What I would like to stress in this regard is this: It has to do particularly with the chattel mortgage, but whether it has to do with the <Col N="1549" /> chattel mortgage or with land, I feel that we have very many farmers requiring credit who will have to be dealt with individually.  In doing that there is the other side of the case.  I believe that the man responsible for determining whether a particular farmer should get a loan or not will find that, through no cause which such a man could prevent, he is also in arrears with his rates and with his annuity, perhaps, for twelve months, and the sheriff may be ready to come upon his land and take stock if stock is put there.  What is to be done in such a case?  It would not be an isolated case; there would be thousands of them, thousands of honest, industrious farmers in that position, and in dealing with the question of agricultural credit the people whose position we must particularly consider are the people whose problems are most difficult and whose cases we find it hardest to meet.  How are we to meet cases like that, which are to be encountered everywhere?  I want the Minister to tell me how such cases are to be met, and I hope that he will for my point of view, make the measure more valuable by meeting such cases without prejudicing the position of the Corporation in giving loans which may be used for purposes of production on the farm, but which loans would be in danger because of some debt incurred by the farmer through causes beyond his control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned the question of chattel mortgages.  In my view, undoubtedly, the chattel mortgage register must be secret.  It would be better if our people were prepared to understand that it was neither discreditable nor humiliating to borrow money for productive purposes.  The whole question of credit would be much simpler than it is if our people were prepared to go out openly and declare that they required money, that they were going to utilise it to the best advantage, and that they were prepared to honour their bonds.  Many of our people have feelings which make it difficult for them to declare that they are in such needy circumstances that they have to borrow money, and some of them would prefer to remain in want, utilising their holdings only to half <Col N="1550" /> their extent, rather than to declare openly that they required capital for the working of these holdings.  The number of farmers who would be prepared to make such an admission would be few.  I admit that credit would be greatly restricted if farmers have to go out into the open and admit that they require capital, and I say that the success of the chattel mortgage will entirely depend on the secrecy that is maintained in the administration of the section dealing with it.  I want further particulars as to how it is proposed to administer the Bill.  Will it be through all the joint stock banks in a town? Will any inspectors be put on direct from the Corporation, or will the banks deal with it, just as they deal with their ordinary business?</P>
    <P>With regard to the question raised by Deputy Heffernan and stressed by Deputy Johnson, which is dealt with in page 13 of the report of the Banking Commission, as to persons who bought land at peak prices, I think there is a problem here which the Minister will have to face up to.  I have not been brought very closely into touch with very many people who are in the position which I know farmers in southern counties to be in, particularly in Deputy Heffernan's constituency.  I have met a few in my own constituency, but they are not to be met with there to the same extent as elsewhere.  I refer to men who, perhaps foolishly, borrowed money and bought land at a very high price&mdash;industrious men with honest intentions who, because of the terrible depression which has since come about, have not been able to honour their bonds.  There is a great number of such farmers in some of the southern counties.  The question is, can anything be done for them, or is the problem of such magnitude and importance as to warrant the Minister or the Dáil taking notice of it?  In my view it is.  I do not for a moment suggest that men should shirk responsibilities which they have undertaken, but men can only discharge their obligations so far as it is humanly possible to do so.  The Minister is as conscious of that fact as anybody else.  He has already recognised the necessity for his Department helping co-operative societies out of difficulties.  I feel that that <Col N="1551" /> action was taken because it was recognised by the Government that if it were not taken consequences would result which would be bad for the farmers, bad for the agricultural industry, and dangerous to the stability and credit of the State.</P>

      <P>The conditions referred to by Deputy Heffernan are not unlike other conditions where the good graces of the Minister were responsible for an arrangement satisfactory not only to banks, but to farmers' organisations which found themselves in difficulties. I wonder whether the Minister would not be able to take action now, or perhaps after the General Election, if and when he comes back, which is necessary, and which would undoubtedly have good results from the point of view of benefit to farmers, and I believe even better results to the banks concerned than the alternative which they may have to face up to if the present position is allowed to continue for long. We know it is necessary at times for banks to face disagreeable things in connection with debts due to them, and to ask themselves whether an arrangement could not be made which would not be too bad for themselves and would not put the debtors down and out.  In my opinion that is the position at present of many farmers, who are affected by the very liberal policy of the banks at one time and the very foolish policy of the farmers at another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the banks could not foresee what the future held it was difficult for the farmers, who were enjoying the prosperity of the war, with banks almost pressing money on them, to realise that the slump would come which we have all experienced since.  Would it not be better from the point of view of the banks concerned that they should act sensibly and recognise that they cannot bring disaster on a wide stretch of country, or a considerable number of the citizens of a State, without also running the risk of creating instability and even worse?  You cannot drive a farmer owning 200 or 300 acres from his home without creating a very bad spirit indeed in the district <Col N="1552" />&mdash;a spirit almost one might say bordering on revolution.  When men are faced with the fact that they are not able to meet their liabilities no matter what efforts they make, and of having to leave their farms, I think the situation is sufficiently serious to warrant action being taken by the Minister similar to that which has already met with success.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows as much and probably more about this problem than I do.  I have met a few men who are intimately concerned.  They want to do what they can and to make an honest effort.  If the banks recognise that these men are anxious to do their best, I think the spirit of reasonableness is the best way out for all.  I do not know that this Bill will meet the situation in cases like that, if someone does not intervene to clear up the position and make it more satisfactory before this measure becomes operative. If the situation is unsatisfactory when this Bill becomes law, and if the Bill does not provide a solution for the difficulties of those people, and enable them to get the credit facilities which they require, the measure will fail to bring that satisfaction to the agricultural community for which we all wish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that most of us who represent the rural constituencies and have been addressing audiences during the last week must have been struck by the feeling, of nervous interest, I might almost say, with which the Bill was regarded.  I agree with the Deputy who stated that this Bill affects two or three sections of the farming community very vitally.  One section comprises those who, about 1920, bought land and paid exorbitant rates when prices were extremely high. The pressure of paying off the debts then incurred is felt very severely at present by that class.  There is also another class who suffered severely in losses of their stock during the 1924-25 period when the fluke epidemic and other diseases were prevalent throughout the country.  The results of that can be seen to-day in the understocked lands all over the country.  I think it is quite apparent that lands are very much understocked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1553" /> There is also another class of farmers feeling the pressure, that is those who under the Act of 1923 got land or additions of land, and who are in a worse condition now even than the other classes.  These people have no capital of any sort and are just hanging on trusting that something may turn up.  If something is not done there will very soon be an end of them.  Their only hope lies in a Bill of this kind, which will put them on their legs and enable them to go forward and in fact, live.</P>
    <P>There is one matter about this Bill which I think is very good.  It is evident that the names of those who find it necessary to borrow money for the purpose of freeing themselves from liabilities to the banks will not be made public, or published from the housetops, as has been the case in the matter of borrowing from the Board of Works, where every particular in connection with the loan is published and is known all over the place.  It may be a very foolish feeling, and probably it is but there are a very large number of people who do not like their neighbours to know all about their affairs: I think that is one reason that the Board of Works has not been availed of in the past as it ought to have been. People do not like their private concerns to be known or to have it known that they are in difficulties or supposed to be in difficulties, and I think this matter of secrecy is very important and will induce many people to look after their own interests much better than they have been doing heretofore. I am glad the Bill gives a chance to purchase machinery and all matters necessary for agriculture throughout the country, because there is a lamentable want of hay barns and machinery of all kinds.</P>
    <P>Everybody who lives in the country knows that farm implements are more frequently with their neighbours than with their owners during a great part of the year.  This Bill will give people a better opportunity of providing themselves with machinery and things of that sort, so that matters will be better for them and for everybody near them.</P>
    <P>There was one question that I was asked last week, and which seemed to <Col N="1554" /> trouble a great many farmers, and that is in what way is this money to be lent and what will be the rate of interest? It was not possible for me to answer that question, and I should like to know a little more about the Bill before attempting to do so.  A good many wanted to know if the money would be lent with a sinking fund so that principal and interest would be repaid in a certain number of years, or would they have to pay back the money in one lump?  It does not appear, from the Bill, how it is to be done.  Perhaps the Minister, in reply, would say something about that.  It would make a considerable difference as to the rate of interest whether it would be for a considerable number of years or only for a comparatively short period.  It is supposed, because this is called a more or less long-term Act, that the number of years would be considerable.  It will not relieve the financial difficulty of those who want to borrow unless the loans are for considerable periods.</P>

I think this is one of the great hopes that people have at the back of their minds, that there will be this consideration and that finance will not press so heavily upon them in consequence. I think there is a very general feeling of hope that out of this Bill may be evolved an improvement of the situation in the farming community which undoubtedly, everywhere, is very serious at the moment.  That there is going to be a very great and successful effort through the operations of this measure is, I think, the hope held by everyone throughout the country.</P>

      <P>It is not often that I agree with Bills introduced in this <Col N="1555" /> House since I became a member of it, but I do agree with this one.  It is a well-known fact that a very large number of small-class farmers are in a deplorable condition and are not able to meet their demands.  I hold that this Bill is going to give them great help.  I know it will enable a person, who is able to give substantial security, to borrow so that he may improve his holdings.  The Minister said that the Bill would enable farmers to purchase their raw materials at wholesale price and to get the best possible prices for what they produce on their land.  The Bill will certainly improve the position of the farming class.  Every Bill that has been introduced since the Dáil was set up has had the object of spoon-feeding the farmers, and the next thing the Minister will be introducing is a Bill to supply feeding-bottles with milk in them, so that the representatives of the farmers may be able to have some refreshments before they leave the House.</P>

      <P>I wonder why is it that in Bills of this kind we do not try and give some help to the people who are really down and out, the people who cannot pay their way because of the high cost of living, high taxation, and want of employment.  I am not going to criticise the Minister for introducing this Bill but I do say that under other Bills introduced here the big men were given protection.  The Dáil is now going to guarantee a sum of £7,500,000 for the purpose of relieving the situation that prevails amongst the farming community.  In other words, you are going to give them a guarantee that they can obtain long-term loans on reasonable terms.  There is no provision in the Bill, however, that the people who obtain these loans will be compelled to provide employment for those who are out of work at the moment, many of them because the far mer has not the money to utilise his land to the best advantage.  Loans are to be granted to the man who can offer sufficient security for the purpose of buying machinery, acquiring additional land or the construction of buildings, but the man who has no security to <Col N="1556" /> offer except his labour is offered nothing. In my opinion, those who are now being put in the position, under this Bill, of obtaining loans on easy terms should be obliged to employ one or two extra men and at a wage that could support these men and their families. Prior to 1920 we had an Agricultural Wages Board in this country.  I think the Minister should see that it is set up again.  Under that Board the agricultural labourers, were entitled to a certain wage.  At the present time the agricultural labourers throughout the Saorstát are employed at a wage that I would be ashamed to mention in this, the assembly of the Irish people. Everything introduced here is in the interests of a certain class, let it be the farming community or the capitalists of some description or other.  The demands of the ordinary workers who are the backbone of the country are ignored and forgotten in our legislation. I think the Minister ought to consider whether some kind of works ought not to be started to relieve the poverty that prevails at the present time.  I do not want to be taken as saying that the Government is not doing its best to start, works.  I know it has done a great deal.  It is not in this House alone, but elsewhere, that I have made this statement.  The Government has done a fairly good share in the way of providing funds to relieve distress, but what I do say is that it has not done sufficient.</P>

I think, however, that it should be possible, under a Bill of this kind, that where people are being granted long-term loans at reasonable rates some provision should be made whereby those obtaining the loans would be obliged to give extra employment and pay a wage capable of supporting a man and his family.  I would like to know from the Minister whether it is his intention to have the Agricultural Wages Board re-established. I know that every farmer in the country would be delighted if it were re-established.</P>

I give the Minister credit for introducing this Bill, but I say that it is not now but in 1923 it should have been brought in.  It is possible that people in some places, in Galway, for instance, may look on it now as an election stunt, but if it had been introduced in 1923 the people would say what a hero the Minister was and how he realised the necessity of improving the position of people on the land.  I fear that Deputy Baxter's prophecy may not come true: that probably we may have some other Minister when the new Dáil meets.</P>

      <P>When that time comes we may fully realise the necessity of giving the agricultural worker some chance of living in this country.  I would like to refer for a moment to the statement made by Deputy Shaw concerning the number of people who got land under the 1923 Act in Westmeath. Deputy Shaw's statement in regard to those tenants is an absolute fact.  I do not know of three people who succeeded in getting extra portions of land under the Act of 1923 who are in a position to-day to pay the annuities.  Even if they were allowed to set the land under the 11 months system, they would not get 10/- an acre.  The rent of that land is from £2 to £2 2s. 0d. per acre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased that these people will be enabled to get some help under this Bill.  I received a large number of queries from Longford-Westmeath in reference to drainage and I would like to ask the Minister whether people who wish to improve their lands by starting drainage systems, will be allowed to borrow money for that purpose.  There are several old-established drainage <Col N="1558" /> boards in Longford-Westmeath at present but people are not able to pay the rates required to carry out drainage, with the result that a very large acreage is flooded for six or eight months of the year.  If these people were enabled to borrow under this Bill for drainage purposes that would relieve the situation immensely and would improve at least 40 per cent. of the land. I welcome the Bill, and I sincerely hope that if, on the Committee Stage, amendments are moved which would give a guaranteed wage and constant employment to agricultural workers the Minister will accept them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JAMES CRAIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like in a few words to congratulate the Minister on this further evidence of his desire to help the agricultural industry. There is no doubt in the mind of anyone who goes through the country that the agricultural industry is in a poor way.  The proposal of the Minister to grant chattel mortgages is a distinct advance.  I approve very highly of that, and I further approve of the fact that any breach of these agreements is to be regarded as criminal.  I also agree that it is necessary that secrecy should be maintained with regard to the borrowing of money.  The Minister has stated here that land is not a good security.  That to a large extent is true.  Deputy Baxter has raised the point, however, that in many cases people are so poor that they will be unable to raise any security at all He did not mention what I thought he might possibly have mentioned, that already in many cases land is mortgaged. In many cases farmers will find great difficulty in raising any security whatsoever.  I do not quite see how the Minister could meet these cases.  It is a very difficult problem to say, where a man has already a mortgage on his farm and where perhaps he is considerably in debt, how it is possible for him to raise a mortgage even on his chattels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admire the small lecture the Minister gave the farmers on the morality of their attitude towards men who get in arrears and who must meet the consequences of being unable to meet their debts.  There is no question that in this country we have got into a serious <Col N="1559" /> state, and that neighbouring farmers look with great annoyance at any creditor who attempts to enforce the law or to get money that is properly due to him.  On the whole, I think this Bill is a distinct advance.  As I say, it will surely meet a great many cases, although difficulties may arise.  I rather agree with the Minister that there will not be any trouble about the maximum amount, which is here fixed at £7,500,000.  I do not think there will be any great trouble about this Corporation interfering with the other ordinary joint stock banks.  Perhaps there may be some more valid reason raised than has been raised in regard to that point, but up to the present I have not heard anything that convinced me that there is going to be any great competition between the joint stock banks and this Corporation.  On the whole, I congratulate the Minister on the advance he has made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just two questions with which I would like the Minister to deal a little more fully in his reply.  The first of these deal with the inspection of the Register of Loans. I agree to a certain extent with the expressions that have fallen from previous speakers that a certain amount of secrecy should be maintained with regard to these registers.  On the other hand, if a farmer is anxious to get credit.  I am afraid those who are forbidden to see these registers will be somewhat slow in future to extend that credit, so that this secrecy will, I am afraid, prove to be a somewhat double-edged sword.  The information, apparently, is only to be divulged to the banks or to the courts and I do not know that it is available at all for creditors under ordinary circumstances. That is a point with which I would like the Minister to deal a little more fully, because I am afraid from my knowledge of the trading community that the effect of clauses like this will be to limit the extension of credit.  The whole object of this Bill is to extend credit to enable the farmer to get more credit in the future than he has got in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point with which I would <Col N="1560" /> like the Minister to deal is possibly more serious.  I read from the report of the Banking Commission, Clause 10:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;An institution such as has been recommended on the lines of the Agricultural Credit Corporation should not in any undue way be permitted to compete with existing banks.  On the contrary it should endeavour to strengthen the banks and to make their operations more secure and more liquid.  The fact of its existence, if successful, should be a material aid to the banking system and should promote the prosperity of the banking institutions.  The proposed institution should undoubtedly have the power of buying in open market bills and notes, and selling same, but only to the extent that is incidental to its agricultural business. It should not undertake to interfere with the commercial business of the banks.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then the paragraph proceeds lower down:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We do not think of it as a competitor of the banks in any sense, although it is doubtless true that many loans of a long-term nature which are now being carried by the banks will and ought to be transferred to the new enterprise, such transfer being in the interests of the banks quite as much as in that of the farmer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Bearing that strong recommendation of the Commission in mind.  I must confess that I was a little surprised when the Minister told us that this Corporation was going to take money by way of deposit and, incidentally, to put a limit of £7,000,000 on that deposit.  Though the Minister mentioned it, I fail to find that the amount on deposit is limited in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no mention of the deposit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the question which I put to the Minister, and I inferred from his reply that there was a limit of £7,000,000.  Under the Bill I do not think that there is any limit to the amount on deposit, but that is not the point with which I am concerned at the moment.  I asked the Minister if <Col N="1561" /> there was any regulation with regard to the rate of interest to be offered for money on deposit.  Deputies will remember the important reply he gave. It was to the effect that, naturally, the Corporation would have to offer a higher rate than that of the banks in order to secure these deposits.  That, to my mind is a feature that is contrary to the recommendations of the Commission. In their report, the Banking Commission clearly set out that this Corporation was in no sense to be a competitor, but I understand from the reply which I got from the Minister that this Corporation will be a competitor with the banks for deposits and will be at liberty to offer a higher rate of interest.  That is a factor which I would like the Minister to explain more fully, as it is a rather serious departure in my opinion from the recommendations of the Banking Commission, which met with such general approval from the commercial and banking community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I look on tins Bill as carrying out a great idea.  It has been said on these benches that if something like this had been done two years ago, or even a year ago, it would have been a better method than that which has been adopted in regard to credit societies. One must, however, recognise that institutions of this description cannot be set up overnight, cannot spring up in a day.  We know now, beyond all doubt, that credit societies have not been able to deal with a certain class of borrower, because of the amount of money he would need, and with another class of borrower because, for one reason or another, he would not join a credit society.  To my mind this Bill ought to be able to get over the whole difficulty.  What else can be done, in addition to this, I fail to see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the whole difficulty of want of credit could, and should, be met by this proposition.  There is one thing I take some interest in and that is the question with regard to the amount of money.  It has been dealt with by Deputy Baxter, Deputy Heffernan and Deputy Johnson, and I take the view of Deputy Heffernan and Deputy Johnson.  This is not the first time that we have had a war, and, in <Col N="1562" /> consequence of all wars, land values jump up during the period of war.  The magnitude of the recent war was far in excess of any previous one, and the amount of gambling that took place in land values was, I think, equally in excess of any that took place in any previous war.  A certain class of people paid huge sums of money for land, and in that respect there is a very live question, especially in parts of Tipperary, where the residents have floated into other counties and created a big problem in Kildare, Dublin and elsewhere. They all came from Tipperary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, but it is not a long way to get out of it.  These people found a way out quickly enough.  I have stated here on several occasions that a wave of madness set over the country and affected not only individuals but also the banks.  If people went mad.  it is no reason why the banks should go mad.  The banks went into this as a business proposition, as a speculation, and at one period they were quite safe.  The prices paid for land in 1915, 1916, 1917, and even up to 1918, proved a good investment for the banks, and up to 1921 people who borrowed money were able to make good and, in almost every case, they were able to pay their way.  The people, however, who came along in 1921 went down with the crash which came in the autumn of that year.  The banks also went down with it.  They entered on the gamble the same as anyone else, and I say that they should be made to toe the line.  I also say that the banks should realise their securities as best they can at present, for, in two or three years' time they will realise much less as the market value will be much lower.  Things will have to come down to something approaching their real value in that time, or, at the outside, five years, and if the banks wait until then instead of realising 50 per cent. of their securities, as they could do to-day they will not be able to realise 25 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy has any intention of living by land he will not pay an exorbitant price for it.  Another question is: what will be the claim of people who bought this class of land out of their private capital if the banks are to be considered on a ratio of 100 per cent.?  This raises a big problem.  I contend that the private individual is entitled to as much consideration as the banks or the people to whom the banks lent money.  As far as I understand the suggestion, it is that the banks are to come off 100 per cent. to the good after embarking on a speculation as a simple business proposition, and I do not see why that should be so. If there is going to be a taking over at all it should be written down at the present market value.  No influence was more responsible for creating and fostering the wave of land madness that reached its height about 1920 than the banks.  They are more responsible than the individuals concerned.  I would like to know if the British Government, or any government in any country, compensate their banks for any losses they meet in home or foreign investments. If they do, I do not grumble at this proposal, but in my opinion there is no parallel in any other country for what is proposed here.  It is a bad policy to act upon that the State must make good any mistake made in business, and the sooner it is departed from the better.  I have very little to quarrel with regarding the questions asked by Deputy Good.  They are material questions. I would like to know with regard to advances made by the banks to farmers, who will have the prior claim?</P>

      <P>I rather agree with Deputy Good that secrecy beyond a certain point would be undesirable.  I think it would be found that business firms would be very slow in the future to give credit to people if they are precluded from making investigations and getting information in a reasonable <Col N="1564" /> way.  As a layman I have nothing to say on the question as to whether the bank should take money on deposit or not, but I do not agree altogether with Deputy Good's attitude, which is purely a banker's attitude.  While wishing to treat the banks fairly well, I will not take up a banker's attitude, and I prefer to look at it in a broader way than that.  The banks, in my opinion, should get credit for the value of their investments up to date, and the State should take no more liability than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. NOLAN Mr. NOLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NOLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Every farmer recognises the need of future credit.  The administration of future credit will depend on the success of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  If the interest charged in the first place is too high it will be nearly impossible for the farmers to recognise their liabilities, but on the other hand if there is a reasonable interest an honest attempt should be made to do so.  I agree to a great extent with Deputy Heffernan that the Bill will not meet the demand for credit by farmers, but it would be very hard to supply all the credit required. If the farmers adopt the policy recently adopted by the Farmers' Defence League in Tipperary I am afraid no banking system will be able to meet their credit needs, for where is the agricultural creditor to get money from but the depositors?  The adoption of the Tipperary policy would mean depositors would get scared and immediately withdraw their money from the fund.  That policy is the payment of only 25 per cent. of your liabilities. After all, depositors are just as fond of their cash as any other class of people, and I am astonished deposits have not been reduced more than they have during the last twelve months.  It was my opinion when I first learned of the policy of the Farmers' Defence League in Tipperary that there would be a withdrawal of deposits from the banks, and I expect that policy is responsible for the reduction that has taken place.  Deputy Heffernan, apparently, is not satisfied with the report of the Banking Commission.  The Deputy's attitude, I think, with regard to that Commission was to ignore it, and he advised the farmers to keep <Col N="1565" /> away from it.  I think the proper course for the farmers would have been to go into the Banking Commission and give evidence, and see whether they could get the Commission to approve of their views.  As I have said, if farmers are not inclined to meet their liabilities they cannot get much credit.  We had Deputy Heffernan's views during the Land Bill discussion regarding the seizing of stock of defaulting annuitants. The Land Commission have the first claim on the land, and if they are not able to seize the stock or chattels on these lands in lieu of payment of annuities I do not see how the bank will be able to do it.  I can understand the farmers being in a bad way in Tipperary occasionally, but when you have an organisation of repudiation it is difficult to get credit.</P>

      <P>The object of the Bill is one that will commend itself to every Deputy.  I have examined the Bill fairly carefully, and the speeches of Deputies have thrown some light on the dark places in it.  I do not think <Col N="1566" /> anybody has put a question as to who the trustees are who are referred to in the Schedule&mdash;the trustees who are to take charge of the securities held against the certificate of charge.  Does the Minister propose to establish a Board of Trustees for this particular purpose?  Those trustees will have responsible duties.  To some extent, they will have to estimate the value of the mortgage securities they hold.  I should like if the Minister would throw some light on that question in his reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. RODDY</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that this Bill represents a new phase of agricultural development in this country. This is one of the few States in which farmers have got no special banking facilities.  The present Bill is designed to remedy that defect.  I should have liked the Minister to have gone a little further in certain directions, but I realise that, in a matter of this kind, involving a large amount of State finance, one must proceed warily.  The Minister must wait until he sees in what direction agricultural development will take place.  I agree with Deputy Baxter that the Bill is not going to cure all the farmer's ills.  It is not going to serve as a general panacea. But if the farmer accepts the Bill in the spirit in which it is offered, and if he adopts the methods employed by his competitors in the English market, by cheapening the process of production and improving his marketing organisations, then he will benefit much by this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not quite clear from the Bill what the exact relationship will be in the future between the agricultural credit societies and the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  Does the Minister contemplate the utilisation of the agricultural credit societies in the rural areas as agencies for disbursing the loans to small farmers, or will that responsibility be thrown entirely on the joint stock banks in the towns and cities?  It is not quite clear from the Bill what function the agricultural credit societies are to fulfil in the future, or what their relationship is to be to the Agricultural Credit Corporation. I should like if the Minister would give us some information on that point in his reply, and if he would <Col N="1567" /> state whether he contemplates continuing the agricultural credit societies on their present lines.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wolfe stated that the farmers did not avail of the long-term loans given by the Board of Works because of the publication they involved. There is another reason why small farmers did not avail more extensively of these loans.  The buildings specified by the Board of Works were too elaborate and too costly, and were entirely unsuited to the needs of the small farmers.  The form of security required&mdash;a mortgage security&mdash;was apparently another reason why the small farmers did not avail themselves as extensively as they should have done of these loans.  I assume that under this Bill it will be possible for the farmers to get loans of this kind without being under the necessity of giving mortgage security.  I hope it will be possible to get loans on personal security or on some form of security simpler than mortgage security.  I hope, too, that the small farmers will not be asked to erect such elaborate structures as they were required to erect in order to obtain loans from the Board of Works.</P>
    <P>There is, after all, something in the nature of a problem in connection with the farmers who borrowed money from the banks, primarily for the purchase of land, during the war period.  This problem exists in other countries, but it was aggravated here, not only because of the Great War, but because of the civil troubles which followed. The problem is there.  In every county in the Saorstát there are farmers who find themselves in an unfortunate position, not through their own fault. There are many farmers, who, heretofore, were most industrious, in this unfortunate position at the moment.  I do not think that one can blame them for speculating in, at that time, what has since transpired to be, reckless fashion.  The temptation was there, and it was very difficult to resist the temptation to speculate, in the hope of making big profits.  I do not know what the exact extent of the problem is, but from what I know of the conditions in my own constituency, and from inquiries made.  I am aware that <Col N="1568" /> there are quite a number of farmers in this unfortunate position.  I think something should be done to deal with the problem.  I am anxious to know if the Minister has given any special thought to the question, and if it is intended to deal with it under this Bill in any way.  It is suggested in the Banking Commission's report, as quoted by Deputy Johnson, that some understanding in connection with this matter should be reached between the banks and the Minister.  I am anxious to know whether the Minister has given consideration to the problem, and how he proposes to deal with it.</P>

      <P>Some Deputies seem to be under the impression that this Corporation will take over bankrupt loans from the banks.  That is not the intention. There is no warranty for that point of view in the Bill.  There is nothing in the Bill that would lead anyone to conclude that it is the intention of the Agricultural Credit Corporation to take over bankrupt loans from the banks.  If such a course were to be taken, obviously it should be set out specifically in the Bill.  Obviously, if it is not set out specifically in the Bill, the new Corporation is not going to do as suggested.  Deputy Johnson asked&mdash;quite rightly&mdash;what guarantee had we that this Corporation will not be so much under the influence of the joint stock banks that they will be able to unload on it some of their worst loans.  The answer to that is clear enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The joint stock banks get 200,000 shares and a sufficient number of directors to correspond with that 200,000, out of 500,000 shares.  Therefore they must be in a minority.  In any event, even though the Minister for Finance may not be under the necessity of taking up the balance of the share capital because it has already been taken up by the public, he will be entitled to four directors.  If he takes up more than 200,000 shares he will be entitled to a fifth, who will be chairman.  That is a sufficient guarantee, from the point of view of the Minister for Finance, that unwise loans shall not be taken over by the Corporation and that the interest of the Corporation shall not be <Col N="1569" /> sacrificed to the interest of the joint stock banks.  I entirely agree with Deputy Johnson, that the Agricultural Credit Corporation should have protection, as he put it, from the banks in this respect.  I entirely agree that it should not be asked to take over unwise loans or loans that are not liquid.</P>

      <P>Section 11 is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Articles of Association of the Corporation shall provide that the number of directors (including the chairman) shall be ten, of whom four (not including the chairman) shall be nominated by the Minister from time to time as occasion requires and that if and so long as the Minister holds more than two hundred thousand shares of the Corporation the chairman of the Corporation shall be nominated (in addition to the said four directors) by the Minister from time to time as occasion offers.</P>
      <P>You have to read that in connection with the provision as to the number of shares to be allotted to the public. Section 5 says:</P>
      <P>Two hundred thousand shares of the Corporation shall be offered at the one time for subscription only by banks carrying on business either wholly or partly in Saorstát Eireann and as soon as may be after the expiration of the time limited with the approval of the Minister for such subscription the remaining three hundred thousand shares of the Corporation and such if any of the said two hundred thousand shares as shall not have been subscribed for by such banks shall be offered at the one time for subscription by members of the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) All shares of the Corporation offered for subscription by the general <Col N="1570" /> public and not so subscribed for shall at the expiration of the time limited with the approval of the Minister for such subscription be subscribed for by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that these shares will be offered to the public.  If the banks, or banks' friends, take up all the shares except those held by the Minister, they may have a majority of the directors.  The banks may constitute the public and may, as a result, obtain a majority on the directorate.</P>

It is absolutely essential to see that the directors of the Corporation shall be in a position to judge, without bias and without intimidation of any kind, what loans they will take over and what loans they will not take over. If it is necessary to make the matter clearer on Committee Stage I am quite willing to do it.</P>

      <P>That will be provided by the Articles of Association.  However, we are not concerned with details here, but with the principle of the Bill. I agree with Deputy Johnson that it is necessary to make it quite clear that the Corporation shall be in an independent position to judge as to what <Col N="1571" /> loans they shall take over and what loans they shall not.  I cannot see the directors of the Corporation taking over any loans that are bankrupt.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Loans that are not liquid.  It was never intended that this should be a means of relieving the joint stock banks of their liabilities.  The sort of loan, I think, they must take over is this the loan quite secured but that should be a long-term instead of a short-term loan.  That will be of very great advantage to the farmer who has a big loan&mdash;a loan fully secured which he could pay off if he could get reasonable time.  This bank will take it over and change it from a short to a long-term loan.  It will become a long or an intermediate-term instead of a short-term loan.  It is only in that way that this particular institution will come to the rescue of existing obligations.  That is the main way in which I can see it coming to the aid of existing obligations.</P>
      <P>Now, there seems to be some confusion about the position of the joint stock banks in connection with loans which they have made.  People say that the banks should make sacrifices also.  The land is not worth anything like what it was when they bought it, and the bank should make sacrifices. If the security is not worth the amount borrowed on it the bank must make sacrifices.  Let us examine the question. If the bank lends £2,000 on land which is only worth £1,000 in the open market, they have suffered a loss of £1,000.  That is not the point.  What is complained of is that the bank holds securities worth £2,000 and are asked to take £1,000.  I see no justification for that.  The problem is widespread. It applies not only to farmers, but to professional men and shopkeepers and even to labourers in their own way.  It applies all over the world to every profession.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister mean to say that he knows places that are security at present for the advances of the bank?  Does that imply that where a farm cost £5,000, £3,000 of which was found by the individual and £2,000 <Col N="1572" /> advanced by the bank, the bank should get the £2,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  A bank lent money on security which was then worth £5,000.  It was a business transaction. They measured their security and found it worth £5,000.  Now, it is worth £3,000.  All they lent was £2,000.  Why should they not get the £2,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>The unfortunate buyer suffered the whole loss of the gamble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>How does he?  It was a business transaction with the bank, which was covered by the security. If you make an exception in the case of the farmer, must you not make an exception for the shopkeeper?  If you make an exception for the farmer in that direction you must make it in every other direction also.  Supposing the farmer put £1,000 on deposit in the bank in 1920 and has it still.  There must be some such cases.  Of the £130,000,000 deposit in the Irish joint stock banks there must be a very big proportion of agricultural deposits which have remained there since the war.  There must be ten, twelve or fifteen millions at the very least.  Supposing a man deposited £200 in 1920. The bank which had to write down a security from £2,000 to £1,000, notwithstanding that the property is still worth £2,000, could go to any farmer and say, &ldquo;You put in £200 in 1920, and you got all the advantages of the inflated money in 1920.  You should only get £150 now.&rdquo;  One side of the picture is that you borrowed £200 in 1920.  Now you are only able to pay £100.  The bank manager will say, &ldquo;You put in £200 in 1920.  Money was inflated then.  You cannot have it both ways.  You must take £100 for that.&rdquo; If you want to draw the 1920 line and start your deductions from there, you must accept the consequences, whether they are for or against the farmer.  Undoubtedly banks would have a perfect case for saying, &ldquo;Why should we pay back £200 deposited when money was inflated if you say we should not get the full amount of the money we lent you in 1920?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I only wanted to have <Col N="1573" /> made clear, if the banks advanced the whole money and if there was to be any policy of compensating them 100 per cent. what the position would be of the farmer who partly or wholly bought the place himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that there is no question of compensating the banks, none whatever.  This institution is not going to take over bankrupt or unsound loans.  It is only going to take over sound loans.  It is going to relieve the farmer by making them long-term or intermediate instead of short-term loans, but there is going to be no question about compensation. Now, as to the other point.  A number of Deputies pointed out that it was a serious problem, but they seem to be under a wrong impression as to the whole matter.  For instance the expression was used that the banks are to make sacrifices.  They do.  Take the case of a bank that lent £2,000 on a security that is now worth £1,000, That bank loses the difference.  But it is a different matter if a bank lends on a security that is still worth the amount of the loan.  The bank is entitled to recover the money it lent.  If not you re-open a bigger question than most Deputies seem to realise.  We cannot do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the case of a man who had £5,000 and borrowed £12,000 from the bank and with the £17,000 bought a farm.  The bank would probably realise a considerable proportion of that now, but it would only do it by selling out a number of other people, or perhaps attempting to sell them out.  With him it will sell out probably nine or ten other people as a consequence.  What can be done in a number of cases like that by intervention to try and clear up the position? I recognise the difficulty, but there is no good in the borrowers saying &ldquo;we will not pay,&rdquo; or &ldquo;we will pay so much.&rdquo;  That policy is impossible, but I suggest there is an alternative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>My answer is that I cannot do anything, and I do not believe that any member of the Government or any Government official can do anything in the matter.  But the banks, <Col N="1574" /> as a rule, face up to the position themselves. They take into account what their securities are worth.  If they believe that their securities are not worth the full value of the loan they are willing to compromise.  They go into the question of what it will cost them to liquidate the debt.  In the ordinary way they cannot liquidate a debt without a certain amount of expense. Then they come to a voluntary settlement and if they think it is better business to come to a voluntary settlement they settle it voluntarily.  But no government can do anything in a matter like that.  What I am concerned to point out is that if there are compositions then those compositions must be between the banks and the creditors, and it is open to this bank after a composition has been come to to take over the compounded debt and change it from a short-term loan into a long-term loan.  A certain amount of that alteration will be done, but it must be done as a business proposition.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Johnson that some limit should be put in before &ldquo;purchase.&rdquo;  The words &ldquo;purchasing land&rdquo; should be &ldquo;purchasing agricultural land.&rdquo;  It was a mistake to omit that limitation.  It is quite impossible to make any discrimination in favour of a man who is tilling a certain portion of his land.  But that question does arise.  It arises when the man is asking for a loan.  Any bank manager will take into account what sort the man is who is asking for the loan.  The first question he will ask is: &ldquo;Is he a thrifty farmer?&rdquo; and the answer to that lies in how much land he tills. You cannot generalise about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>What does that prove?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the small farmer. The man who is tilling an extra bit of land is generally a better man and he will get more money.  It ought to be clear also that this Corporation is not going to lend money without security. Deputy Baxter asked: &ldquo;What about the man who has no security?&rdquo;  The man who has no security gets no money.  But there are different kinds of securities.  There is the security that property gives and there is the security of character.  There are very few farmers <Col N="1575" /> in Ireland who have not some little property to give as security. There is no doubt about it that a very small property security together with a considerable security, such as the character of the farmer, would be regarded as good security.  A farmer of good character would go a long way in getting security from a bank.  If the banks get a really honest farmer with a small property they will give him more than they would give the other sort of man who has a great deal more property. There are, in practice, very few farmers who cannot offer some security. Deputy Baxter asked me what would be the position of a man who owed his rent and rates and a couple of hundred pounds besides, how was he going to be taken out of his position?  That man is not going to be benefited.  That man is bankrupt and nothing can take him out of it.  That man has reached a point when debts exceed assets, and he has little hope except there is a windfall.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on the special circumstances of the case.  A man who owes rent and rates and who has no stock on his land is in a very different position from the man who has his land stocked and owes rent and rates but nothing else.  That man is solvent and can always get money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gorey shakes his head.  He can always get money from a bank of this sort.  I was asked by Deputy Roddy about credit societies. Will this Corporation deal with the ordinary farmer through credit societies exclusively?  Of course it will not.  It will be necessary for the Corporation to have agents, and the most suitable agents are the joint stock banks in every town.  I do not expect there will be any difficulty in getting these banks as agents.  Again, of course, that is a commercial proposition.  To my mind it is quite a suitable method. So far as the credit societies are concerned <Col N="1576" /> these will be found particularly useful along the western seaboard where the average man wants to borrow anything from £10 to £40.  They are particularly suitable in these districts along the western seaboard and for the poorer districts all over the country.  This Corporation will deal with the farmers of these districts through their credit societies.</P>
      <P>Deputy Good asked me two questions. He pointed out that a secret register has advantages and disadvantages. A secret register, he mentioned, is going to limit credit from other sources.  That is the rock on which this question has split on many occasions. That is a matter on which the Commission deliberated carefully.  It is quite evident the moment you begin to consider chattel mortgages that secrecy is necessary, but, on the other hand, secrecy will limit credit from any other source.  That is the particular problem that has come up for consideration very often.  You have to consider the greater of two evils.  My view is it is more important for the small farmer to get reasonable credit from banks than from any other source.  It might be an advantage to have some of the other credits dried up or limited.  The important thing is that he can get reasonable credits at reasonable rates of interest from the bodies that exist for that purpose, and, outside that, that he does a cash business so far as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>He will know in good time.  As regards deposits, I stated before that the Banking Commission did not recommend that this bank should take deposits.  We followed the Banking Commission report very closely.  It is a very sound report, but it is not gospel and was not intended to be.  I think that if the proposition I have already put were made to the most of the banks they would agree to it&mdash;that some deposits should be taken by this Corporation.  Deposits can be got more cheaply than money on certificates or share capital, and it is an advantage to this bank to have a certain amount of cheap money.  Deposits <Col N="1577" /> are not suitable for lending on long terms, but there will be a certain amount of intermediate term business and a certain amount of deposits will undoubtedly help.</P>

I understand it is common form when debentures are issued that the security is placed in the name of trustees.  I think that is more or less to impress the public.  Rather big names are put up as trustees, and people are, therefore, more likely to lend money.  That is not necessary in this case, because the real guarantee is the Minister for Finance.  The trustees will be required, so far as you have them, in order to secure the Minister for Finance, and his real trustees are the directors.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1927.  This brief Bill purports to bring the electoral law and machinery into line with the Constitution, as recently amended, and to remove other anomalies which are more or less consequential on the amendments.  The amendments, which make these alterations in the electoral law essential, are, first of all, the re-election of the Ceann Comhairle; the deletion of the provision that the day of the election shall be a public holiday; and, third, extension of the duration of the Oireachtas.  This Bill is mainly intended to give effect to the altered Constitution. The other provisions, as I say, are mainly consequential.  So long as the day of polling is not a public holiday, it is better not to fix that day on a Monday, which is in many respects the worst day, as the ballot boxes have to remain over night in the houses of the presiding officers, which is not always an advisable thing.  The Bill gives a certain amount of elasticity as regards the day.  We are not tied to Monday or any other particular day That is a good thing, because if you fix a particular day you may find that it falls on some holiday, such as the 12th of July, which would not be satisfactory in some districts for polling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the duration of the <Col N="1580" /> Oireachtas, it is suggested that the limit be five years.  In a case of emergency, the limit can be extended to the full period in the Constitution, six years.  The hours of polling will also be extended under the Bill.  That is necessary in order to make up for the fact that the polling day will not be a holiday, and, accordingly, people will not have the same facilities for voting.  The other portions of the Bill refer more particularly to the general election, which is due to be held this year.  The actual date of the election will depend largely on the date of the dissolution.  The new register is being prepared, and it will be well to hold the election on that register.  This will be the case if the Dáil dissolves any time after the middle of May. Two possible complications have to be met.  The university register comes into force on the 15th of June, and the register in the other constituencies on the 1st of June.  It is proposed to bring both registers into line to come into force on the 1st of June.  If the Dáil is dissolved towards the end of May, that is another difficulty&mdash;the last day for nominations will be early in June, and the nomination papers must be checked against the register in force on the particular day they were received.  This might possibly be a source of confusion, which the Bill removes, by providing that, so long as a person is registered as an elector on the register in force for any portion of the period for the receipt of nominations, he is to be considered as a registered elector, and, accordingly, he can nominate a candidate.  Briefly, that is all the Bill purports to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not much to be said as regards the principles of this measure, inasmuch as we were all warned of the necessity for it after the passing of the Constitution Amendment Bill.  There are one or two points of detail that I think ought to be amended, and that it would be more convenient to deal with now.  In the first place, I refer to the hours fixed in sub-section 3 of Section 3, from 9 o'clock in the forenoon till 8 o'clock in the afternoon. In the discussion that took place at the Committee dealing with the proposed change in the Constitution this question <Col N="1581" /> was referred to in connection with the proposed abolition of the public holiday. As the Minister has pointed out, some change is necessary, consequent on the abolition of the holiday, but the change proposed here is not at all satisfactory.</P>
      <P>We must think of it in the light of the practice regarding summer-time in the country.  Notwithstanding the law, it is the practice to recognise the old time, even during the summer months. Consequently, to close the poll at 8 o'clock in the evening will mean that very large numbers will be kept from voting.  I made the suggestion at that Committee that it would tend to increase the convenience of the polling day, and increase the total poll, if instead of an early morning opening and an early evening close, we might even postpone the opening of the poll until, say, eleven o'clock and keep it open till 10 o'clock at night.  Some people think 10 o'clock at night too late for country districts, but 8 o'clock is certainly too early.  If it is the view of the House that 10 p.m. is too late, I would press very strongly for 9 o'clock at night at the very earliest, even if we had a 10 or 11 o'clock opening in the morning.  It is pretty generally recognised that the morning hours of polling are very slack, and are quite unnecessary, either in town or country.  We can afford to be elastic in that and still fit the convenience of the people engaged in the business of the election.</P>
      <P>A thirteen or fourteen hours day is almost too much for electioneering, whether behind the ballot box or for people working in the election, and I think all the requirements would be met, if, say, 10 in the morning were the hour of opening, whether in town or country, and I would suggest the possibility of a 10 o'clock closing in the cities, and, perhaps, 9 o'clock in the country.  I certainly would strongly urge the necessity for having the poll open until 9 o'clock whether in town or country, and I hope that this decision of 9 o'clock in the morning to 8 o'clock in the evening is not a final one, and that the Minister will accept this suggestion of a later hour of closing the poll, whether he alters the hour of opening or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1582" /> I think that there is an omission from the Bill which might well have been dealt with, and it is not a matter affecting one party more than another.  I refer to the question of the deposit and the conditions under which the deposit will be returned.  I do not know whether this would constitute the kind of amendment which would be reserved to the Minister, but I would urge upon Ministers and upon the Dáil that the condition of the present Act, requiring the candidate to receive one-third of the quota before he can get the return of his deposit, is unnecessarily severe, and is not required to meet the purposes of the deposit.  I think everybody will admit that the idea behind this provision regarding deposits was to prevent forcing elections, forcing the community into expense merely for a sport candidate, and to prevent the irruption of all kinds of freak candidates into an election.  While one may not, perhaps, like this kind of a monetary test of a man's ability and capacity, it is the law at any rate, and we are not making a major change. But I press this idea on Ministers and on the House, that the third of the quota is unnecessarily high for the purpose of achieving the end aimed at by this provision regarding deposits, and it works inequitably as between one constituency and another.  I accidentally found this morning a cutting from a newspaper dealing with the last election.  It states that up to that date ninety-seven forfeits in twenty-one constituencies had been made owing to the absence of the quota.</P>
    <P>I know that in a number of those cases, and in some of the by-elections, the candidate who had to forfeit his deposit was by no means a freak candidate, and in the case of a general election you are not preventing a contest. A candidate goes forward as one of a group, with quite a solid backing and a legitimate aspiration for election, with perhaps a strong body of opinion behind him, but he happens to be one more than that group is able to carry home.  I think it is quite inequitable and unreasonable that that particular candidate should have to forfeit these deposits in the same way as if he were a candidate who had no backing and support.  So much depends upon the <Col N="1583" /> extent of the poll.  Under the present method there is an actual advantage to a man, if he had a modicum of support which he can rely upon, to prevent a heavy poll.  A man might find that he could rely upon 2,000 or 3,000 votes, and it would be to his advantage to urge that there should not be a heavy poll.  I think that that is quite a drawback to the system, and it should not be a temptation to anybody to urge a small poll.  Take two constituencies. In one the quota is perhaps 10,000 and in the other the quota is 5,000.  One-third of 5,000 is only a half one-third of 10,000, and yet in the one case the man may have twice the number of supporters that the other man may have and still be obliged to forfeit his deposit.  I say that that is inequitable, and I submit that the way this should be met is that a certain fixed figure, covering the whole country, should be named as a minimum, whether it amounts to one-third of the quota or not, and that that figure, having been reached, might be reckoned to be the figure which would warrant the return of the deposit.  No particular Party is affected by this more than another, but I think that the provision militates against the success of an election and is inequitable, and we might well alter it without any loss, except perhaps £1,000 or £2,000 to the Minister for Finance.  I do not think the Minister for Finance should be a participant in the profits of forfeits, and I urge upon the Minister the desirability of introducing an amendment to the Bill dealing with this question of forfeits and altering the present law, so that, let us say, one-fifth of the quota, or 1,500 or 2,000 votes, whichever is the smaller number, should be required by a candidate before his deposit is returned. Otherwise I think the Bill is merely a matter of machinery and one which, as we have passed amendments to the Constitution, is necessary and calls for no comment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am, in general, in agreement both with the Minister and with Deputy Johnson.  I think the Bill is a necessary one and an improvement on our present machinery, and I <Col N="1584" /> specially welcome what the Minister describes as consequential provisions, that the polling date need not necessarily be a Monday and is not to be a public holiday, because it is, I think, desirable in the interests of the State that as many people should vote as possible. There was a tendency in certain quarters, when polling day was a Monday and a public holiday, to regard it as a bank holiday which justified a long week-end and took the voter away from home and away from the polling booth where he was needed.  I am very glad from that point of view that this Bill has been brought in.  But I wish it had been possible to introduce a longer and more comprehensive Bill, and I wish it had been based, not on the report of a committee consisting of officials and members of the Government, but of a committee representative of all Parties.  But it will not be difficult for the Government to get the goodwill of all Parties in the matter of electoral reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We realise the disadvantage of the present situation, and there would be more force behind the measure of electoral reform if it came as the result of previous consultation and agreement between all Parties of the Dáil.  However, I want rather to call attention to the omissions.  I agree with Deputy Johnson on the question of polling hours.  I do not know that I would go quite so far as he does in suggesting that the poll might not be opened until 11 o'clock, because it is of some convenience to candidates, and of some convenience to voters if they can vote before going to their work.  The present Bill provides for eleven hours' polling.  Seventeen years ago the polling period was always twelve hours, and I believe in Great Britain now it can be made thirteen hours, and that under a much simpler and less complicated method of election than ours is. In Great Britain all that the voter has to do is to get the ballot paper, with two or three names on it, and put a cross on it.  We are handed a list of anything from eighteen to twenty-five names on which we have to mark our preferences&mdash;1, 2, 3, and so on.  It is a slower and more complicated process, <Col N="1585" /> and I think it is therefore strongly arguable that at least as much time should be afforded to the voter in carrying out this slower process as is afforded to the voter under the simpler system in Great Britain.  I also agree with Deputy Johnson in regretting that no provision has been made as to the forfeit of deposits.  I do not think that the existing law on the subject would stand examination from the point of view of proportional representation. A man may have a very considerable amount of support in a constituency and yet not be able to get 2,000 first preference votes, and in County Dublin it was necessary to get at least 2,000 first preferences at the last election in order to be sure not to forfeit your deposit.</P>

Fortunately, from the Cumann na nGaedheal point of view, in the last election the Minister for Justice obtained three times the quota, and his transfers enabled the other Cumann na nGaedheal candidates, except, I think, one, to make themselves safe, but it might be quite possible for a candidate getting 1,000 first preferences to forfeit his deposit. Anybody who can get 1,000 preferences has some solid support behind him.  I do not think the Minister for Finance has made any provision in the Budget for these forfeited deposits.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister for Local Government could make <Col N="1586" /> this concession, and say that anybody who gets less than 1,000 first preference votes should forfeit his deposit, without seriously deranging the calculations of the Minister for Finance.  I pass on to two points of my own.  The first is that I do very deeply regret that in this Bill there has been no reform of the existing system of registration.  I do not think the present system of registration is at all suited to the conditions of this country, because it is an entirely irresponsible registration.  I think anybody with any experience of the working of a big constituency knows that the registration is extraordinarily patchy&mdash;that in some parts of the constituency it is done extremely well, and in others you find omissions and misdescriptions, people coming in and saying that their Christian name is not James but John, and things of that kind.  That is because it is done by entirely irresponsible people who are not the servants of the State but the servants of the local authority.  Whatever their errors are, and however carelessly they do their work, there is no means of bringing them to book.  I think the Minister for Justice once said that he did not believe that registration would ever be satisfactory until it was done by people on a uniform system&mdash;by the Gárda, for instance.</P>

      <P>That is not the point I wish to correct the Deputy on, but the point that the registers are not correct&mdash;that there have been mistakes, misdescriptions and so on.  That is not the case.  Every year the register is more perfect than the previous year, and no matter what alterations may have been made regarding registration generally, it is as correct now, having regard to the system that has been adopted, as is humanly possible in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to hear it, and I hope the President's statement will be borne out.  I think the existing system is very far from perfect.  The President could hardly answer for every individual rate collector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate collectors have been followed practically all over the country and checked, and I think at least one or two have paid the penalty for not being more correct in regard to their work.  It has had a wonderful effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear that.  I hope also that steps have been taken to see that the rate collectors go to the head of the house for the information with regard to the register, because in my experience the man compiling the register has come and talked to servants, and taken from them the Christian names and so on of which they had no knowledge whatever, instead of approaching the head of the house.  That has happened within the last year.  The system is not perfect, and I do not think the rate-collector system was ever a desirable one in this country.  You would want to get somebody not concerned in local politics, like a member of the Gárda, who comes from a different district and is not vitally concerned.  I do not think that anybody, whatever his party feelings are, would suggest that a Gárda entrusted with a responsible duty of that kind would act as a partisan.  I think that that would be a better system and I hope the Government will consider it.  The Government, after all, are <i>in articulo mortis</i>&mdash;they might make their soul, not by any amendment of this Bill, because I realise that it would be a big amendment to bring in at present, <Col N="1588" /> but by a pledge that if they survive the election and are still the Government they would then go into this matter again.  The other point I should like to raise is redistribution.  There is a provision in the Constitution that after a census there should be a redistribution. That has not been carried out.  It would deprive certain constituencies of a number of Deputies, which I should regret.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>The population of Co. Dublin has gone up to such an extent that one extra Deputy would be returned to this Dáil.  I regret that, not because I am particularly afraid for myself, but because I feel that possibly some very valuable Deputy in this Dáil may find himself denied, and if I did not happen to raise this question I should reproach myself.  I want to go further.  I do not think our existing constituencies are in many cases laid out on the wisest lines.  I think they are too large.  It is very hard to serve 97,000 people.  It may be possible to do it when you are one of a Party and can devolve your duties on colleagues.  But where there is one Deputy of a Party, say the Farmers' Party, or one Independent Deputy returned for a big constituency the work is almost more than he can perform if he tries to do it conscientiously.  It is not only in County Dublin.  It is the same in Tirconaill and Galway and Tipperary.  In any of the big county constituencies returning from seven to nine Deputies the work is very heavy indeed.  It is even more so in what I might call the linked constituencies&mdash; Carlow-Kilkenny for instance.  I do not know whether there are any secret affinities between Carlow and Kilkenny which make the link desirable, but I know there are very few between Sligo and Leitrim.  I think these constituencies might well be divided.  Sligo and Leitrim return seven, so that four Deputies should be returned from one and three from the other.  It is said that these big constituencies are a protection to the minority.  I do not think that is the case.  You have only to look at Wicklow and Kildare, each returning <Col N="1589" /> only three Deputies and returning three Deputies of different parties &mdash;Wicklow returning Deputy Everett, Labour; Deputy Wilson, Farmer; and Deputy C. Byrne, Clan Eireann; Kildare returning Deputy Conlan, Farmer; Deputy Wolfe, Cumann na nGaedheal; and Deputy Colohan, Labour. The minority gets a show even in a small constituency, and I wish that there was some redistribution, some reduction of those linked constituencies, and possibly some division of the larger counties.  You could divide Co. Dublin into Dublin North of the Liffey and Dublin South of the Liffey, one returning five members and one returning three, in the same way.  It would make for a better performance of our duties as public representatives. Though I regret the Government have not had time to deal with these things, and that they have not consulted other Parties in the House in order to deal with them, still the Bill is an improvement, and I support it.</P>

      <P>I wish to make one point clear.  When I said that the rate collectors were followed I did not mean in the county or city of Dublin, and I did not mean any district round about here.  It was one particular part of the country where we learned the returns were not correct. I think anybody who followed registration generally will pay tribute to the great improvement that has taken place.  The underlying idea was that the register should be compiled free from the usual support, which was traditional in this country, of the various political parties; that it should be a correct register of electors, and every year it is becoming more and more perfect.  I should say that, probably the 1927 register, that is the register coming on now, will be the best yet produced in the country, and I should say that by 1930 the register will be the best in any country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add to what the President said that I have had some experience, recently, in connection with the checking of some of the work done and from the figures put before me I was certainly, like <Col N="1590" /> the President, surprised at the small number of errors over a very large area.  I agree that there has been a marked improvement in the preparation of recent registers.  Now with regard to the hours of polling, I cannot say I am in agreement with either Deputy Johnson or Deputy Cooper. It has been settled that the election day should not be a holiday.  That means that it will be an ordinary day in which one carries on one's ordinary duties.  Deputies must be aware that a great many working men and ordinary business men go to the country early in the day and return back late in the evening.  I happen to know a very large number of such.  If the polling hours are fixed, as Deputy Johnson suggests, to start at 11 o'clock in the morning, it would be impossible for those men to poll before going to the country.  I am afraid that would disfranchise a very considerable number of them.  Numbers of these men come up from different parts of the country the night before, and leave in the morning after they have voted, returning to where they are carrying on work.  The hours in the Bill for voting are from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.</P>
      <P>Instead of moving with Deputy Johnson in the direction of starting later and finishing later, I would prefer to go in the other direction.  I would like to see 8 o'clock substituted for 9 o'clock in the morning because that would afford great convenience to a considerable number.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>A great many do not return at all.  Large numbers of them are travellers, and there are a great many in the Deputy's own constituency, who come up the night before for the purpose of voting.  They vote early in the morning, and then they take the train and go off to the country, where they work, and possibly do not come back again until the end of the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of extending the hour of 8 o'clock in the evening, it has been my experience, and possibly it is borne out by the experience <Col N="1591" /> of others, that more &ldquo;dead men&rdquo; vote after seven o'clock in the evening than at any other time.  That is an extraordinary fact, but I think it will be found to be so, and I do not think it is a very desirable condition of things.  I do not lay much stress upon it, but I do upon the other point, that it would be desirable, if possible, to start a little earlier in the morning, rather than later.  For those engaged in the polling booths during the month of June, I do not think it is very desirable to keep them longer than eleven hours.  For these reasons I would not be in favour of extending the hours longer than those proposed in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I wish to draw attention to what I consider the greatest defect in our electoral system, and that is the responsibility thrown upon the various candidates in supplying the electors with their number on the register and their place of polling, and with the letter of the table at which they are to poll.  It is a big responsibility for a candidate who has 95,000 electors on the register.  It may have been noticed that at the last election, at least in two constituencies, only two candidates went to the trouble of supplying the electors with their official numbers.  Just consider what the position would have been had these two candidates not issued to the public their numbers, and if they had taken the same chances as other candidates, and just issued an ordinary private card, with no information whatever on it.  I think that is a defect that ought to be remedied, and that the responsibility for giving this information to the electors should be put upon the Government through the returning officer. The numbers would then be such that people could rely on them, because I have also a similar experience of candidates mixing two separate areas in the one constituency, and sending people their wrong numbers.  The result was that when the voters presented their cards they were told by the returning officer they had not the proper numbers and had better go and get them.  It is all very fine for one who is a member of a party, where the cost of giving this information is spread over a big number, because it falls lightly on the <Col N="1592" /> man who does not go to any trouble and has merely to subscribe his portion of the cost, leaving some agent to do the work for him.  In my case, and in the case of Deputy Myles Keogh, we tried to give the people this information. When I tell the House that there are 98,000 voters on the north side of Dublin, and, I think, 95,000 voters on the south side, they will see the magnitude of this task.</P>
      <P>I think the Dublin constituencies are far too large, and that there ought to be four constituencies in Dublin instead of two.  As regards the Bill before the House, I agree that it is an improvement.  With regard to the polling hours, and taking into consideration the convenience of the public generally, I think there ought to be a closing hour at some portion of the day to allow the officials inside the booths to get lunch.  Proper management would permit that being done.  The polling stations could be closed between 3 and 4 o'clock, and then the hour taken off for the convenience of the officials in the polling stations could be added on to the hours in the night time.  I am satisfied one hour additional in the evening would be of far greater advantage in the city than one hour earlier in the morning.  At present the booths open much too early, and if there is any increase in hours I hope it will not be in the direction of an earlier opening, but of a later closing.  I certainly also hope that the Government will consider the advisability of giving to the voters their official numbers on the register.</P>

      <P>I would like to know from the Minister whether what I am going to state is the correct thing to do: that it is only necessary for a voter when he goes into a polling booth to do as I always do, namely, when the official asks me for my number I tell him I do not know it.  When he asks me my name and address I give it, and it seems to me that it is only necessary for every voter to do that.  I would like the Minister to say whether that is legal advice to give or not.  I do not see why people should be asked to remember their numbers.  You meet an extremely large number of people who are not able to remember their telephone <Col N="1593" /> numbers.  When semi-illiterate people go into a booth, and numbers on a card are produced before them, they are not able to remember their numbers. I assume that people act quite legally by giving their names and addresses. The numbers, I think, should only be used for counting up the people who enter the booth.</P>

      <P>I desire to associate myself with the request made by other Deputies for an extra hour for voting in the evening.  In the country districts where the old time is observed it is really only 6.30 when the booth is closed at the official hour of 8 o'clock. The workers in rural districts cannot leave their work on a June day so that they may be able to reach the booths before that hour.  In the constituency that I represent some 200 or 300 voters were unable to cast their votes at the last election because of the fact that the booth was closed at 8 o'clock summer time.  There are complaints. too, from a great many people with regard to the situation of the polling booths.  There are voters who have to travel distances of from six to eight miles in order to record their votes.  I do not think the Government could even expect their own supporters to travel such long distances after a hard day's work.  I think some better arrangements should be made with regard to the situation of the polling booths.  I know that in Longford and Westmeath there are people living within two miles of a polling booth and yet that is not their polling booth, but instead they have to travel a distance of six miles to vote.  I observe that under this Bill the election is to take place six days after the nomination day.  In the Principal Act the period was seven days, and the polling was to be on a Monday, but under this Bill the election can be held on any day, not earlier than six days after nomination day or later than fourteen days. Within that period the Government will have the new register at their disposal but other Deputies will not.</P>

      <P>I feel sure the Government Party will not be like the ordinary <Col N="1594" /> Deputies who will not see a copy of the register until the day on which it is issued.  The Government Party probably have it in their possession at the present time.  Well, I think that is letting the other Deputies down.  I do not see how other Deputies will be able to send out circulars and letters lo their constituents in less than six days.  As far as I am concerned, I would not mind if the Government were to run the election to-morrow, but if the Government intend to run the election in June then I think they should let all Deputies have copies of the register three or four days before the nomination day so as to give them an opportunity of getting out the extra numbers on it.  I agree with Deputy Good&mdash;it is not often I do&mdash;in his remarks with regard to the improvement in the register.  I think the officials deserve the very best praise for the manner in which it has been got out.  The last register was a great improvement on the one issued in 1923.  If the Government cannot see its way to alter the situation of the polling booths, then I think&mdash;I am not speaking in any personal way now&mdash; it should provide motor transport for the purpose of taking people to vote. I am sure the Government is democratic enough to carry the supporters of other Parties to the polls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to grant the extra hour in the evening for voting.  I am satisfied as regards the morning hour, but the extra hour is needed in the evening because in some places the old Irish time is observed; in other places they keep winter time, and then you have the official summer time.  I agree with Deputy A. Byrne that it would be well if we had a split hour in the evening on polling day. It would be a great convenience for many people.  It has been put into the Liquor Bill.  It will, I think, do harm there, but it would certainly be a very good thing to have on an election day, because it would enable people engaged at work all day to get to the booths in time to vote.  It would prove of great advantage in towns where you have 800 or 900 people working in factories. They are not able to get to the booths to vote during meal hours. In many cases the booths are closed by <Col N="1595" /> the time they are able to get to them in the evening after taking tea.  At the last election 40 people were turned away from one polling booth in Athlone at 8 o'clock.  The same thing, I imagine, applied at other booths in that town.  I think the people should be afforded facilities to record their vote for the form of Government they want to live under.  I sincerely hope the Government will grant the extra hour in the evening.</P>

      <P>I desire to join in the plea made by Deputy Cooper and Deputy Johnson with regard to an extension of the hours for voting in the evening.  The hour of 8 o'clock mentioned in the Bill will, in rural areas at least, involve hardship. I agree with Deputy Lyons that, where Greenwich time is kept in the country, 8 o'clock is altogether too early for closing the booths.  If, as seems likely, elections are to be held during the summer months, then I think the closing hour should be 9 o'clock.  Of course if the elections were held in the winter the matter would be quite different. In the summer, however, 9 o'clock is quite a reasonable time for closing the booths.  To close the booths before that hour must nceessarily deprive a lot of working people down through the country from exercising their vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a further point with regard to the register.  It appears the proposal in the Bill is that for the coming election, and evidently for every subsequent election, we can have candidates nominated on the old register, but the election is to be held on the new register.  In my opinion that is hardly a desirable principle to establish, but in any case let us realise that this novel proposal is introduced by the Government as a measure of expediency for this particular general election. They want to get their poll early in June, and in order to do that they bring in this Bill which is establishing this principle as a permanency.  It is quite possible under this Bill that, not at the next election but at some other election, the new register can come into operation on the very day of the poll, in other words that Parties will not be <Col N="1596" /> supplied with the valid register, and that they will have to do all their election work on the old register.  I do not think that is a desirable principle to establish.  I think, myself, the House would be well advised to resist this Section 5.  It seems to me that the general principle should be that the election should be held on the register on which nominations are made.  It is not asking too much, and I do not see why, even for the sake of a temporary expedient, the Government should be facilitated by this House to pass this Section 5.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to make another suggestion&mdash;that when the voting papers are being printed, or perhaps even when the nomination papers are being made out, that each candidate will have to stipulate what Party he is supporting&mdash;Cumann na nGaedheal, the Farmers' Party or the Labour Party&mdash;and that the name of the Party should follow the name of the candidate on the ballot paper.  That may seem a jocular suggestion, but it is not.  It is meant seriously.  I believe we will have in certain constituencies at this election as many as 20 candidates. A lot of voters, perhaps some people who are almost but not quite illiterate, get confused with the enormous number of names.  It is a great advantage to the man who has the alphabetical priority.  The A man stands well above the K man, and you may have two Joneses and two Smiths. One is a Cumann na nGaedheal candidate and the other is a Farmers' candidate. Very often the Cumann na nGaedheal candidate gets the Farmers' vote and so on.  I am not quite sure whether I will be in order in proposing such an amendment, but I intend to do so.  It has been suggested in other places.  It has been suggested in Australia.  I do not know whether it has <Col N="1597" /> been carried out or not.  I desire to support the suggestion, speaking on behalf of the farmers in the constituency I represent, that the polling hours should be extended to 9 o'clock.  I think it is very important that they should be extended.  I also want to say that most Deputies will give their approval to the suggestion put forward by Deputies A. Byrne and Lyons.  Perhaps it could be carried further and that we could get the Government to send out all our propaganda and literature, and to see that each candidate gets only equal space in the newspapers so that we will all have an equal chance.</P>

      <P>I do not think it will help us at the present time, when we have not got very much official time at our disposal, to introduce this measure, and therefore it is not necessary for me to answer a good many of the points touched upon here.  Deputy Cooper expressed doubts as to the present register and as to the means by which it was obtained.  I think, in fact I can state with authority, that we have a very fine register this year.  In the country districts the register was prepared under the supervision of the Civic Guard.  I can state with every confidence that it is the best register we have had, since we came into office at all events.  Deputy Cooper also mentioned that it would be well if there was a redistribution, such as is necessary under the Constitution.  However, <Col N="1598" /> any redistribution of seats must be based on census, and we have no new census officially available at the moment, so that is out of the question.</P>
      <P>Most of the controversy so far has ranged round the hours.  That was only to be expected.  The original hours were from 8 to 8, and we are now changing them from 9 to 8.  We found from experience that there was very little voting in the morning hour from 8 to 9, and accordingly we feel that we are justified in eliminating that hour.  On the other hand voters are continually being told to vote early. Sometimes they are told to vote early and often.  At all events they are told to vote early, and you may expect that there will be a number voting between 9 and 10 o'clock.  That is a very good hour for housekeepers, who often go out to shop between those hours in cities.  I would be very slow to give way on the hour of 9 in the morning. With regard to the evening hour, there is perhaps more scope for giving way, and I would like to hear some further discussion on it in the Committee Stage.  On the one hand you have the fact that in country districts it is impossible to collect all the ballot boxes together.  Sometimes officials are delayed for a very long time in the polling booths before the ballot boxes can be collected, and also, as Deputy Good mentioned, the dead have a kind of predilection for that particular hour at night.  It is, perhaps, just as well that we do not facilitate them in walking, while the booths are open at all events, so that for the present I would like to let the hour of 8 o'clock stand for further discussion on Committee Stage. Deputy Johnson referred to another point in regard to one-third of the quota.  That is a point which I think is really outside the scope of our discussion here at present.  If I were introducing a more comprehensive measure perhaps there would be something to be said for it.</P>

      <P>When this debate was adjourned on Friday I was dealing with the question of unemployment, and I said that a great deal depended on the farmers in regard to the relief of distress amongst the unemployed, who are, in the majority of cases, in a destitute condition.  I feel sure, after the Second Reading of the Agricultural Credit Bill to-day, that when farmers get loans they will be able to give great help in that respect.  I did not use the word &ldquo;farmers&rdquo; in the same way as other Deputies have used it during this debate on the Budget.  I did not mean to convey that the farmers were narrow-minded, or were not out to give employment, if they could possibly do so.  I meant to convey that owing to high taxation and inability to market their produce and to get guaranteed prices for it, the farmers were not in the position to provide work for agricultural labourers who were unemployed. <Col N="1601" /> It is a well-known fact that there is not more than one agricultural labourer now working on the land where there were forty pre-war.</P>
      <P>There are something like 3,000 agricultural labourers in Westmeath, and of that number there are not 250 in employment.  In Westmeath and Longford the farming industry has gone down completely.  In 1920, when there was a great circulation of money, and when everything was at top price, the farmers did well.  As was mentioned to-day, during the debate on the Agricultural Credit Bill, there was at that time an Agricultural Wages Board, and the farmers in Longford and Westmeath were quite content to pay the wages fixed by that board.  Owing, however, to what has happened since 1920, people have been over-taxed, and the burden is now so heavy they are not in a position to hold out any longer.  Had I not read the Agricultural Credit Bill I would not have any hope for the farming community being able to give extra employment during the coming year, but some help will be given to them by means of that Bill, and I hope, in that way, they will be in a position to give more employment at a living wage to their agricultural workers.</P>
      <P>With regard to the tax on wireless sets and parts, we are told by the Minister that this cannot possibly be removed or reduced.  The yield to revenue from this tax was about £19,000.  Why is there a tax on wireless parts that cannot possibly be manufactured in the Saorstát?  I hold it would be better from the point of view of the State to abolish that tax because its abolition would be the means of giving employment to a number of engineers in putting those wireless parts together, and disposing of them.  There is a good market for them at present.  The Government might as well put a tax on tea because it is not grown in the Saorstát as to put a tax on wireless parts that are not and cannot be made here.  I think some consideration should be given by the Minister for Finance to my suggestion on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel sure a number of Deputies regretted that they voted for the betting tax.  I wonder has the £59,028 got from that tax in any way recouped the <Col N="1602" /> taxpayers for the amount of money they have had to contribute to the different labour exchanges towards the unemployed.  It is a well-known fact that a number of motor drivers and stable hands have lost their employment owing to that tax, and those who produce food for horses also suffered. I think only about 13 Deputies in this House voted against that tax.  No return is given as to what it cost to collect the £59,028, what it cost to relieve unemployment as a consequence of it, and what it has cost the county boards of health.  I was sorry to see the majority of the Labour Deputies voting in favour of that tax.  I am not going to ridicule them, but I really think they should have had better sense than to vote in favour of a tax that they knew would be the means of throwing numbers of people out of employment, and I cannot understand why a party who were doing everything in their power to improve the position of the workers should do such a thing and make their position far harder.  I urge the Minister to abolish this tax also, as the amount of money it yields when put against the cost of collection and the distress it has caused shows that it is not worth continuing.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that there has been no reduction in the cost of the postage stamp.  It is 100 per cent. over pre-war days and one halfpenny more than in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain.  People living at a certain distance from a post office have to give sixpence per mile for the delivery of a telegram.  A man living 3½ miles from a post office has to pay 3/6 for delivery. I know a man in Athlone area who had to pay 3/- for the delivery of a telegram, and I do not think the boy who delivered the telegram got one penny out of that.  Some reduction should be made in these charges.  The sixpence per mile charge is uncalled for.  People who live a couple of miles outside a town will not allow telegrams to be delivered to them except the sender pays for them, and he does not like that.  I do not know why the Government should charge twopence for a stamp.  It might be that the extra halfpenny is charged for dyeing it green, which might be dearer than the English red.  They might get their <Col N="1603" /> dyes cheaper from Germany like they got their engineers for the Shannon scheme.  As regards beer duties, down the country a half-barrel of stout can be purchased for £4.  Out of that the Government receives £2 10s. 0d., and there is left £1 10s. 0d., to pay the grower of the barley, the freight from Dublin and back, the brewer, the carters, the publican and the shop assistants.</P>
    <P>Surely some adjustment could be made in the price of beer.  If the Government could not see their way to reduce the price of spirits, they should, at least, have followed the example of the British Government, who reduced their figure of 100/- in 1923 to 80/- per barrel.  Four pounds per barrel should he quite enough clear profit for the Government to get, without any labour whatsoever.  The position of the Government is a very favourable one if you contrast it with the position of the man at 30/- per week who has to make eight different entries in connection with these transactions, or with the position of the workman.  To the workman a drink is part of his food.  For his dinner he has a sandwich and a drink.  Why should not some relief be given to that man?  It would be most popular for the Government to do so. I know that pressure has been brought to bear on the Minister for Finance to refuse this reduction, because these teetotallers and converted teetotallers, and people on whom total abstinence is compulsory, judge others by themselves. They say that if any relief is given there will be an abuse as regards intoxication. I do not think any workman could afford, on his present wages, to get even slightly intoxicated.  The publichouse does not act as a magnet on the workman.  If £1 a barrel were taken off beer, and the price of the pint reduced by a penny or twopence, it would give employment to the worker, and it would provide a market for the farmer.  If the pint were reduced by twopence, the shilling per week the working man would save would be devoted to the welfare of his children.  But we must stick to the prices that were fixed from 1919 to <Col N="1604" /> 1921, when everybody was rolling in wealth.  Now we are financially embarrassed and the workman is not able to pay the same price for drink that he paid in those years.  The Minister is out for temperance.  He reminds me of the chairman of a district council in Edenderry who spoke from a platform in 1901 against emigration.  Workers were then receiving 11/- per week.  The only way, this gentleman said, to prevent emigration was to reduce the wages of the workers, so that they could not save sufficient to pay their passage.  The Minister thinks he is going to foster temperance by maintaining a high duty on liquor.  The Edenderry gentleman did not, prevent emigration and the Minister is not going to prevent a man getting a drink because the price is high.</P>
    <P>I realise that the Minister has reduced the demand on the people this year from £27,000,000 to £23,000,000. The balance of the money required will be borrowed.  When the Minister can borrow about three and a half million pounds, what is to prevent him borrowing a much larger sum?  Succeeding generations should be made bear some of the cost of establishing this State, and particularly the amount that it has cost to keep the Free State functioning from the end of 1922.  I think the figure is somewhere in the neighbourhood of £50,000,000.</P>
    <P>The people at present have to be overtaxed until that amount is paid back.  I was pleased to hear the Minister say that our credit was good.  That is very welcome news for the people of the Saorstát, but it would be better if the Minister said: &ldquo;We are going to borrow thirty or forty millions to reduce taxation for the purpose of paying the overdrafts of the county councils.&rdquo; Primarily through the political strife every county council in the country has an overdraft of from twenty thousand up to a hundred thousand pounds.  The ratepayers are saddled with that.  The Westmeath County Council had at one time an overdraft of £60,000.  About £3,400 per year was paid as interest on the over draft.  I have been a member of that Council since 1920.  The overdraft is there owing to the political strife, <Col N="1605" /> through swearing allegiance to Dáil Eireann the grants were stopped.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the least the Minister could do would be to look for a loan whereby the overdraft of each county council could beat least paid off, or otherwise give the county council a longer term in which to pay, and so save the ratepayers of those counties. At present you have over 80,000 people idle in this country.  The county councils are not in a position to give employment owing to the heavy rates and their overdrafts.  I ask the Minister to do something to relieve distress amongst people willing and able to work.  There is due by the Labour Exchange something over £1,400,000. From what sources can that money be paid back?  Surely we cannot expect the Labour Exchange at present, where there is such a heavy demand by the unemployed, to be in a position to pay back to the State that amount of money.  I think it would be much better if the Government floated a loan for a greater sum and started industries to find employment for the workers.  I have no hesitation in saying that the people I am associated with, the workers of Westmeath and Longford&mdash;and I am sure they are voicing the opinion of the Saorstát&mdash; do not want the dole.  They want employment, and every Budget in this House has only been adding extra numbers to the unemployed.  This one will add to the unemployed.  You will have more distilleries closed down and more men dismissed from the shops. Instead of trying to help the workers of this country, you are doing everything to make the worker a beggar. That is the position to-day.  I know highly respectable workers in my own constituency whose wives are put in the position of going with their hands out from door to door when at the same time the men are quite willing to work.  They cannot get employment because the people are overtaxed.  The people who will give employment cannot give it owing to the high duties imposed by the Government.  As a result the people must starve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1606" /> It is no use in saying that the teetotallers will not have any reduction in duty.  The workers have greater ideas of temperance than any other class in the State.  I am sure there is not any workman who has been dismissed from either brewery or distillery but would welcome and appreciate the removal of £1 per barrel off beer and £1 2s. 6d. off spirits.  It would mean constant employment for them, and they would be able to provide for their wives and families.  At present they are not able to do it. The result is that they are getting degraded.  I cannot put forward the beautiful picture some Deputies put forward.  I see nothing but disaster confronting us.  I see nothing confronting my fellow-workers but that they will become eventually a band of wasters.  Whom should we blame? We must blame the Government, who do nothing to find employment for them.  What can we expect?  We cannot expect great things.  We cannot expect the Minister for Finance to make an appeal to the wealthy classes of the Saorstát, or even to apply to the British Government, as under the Land Act of 1923, for a guarantee on the land bonds for £30,000,000.  The Government will not apply to the British Government for a long term loan to try and find employment for their citizens.  They will not ask the British Government, or any other Government, to give a guarantee that if they float a loan of thirty or forty millions the money will be quite safe.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that if the Minister does float a loan he will float a decent loan.  I have no hesitation in saying that the people of the Saorstát will subscribe it.  You have at present quite a large number of ex-servicemen. They fought against foreign powers, against their own fellow-men at home in some cases against their own brothers, and we find that even of the pensions that are given them, that portion of the money, is to be borrowed.  If that item of £55,000 is to be borrowed for National ex-servicemen's pensions, why is it that an extra amount cannot be borrowed to give them constant employment? I hope that every Deputy realises that it is not yet too late for <Col N="1607" /> the Government, even at the eleventh hour, to do this.  The Minister can, even before the election, ask leave to borrow a greater amount.  He can put forward his schemes from the industrial point of view.  He can, in conjunction with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, put forward schemes for the purpose of starting industries in order to give employment.  I appeal to the Government to do something for the workers before they dissolve the Dáil. I appeal to them not to leave the workers in a worse position than they were when this Government took office.  When the Government took office in 1922 the workers were in a good position.  If the Government cannot better their position they should leave them in as good a position as they were in in 1922.</P>
    <P>The most lamentable proposition ever put forward by any Government was the reduction of the old age pensions. That was one of the worst crimes that could possibly be committed, and if I had been Minister for Justice at the time I really think the Minister for Finance would now be &ldquo;doing time.&rdquo; I hold that reduction was barefaced robbery.  We were told that the reduction was one shilling, but in some cases it went as far as six shillings. Now, after three years the Minister cannot restore that shilling to old people who are 81 and 82 years of age and who have no other means of livelihood. They are now getting 9/-, but they are entitled to 10/-.  Had they been 80 years of age at the time of the passing of this reduction they would be getting 10/-.  Surely that is a crime that is calling for vengeance and vengeance will fall on somebody.  If not at the election time it will fall sooner or later.  I am very pleased that I was not associated with that act.  I did everything in my power against it, speaking and voting against it, and the least the Minister could have done at the end of three years was to restore that shilling.  He is not going to benefit a lot by it.  A sum of £500,000 has been given to income tax payers, people who never go to bed without their supper.  The man who pays income tax has always his loaf on the table.  But <Col N="1608" /> in the case of the old age pensioner the loaf has been taken away from him by one of the Government officials, and it is put on the table of the income tax payers.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will put into effect the findings of the Old Age Pensions Committee that was set up for the purpose of going into this whole question of old age pension. The State had to bear the expense of that Committee but the result was that the whole thing was a bottle of smoke, for the findings were never put into force, simply because they did not find in the right direction.  Had they found that the pension was too much and that it ought to be still further reduced the findings would have been put into effect very soon.</P>
    <P>Then there is the case of the national teachers who in the interests of economy suffered a ten per cent cut in their salaries.  Increased work is being put on the national teachers month after month and yet their salaries are reduced ten per cent.  The salaries of the Governor-General and other well-paid officials are not reduced by ten per cent.  I had hoped that the cut in the old age pensions would this year be restored and also that the cut in the teachers' salaries would be discontinued.  I cannot possibly see how the people of the Saorstát can praise this Budget.  There is no citizen outside of the 60,000 taxpayers who will benefit by the reduction in income tax.  If the Government cannot increase wages or find employment then they should do something to reduce the cost of living so as to enable the people to rear their families.  I do not want to criticise the Minister for his reduction in the income tax.  Personally I never paid income tax as I had so many dependents that when the exemptions were deducted I owed none.  I know that the reduction in income tax will be a help to those who have been paying it.  I trust the Minister will see his way to give some help to the other sections of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not resisting&mdash;I distinctly welcome&mdash;the proposal to reduce income tax below the British level; but my mind goes back a few years to the time in 1924 when our income tax was fixed at 5/- and the British income tax was fixed at 4/-.  I then put down an amendment to the Finance Bill to reduce our income tax at least to the British level.  The Minister for Finance replied that it was a ridiculous proposal, no less, to reduce income tax to the British level.  At the time I pointed out to him not merely the facilities in the matter of money, but the social amenities that would be brought about.  I pointed out the advantages that a lower cost of living than Great Britain would offer to people; I mentioned that it would steady incomes and would prevent people who had no ties in the country leaving it to take up residence in England and elsewhere.  The Minister for Finance, like Shylock, would have his pound of flesh, and, despite all reason, his mute, brute majority prevailed and carried the proposal to have a 5/- income tax.  To-day he is in the unhappy position that he has to make a substantial cut below the British level in order to attract, as he bluntly admits, some of the capital and some of the wealthy people who have flitted from this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It evidently takes a calamity to open the eyes of the Minister for Finance. Reason cannot prevail with the Minister.  It is only a hard and bitter experience, the same as we have had in this country, will convince him of the reasonableness of a claim.  It is no exaggeration to say that, with the difficulties created by double income tax and the involved and cumbersome methods to gain relief, people who were resident in this country and who drew largely from moneys invested in Great Britain were obliged to leave the <Col N="1610" /> country.  A moderate estimate of the income lost to us annually would be at least a million.  That involves anything up to twenty or twenty-five millions of capital.  We lose income tax on every penny of that, and we lose also the purchasing power of the people who owned that money.  The benefit of that money is lost to the general mass of our citizens.  That is a very serious indictment of the Minister, to have pursued a policy for a number of years which has led directly to the withdrawal of very large sums of capital from this country, and the withdrawal also of wealthy residents who are now spending their incomes abroad.  But we lose even more.  We lose everything in the nature of death duties, and this represents a very considerable loss to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>On the question of relief of income tax it is well to point out that even with the reduction of one shilling the position is not yet quite satisfactory, owing to the fact that we have a high cost of living in this country and owing to the difficulties with regard to relief from double taxation.  I have been credibly informed that notwithstanding the agreement entered into last year by the Governments of the Saorstát and Great Britain, together with certain assurances given by the Minister in the House and elsewhere under which a person who has income and who is resident in this country, but has money coming from investments in Great Britain, gets exempted from the British income tax, circumstances point to a different state of affairs.  Demands are being made by inspectors through the country, and they are assessing people on the original amounts of their incomes. They are even pressing for payment. I do not think that is in keeping with the spirit of the agreement, or even the spirit of the Minister's own paper, headed &ldquo;Irish Free State and Great Britain (or Northern Ireland): Arrangements in Respect of Double Income Tax.&rdquo;  Paragraph 5 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>A person resident in the Irish Free State who is entitled to repayment of British tax on the ground that he is not resident in Great Britain or Northern Ireland may authorise the British Commissioners of Inland Revenue <Col N="1611" /> to make the repayment on his behalf direct to the Irish Free State Revenue Commissioners, to be applied in satisfaction of Irish Free State tax due from him.  The authority should be given in the space provided for the purpose on the repayment form K.1.  The Irish Free State Revenue Commissioners will remit to the claimant any excess of the repayment received by them over the Irish Free State tax due from him.  (This arrangement is designed to prevent the initial double payment of British and Irish Free State tax on the same income without relief, and must not be taken as implying that the Irish Free State Revenue Commissioners will in any sense act as the claimant's agent in the prosecution of his claim to repayment of British tax...)</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister gave a distinct assurance that a clearing-house would be set up with regard to this very question.  So far, I understand that clearing-house has not been set up, with the result that very considerable hardship has been inflicted upon residents in this country, people mostly of moderate incomes which is derived from investments abroad.  I understand they are subjected to very great hardships by the demands and pressure put upon them by our income tax people to get income tax again which has already been paid in Great Britain and in respect of which relief is in process of transfer.</P>
    <P>I say that is a position which ought not be, and a position which is not desirable.  All this irritation can only tend to drive wealthy residents out of the country.  I confess that I do not look for very substantial improvements in this country consequent on the reduction of 1/- in the £ income tax, except in so far as that reduction will attract people formerly resident in this country and induce them to return.  I hope that perhaps other people will come in.  I do not look for very substantial industrial revival as a result of this reduction in the income tax.  If you had depressed industries you might have a substantial improvement, but where your industries are nonexistent they have to be created.  For <Col N="1612" /> that reason I do not expect any great industrial revival as a consequence of this remission in the income tax rate. I think that attention must be given to the process of making this country attractive to wealthy people, people of means.  I say again that the policy of the Government for the last four years, with their high taxation and high cost of living, has been to drive out those very desirable residents.</P>
    <P>In his Budget speech the Minister gave us certain figures showing the extent of the National Debt.  These figures are, in my opinion, somewhat inaccurate.  The Minister did not give us figures of the commitments which this Government has entered into.  He gave the amount of the National Loan, Compensation Stock issued, Savings Certificates, Irish Free State Bills, Ways and Means advances, Telephone Capital advances.  Why did he leave out of his calculation the capital sum we are committed to under the London Agreement, 1925, amounting to about £5,000,000?  That is a debt already incurred to which we are very definitely committed, and, on the Minister's showing, we are bearing the charge this year.</P>

      <P>The British retained £900,000 they were to send over in order to meet the first instalments. The Minister had to find the money for the Property Losses Commission from some other sources.  This money was going to the relief of that Vote. Now it must be found elsewhere.  The money has to be found somehow. That point seems to have been ignored. We have in addition this question of Dáil Bonds.  I believe the sum falling on the Exchequer is very considerable &mdash;over half a million this year.  That is a debt already incurred.  Why is it not regarded as part of the existing National Debt?  The Shannon scheme inasmuch as we have definitely committed ourselves to it ought also to have been taken into calculation.  The Minister states that the £16,290,000 is the total indebtedness at the moment. It would not be any exaggeration to say that, plus the London Agreement and the Dáil Bonds but excluding the Shannon scheme, our National Debt is <Col N="1613" /> about £22,000,000.  There is a serious discrepancy between that and the Minister's figure of £16,000,000.  The method by which the Minister proposes to balance his Budget is novel in the extreme.  I consider it merely a piece of financial jugglery.  The Minister stated that a couple of years ago he would have regarded the normal charge for the Army as £2,000,000. The figure is now reduced to one and a half millions.  The Minister states that that represents a saving as compared with this year's net estimate of something like £650,000.  Why stop at one and a half millions?  The process could be continued until zero is reached.  I fail to understand how the Minister can justify his proposals or claim that he has effected a saving of £650,000.  It is only a paper saving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point that the Minister has claimed as a saving is over-estimation. The attention of' the Public Accounts Committee has been drawn every year to the principle of over-estimation, and they made a very definite recommendation that over-estimation will be severely scrutinised.  In a small Budget like ours I agree that it is impossible to come down to the fine relation of estimates and expenditure that prevails in Great Britain.  In Great Britain the difference only represents 1.5.  I do not think we could come down to so fine a figure.  The Minister makes a gross estimate and hopes he will be able to save the £650,00 out of it.  He thinks there is a little surplus included in every Estimate which will enable him to save the £650,000 which will be devoted to the relief of taxation.  From that saving a reduction of 1/- in the income tax is granted.  Does the Minister realise that his proposals mean that there will hardly be a penny in the Exchequer at the end of the next financial year, and that it will practically be as bare as ever Mother Hubbard's cupboard was, and that he must go out the next day and raise money by bills?  If these are the savings the Minister claims to have effected I say they are very poor savings.  The real saving is not this fine jugglery but rather in reduced expenditure. In several passages in his Budget speech the Minister has admitted that it is possible to reduce expenditure. <Col N="1614" /> Why has he not taken the necessary step to do so?  He proposes to set up a Committee to investigate, and this precious Committee is to consist of a Minister and two heads of the Civil Service.  In other words, the Ministry will sit in judgment on itself. I say that such a Committee cannot obtain public confidence and cannot obtain public respect.  What other result could be expected from such a Committee of two officials plus a Minister who will be called upon to sit in judgment upon themselves, reviewing all the results of their policy for three or four years?  A hopeful report is to be expected from it!  Certainly the report, if it is to be published, will not be helpful, yet the Minister admits that a very considerable reduction in expenditure can be brought about.  Why is it necessary to wait for this Committee? Why does he not take the matter in hands at once?  He has not done so, and that is part of my criticism, that he has allowed several precious years to pass by without taking the necessary steps to reduce expenditure.  As a matter of fact, except in abnormal items, expenditure is already very nearly stabilised.  It is true that the huge Army expenditure at £10,000,000 in 1924 is now reduced to a gross charge of £2,666,000, that is, taking in not alone the sum for which the Accounting Officer is responsible, but other charges, such as the Board of Works, the Post Office and other services which are incidental and corelated to the service of the Army.  It is true that the huge Property Losses Vote is reduced.  But come down to other things.  Certain aspects have been cut out, but have these been as much as the position of the country at the moment warrants, and which, if this country is to survive, it must demand? I say they have not.</P>
    <P>You have got to come down to the taxable capacity of the people, and from first to last the Government has made no definite effort to ascertain what the taxable capacity is.  They have got to realise whether all these services are actually necessary for the country in its present state of depleted finances.  Facing up to that problem, I believe that there must be a scrapping <Col N="1615" /> of some of our services.  How can a poor agricultural community, with thousands of holdings that are either uneconomic or barely economic, keep up the social services of a country with the wealth and immeasurable resources of Great Britain?  In my opinion it is an impossibility, and that position must be faced.  Every commitment&mdash; and the Government has entered into many commitments&mdash;imposes a charge upon the public purse.  Their tariffs, for instance, are making it exceedingly difficult for the country to pull through.  As I pointed out here last week, there is no tax so cruel, so unjustifiable, as the boot tax.  The Minister told us that he put it on as an experiment. I presume that that is part of the policy of experimenting which led him in 1924 to impose an income tax of 5/-, while it was only 4/6 in Great Britain.  He is now taking off two sixpences, when one then would have fitted the bill pretty well.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Minister has imposed the boot tax for a period of seven years, and I presume at the end of that time he will have found out, what the rest of the country have found out already, that this tariff is not warranted and is absolutely unjustifiable in the case of poor peoople.  Boots are an absolute necessity in winter or summer.  People can wear rather bad clothes and they will keep them warm, but in our climate, and especially for young children, sound and absolutely waterproof boots are required.  If you have not such boots you are risking the health of the coming generation, and I may say that the Minister's policy, in a period of acute agricultural depression, when every penny counts, of putting on a 15 per cent. tariff, especially in the case of the poor farmer and the poor agricultural labourer with a long family, is really striking at the health and the future efficiency of the country. I hope that a considerable volume of support, in this House and out of it, will be forthcoming to get rid of this tax.  It brings in merely a quarter of a million, and while a quarter of a million is not to be despised, I do say that the price of boots is ruinous, and I say very definitely that the boot tariff must go.  We could take the same line with <Col N="1616" /> other tariffs, but as the finances of the country are based to some extent upon the revenue that accrues from them, we cannot remove them altogether. But I do say that the boot tax is a most iniquitous tax as far as the whole population of the West of Ireland, from Tirconaill down to West Cork, is concerned. It strikes very severely at the people.</P>
    <P>The whole tendency of tariffs necessarily is to put up the cost of living. Does not that take very largely from the effect, when the cost of living has gone up beyond the figure in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and does it not really cut across the Minister's proposal for the reduction of income tax to attract people back here?  In the case of a person of very considerable income it would pay, with the lower rates of super tax and income tax, but in the case of a person with an income of £400 the reduction would only be something in the neighbourhood of 50/- or 55/-.  Does the higher cost of living warrant a person with an income of, say, £400, to come from abroad in order to save these few pounds?  I claim that it does not, and I say definitely that the Minister's proposal, as far as these small incomes are concerned, is absolutely defeated.  It was part of the policy of members of the Government, in making speeches throughout the country last year, not to bemoan the high taxation that exists, but rather to justify it.  They told the country that it was getting &ldquo;damn good value&rdquo; for its money. Therefore, on their own admissions. they agree that the country is taxed beyond its resources, and taxed far and away beyond its capacity, but they say they are giving good value.  I was wondering whether the Executive Council ever had such a thing as a patron saint, and now I realise that they had, and that patron saint was the Good Thief&mdash;the Penitent Thief.</P>

      <P>I do say, with Deputy Johnson, that the position of this country is such as to cause anybody very grave anxiety who studies it.  Ministers may speak of rosy prospects, of rounding the corner, and all <Col N="1617" /> that kind of thing.  I submit that they are out of touch with their constituents and that they have no measure of the feeling that prevails in the country. It is only too apparent to any man who travels through the Midlands, through several portions of Clare, parts of Leitrim and parts of Kerry, that the land is very inadequately stocked and that there is much possibility that there will not be sufficient stock to eat this summer's grass.  But more than that, in these stressed and pinched times farmers generally are obliged to cut expenditure in every direction, even in the case of the very necessary improvements that the land requires. There is no doubt that the carrying power of the land has very seriously declined within the last three or four years.  The land is no longer as fertile as it was six or eight years ago.  That is due to two causes: the inclement season of 1924, when the land became absolutely waterlogged, and the farmers, owing to the bad times through which they have been passing, not being in a position to put in the necessary fertilisers to maintain the fertility of the soil.  That is a very serious state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that that is due to high local taxation.  Who is responsible for the high cost of local services? I claim that the Government, and three Ministers particularly, must bear a very considerable share of that responsibility. These Ministers are: the Minister for Finance, who was responsible to a very great extent when Minister for Local Government; the President, and the Minister for Justice. In the years 1920-21 and subsequent years they involved the country in very huge commitments.  They attempted to reform the social services and to base the normal expenditure upon the peak prices which then prevailed. That has happened at least in my constituency. Then there are the duties put upon local authorities by the legislation passed here in the last few years, particularly the Local Government Act of 1925.  Very considerable sums have to be found under those Acts.  The Government cannot escape individual responsibility, because there were definite proposals put up <Col N="1618" /> here which would have the effect of reducing the obligations of local authorities with regard to pensions, etc., which were carried in this House, but when they went to the Seanad the Seanad reversed the order established here, and the Government tamely acquiesced and actually divided the Dáil in support of the Seanad amendment, although previously they had taken the line that these commitments were not desirable.</P>
    <P>I say then that it is not a fair position for the Government to adopt, to cast all the blame on the local authorities for their own failure.  The local authorities are doing their best to get out of the very undesirable situation which the Government, and particularly the present Minister for Finance, created for them in 1923, when he was Minister for Local Government. They are endeavouring to undo his work, and it comes very badly from the Government to be accusing the local authorities of failure, when they themselves had stereotyped the commitments and had prevented local authorities from making any effort to reduce them.  That question will be very definitely put up to them at the General Election&mdash;their complete failure to realise the poverty prevailing, especially in some of the Western counties and to make suitable provision to relieve the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Whatever the Government may say, this country has very little reason to be grateful to them, especially on this question of finance.  They have absolutely resisted the claims put up here within the last two or three years for a &ldquo;Geddes&rdquo; committee to examine the position&mdash;an independent committee, not a committee of Ministers or a couple of civil servants, to sit in judgment upon their own past administration. See what happened in England.</P>
    <P>When Sir Eric Geddes, who had been a Cabinet Minister, but had severed his connection with the Government, and who was a business man and not a professional politician, went into the question of expenditure there, it was found possible to make very considerable reductions.  Considerable as they were, <Col N="1619" /> the British people are now forced under stress of circumstances to demand much greater retrenchment. Hard as conditions may be in England, they are unfortunately harder here. We have a country which is infinitely poorer.  The fact cannot be sufficiently impressed on the people that we have only 1-66th of the earning resources of Great Britain, and if we take our expenditure upon that basis, it is relatively 2½ times the British expenditure. Our total expenditure this year, when we take into account loans, etc., amounts to £32,000,000, both for normal and abnormal services under the heads of voted moneys, expenditure out of the Central Fund and capital issues. That is a matter for serious consideration. People speak lightly of borrowing money, but every penny borrowed imposes a further charge.  It is a good thing certainly to get it, but there must be wisdom and discretion in borrowing. We have entered into too many commitments&mdash;commitments far and away beyond the resources of the country. Those commitments may be very admirable and very successful in course of time, but they are beyond our financial resources, and that constitutes my severest indictment of the Government.</P>

      <P>I trust my friend Deputy Connor Hogan will forgive me if I say that his speech, which we have listened to with so much interest, was a strange blend of practical wisdom and the veriest folly.  When he indicted the Government and indicated its financial blundering he was admirable, but when he recollected that he is a member of the Farmers' Party and bound therefore, as he believes, to attack tariffs in aid of industries, he fell away sadly from grace.  The Minister's whole Budget has the keynote of it indicated in the second sentence:&mdash;&ldquo;The financial credit of the State has been securely established.&rdquo; In my reading of the Budget statement <Col N="1620" /> the whole effect that it is designed to create is that the Government has established securely the financial stability of the State.  There are no doubt good items in the Budget.  It would be difficult indeed to have a Budget that would be all bad.  But I suggested in the criticism which I had the opportunity to make on the first resolution concerning income tax, that this was a great advertisement.  I find that one of the Sunday papers echoes that description.  There was nothing startling, it was clear, nothing spectacular, nothing in the way of a new departure, in the Budget.</P>
      <P>The Minister seems to have played merely for safety, retaining practically the impositions of the former Budget. I think anyone who has followed the wiser portion of Deputy Connor Hogan's speech will have realised that the Minister has tried to make his financial position appear very much better than the searchlight of Deputy Connor Hogan allows us to see it to be. What evidence is there in the Budget that the financial credit of the State has been securely established?  It is the duty of any national government to protect the three great assets of the State: Its land, its wealth, its people. Deputy Connor Hogan joins with the Minister in seeing nothing hurtful, nothing to be condemned, in a financial and fiscal policy that drives away, out of this State, the best and most valuable of its population.  Once it became a question of a tariff upon boots Deputy Connor Hogan forgot the 30,000 emigrants that left this little State last year.  His word to the farmers is: &ldquo;Let your sons and daughters go abroad to protected lands to look for the employment that they cannot get at home,&rdquo; and, then, when he contemplates the reduction of the income tax he sings &ldquo;Come back to Erin&rdquo; to the poltroons that left the country before to escape its financial and other burdens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the most heavily taxed country in Europe.  Mr. Baldwin, in his statement, which I quoted before in another context, declared that we export more of our capital than any other country in Europe.  We are exporting <Col N="1621" /> our population, and we are exporting our wealth with the rake's progress, and yet we are told, in this Budget statement, that national stability has been secured.  There is, to the superficial reader, a certain show of stability. I claim as regards certain portions of it&mdash;the best features&mdash;that it was the pressure of the uprise of another party that brought financial light and leading to the Minister for Finance. When I made that claim, a Deputy of the Farmers' Party made a sign of derision.  The document to which I am referring is dated January 22nd, 1926: &ldquo;Outline of Clann Eireann's policy and aims.&rdquo;  It declares:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The immediate objective is the release of agriculture and business from the stranglehold of bad finance. The burden of taxation, national and local, is greater than farming can bear: and what with income tax, super-tax, corporation tax, enterprise in the other industrial domain is checked, repressed, even palsied. Our towns exhibit acute depression. The farmer is harried by a horde of State officials.  Industries dwindle; unemployment and emigration alone expand.  The Government's course must be stayed before irreparable disaster comes upon the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And one of the proposals which is the very latest proposition of the Government to deal with transport is insisted on, and so on right through the programme until we come to the statement that the present scale of spending and our national income are thoroughly out of relation.  The document from which I am reading these few excerpts declares: &ldquo;For constructive development the moneys requisite can be secured through the checking of waste and the pruning of extravagance.&rdquo; And it goes on: &ldquo;The wrong organisation which mars the efficiency of the Department of Defence and of the Department of External Affairs provides additional notable examples of misspending.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now the two remarkably striking features of the Budget proposals are the reduction in income tax and the proposal to reduce the Army down to a cost of only one million and a half. The ordinary reader in piercing beneath <Col N="1622" /> the surface of the proposal will see in that evidence of stability.  It is somewhat inconsistent, no doubt, this Budget statement, especially with what Deputy Gorey calls the cross-roads protestations of political speechmakers. While at the cross-roads, Ministers terrify voters with the prospect that if they are not returned by the electorate it will be impossible to borrow money, and other horrors are prophesied as awaiting the country in the background. Yet, when it comes to the real financial proposals embodied in the Budget, what do we find?  That the Minister is able to propose a reduction in the Army, and to substitute for it something in the nature of a territorial force.  Which of these two doctrines, put before the public, is the truth? It is quite obvious, that we have that stability which makes it possible to reduce the Army, and by a species of political legerdemain in the Budget we are asked to believe that that stability and financial stability, which are to secure relief from national indebtedness, are the same thing, and obviously they are not.  I proved that out of the Minister's own figures.  We have the largest national debt.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connor Hogan asked for information with regard to taxable capacity, but he forgets that the Minister in the debate of December, 1925, told us how he and Mr. Winston Churchill, the English Chancellor of the Exchequer, arrived at their bargain under Article V.  He said the British put it up to him&mdash;and, of course, whatever the British put up to him he accepted&mdash;that the relative taxable capacity of the two States might fairly be taken as indicated by the yield in their respective direct taxation, so that he got the ratio of one and a half to one hundred.  Now the taxation which this country is called upon to bear should, upon that basis, be something between £12,000,000 and £13,000,000.  Here it is £23,000,000, just a little over twice what it ought to be.  And yet we are asked to believe that the Minister has done great things.  Now the Minister says: &ldquo;Great constructive schemes have been initiated and are being hastened forward.  New help has been given to <Col N="1623" /> agriculture and industry.  The burden of taxation has been appreciably reduced while the public debt remains low.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I find it somewhat extraordinary that the Minister for Finance should use the expression, &ldquo;public debt,&rdquo; when I recall that in the Seanad on the 1st April he professed utter and complete incapacity to state what the term &ldquo;public debt&rdquo; means.  It will be recollected that under Article V. of the Treaty it was stipulated that Ireland was to bear a proportion of the national debt.  The words used were &ldquo;Public Debt of Great Britain and Ireland,&rdquo; according to a proportion found to be just and equitable. In the Seanad on April 1st the Minister for Finance declared that he did not know what those words meant. He declared further that it was useless for him to suggest a definition, for the British representative might put forward another.  Yet, here we have the very term itself employed in the introductory statement to the Budget, and obviously it is meant to be a synonym for State debt, the debt of the State That is to say, it is the same thing as what is popularly called the national debt.</P>
    <P>The reason I am harping upon that is because in a recent financial settlement made by the Minister, and signed in March last, the Minister set his signature and seal to an arrangement whereby the finances of this country are to be drained still further away, and exported, so that what ought to have been cancelled under the cancellation of Article V., to wit, our indebtedness for portion of the public debt of Great Britain and Ireland, is continued as a financial commitment of ours by the Minister's settlement, and would have appeared, I have no doubt, in the items of the Estimates if we had an opportunity given us before the dissolution of this House to consider them. I maintain that the total public debt or State debt of the Irish Free State is not set out in this Budget statement, and that our national debt is represented at a lower figure than that at which it actually stands, and that the whole Budget is designed to give the impression of our occupying a better and a <Col N="1624" /> sounder financial position than we really are entitled to claim.  Deputy Connor Hogan has dealt with the items of the national debt ably, and I leave the matter where he left it.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that in his last Budget statement he estimated for certain excise duties and also spirit and beer duties, and from his results it would appear that the home-made spirit is getting a larger consumption than it had formerly.  The Minister estimates no reduction in the coming year, notwithstanding that we have devoted quite a considerable amount of our time to the regulation of the drink traffic. The next item of the Budget statement is in regard to the taxes on motor cars. The Customs duty on motor cars and motor bicycles yielded about a quarter of a million.  The Minister explains the fall in the yield by the diminution in the value of cars owing to the slump in the French and Italian currencies, and the discrimination in favour of the home-made car shown in the new basis of road taxes, and to the easing off of the brisk demand for cars which arose on the restoration of settled conditions. There is no mention in this connection of any effort to help the home industry. I made the point to the Minister for Trade and Commerce in the Provisional Government that we should allow the chassis of motor cars of all descriptions in, either free of tax, or with a very, very much diminished tax, so that only the ready-to-drive-away car should bear the heavy impost.  In that way we could bring back again, especially to this city, what had once been one of its most thriving industries.</P>
    <P>We have all seen evidence recently that even yet in the great towns of England, towns like Coventry and London, where coach-building is a fine art, and where the world is really out-rivalled in excellence of production, the leading workers are Irishmen.  We had a pre-eminence in coach-building up to roughly about the time of the development of the pneumatic tyre.  We lost this industry, and with it all the employment that it afforded both through itself and through cognate industries. We will continue to lose it so long as the motor car arrives in the Free State in a completed form.  Now <Col N="1625" /> it is quite obvious that with the development of road transport in the form of buses, a great fillip could be given to home production of this type if the chassis for these vehicles came in without tax or at a diminished rate of tax.  I find no proposition with regard to that in the Budget.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will state the reason why Edward Collins, Macroom, County Cork, who was appointed summons <Col N="1515" /> server fifty-eight years ago, and Civil Bill Officer fifty-seven years ago, and who has had to devote all his time to his work during that period, was discharged from his employment recently and refused any compensation, gratuity, or pension, and if he will have the case reconsidered.</P>

      <P>The effect of the Court Officers Act, 1926, was to abolish the position of Civil Bill Officer and to substitute therefor the new post of Summons Server, in which the functions of the Civil Bill Officer and the Summons Server of the former Petty Sessions Court were combined.  Accordingly, every Civil Bill Officer ceased to hold employment as such on the coming into operation of the Act mentioned, but existing officers whose service, health, age, etc., were satisfactory, were given an opportunity of accepting employment as Summons Servers.  Mr. Collins was not continued in employment for the reason that he is approximately 77 years of age.  Civil Bill Officers do not come within the scope of the compensation provisions of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, which stipulate in Section I. of Schedule VIII. that officers if not established must devote their whole time to the duties of their office before they are eligible for compensation, and, accordingly, Mr. Collins is not entitled to any compensation for loss of office under Article X. of the Treaty.  Moreover, Civil Bill Officers whose appointment and tenure were governed by the terms of Section 15 of the Civil Bill Courts (Ireland) Act, 1851, held office at the will and pleasure of the County Court Judge, and under the terms of the Statute had no claim to pension or gratuity on ceasing to hold office.</P>
      <P>For these reasons the Minister for Justice considered that he was precluded from entertaining any claim from Mr. Collins for superannuation or gratuity, or from making any payment to him by way of compensation for loss of office.</P>
