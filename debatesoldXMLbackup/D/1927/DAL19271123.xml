      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that Charles Hourican, Rathmore, Aughnacliff, County Longford, surrendered his sporting gun to the I.R.A. in 1918, and that two of these men, one who is at present an officer of the National Army, and the other an ex-officer of the I.R.A., are prepared to give testimony on oath that such is the case; that Charles Hourican has been refused compensation on the grounds that his application was received too late, and whether the Minister will take into consideration the fact that this man lives in a backward part of the country, does not see the papers regularly, and grant him compensation for the loss of his gun.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>Charles Hourican lodged a <Col N="1708" /> claim with my Department under the Indemnity Act, 1924, in respect of a gun stated to have been handed over to Volunteers in 1918. The Act provides that only claims lodged before the 1st November, 1924, could be considered; Mr. Hourican's claim was received on the 15th March, 1926, and it was, therefore, impossible, having regard to the terms of the Act, to entertain it.  Moreover, the Act provides for payment of compensation only in respect of losses sustained in the period from the 21st January, 1919, to the 28th June, 1922.  In these circumstances, I regret that I have no power to authorise the payment of any compensation in this case.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether contracts for mail bag cloth, cotton and union drills have recently been placed by the Contract Board with manufacturers outside the Saorstát; whether Irish manufacturers also tendered, and will the Minister give the reasons which actuated the Contract Board in this matter.</P>

      <P>have recently been placed by the Government Contracts Committee with manufacturers outside the Saorstát.  In the case of the first two named contracts, tenders were received from Saorstát firms, but as the prices quoted were so much in excess of those offered by the non-Saorstát firms, the Committee had no option but to award the contracts to the latter.  No Saorstát firm tendered for the contract for the supply of heavy cotton.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether the question of coast erosion in County Waterford has been considered, and if he is aware, with particular reference to the Tramore area, that the erosion now threatens the existence of at least twenty houses, as well as much land, and if he proposes to take any steps with regard to the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY to the MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. J. Dolan)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is not empowered to undertake the construction of sea defence works, nor has it at its disposal funds which could be advanced by way of grant or loan in aid of such works.  In general the cost of works for defence against the sea has been found to be out of all proportion to the value of the interests protected, which are usually private interests.  The matter has frequently been considered, but it has been regarded as out of the question for the State to accept responsibility for the general defence of the coast against erosion.</P>
      <P>In the particular case where injury is caused by parties removing sand or shingle from the seashore the Department has power, under the Harbours Act, 1814, to prohibit such removals under penalty.  An order of this nature was made in the year 1925 in respect of shore at Tramore, and several persons have since been convicted for infringements of the order.</P>
      <P>There are no further steps which I have power to take.</P>

      <NameTxt>PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY to the MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. J. Bourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate (27/- per week) paid to workers on the Owenmore Drainage Scheme was fixed last spring on the advice of the Inter-departmental Wages Advisory Committee, who in fixing it took into consideration the somewhat lower wages paid for ordinary agricultural work in County Sligo.</P>
      <P>This is the highest rate paid by the Commissioners of Public Works to labourers on any drainage scheme in Connaught and it is not proposed to increase it.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether his attention has been called to the claim to unemployment insurance benefit, dated 26th October, 1927, of John Brett, Cinema Operator, Windmill Hill, Kildare (Serial No. 2472) employed at Sandes Home Curragh Camp, from February, 1924, to 11th August, 1927, when he was discharged owing to shortage of work; whether his employer refused to stamp his card for this period, and, if so, what action he has taken or intends to take to force this employer to have the stamps placed to the credit of the claimant, so that benefit may be paid to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesNicholasDolan" hpid="Mr. DOLAN Mr. DOLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>A claim to unemployment insurance benefit made on the 26th October last by John Brett, Windmill Hill, Kildare, was disallowed by the insurance officer on the ground that no contributions had been paid in respect of the claimant.  It is understood that the claimant was employed at the Sandes Soldiers' Home from February, 1924, to August, 1927.  Contributions under the Unemployment Insurance Acts have not been paid in <Col N="1715" /> respect of his employment, the employers when requested to pay alleging that Brett was employed in domestic service and consequently was not insurable. Further inquiries are being made into the circumstances of the employment, and when all the information required is obtained the question in dispute will be decided.  If the decision is that contributions are payable in respect of Brett's employment steps will then be taken to enforce payment.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, insured contributors are entitled by Section 24 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, to sue employers for any benefit they may have lost by reason of the employer's failure or refusal to pay contributions in respect of their employment.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that about 12,000 citizens of the Saorstát are affected by the lack of reciprocal agreements with the Governments of Northern Ireland and Great Britain in the matter of unemployment insurance benefits for merchant seamen, and whether the Minister intends to give this matter immediate attention, in view of the hardships inflicted on this large number of citizens, and further, if he is aware that in the Kinsale district alone about 300 people are adversely affected in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesNicholasDolan" hpid="Mr. DOLAN Mr. DOLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the replies given on the 19th December, 1924, to Deputy Alfred Byrne and to Deputy Thomas Johnson, and, again, to Deputy Alfred Byrne, on the 15th February, 1927, to questions asked by them concerning the position of seamen and insured persons generally who are affected by lack of reciprocal arrangements under the Unemployment Insurance Acts with the Governments of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  These replies set out the position at considerable length and indicated that on his part everything possible had been done by the Minister to secure a reciprocal agreement, but that proposals for such an agreement were not being entertained by the other parties concerned. The position is still the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure what adverse effects <Col N="1716" /> are referred to in the last part of the question.  If it is that Irish seamen are paying contributions while employed on ships registered in Great Britain, then, as was recently explained to the Dáil, the deduction of contributions from their wages in these circumstances is illegal.  On confirmation that it is taking place, I will communicate with the British Ministry of Labour and have no doubt that Ministry will assist in bringing the practice to an end.  If, however, the grievance is that seamen domiciled in one country and serving on a ship registered in another have no means of bringing themselves into insurance, I can do no more than I have done, in proposing reciprocal agreements, to secure that if they pay contributions to one country's fund they can receive benefit from the other.</P>
    <P>I may add that the grievance of seamen through the reluctance of the other Governments to make reciprocal agreements are much less than those of workers on land, since the seamen are not legally liable to pay contributions and they can't get benefit, whereas the other workers, domiciled here, but employed in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, are liable to pay contributions though they are not able to obtain benefit.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if his attention has been drawn to the fact that in levying decrees in Donegal it is the practice to charge defendants with an attorney's filing fee of 1s. 6d., in addition to the usual sheriff's fees; if he will state the reason for levying this fee, in addition to the debt, Court costs and sheriffs' fees, payable under the Under-Sheriffs' Fees Order, 1926; if the Minister will make inquiries in the matter, and if it is found that this fee has been improperly levied, he will state what action, if any, he intends to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney) James Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention has recently been drawn to the practice of which the Deputy complains, and I have already issued instructions to the Under-Sheriff of Donegal that this practice must cease.  As the Deputy is, no doubt, aware, the Under-Sheriff will not proceed to execute a decree unless it is accompanied at the time of lodgment by a certificate signed by the plaintiff or his solicitor stating the amount then claimed to be due.  It seems that it has been the practice of the solicitors in Donegal to include in the amount certified as due, in addition to the debt, costs and witnesses' expenses awarded by the Court, a fee of 1/6 as a fee for drawing the certificate of the sum due.  In other words, <Col N="1719" /> the successful party's solicitor was in the habit of claiming not merely the party and party costs in accordance with the appropriate scale prescribed by the District Court Rules, but further costs to the amount of 1/6, which, if payable at all, were in the nature of costs as between solicitor and client, and were not, in my opinion, leviable from the defendant on foot of the decree. The Under-Sheriff did not, of course, benefit in any way from the fee of 1/6 in question, which, if levied by him, was handed over to the solicitor of the successful party; and in cases where the amount certified as due was less than the amount awarded by the Court in respect of debt, costs and witnesses' expenses, as, for example, where the debtor had paid off some of the debt in the interval between the issue of the decree and the execution thereof, it is doubtful if the Under-Sheriff had any option but to levy for the full amount certified.  As I have said, I have directed the Under-Sheriff of Donegal that, in future, if it appears that the amount certified as due by the person demanding an execution includes any fee or costs other than those awarded by the Court, he is not to levy for any greater amount than has been so awarded.  I do not propose to take any further action in the matter, but it is, of course, open to any person who may have been prejudiced by the improper practice which has formed the subject of the Deputy's question to take such legal action as he may be advised is appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that there is no restriction on the importation of meat from Great Britain or non-European countries. Owing to the prevalence of foot and mouth disease on the continent, however, the importation of animal carcases and certain animal products from Europe is prohibited by the Importation of Carcases (Prohibition) Order of 1926.  This Order, made by the Department under the Diseases of Animals Acts exempts, however, from the general prohibition certain animal products, including the following edible products, i.e., bacon, ham, pigs' heads and feet.  Bacon and ham are allowed to be imported if accompanied by certificates signed by a responsible government official of the country of origin to the effect that such bacon or ham has been subjected to a process of curing specified in the Order, and indicating the name and situation of the factory in which the curing has been done.  Certificates of a somewhat similar character are required to legalise the importation of pigs' heads and feet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an Amending Order issued in May last the requirements in regard to bacon and ham have been modified to the extent of permitting these products to be imported, without the prescribed certificates, if bearing a stamp or brand (and labelled with a replica of such stamp or brand) approved by the Department, following the receipt of formal assurances from the government of the country of origin that such stamp or brand will be affixed <Col N="1733" /> only to bacon or ham which has undergone the prescribed curing process in a factory under continuous government supervision.  So far, this modified procedure has been applied only in the case of one country, the Netherlands.</P>
    <P>The following are the figures supplied to me by the Statistics Division of the Department of Industry and Commerce as to the importations into the Free State from the Continent of Europe during the six months ended 30th September last:&mdash;Bacon, 2,015 cwts.; Hams, 2 cwts.; Pigs' Heads, 14,445 cwts.</P>

      <P>Among the representations received by me from various parts of the country relative to the establishment of another beet sugar factory are some from East Cork.  The undertakings for the growing of beet referred to in the second part of the question are, and must necessarily be, of a general character, seeing that, before they can be regarded as definite and reliable, they must be related to a definite price for beet, and such relation is not at this stage practicable. No offer from a French or other firm has been received by me or by the Department.  I have no information which would lead me to believe that tillage is decreasing in East Cork to an extent greater than in other parts of the country.</P>
      <P>In regard to the concluding portion of the question, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Deputy Heffernan's question of 4th August last.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture whether it is the intention of the Department to proceed with a scheme of afforestation at Thomastown, on the main road between Athlone and Ballinasloe; whether the Department, in a letter dated 4th December, 1924, No. 587/F., stated they would be pleased to receive from the Roscommon County Committee of Agriculture and Technical Instruction particulars of lands available for afforestation of not less than 300 acres in extent; whether such a plot has not been offered at a reasonable price by John D. Naghten, of Thomastown, and can the Minister state the reason for the delay in proceeding with the scheme.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture if he is aware that as a result of inquiries made by me some time ago concerning 300 acres of land at Thomastown, near Athlone, the property of Mr. Naghten, a communication was received stating that although the price and quality of the land offered was reasonable, his Department did not consider the acreage sufficient for forestry purpose, and if he will state if the Department still hold this view, and, if not, will he take steps to have the matter taken in hands and the planting done immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal with these two questions together.  The reply to the first portion of Deputy O'Dowd's question is in the negative.  In the letter referred to, the Department informed the Committee that they would be glad to receive particulars of lands available for afforestation, conforming to certain conditions specified in the letter, one of which was that any blocks of land offered should not be less than 300 acres in extent.  The land offered by Mr. Naghten is estimated to contain 245 acres.  It consists of an irregular block of good grazing land, partly covered with timber and seedlings, but not differing in quality from the better <Col N="1736" /> portions of the farm.  The quality and use of the land in the vicinity would preclude its acquisition for afforestation purposes, and the Department, having decided that the area would not be suitable as the nucleus of an afforestation area, have refused Mr. Naghten's offer.</P>
      <P>In regard to Deputy Brennan's question, the communication sent to him by the Department in reply to a written inquiry did not state that the price and quality of the land offered were reasonable, but intimated that the plot was not sufficiently large to form an economic forest centre.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very technical question, and I am informed, and believe the evidence, that 300 acres is about the minimum economic unit. There is also this to be said about these lands, that there is no other suitable land in the neighbourhood which would be likely to fall into the hands of the Department to add to them at a later date.  That is the real trouble.</P>

      <P>The question appears to relate to the appointment of a particular individual as postman at Carrigtwohill.  It opens up a new and very wide field if on the adjournment we are to have questions raised which have no general interest and no general application, but that simply concern one particular individual case.  I am very loath to accept a notice like that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. CORRY Mr. CORRY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORRY</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of notice, may I ask whether it is not the established custom that, if a Deputy does not receive what he considers to be a satisfactory reply to his question in the Dáil he is entitled to give notice that he will raise the question on the adjournment, with a view to having, perhaps, something in the nature of a more elaborate question and answer brought before the Dáil? Does the question at issue enter into the matter of order at all?  Is the Deputy not entitled to raise the question whether it is a particular question or whether it relates to general policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to accept the Deputy's view as to what enters into a question of order.  Deputy Corry asked a particular question to-day and he said he was going to raise the matter on the adjournment.  The matter, as it appeared from the question and the reply, and the supplementary questions and answers, seems to concern <Col N="1739" /> one particular instance of a temporary postman at Carrigtwohill and it seems to me as a matter of order that to raise on the adjournment a particular case, in which no general principle would appear to be involved, and which would appear to have no general interest, is a bad procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputies will do me the honour of listen-to me while I am on my feet, there will not be any doubt about the order of that.  When a completely new line is opened in the Dáil, it is part of the duty of the Chair to indicate to the Dáil that that is being done, and I think it would be done if Deputy Corry simply wanted to raise on the adjournment a question relating to the employment of a particular individual not raising any general principle at all.  I understand from him now that what he desires to raise is a question of the preference given by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to ex-National Army men for promotion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is quite so.  There has been a tendency to regard the time on the adjournment as being a time when Deputies make speeches, when the Minister gets very little time to answer, and when, during the little time that he gets, he is interrupted persistently.  I hope it is not intended to pursue that policy on the adjournment in future. But I did not state in the beginning that I would not allow Deputy Corry to raise the question.  I simply said there was a new question arising now, as to whether on the adjournment we would have questions raised which have no general interest whatever.  As far as my recollection carries me, that has never occurred.  I am taking Deputy Corry's amended notice.</P>

If the Committee makes recommendations that the Executive Council think can be carried into effect, I will say that the Executive Council will carry them into effect.

    <P>
      <Col N="1747" /> That the Dáil concur with the Seanad in their Resolution communicated to the Dáil on the 16th day of November, 1927, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  That the promoters of every Private Bill which lapsed by reason of the termination of the last Session before the Bill had reached its final stage have leave to proceed with the Bill in the present Session of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>2.  That the Principal Clerk of the Private Bill Office shall lay upon the Table of the Seanad a copy of every such Bill, notice of the intention to proceed with which has been given by the promoters in the Private Bill Office.</P>
    <P>3.  That in respect of every Bill so laid upon the Table the proceedings on such Bill shall be formal in regard to every stage through which the Bill shall have passed in the last Session.</P>
    <P>4.  That no new fees shall be charged in respect of any stage upon which fees have already been paid in a previous Session.</P>
    <P>5.  That all Petitions presented against any such Bill which stood referred to the Committee on such Bill in a previous Session shall stand referred to the Committee on the same Bill in the present Session.</P>
    <P>6.  That no Petitioners shall be heard before the Committee on such Bill unless their Petition shall have been presented within the prescribed time in a previous Session.</P>
    <P>This resolution proposes to deal with Private Bills that had reached a certain stage before the conclusion of the last session.  Of course it is understood that Private Bills involve a certain amount of expenditure, and it is to prevent duplication of that expenditure for the promoters of the Bills that the resolution is put before the Dáil.  Of course the stages which the Bills went through in the previous session will be formally gone through in this session.</P>

      <P>This resolution proposes to deal with Bills that had passed certain stages before the conclusion of the last session. They had reached, say, the First or Second Stage, and, as Private Bills involve a certain amount of expenditure, it is considered unfair that the promoters should be put to the necessity of introducing the Bills de novo and duplicating the expenditure.  It is understood that this House will have a certain amount of control over these Bills afterwards.  When these Bills are sent to this House the motion will be that a Joint Committee be selected. Then it will be open to this House either to accept or reject that proposal, and Deputies will be in a position to express an opinion on the Private Bills. This resolution will not in any way prejudice Deputies' decisions when the Bills come before them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the Bills have passed the Second Stage, and that is the real point at issue.  If a Private Bill gets through the Second Stage in both Houses, we have then committed ourselves to the principle of the measure, and it would be unfair afterwards to reject it on a question of principle. It is only on a question of detail that it ought to be rejected subsequently. These measures cost a very considerable sum of money.  Practically every stage in the whole litany of events as regards Bills costs money. The opinion of the Dáil as expressed in connection with the Second Reading is much the opinion of a jury.  Let me take a case in point.  We had a proposal to widen Butt Bridge.  As far as <Col N="1749" /> the Second Reading was concerned it was purely in relation to Butt Bridge &mdash;whether or not it should be there. We could not deal with the question of its construction up or down the river. Considerable expenditure and delay have been involved by reason of the fact that we have had two general elections in the year.  It would be a blister on Private Bill promoters if, after a general election, the whole of the stages had to be gone through again.</P>
      <P>I would like Deputies to understand that as far as the Second Reading is concerned, the passing of the Second Reading commits the Dáil to the principle of the measure, and there ought not&mdash;I am not saying should not&mdash;be subsequently a rejection on the grounds of principle because of the expense to which the promoters have been put.</P>

      <P>While I see the full force of the remarks made by the President, still I think it is unfair to us to ask us to agree to this, and we will not consent to pass this resolution until we know what the Bills are and until we get full information as to what the Stages are. When we get that information we will be prepared to take into account the view expressed by the President, which is the natural one.  I think we cannot forego our own rights to examine these Bills and see whether we would not prefer to stop them now or to bring in a repealing measure afterwards repealing these Bills if they are passed.</P>

      <P>The real question at issue is not concerned with the merits of the particular Bills that are involved in this motion before the House.  Private Bill business is managed by a Joint Committee of both Houses, and this particular motion was settled by the Joint Committee and passed by the Seanad.  It aims at preventing people who promoted Private <Col N="1750" /> Bills from being damnified by the fact that there was an unexpected dissolution of the Dáil recently.  The Bills themselves must come before this House, and no resolution that we could pass could alter the powers that we have over these Bills.  They must actually come before this House as if this resolution had never been passed. The effect of the resolution is that the whole matter is not to be taken up again with a consequent long delay, and that expenses of advertising and the payment of other fees are not to be gone through again by the promoters.  It can be said that objection has been taken to the motion, and it can be put down for consideration to-morrow.  In view of the adjournment, I take it that to-morrow is a suitable day.</P>

Private Bills are introduced and pass the Second Reading in the Seanad.  The Seanad then sends us a request for the setting up of a Joint Committee on the Bill.  When we assent to that motion and set up a Joint Committee, then we have agreed to the principle, but that has yet to come and inquiries can be made by the Deputies to-morrow.  The motion is postponed until to-morrow.</P>

      <P>Cuirimse os cómhair na Dála an leas-rún so.&mdash;&ldquo;In page 2 to delete lines 31 to 35 inclusive.&rdquo;  Although most of us object to certain principles that are adhered to in this Bill, we may take it that in discussing this particular amendment we will be discussing matters which will cover the ideas we have in mind, particularly in relation to the situation that exists with regard to the abolition or dissolution of the Municipal Council of Dublin, the Board of Guardians of Dublin, and the Municipal Council of Cork and subsidiary bodies.  We on these benches object <i>in toto</i> to the continued existence of the Order which was put in force in 1924, which was acted on in 1924 as if authority existed to do so, and which abolished since that time the Municipal Council of Dublin. Going back a bit, and it is no harm to go over what did happen, we believe that at that time the matter was never discussed in this House.  We believe that when that Order was issued by the Local Government Minister of the time to dissolve the Municipal Council of Dublin that that Order was <i>ultra vires;</i> that there was no authority sought here in this House, as it existed then, for power to suppress the Dublin Corporation.  Of course, that power was obtained later. Therefore, I take it this body put itself in order so far as that original Order, which I at any rate claim was <i>ultra vires,</i> is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have never heard it explained&mdash;I have never seen in print anywhere any statement giving the reason for the suppression of the Municipal Council of Dublin, the Borough Council of Cork, the Board of Guardians in Dublin and some other bodies against whom no charges of mismanagement or corruption were made.  I speak in particular with regard to the Municipal Council of Dublin and the Board of Guardians of Dublin.  We had a discussion last week relative to the County Borough of Cork, and there it was made clear that, so far as Cork was concerned, there was no charge certainly of mismanagement or corruption levelled against that body; neither was there, so far as I am aware, any such charge levelled against the Municipal Council of Dublin.  The <Col N="1753" /> citizens of Dublin&mdash;and I speak especially of those of us who have been connected for a long time with the Municipality of Dublin and with civic affairs&mdash;have been wondering why that body, without any reason, serious or otherwise, being advanced for the act, was suddenly wiped out of existence.  The other day we were discussing the Borough Council of Cork, and Deputy de Loughrey, from Kilkenny, said the Free State Government did right in suppressing the Dublin Corporation.  I know that others have said the same in public.  Responsible people have said it.  I know that the Dublin daily Press has said the same, but I have yet to meet an individual, and I have yet to read in the daily Press or elsewhere, any good or sufficient reasons why that municipal authority of the City of Dublin should have been suppressed.  Deputy de Loughrey did not advance a solitary reason for his statement.  He was reminded, when he spoke of the Dublin Corporation, that Dublin had not had, and the Municipal Council of Dublin did not have, any official in its control in the working of that Municipal Council against whom a charge of misuse of the public funds could have been advanced. We are told that the same could not be said to be true of Kilkenny. No charge of mismanagement, that we know of, was made against the Municipal Council of Dublin.  No charge of corruption was advanced against any official of that Corporation, and no attempt was made to prove any such charge or any such innuendo, and yet the Corporation was dissolved.  No such attempt at proof was made at any time that the Corporation of Dublin had been unsatisfactory to the citizens.</P>
    <P>I had a long connection with that body, as also had the President of the Executive Council.  I, personally, because of my long connection with that Corporation, leaving aside the fact that I am a citizen of Dublin and a ratepayer, because of my long and intimate connection with that body, deeply resent, as a citizen and on behalf of the citizens of Dublin, the fact that, without any inquiry and without any charge being levelled against that body, a Government in this country, <Col N="1754" /> supposed to be the first native Government in existence in Ireland for a century, and the most prominent member of which was formerly most prominent also in the municipal life of Dublin and on the Municipal Council of Dublin, blotted out, so far as it could do so, the Municipal Council of Dublin and filched from the citizens their civic rights.</P>
    <P>That is an act that does not do credit to those who are responsible and it certainly casts grave reflection on the municipal body of Dublin.  I am sorry the President was not here to hear what I have to say.  He was intimately associated with the working of that body.  He was what would be called, in America at any rate, the boss of the Dublin Corporation.  He controlled it practically, he had it in his pocket, and if there were mismanagement or corruption he is more to blame than anyone else from the years 1919 to 1922.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'KELLY Mr. O'KELLY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'KELLY</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly do not. If there was mismanagement that gentleman for three or four years before the abolition was primarily responsible. I must say in regard to the President of the Executive Council that as far as my knowledge goes, and I was fairly intimate with the work he did as a municipal councillor, he was as good as anyone could be in any part of Ireland, in any public body.  He was as efficient, as reliable and as trustworthy as any man ever elected to a public board.  I had twenty years' experience of that body. I think I happened to be in it one year before the President of the Executive Council.  I continued there for a great number of years, and I personally must do what little I can to refute the charge of mismanagement and corruption levelled at it, particularly by the daily Press.  I, personally, never came across anything that anyone could put a finger on and say it was corruption. I have never had that experience.  I would like to say that, in justice to the abolished Corporation which the President of the Executive Council certainly did not show great regard or respect for when he wiped it out at <Col N="1755" /> the first opportunity he got.  He was elected to that body over and over again by the citizens of Dublin.  That body on many occasions paid respect to him, and he ought to have shown a little more gratitude to the city and the citizens that elected him.  The abolition of the municipal council, in my opinion, was entirely autocratic. With the sudden access to power of some of these gentlemen, they thought they were little tin gods.  They got power into their hands, a thing unknown to them before, and they forgot all their teachings with regard to the duties and rights of citizenship and the responsibilities that attached to membership of public offices.  They showed their disrespect for a body that was up to a short time before that the premier public body in the country.  It was certainly a very rotten headline to the country, and there is little credit due to those responsible for that action.  The affairs of the municipal council were handed over to a triumvirate.  I do not know anything about any of them personally, except that I remember one of them in the old Volunteer days, but it was an extraordinary idea to hand over the City of Dublin, with its intricate services and its huge finances, to three absolutely inexperienced men. Of course, they had, as municipal councillors who were newly elected had, the advice of reliable officials, but to throw out a responsible body of citizens, elected by the citizens to control the destinies of the city and put in three well-paid gentlemen, not one of whom had any experience of municipal management and to expect that these men should be able to give better service than the municipal councillors, some of whom, at least, had several years' experience, was preposterous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is certainly an act against which I, as one citizen of Dublin, at any rate, protest with all my might.  We know that the daily Press in Dublin&mdash;the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; Newspapers and, to a greater extent, the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo;&mdash; were delighted at this action and gave it their blessing.  We know, as long as I can remember taking any interest in public life, that certainly the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo;&mdash;the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; was not <Col N="1756" /> so long under the same control, since it came into the hands of the late Mr. William Martin Murphy, a very respected citizen&mdash;we know that for a great number of years since the wider and more democratic franchise was introduced there has been a persistent campaign against the municipal council of Dublin on the part of these two newspapers.  As long as the municipal council was controlled by what I might call the old gang&mdash;those who were not elected on the broad franchise &mdash;the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; did not have much complaint.  They criticised naturally, from time to time, but they never demanded the filching from the citizens of their civic rights.  From the time that the late Mr. William Martin Murphy was defeated in his efforts to get control of the electric lighting system of Dublin, the newspaper which he and his family controlled has been bitterly hostile to the municipality of Dublin.  Therein, to my mind, lies a good deal of the unswerving hostility that that particular paper has shown towards the management of municipal affairs by the popularly-elected body.  Those who own and control the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; Newspapers wanted to control and run the electricity undertaking in Dublin, now owned by the municipality, despite the efforts of the Murphy family.  But they to a great extent own and certainly control the tramways in Dublin.  There was an idea in recent years in the minds of the members of the Dublin Municipal Council that these tramways, being a public service, ought to be owned by the citizens, and that when the lease of the tramways, which was renewed in 1896, fell in, that the municipality would take over the tramways.  I wonder if the abolition of the Municipal Council in Dublin did not have some connection with the renewal of the lease of the tramway company or of the streets of the city of Dublin to the Dublin Tramways Company.  That may seem, in the minds of some, to be farfetched, but when we know that quite recently the lease of the streets of Dublin, which had several years to run still, has been renewed for a further long period&mdash;it has been renewed behind the backs of the citizens by the gentlemen who now, nominated <Col N="1757" /> by the Free State Government, control the city and its finances&mdash;the suspicion is in the minds of many citizens that it is a far-sighted move on behalf of those who had a personal financial interest in the matter.  That may have been one of the reasons suggested&mdash;that the Corporation might not have so easily given away a lease but might have demanded a bigger price for the use of the city's streets&mdash;why that body was wiped out and three gentlemen who could be induced&mdash;I will not use a stronger word&mdash;more easily to deal lightly with a body like the Tramways Company, and to have perhaps a less sense of responsibility of what is due to Dublin and its citizens than the old municipality would have or the new municipality if there had been one elected in the meantime put in their place.</P>

      <P>That suggestion was made, and it certainly is in the back of my mind.  It may be because these people are long-sighted and wanted the Municipal Council out of the way, because they could get a renewal of their lease more easily in other quarters, that the Municipality was wiped out.  Then <Col N="1758" /> we are told that it was in order to introduce a system which would mean better civic management that the Corporation was abolished.  If there were a serious idea in the minds of those who abolished the Corporation that they wanted to get some other kind of system of municipal management, it would not necessarily follow that in order to make inquiries or to study other systems of municipal control or management that they would have to abolish the Municipality of Dublin in the meantime.  It was not even because it was desirable to extend the boundaries of Dublin that the Corporation of the city had to be abolished.  In my time&mdash;it is not so very long ago &mdash;I remember the boundaries of Dublin City being extended, and it was not necessary to suspend the functioning of the Municipal Council of Dublin while that process was going through.  I cannot, therefore, see that there is any serious reason why, in order to extend the boundaries of Dublin, if that be decided upon at present, the Municipal Council of Dublin should not be restored and should not function in a normal way, and why the citizens should not have their civic rights restored to them.  Important as the Greater Dublin Report is, that excuse does not hold water.  I really am at a loss to know what was in the minds of those who adopted such an autocratic way of dealing with an old body like the Corporation of Dublin, one that in Ireland's fight for freedom in recent years and within the last century and a quarter had done its share.  That body, speaking as a municipality in its corporate capacity, had helped very materially to make a success of the fight in recent years against British rule in Ireland.  Anything that it, as a corporate body, could do to help that fight was done by it, and on many occasions it gave a lead to the whole country and to public bodies all over Ireland as to what such bodies could do and should do to help to get Ireland free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of those who had been a leader in that direction was to the front in suppressing the old-established, respected&mdash;it was worthy of respect, too, in every way as far as my knowledge goes&mdash;Municipality of Dublin.  I am at <Col N="1759" /> a loss to know what was at the back of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'KELLY</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps he had.  I do not know, and I hope you had.  To my mind, judging by experience, it should not have been done in order to secure better municipal management because in the last few years, looking on the city as I see it, there has not been any improvement in management that would justify such improper action being taken by this body or any responsible person connected with it towards the Municipal Council of Dublin.  It was a body that ought to have, if only for its work within the last five or six years before it was suppressed, earned the respect of those who form the responsible element in the Government of the Free State.  It did not get that, and, therefore, I claim, at any rate, that those responsible people who abolished the Corporation showed the basest ingratitude.  I also claim that the city has not been better managed.  Rates have been reduced undoubtedly, and I am as glad of that as anybody.  It means as much to me as it means to the majority of citizens&mdash;to my own pocket&mdash;but I would be prepared to sacrifice what little has been gained if it were necessary, as I believe it is, to treat the poor of Dublin better than they have been treated by the Commissioners appointed by the Minister for Local Government.  Since they came into office I am informed that they have tightened up&mdash;no one could object to that if there was looseness&mdash;relief inside the various buildings associated with the old Dublin Union, but as regards home assistance or poor relief they have gone too far in my opinion. They have gone further than present conditions of life in the city for the poor justify.  As one who is a Dublin Deputy&mdash;I am sure every Deputy from the city of Dublin has the same experience&mdash;I am every day bombarded by callers and communications from people who are very poor and half starved, but who nevertheless are entitled to every consideration and respect.  They are entitled, too, to the <Col N="1760" /> relief which is provided out of the rates paid by the people.  They find, unlike the old days when they could go to a Guardian, get a friendly hearing and get their cases considered, in these times that they have the greatest difficulty in getting consideration for even urgent cases of distress in our city.  From that point of view, things have not improved, but instead have very much disimproved.  It is true, of course, that the rates have come down. No one objects to that if in bringing them down hardship is not imposed upon the people who are least able to bear it.</P>
      <P>Looking around the city, I agree that the centre of it is very clean.  In some respects perhaps certain streets are better looked after than they used to be in the days of the old Municipal Council. But if one goes into the back lanes, the back streets, the alleys and the slums, he will see there sights during weather like this which are certainly no credit to any body in control of the municipality.  While, as I have said, some of the city streets are getting more attention than used to be paid to them in the old days, I do say that the back streets of our city are neglected.  But there are other things happening, such, for instance, as the taking up of the pavement in Dame Street.  The pavement there was quite good and would have lasted for perhaps another ten years.  It was taken up perhaps for publicity value&mdash;in order to give the Press something to talk about in praise of the wonderful young men who have transformed certain streets of the city.  That pavement, in my opinion, would have lasted for another ten years, but it has been taken up and the street has been asphalted at very considerable cost.  Things like that are done to give opportunity perhaps for praise and publicity for those concerned, but to my mind at least they do not mean that the city is better governed than it was ten years before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody called my attention the other day to the fact&mdash;I suppose it is a kind of quid pro quo&mdash;that the part of Middle Abbey Street nearest to the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; Office has been dug up and a new noiseless road laid down. But the same thing was not done near <Col N="1761" /> Jervis Street Hospital, a hundred yards further down the street.  I think we could reasonably claim that a public institution of that nature was as deserving of consideration, if there were noiseless streets being handed out, as was the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; newspaper office.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said and published with regard to housing improvements in Dublin during the last five or six years since these wonderful, active and brilliant young men took control. But there is one test that one might put, and I think it is a just test, to find out what exactly, so far as housing is concerned, has been the improvement in the city.  I asked for and got figures the other day which proved, although we are told wonders have been done and thousands of houses have been built and that there are great schemes in operation, that, notwithstanding all that, it is a fact that there are a greater number of families living in one-roomed tenements in the City of Dublin to-day than there were five years ago. These are the facts, and these figures can be got even from the Municipality itself.  That, to my mind, disproves any claim that can be made that as far as housing is concerned any advance whatsoever has been made.  As a matter of fact, we have retrograded.</P>
    <P>There is only one direction that I am conscious of in which an advance, as some people might call it, has been made, and that is in the publicity of Dublin as a municipal centre.  The activities of these three well-paid, brilliant young men, who, as we have been cold, have instituted so many social reforms in the municipal life of Dublin, have certainly reformed the old Dublin as we used to know it so far as publicity is concerned.  They have a lot to say in praise of their own work.  The Corporation of the old days got little praise.  Perhaps they did not deserve it, but I do not think they looked for it. These gentlemen, whatever the reason, seem to me to give more of their attention to getting publicity and praise for their work, for whatever they do, than one would expect or than one would think right and proper if they were giving the whole of their time, as one would expect them <Col N="1762" /> to do, to the work of the municipality. With regard to this publicity there was, to use a slang word, one stunt held a couple of months ago in the city.  It advertised Dublin as if Dublin were a fifth-rate American town that had sprung up in a few weeks and that wanted to boost itself.  This stunt they called Civic Week.  Well, what that Civic Week did to make Dublin better known or more respected inside or outside the ambit of the municipality I do not know.  I am not aware that it did anything to raise the credit of Dublin City or of the Dublin Municipality. They erected some kind of a wooden structure on O'Connell Bridge.  I think it was &ldquo;Dublin Opinion&rdquo; that called it &ldquo;Dublin's Empty Formula.&rdquo;  What value it had or what value we got out of the sum of close on £2,000 that it cost, goodness only knows.</P>
    <P>The whole of that week's proceedings seemed to me to be a lowering of the dignity that attaches to the municipality of Dublin.  We had a week of jazz and a circus of some kind parading the city.  Ladies&mdash;I do not know anything about them and I do not know anyone who does&mdash;were brought here on beauty show.  Imagine bringing beauties from outside to a city like Dublin.  Someone beside me suggests that it was like bringing coals to Newcastle.  Well I do not think Paris can teach us anything in that way or that they possess any attributes in that way that we need look to.  Bringing people here about whom little is known was certainly not adding to the dignity or sense of responsibility of this old municipality.  The bringing of them may have given a little enjoyment to the Minister for Local Government and the officials concerned, parading around and dancing around those beauties, showing them off and airing, perhaps, their French, but what in God's name all that did to help to raise the tone of Dublin City or to add to the dignity of this old municipality I do not know.</P>

      <P>If the citizens of Dublin were in control of the city, which they are not owing to the Local Elections Act, that sort of &ldquo;codology&rdquo;<Col N="1763" /> would not be tolerated.  We have our own ideas of beauty here and we have our own ideas of what constitutes good citizenship and what constitutes dignity.  We do not need jazz bands from Paris or elsewhere to teach us anything in that respect.  We do not need&mdash;I do not want to say a word in disrespect of them&mdash;ladies from Paris or elsewhere in France to teach us anything in regard to what constitutes beauty.  Perhaps the Minister and his acolytes who control the municipality do need a little tuition or, perhaps, they thought they did when they imported these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do feel that Dublin has been badly treated.  I do feel that the dignity of our city has been hurt.  I do feel that a body which gave good service, not alone to the citizens, but to the national movement&mdash;a body that even during the period of membership of the President of the Executive Council gave service second to none in the movement for the liberation of our country&mdash;that that body should be wiped out of existence, a body of which President Cosgrave was such a valued member, and who did, as I said earlier when he was not present, such good work in his time.  I do feel that that body should have been wiped out of existence without any discussion, without any charge of mismanagement, without any charge of corruption being levelled against it, without any opportunity being given to that body to defend itself.  I feel that we should make an earnest protest against that.  I take this opportunity, speaking as one citizen who has some sense of responsibility, who has a love for the old city, and who believes that it ought not to be treated in that way, to protest against the system which has been adopted.  It is to get an opportunity of voicing that protest, and helping to bring to an early end the period over which this order abolishing the Corporation will run, that I move this amendment.  We believe that it is not necessary to continue the extinction of the Corporation for another nine months or for another year, or perhaps longer, in order to discuss the question of Greater Dublin or the reconstruction of the municipality. <Col N="1764" /> We believe that all that could be discussed, and discussed well, while the Municipal Council was carrying on its ordinary functions.  Therefore, we believe that the amendment I have proposed to shorten the period is in order, and ought be adopted by this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterDeLoughry" hpid="Mr. DE LOUGHREY Mr. DE LOUGHREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE LOUGHREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to take part in this debate, but as Deputy O'Kelly has referred to a statement by me, that the Government were justified in every case in which they appointed Commissioners, I think I might be allowed to explain.  Deputy O'Kelly says I made no attempt to prove that the Corporation of Dublin was unsatisfactory&mdash;that I made no reference to the mismanagement of the Dublin Corporation.  I did not, and I never intended to do so.  I think he sums up the situation himself when he says he could not put his finger on anything that could be called corruption. I should be long sorry to stand up here and charge any elected body with corruption.  But we know that a municipal body, like a Corporation, can be inefficient and unsatisfactory without being actually corrupt.  At least, that is my experience&mdash;that you will find such a state of affairs existing for many years in a public body that no matter how well you divide your energy in order to bring it into a state of efficiency, you are handicapped by the fact that you inherit a good deal of inefficiency.  I think that applies generally.  I would like to make it quite clear that I am not in favour of Commissioners as a permanent cure for unsatisfactory local government. While I believe that there are cases in which the appointment of Commissioners is not only justifiable but desirable&mdash;that there are councils which have, so to speak, run to seed and require different methods&mdash;I do believe that Commissioners as a permanent cure would be unsatisfactory. Nevertheless, I believe that the general body of the electorate in Dublin would vote for the continuance of Commissioners. I have only the knowledge derived in discussing the matter with citizens in Dublin to justify me in that statement.  There were certainly expressions of dissatisfaction with the methods of the Dublin Corporation.  I <Col N="1765" /> believe that in Kilkenny, for instance, the electors would vote for Commissioners. Notwithstanding that, I disagree with this method, because I think it tends to kill public spirit.  I think that even if you got better administration from Commissioners, it would be a very undesirable method of administration, because it would kill local interest and public spirit.  I never heard it stated that it was the intention of the Local Government Department to retain the Commissioners in Dublin or elsewhere longer than was absolutely necessary.  I take it that they regard this as only a temporary expedient.  I think they should get support in putting back the Dublin Corporation, the Cork Corporation, and any other bodies that have been dissolved, so that these bodies could start off with new life.  I think that we, as a young State, should give our capital city a decent start and make it a city that we can all be proud of.  I do not want to criticise the Dublin Corporation of the past.  I believe the members did their best, but they were up against a situation, as others were up against similar situations elsewhere, which they could not control.  I hope that, as soon as possible, but not sooner than is desirable or safe, the Commissioners for the City of Dublin and the City of Cork will be replaced by elected bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>During the debates on the Second Reading and on the Committee Stage Deputies on these Benches tried to extract from the Government, in the first place, some explanation as to why the Dublin Corporation was suppressed, and, secondly, why it was necessary to continue its suppression until March, 1929.  We have not succeeded.  No reasons whatever have been given, except one which, I think, was obviously not the correct one, namely, that the report of the Greater Dublin Commission has not yet been adequately considered, or the legislation that will arise out of it drafted. I should like to know from the Minister what were the reasons for the suppression of the Dublin Corporation, and do those reasons still exist.  Deputy De Loughrey, who is a member of the Government Party, has assured <Col N="1766" /> us that, although the Government was justified, there was no mismanagement or corruption proved against the Dublin Corporation.  He said, however, that the Corporation was inefficient&mdash;that it had gone to seed.  If such were the case, the evil could have been remedied by the election of a new Council.  There is no one here who will suggest that the Council which was in office at the time of the dissolution should be continued indefinitely.  That particular Council had, for various reasons in connection with the troubled period during which it existed, lost a number of its most useful members. Another election, I submit, could have been usefully held and a new Council elected.  That new Council could have been conducting the affairs of the city while the Greater Dublin Commission was discussing the problem of municipal management and preparing its report. While that report is being considered by the Executive Council, we are told that it is necessary to continue the suppression of the Corporation until March, 1929, because it will take that time to enable the Government to prepare, introduce and have passed the necessary legislation arising out of the report of the Greater Dublin Commission.  I cannot convince myself that that is the correct explanation. I believe that there was some motive, which we have not even glimpsed at, originally behind the suppression of the Corporation, which is now the reason for continuing its suppression long after the date on which the other local government elections will have been held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us cast our minds back over the period during which the Commissioners have been in control and see what exactly has happened, in order to discover, if possible, a clue to the reason for their appointment.  We know that practically their first triumph, or successful performance, after their appointment was that they succeeded in reducing the wages of the Corporation workers very considerably.  These reductions have been continued.  As Deputy Boland pointed out on the Second Reading, the last reduction endured by the Corporation workers was followed immediately afterwards by an increase of £200 per year to each <Col N="1767" /> of the Commissioners.  Was it in order to ensure that reduction of wages that the Corporation was suppressed?  Possibly, it may have been one of the reasons.  Deputy O'Kelly has mentioned the matter of the tramway lease.  That was a big reason.  Possibly that lease in itself was the real reason behind the suppression of the Corporation, because I do not think it is likely that the elected representatives of the citizens would have so lightly entered into the matter as the Commissioners did.  There was no urgency in the matter.  I think I am correct in stating that the existing lease holds good for a few years yet, and the whole matter could have been left over until the Greater Dublin Commission had been set up and the elected representatives of the people had an opportunity of considering it.  Now they are presented with a fait accompli. They have no choice in the matter. Their property has been given away from them without their consent.</P>
    <P>There was a reduction in the rates, we are told.  I think an examination will reveal that a very considerable portion of that reduction was automatic and would have come about just as surely if an elected Council had been in control instead of the Commissioners. The remaining portion of the reduction was secured, as Deputy O'Kelly pointed out, by economy in the wrong direction&mdash;by cutting the rations that were given to the poor in the Union and by economy in the administration of outdoor relief to an extent involving great hardship on the lowest strata of the population.  That is one way to secure economy.  If you abolished outdoor relief altogether, pulled down your Union and dismissed the officials, you would be able to secure a very considerable reduction in the rates.  If you abolished all other municipal services of a charitable kind, you would be able to reduce the rates still further. But I do not think that the ratepayers of Dublin want reductions made in that way.  I think that they would be prepared to pay a fair share to maintain in some degree of comfort the destitute poor of this city.  These things are past and it is our purpose now to try and find out what is going to happen <Col N="1768" /> within the next sixteen or seventeen months, while the Commissioners are in control, to explain the extraordinary delay in the consideration of the report of the Greater Dublin Commission.  I have been trying to discover it, and I do not think I have succeeded yet.  I hear that an agreement is being negotiated to place the public libraries of the city under the control of the Carnegie Trust.  Whether that is correct or not, I do not know, but there are certainly strong rumours to that effect in circulation in the city.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate we would like to know the truth of it.  There is one thing certain&mdash;that no elected Council in Dublin would consent to such an agreement.  I can hardly think that it is proposed to reduce the wages of the workers any lower than they are. That is a physical impossibility.  They must give the men enough to keep them living at any rate from week to week, and that is barely what they are giving at present.  Of course, the Town Clerk has been given a remunerative position in connection with the Shannon scheme, and I do not think that there are any other officials to be placed in highly paid positions that do not require considerable activity.  It is very hard to know what is the real reason for continuing the Commissioners in power and postponing the election of the Corporation from June until March, 1929, and I hope the Minister will endeavour to enlighten us.  As I said previously here, it strikes me, and it is striking the citizens of Dublin, that the Executive Council do not appreciate the seriousness of their action in taking from the people of Dublin, and of the other municipal areas in the country, their democratic rights.  We, as the representatives of the people, and the guardians of their rights, should grudge every moment during which the suppression of the Dublin Corporation and these other Councils is continued. That is our function.  It is for that we were elected&mdash;to preserve the rights of the people who sent us here. One of the rights of the people of Dublin is to have a direct voice in the control of their municipal affairs, and <Col N="1769" /> it is as much the duty of the Deputies elected for Dublin on the Government Benches, as it is the duty of the Deputies on these benches, to see that these rights are restored to the Dublin people at the earliest possible moment.</P>
      <P>I believe if the Minister for Local Government would try and ginger up his staff and get things moving it would be possible to have legislation introduced and passed through this House before June which would enable the elections to take place in Dublin on the same date and time as the elections for municipal bodies in the country.  Deputy de Loughrey is quite right when he says that if we want to restore the proper civic spirit amongst our people we must give them the civic responsibility. We cannot produce that spirit amongst the people of Dublin that we would like to see until the citizens feel that they have direct responsibility for every action taken that affects the affairs of the city.  Deputy O'Kelly mentioned Civic Week.  I do not want to deal with that, except to mention a matter on which I feel very strongly.</P>
      <P>The Mansion House in Dublin and other municipal halls were available during that week for beauty shows and jazz dancing competitions.  But when Madame Markievicz, a lady representative of the City of Dublin, died recently, and it was attempted to secure one of those halls for the purpose of having the body laid in state so that the citizens might pay a last tribute to her memory every municipal hall was refused, and it was necessary to hire a concert hall to enable that lying-in-state to take place.  I consider that studied insult offered to the people who elected that lady to be their representative was itself sufficient to condemn the whole Commissioner system and the mentality behind it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy de Loughrey said he is not in favour of continuing the Commissioners longer than is necessary.  Necessary for what?  That is the question I have been asking during the whole course of my remarks.  Longer than is necessary? I want to know why it is necessary to have them at all in the first place, and, secondly, why it is necessary to make an exception in the case of Dublin and <Col N="1770" /> to keep the Commissioners in office longer than is necessary?</P>

      <P>I did not intend to make any contribution to this debate, but I suppose in some respects I am the principal villain of the piece, having been the Minister responsible at the time.  I intend to explain my position as briefly as possible.  The two speeches delivered from the Opposition Benches, one by Deputy O'Kelly and the other by Deputy Lemass, would have served a more useful purpose if delivered three years ago.  At least, they might possibly have served some purpose then, but post mortem jeremiads of this kind are not going to serve any very useful purpose now. The question as to whether the Government were justified in the abolition of the Corporation or not is going to be decided by the experience which we have gone through rather than by any theoretical argument, pro or con.  We know what the facts are.  Even Deputy O'Kelly could do no more in criticising the Commissioners than damn them with faint praise.  He has had to admit that the rates are reduced, that services are better, that the roads are better, that the streets are cleaner and that there are more houses available, and in order to find some fly in the ointment, he had to go down to the slums.</P>
      <P>There is no city in the world of which I have had experience but has its slums.  You cannot get rid of them. Even in New York, San Francisco, Chicago, on the continent, and in London there are many slums.  If the body responsible for the control&mdash; the municipality&mdash;is able to keep its particular streets in first-class order, I think it is as much as could be expected. You must have first and second class streets in every city, and you cannot have them all up to the same level of perfection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been accused of putting out the Corporation without legitimate excuse. The Corporation was put out after a public inquiry was held.  I was the individual responsible for signing the order.  I was an Extern Minister at the time and had a certain amount of responsibility.  I believed at the time that the extinction of the Corporation <Col N="1771" /> would justify itself.  I had some experience in another country.  I was in the City of Buffalo and I saw how Commissioners had been appointed and justified their appointment.  I was, also, in the model city of Dayton, in Ohio, where Commissioners had been appointed, and gave complete satisfaction. I was always quite confident that the suppression of the Dublin Corporation would justify itself.  It has done so.  The excuse for putting out the Dublin Corporation was not corruption. We held a public inquiry.  We did not find corruption, and we did not expect to find it.  We found that there was a certain amount of mismanagement, and we realised that the time had come to make a change.  We realised that we would have increased efficiency and that we would gain economically by putting in Commissioners. There is an idea that because you have a body in existence for a great number of years you ought never change it, that the old order should never be changed, and that you should never have anything new.  But that is a wholly wrong conception.</P>
    <P>It is asked why the Commissioners are continued.  Everyone is aware that there was a Commission set up, known as the Greater Dublin Commission, to inquire into the whole question of the administration of Dublin.  That took a long time.  They published a short report. It took a very long time to hear all the evidence, and it will take a considerable time to put into operation machinery based on that report.  Personally I do not know what action the Government will take later on, but I hope the Commissioner system will be retained, whether with some kind of an advisory body or not I do not know. But I would be very sorry, and I think the citizens of Dublin would be very sorry, to revert to the old Corporation system.</P>

      <P>There is one point in connection with this amendment which I would like the Minister for Local Government to refer to when he comes to reply.  The last speaker referred to the reduction of the rates effected by the Commissioner system, in justification of the suppression of the Dublin Corporation <Col N="1772" /> and the appointment of the Commissioners.  Attention has been repeatedly drawn to the reduction in rates they affected.  I should like to ask the Minister if it is not a fact that at the time of the suppression of the Dublin Corporation the public debt was, approximately, £2,400,000, and that at the present time it is approximately £3,600,000, an increase of £1,200,000, and is it not a fact that if that £1,200,000 had been levied on the rates it would mean an average additional rate of 8/- in the £ on the intervening years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOLT</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the black spots in the history of President Cosgrave's régime is that in respect of the dissolution of public bodies in the Free State and the appointment of paid Commissioners. I quite agree with Deputy O'Kelly when he says there was no reason for the dissolution of the Dublin Corporation, or, indeed, for the dissolution of any other public body in the twenty-six counties.  I say here from experience&mdash;experience gained in the case of the Leitrim County Council, the first public body in the twenty-six counties to be dissolved&mdash;that the work of the public bodies has not been carried out as well by the Commissioners appointed by the Local Government Department as by the suppressed public bodies consisting of elected representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will take the case of the Leitrim County Council to prove this assertion. When the Commissioner who was appointed for the County Leitrim came there to discharge the duties of the dissolved County Council the rate on land was 1s. 11d. in the £, and the rate on buildings was 3s. 11d.  When the Commissioner left Leitrim the rate on land had risen to 6s. 6d. in the £, and on buildings to 10s.  The overdraft when the Commissioner left was something like £35,000.  That in itself proves that the duties were not carried out half as well, or, indeed, anything like as <Col N="1773" /> well as when the Leitrim people had their own county council there.  There was no audit of accounts.  We are not in a position even yet to say how things stand.  We know from experience that things were not done as well as they would have been done by the local bodies.  We have had no audit of accounts of the Leitrim County Council from 1922 to 1926, during the time the Commissioner was there.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Deputies opposite have a mandate from their constituents to vote for the retention of the Commissioners in Dublin and Cork?  Are the Deputies from Leitrim, who sit opposite, and who have a knowledge of what happened in the case of the Leitrim County Council, prepared to disfranchise the citizens of Dublin in a manner similar to that in which the ratepayers in Leitrim have been disfranchised and mulcted?  The discharge of the duties of the Commissioner brought about a series of abuses from start to finish, and I say that in order to stop this at once the first thing the Government should do is to have an election in Dublin and Cork.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. BRISCOE Mr. BRISCOE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BRISCOE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not very much to say on this matter.  I have given a little consideration to matters connected with Dublin City and I have tried to verify whether the objections that have arisen to the Commissioners taking over the powers of the Corporation of Dublin can be justified.  I have not approached this matter from the angle of a party subject, from any political angle, and I have not approached it merely for the sake of saying something about it with others.  I find that the Government do not seem to realise that there are many things wrong as a result of the present administration. Deputy Lemass first of all mentioned that when we, representing the City of Dublin, approached Commissioner Hernon&mdash;I was one of the men who went along with the deputation&mdash;for the use of the Mansion House for the lying-in-state of the remains of Madame Markievicz, Commissioner Hernon could give us no reason.  His explanation was that he had received instructions from Merrion Street not to give us the use of that place.  That was the secret of the administration.  The Commissioners' <Col N="1774" /> affairs are not administered from Dublin City Hall; it is Merrion Street that is administering.</P>
      <P>I had an interview with Doctor O'Dwyer with regard to derelict sites in Dublin and I tried to discuss with him ways and means by which these derelict sites could be acquired and much-needed housing accommodation for the poorer people of Dublin, living in slums and tenement dwellings, erected.  Some of the slums and tenement dwellings that I refer to were condemned for various reasons.  I was given to understand that there was no such thing as an impossibility in the building of more than one thousand houses per annum, as was put up to us in the unemployment debates.  Doctor O'Dwyer tells me that the reason they cannot build houses is because they have not the money.  He tells me further that this money does not come through a Government grant other than the grants they give in the ordinary house-building schemes, and he mentioned that it would not be wise to borrow money for the building of houses, first because it might interfere with the floating of the National Loan, and, secondly, because they owe enough already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not the outlook that the ratepayers would have.  The representatives of the ratepayers would examine the situation and they would realise that we have slums.  I do not believe the Parliamentary Secretary, Mr. Bourke, when he tells us that there are condemned dwellings in places other than Dublin administered to a certain extent by Commissioners or by the elected representatives.  In Dublin there is a lot of work to be done in that regard, and if you restore the representatives of the people on the Dublin Corporation they will have the responsibility of looking after the requirements of their fellow-citizens. Obstacles such as Dr. O'Dwyer has to overcome, possibly as a result of interviews in Merrion Street, would be more easily overcome by the representatives of the people.  With regard to the houses that have been built, we have heard frequently of the number but I have yet to find a house that has been built which is suitable for a workman <Col N="1775" /> from the point of view that he is able to pay the rent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. BRISCOE Mr. BRISCOE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BRISCOE</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that later on.  At the present time there is no use in building houses for workmen when they cannot go into them because the rents are too high.  There is no use in putting men in houses if they have to starve themselves when they go there and pay a rent that is too high. There is an objection from certain circles with regard to the building of self-contained flats.  A certain number of flats are being built.  I have asked questions of prominent men in business in the city in regard to the erection on properly-acquired sites of houses for workmen on the basis of the buildings in Temple Bar, and I find that houses could be erected and charges for rent could be made that would be more in keeping with the capacity of the workman. There is no doubt about that, and if the President wants to get particulars he will not have much difficulty.</P>

      <P>I am not a builder. Has it been attempted by the Commissioners, or has it been proved a failure by the Commissioners?  They are building houses at present, and there is no failure about it.  Where a local body is established through election by the citizens you have your local unemployment questions solved by the locally elected representatives.  In Dublin, because of the way the Commissioners run the city, the question of local unemployment gets no consideration at all.  I have in mind a certain incident. At the time the Commissioners took over the Corporation there was a department employing permanent men who were on the Corporation staff, and who did the work of compiling registers.  The Commissioners, with a view to effecting economy, disbanded that department and put the men who were permanently employed on a temporary basis.  I find now that out of <Col N="1776" /> the sixty men who were permanently employed at one time, and who were afterwards made temporary, four are now employed and the rest are ex-National Army officers.  I think that is a grievance.  Where we have an elected body they will look after questions of unemployment, and they will not look into it in any political sense.</P>

      <P>Or even one.  I will put it down at even one if you like. One even is wrong.  The fact that you have now one man who was a permanent member of the old staff of the Corporation when the Commissioners took over, and who is now unemployed, is wrong.  The fact that even one permanent man became a temporary man as a result of the Commissioners' campaign of economy, and is now unemployed and replaced by an ex-National Army officer, is wrong.  The one thing I would like to get back to is this: I would like to see the Dublin Corporation restored, because if they are restored some more humane point <Col N="1777" /> of view would be taken with regard to the building of living accommodation for the poorer people of this city.  I do not think the President has gone over the district that he once was very much interested in&mdash;I mean the Meath Street district.  The deputation on which I went to Commissioner Dwyer arose out of a deputation that was appointed ten years ago, and in which the President was interested, and that was with respect to derelict sites in Meath Street.  Nothing in connection with that matter was done by the Commissioners although the Corporation, when they were dissolved, had schemes to deal with this very matter; these schemes were shelved because of the economies propounded by the Commissioners. I believe if we get back in Dublin to the elected representatives of the city, and have them to take over the Corporation, not only will you have the departments, such as the Electricity Department, a paying concern, but you will have the other departments run just as well, and I believe we will have a better understanding with regard to cheap living accommodation for the less fortunate people of the city.</P>

The Deputy will find that in connection with the building schemes under the old Corporation, speaking now of the last thirty years, the type of housing which he describes as flats was the most uneconomic type of building which was possible for the Corporation to carry out.  The Deputy does not believe it.  I would advise him if he is still an unrepentant unbeliever in respect of that, that he should get the figures, the published accounts of the Dublin Corporation, and that he should get the report of the Departmental Housing Inquiry which took place in 1913, and which was published in 1914.  He could satisfy himself on the point, and if still dissatisfied he could invite a couple of those with whom he is acquainted in order to give an example of citizenship by way of a housing experiment and showing how it can be done.</P>

      <P>Considering this matter this evening, I wondered, with the anxiety of the Government to appoint Commissioners, and their craving for Commissioners, that they never got the idea of appointing a couple of Commissioners to run the country.  When you consider the fact that £23,000 a year is paid to the Deputies of this House, I think you will see that a lot of economy can be effected here.  Coming from the county which has been, and I say it deliberately, Commissioner-ridden recently, I make this suggestion. We have there Commissioners being shoved around from one post to another.  We have there, in fact, Commissioners who were found, in the <Col N="1779" /> finish, to be absolutely unable to manage their own home affairs, and who have been withdrawn from being Commissioners on that account&mdash; through being unable to manage their own home affairs.  We have a Commissioner now in the Cork Corporation. He happens to be at present a member of the Public Health Board in Cork, representing five members of Cork City.  I have noticed that the Mommissioner's chief anxiety there is to cut down the relief that we are giving to the poor.</P>
      <P>There are members of that body on the opposite benches and they are aware of that.  He was the individual who stood up the other day to make the case and to say that the Local Government Department were wrong in interfering with the salary of a gentleman who was drawing £900 a year.  Doubtless he had some fears as to his own salary.  I wonder what case has been made for the suppression of the Cork Corporation and other Corporations that could not be made equally well and with equal strength for the suppression of the members of this House and for the appointment of Commissioners here.  I cannot see any.  If the people cannot be trusted to elect representatives to manage the Corporation and to manage the affairs of the county, and the affairs of the city, how can they be trusted to elect representatives to manage the affairs of the twenty-six counties?  I wonder that the members opposite have the impertinence to offer themselves as candidates at all if they could not trust the electors.  How did the President offer himself as candidate for Cork City when he cannot trust the people of that city to elect the Corporation?</P>

      <P>The President gulled them sufficiently to elect him.  But I see no reason whatsoever for retaining the Commissioners and I think the time has come when we, who are in here to protect the rights of the citizens everywhere, must see to it that this Commissioner system is abolished and at once.  I see no case put up for it that could not be put up very much more strongly for the abolition of this House <Col N="1780" /> and the appointment of three Commissioners to discharge our duties here.  It would save a great deal of money to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been pointed out already, the effect of Section 3 is still to allow the Minister his discretion with regard to retaining the Commissioners in Dublin City, Dublin Union, in the Corporation of Cork and in the Urban District Councils of Trim, Ennis and Westport.  The effect of removing this section will be to withdraw from the Minister his discretion in these matters.  Now as far as the three urban district councils are concerned, I am not yet convinced that it is right in the interest of the ratepayers and in the general interests of the affairs of the Urban District that the election in these districts should take place in June.  If I am persuaded between this and June, that in these districts an election can take place, then there is nothing to prevent an Order being issued ordering an election in these places.  At the present moment, I see no reason why an election should take place there.  In the case of Cork, I dealt with that in Committee.  In the case of Dublin, I want to reiterate that as far as the Corporation is concerned, and as far as the Dublin Union is concerned, I cannot recommend at all that the Commissioners be removed and that they be replaced by elected bodies in time to have an election take place in June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Kelly has spoken at great length on this particular matter.  He opened his statement with a whole broadside of misrepresentations.  When we consider the City of Dublin, we consider very important interests, very important concerns for the people of the city and for the people of the country as a whole, and it is wrong and unfair to the judgment of members of this House that a case should be endeavoured to be made in connection with the matter, prefaced, as I say, by a whole broadside of misrepresentations.  Deputy O'Kelly stated that the Dublin Corporation was suppressed without any inquiry, that he never saw any reasons for its suppression, that the Government at the time sought no authority for it, but that it obtained powers later.  As <Col N="1781" /> bring us any further, and I must beg regards the statement that there was no inquiry, a proposal to hold an inquiry was duly advertised in the Press, and an inquiry was publicly held in the Mansion House on 11th March, 1924, and from the 19th March, to the 24th March, 1924.  Deputy O'Kelly said that the Corporation was dissolved without any inquiry, that there were no reasons. The fullest publicity was given in the Press to the evidence that was given before that inquiry and an order was publicly issued declaring that after the holding of the said inquiry the Minister for Local Government was satisfied that the duties of the Council of the County Borough of Dublin were not being duly and effectually discharged by them.  No reasons!  No authority!  And the suggestion that having dissolved the Corporation we came back to the Dáil and got authority for it!  Section 12 of the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, gave the Minister power to hold an inquiry and, for particular reasons, to dissolve any public authority.  That was passed on 28th March, 1923.  After due public inquiry, and within the authority given to him under the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, the Dublin Corporation was dissolved by the Minister on the 20th March, 1924, more than twelve months after the Minister had been empowered by the Dáil to take the action that was taken.  Yet, the Deputies who may not recollect the position at that particular time are informed by Deputy O'Kelly that no authority was sought for the dissolution, and that power was obtained later.  It is unfair, in the discussion of a very important matter, that a Deputy should get up and endeavour to blind the Dáil to facts.  The Dublin Corporation was dissolved for the reasons stated in the Order given by the Minister at the time.  We are dealing here with the consideration of whether or not it is possible to have an election for the Dublin Corporation held in June, 1928, bearing in mind the general position with regard to the city and the in terests of the ratepayers.  To get back into all the reasons, imaginary and otherwise, that are germinating in the mind of Deputy Lemass, would not <Col N="1782" /> to be excused by the Dáil, and I am sure the Dáil will excuse me, if I leave Deputy Lemass to the particular kind of nightmare he has with regard to this reason&mdash;leave him to sleep on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a good judge.  We are discussing whether or not an election for the Dublin Corporation can be held reasonably in June next year.  As I say, all the discussion that took place at the inquiry dealing with the Dublin Corporation in 1924 might have been relevant when the Local Government Act of 1926 was being passed.  It gave authority for the continued retention of the Commissioners in Cork, Dublin, and the Dublin Union until the 31st March, 1929.  That may have been relevant then, but it is not relevant now. <Col N="1783" /> The different things that are wrong with Dublin from the point of view of Deputy Briscoe have little relation to what we are discussing now.  They have, perhaps, some, in that it can very easily be argued that if the matters that are under consideration in connection with the Greater Dublin Commission's report are thoroughly and systematically gone into, and proper and mature judgment is brought to bear, that when you deal with Dublin, on decisions taken after the Greater Dublin Commission's report has been examined and decided on, you will, certainly, much more easily and effectively deal with problems required to be dealt with, whether it is the giving of more pay to city workers or the greater alleviation of people who want home assistance, or the better provision of housing.  So that the point I rely on to persuade members of the Dáil that the best interests of Dublin can be served only by postponing, until a date not later than the 31st March, 1929, the election, is the consideration of the facts brought out in the Greater Dublin Commission's report.  I have already drawn attention to the fact stated here on page 3: &ldquo;In the area to be comprised within Greater Dublin, and to enjoy unitary control and administration, there now function some nineteen thinking and spending authorities.&rdquo; Within these nineteen bodies are the Dublin Corporation, the Rural District Council, important townships like Rathmines and Pembroke, and large sections of the county townships, such as Howth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the interests of all concerned, of the workmen, the people who want houses, the poor and the rest of the citizens of every class, we must insist and very strongly urge on the members of the Dáil that the matters that require to be considered and require a clear and workable decision, and that are dealt with in the Greater Dublin Commission's report, are matters of such importance that they cannot hope to be dealt with in time to allow an election to take place for any kind of a governing body in Dublin City in June next. If you are going to shut your eyes to <Col N="1784" /> objectionable facts in the way Deputy O'Kelly has shut his eyes to them, and if you do decide that you are going to have an election for Dublin in 1928, you are going to spend approximately £10,000 on elections in the city to elect bodies who may, after the Greater Dublin Commission's report has been examined and decided upon, be, to a large extent, replaced or changed in 1929, involving fresh elections in 1929 practically over the whole County and City of Dublin.  So that in the interests of all those things that are wrong, it is suggested to you that you scrappily examine an important question, that you throw away £10,000 in unnecessary elections, and that generally you shut your eyes to facts because of the long-drawn-out indignation of certain Deputies about the way in which the Dublin Corporation was dissolved in 1924.  We are considering here the problems that confront us to-day and will confront us to-morrow, and we ought to bring our minds honestly to bear on these and the facts that made them up.  The amendment of Deputy Seán T. O Ceallaigh is unacceptable, and would throw a very heavy expense on the ratepayers in both the city and county of Dublin, and would prevent them having examined, in the thorough way it ought to be examined, the whole management of their city here.</P>

      <P>Before you put the question, I would like to ask the Minister for Local Government if he could give to the House any explanation as to why the Commissioners granted a renewal of the Tramway Company's lease, and particularly as to why the President of the Executive Council intervened to influence certain townships which were refusing to grant that lease, to grant similar powers and similar extensions to those which the Dublin Commissioners have already granted.  I want the Minister to state why the President of the Executive Council intervened to secure an extension of that lease.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: That the Bill be received for final consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>On the motion before the House I wish to raise a matter which I had hoped to mention on the last amendment.  That is the matter to which Deputy Lemass has already referred, namely, the circumstances under which the Dublin Corporation granted a renewal of the Tramways Company's lease.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to establish the relevancy in this way: in order to show how detrimental it is to the interests of the citizens of Dublin generally that the Dublin Corporation should still remain suspended.  I wish to draw attention to one incident which occurred under the administration of the present Commissioners.  This incident goes to show that either the Department of Local Government or the Executive Council interfered in the civic concerns of Dublin city.  I think if I can establish to this House that Dublin municipality is not administered by the Commissioners on behalf of the citizens but by the Commissioners on behalf of the Government, I will be in a position to show that there is no reason whatsoever why the elections should be postponed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, the Second Reading of which has been passed, embodies a principle in connection with the holding of elections and changes the date of elections from January to June or July.  The Dáil, by the Vote which has just been taken, affirmed the exclusion of certain local authorities from the scope of this Bill. They are not included in the Bill and are not part of it now.  This Bill refers only to local authorities in respect of which elections would be held in January but are now to be held in June or July.  I submit that the point the Deputy is raising is irrelevant on this Bill.  While anxious to accommodate him at any other time, I submit that he is not in order in raising this matter now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the point this: that we on this side of the House oppose the omission of the public bodies that the President has cited from the operation of this Bill.  We wish them to be included.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN LEAS-CHEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I was anxious to allow Deputy MacEntee to establish the relevancy of his remarks.  If the Deputy had spoken when we were considering amendment No. 1, I would have allowed him to proceed and make the point.  The position, however, is that a vote has been taken <Col N="1789" /> on amendment No. 1 and a decision arrived at.  In view of that, I do not see how the Deputy can be allowed to re-open a decision already taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Report Stage am I not in order in discussing the whole principle of a Bill, not only the positive but the negative effects of it in so far as it stipulates that certain public bodies and authorities will remain outside its scope?  There are two principles involved in this Bill.  One stipulates that elections will be held in certain areas, and the other that elections will not be held in certain areas. I am confining myself to the second principle in the Bill, which is that elections will not be held so far as public bodies in Dublin are concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, it seems to me, desires to make the Bill a little more extensive than it is.  It is extensive to this extent: that elections will take place in the case of 95% of local authorities.  We have decided the principle of that.  Not only that, but the amendment to include the other 5% has been definitely rejected.  I put it to the Deputy, as a matter of common sense, that having brought the Bill on its present 95% basis to the present stage, the only question really at issue now is whether or not the Bill ought to pass.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Deputy to remember this: the main purpose of this Bill was economy.  A case has been made as well, and answered as well, as it could be in respect of those local authorities which are precluded for nine months from having their elections.  In those circumstances, is it wise to divide on this motion, having regard to the economy and to the change of time&mdash;the change <Col N="1791" /> of the date of election from January to June, and the limitation and lessening of the expense in connection with those elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no other way of indicating that we are still dissatisfied with the exclusion of Dublin and Cork from the scope of this Bill. We have indicated our willingness to accept, in the balance, the holding of the elections on the same day.  To that extent we are satisfied.  But we are not satisfied with regard to the exclusion of Dublin and Cork.  The only way we can indicate that we are not satisfied in that respect&mdash;notwithstanding that we have accepted the other portions of the Bill&mdash;is by voting against the motion.</P>

(or increasing my salary or emoluments as ......... as the case may require), I, the said A.B., do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare that I will bear allegiance to the Irish Free State and its constitution as by law established and that, in the event of such appointment being (or whether such increase is or is not as the case may require) confirmed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, I will, to the best of my judgment and ability, duly and faithfully perform the duties of the (or my as the case may require) said office and will observe and obey such orders and directions in relation to such duties as shall lawfully be given to me.</P>
    <P>(3).  Nothing in this section shall prejudice or affect the operation of any enactment requiring the sanction or confirmation of any such resolution as aforesaid by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.</P>
    <P>That section appears in a Local Government Act, and if you look through the Act you will find that it has to deal with public health, roads, bridges, rating of buildings, and so on.  It is very strange to find in the centre of this Local Government Act the section I have read.  It seems as altogether apart from the Act.  It clearly was not a part of the original conception of the Act, and it is particularly strange coming from a Party that made a part of its platform the abolition of political questions in local bodies.  It is a political test.  It is a penalsing, political section intended to penalise political opponents of the Party that passed it.  Its history is that it was introduced, not in the Dáil, but in the Seanad, and that it was sponsored by the Minister for Local Government of the time.  I have read the debates concerning that Bill, read the case that was made for and against it, and I must say that I have very little to add to the case made against it here when it was being debated.  My hope is that it will not be necessary for me to go into detail about it, because perhaps there may <Col N="1796" /> be a change of mind on the Benches opposite, and we may have a reconsideration of the whole question.  If I thought that were so, we could end the discussion here and now&mdash;if it could be agreed that this section should be taken out of the Act.  If not, I will have simply to deal with it largely on the lines on which it was dealt with here by those who opposed it before.</P>
    <P>My first point is that it is altogether out of place in this Act.  It deals with the conditions of employment of local officers.  It is going over the heads of local bodies and imposing a test on these employees.  I think that a local body ought to be given the liberty of selecting the officers that will serve it best, irrespective of any political opinions they may hold.  It will, of course, I know be argued from the opposite side that there is no hardship on any employee making this declaration of allegiance to the Free State and Constitution.  That, of course, accords with the policy and with the principles of the Party which has been the majority Party up to the present.  But I submit there is another side to the question.  I think it will be generally admitted that this Free State has not been established by the free will of our people.  I think there are Deputies on the other side who will be prepared to acknowledge that so far as this State has a de facto existence it is because of external pressure, and that without that pressure this is not the State that would be in this country.  These two States are not the governmental machinery that would have been set up by the free will of the Irish people.  Padraig Pearse at one time said that Ireland unfree will never be at rest.  That is a statement of fact.</P>
    <P>I think it will be admitted by most people that it is a fact that those who took the Treaty policy and who have accepted the Treaty policy have taken with it that disadvantage which is going to be a continuing thing for them and it is in vain for them to hope that it will be otherwise; that is, they have accepted something that in its nature is bound to be unstable.  It does not satisfy the aspirations of our people and it can only be used as something on the road to a greater freedom.  Now, as <Col N="1797" /> long as that continues you are bound to have a section of people, as in the past&mdash;and a section particularly of the younger people who will be close in touch with the national tradition&mdash;who will say that they have the right to strive for that greater freedom which is denied them at present and all that can be expected of them&mdash;all that anybody who adopts the policy of the Treaty can expect from them&mdash;is that there should be some rule by which national policy for the time being would be determined and that those who do not agree with that policy could, in accordance with that rule, strive for the greater freedom.</P>
    <P>Now, the conditions under which this test has been imposed were conditions which indicated that there was no natural loyalty from a large section of the people coming to this State.  Had there been such natural loyalty there would be no need of a test clause of this kind.  The introduction of it was a confession that there was something wrong and that that something wrong was not mere perversity; it was something which was natural, which was here in this country as long as the history of our struggle against British interference is known, as long as that history has lasted.  Accordingly we must take it into account.  Now, the imposition of it may seem nothing to the majority party that imposed it, but it means a great deal to those who feel that giving allegiance in the way demanded here would mean a forswearing of their own opinions and their political principles and I think nobody has a right to impose that as a test of employment.  All that can be expected is that those who would be employed by the local authorities would give faithful service to the local authority, would perform their duties faithfully and would carry out the orders given to them.  I think you have no right to go any further than that; you have no right to put in penal clauses which are purely test clauses.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the fairmindedness of everybody here to accept that view and take out this section which is a disfiguring section of the Act.  I know the circumstances under which it was introduced.  I am making full allowance for that.  As a coercive measure it was deliberately introduced by the <Col N="1798" /> Party on the opposite Benches, but I say that if there is going to be any progress here at all we must as quickly as possible get rid of every, as Deputy Johnson called it, irritating test such as we have in this Act.  My attitude will be one rather of appeal to the fairmindedness of everybody.  We have passed through very difficult times during the last four or five years, and it will be for the good of the country generally to get rid of evidences of that past from our institutions and from our Acts, if we can, and the sooner we do it the better.</P>
    <P>We are going to look for a National Loan very soon.  Have you not a far more secure basis of stability in the acceptance of some such rule as I have indicated, some such rule by which, whilst nobody is going to forswear his individual opinion or aspiration, for the time being some national policy can be accepted as being the suitable policy for the moment?  I believe if you approach it in that way we will make much more progress than we possibly can make by insisting on the retention of clauses of this kind.  The Executive have shown a certain amount of good sense in reconsidering the question of the teachers.  They have also shown good sense in a reply which I got the other day to a question respecting certain dismissed R.I.C. men. In accordance with the reply given by the Minister for Finance, a change of attitude has been shown.  These dismissed and resigned R.I.C. men were denied pensions because of their political affiliations.  I regard that as evidence of returning sanity, as I look upon it, and I would welcome further evidence of that if the Executive will say: &ldquo;Very well; we are prepared to wipe out that clause now without any question of discussing whether at any time it was right or defensible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Even while I wish to approach it in that way, I can state my point of view that I regard it as mean and contemptible, this idea of trying to force a man to forswear his views and adopt an outward conformity by threatening his wife and children with starvation, by telling him that the emigrant ship is the place for him.  I call that the meanest type of coercion.  It does not get you anywhere.  You will never <Col N="1799" /> compel or purchase loyalty that way, aid the loyalty of people whose loyalty you can buy in that particular way, is not worth anything.  You will not gain your ends by that means. Reason and appeal to the difficulties of the situation are going to get you much further in that way than coercion.</P>
    <P>I have indicated fairly clearly my mind.  I regard it as very bad from the point of view of the spirit of our people and from the point of view of the moral character of our people to be forcing declarations of this kind.  It is bound to injure a man when he has, so to speak, to debase himself, when he has to give a formal denial of the principles he holds at heart.  It is not a good lesson for our people.  The general national interest and the character of our people as a whole are bound to be affected by measures of this kind, and I appeal to all Deputies to combine in this case, and not make a Party question of it, if possible.  Let it be by agreement, and let this thing be taken out.  Let it be dealt with just as we had a reconsideration of the position of teachers and of the position of the dismissed and resigned R.I.C.</P>
    <P>I cannot help regarding this matter, irrespective of how clearly I see the point of view of those who try to impose it, otherwise than I have stated. I understand clearly what their motives were, and what the impulse in their minds was.  I must regard this as mean, and any people who descended to do it were giving way to the meanest instincts in them.  It is not worthy of any government in any country to do a thing of that kind.  It simply means that you are going to divide your people into two classes&mdash; those who are outlaws and those who are otherwise, and you will find, as the elections proved, that this is not a case of dealing with a handful, but with, no matter what the circumstances were, at least one-third of our people who have shown in the most difficult circumstances that they were opposed to this policy, and that they do not like it.  You are continuing the old bad British traditions of trying to get loyalty by coercion.  I do not think it will succeed.  It is most unwise, and I ask the House without further talk to <Col N="1800" /> give this Bill a Second Reading, and delete that section from the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government opposes this measure.  Deputy de Valera states that he knows the spirit in which the measure was introduced and this section was put in the Bill, and that in giving way to its insertion in the Bill we gave way to the meanest instincts that were in us.  Deputy de Valera is right in saying this section was not in the Bill as originally framed. He is right in saying that it was put into the Bill in the Seanad and that it was accepted here by the majority of the Dáil.  And when we speak of the circumstances in which it was agreed to put this section into the Act we have to realise that the real reason why the section is in the Act is that there was a time when the State which was established here was challenged and when the institutions of the State that were set <Col N="1801" /> up here were attacked with a view to undermining the State and bringing down the State.  We have to realise that in these circumstances in different parts of the country many employees of public bodies, both openly and covertly, took part in the denial of the State that existed here and took part in the attack on its institutions and in these particular circumstances it was necessary to do two things.  It is interesting to see that it was public opinion outside rather than deliberate action on the part of the Executive Council which made it clear that it was necessary to do these two things.</P>
      <P>It was necessary in the first place to prevent from being used in the attack on the State and on its institutions the influence and prestige that attach to persons holding different public positions throughout the country.  Secondly, it was necessary to preserve in the minds of our people complete confidence in the institutions of local government, and complete confidence in the institutions that were set up to serve the needs of the people; and to see that the finances that were collected were spent by officials who were entirely devoted to the interests of the people in the work which they were carrying out.  Local officials then in certain circumstances were required to make the declaration that Deputy de Valera read from the Act.  It is necessary in the circumstances in which Deputy de Valera in his speech urged the taking away of this section to read this particular passage with its implication:&mdash;&ldquo;There should be some rule by which national policy would be determined and those who do not agree with that policy could ...strive for the greater freedom.&rdquo; Associating that statement with the statement made by Deputy de Valera the other day, that he recognised this assembly simply because of the individuals that it contained, we must still take it that we are in a position in which the State that is set up here is denied as a State, and the benefits that accrue to our people in having achieved Statehood even to the extent of the twenty-six counties here, the benefits that accrue to our people, nationally and internationally of having achieved Statehood&mdash;that that is going to be denied to our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1802" /> We are asked to withdraw this section at a time when Deputy de Valera, representing and leading a large Party in here, denies this Dáil practically as an institution of State and, wants to have it regarded throughout the country as a group of people of a particular political persuasion, varying to a certain degree, coming together to agree what is to be our national policy; not coming together as a Sovereign Assembly of the State, wielding all the force and shouldering all the prestige of the Sovereign Assembly and governing body of the State.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances we cannot agree to this measure.  In these circumstances it cannot be done without inviting public officials to repudiate the State here; without putting our people in the position that men are carrying out public duties and handling public funds throughout the country who deny the State that exists here and who, in the words of Deputy de Valera, are to strive for the greater freedom.</P>
    <P>We have seen what striving for the greater freedom has meant up to the present.  We hope that the phrase to-day may mean something different from what it meant before, but we are not clear, and it is simply inviting public officials to repudiate the State if we pass this measure.  It is giving over to the people who are to use other means in striving for greater freedom, the power, prestige and resources that the holding of public employment in the country will give them.  We must certainly do everything we can to prevent that prestige that comes from occupying the position of public servants, that power that comes from wielding the influence and wielding the machinery that goes with public service, being used for the denial of or for the overthrow of the State.  It is for that reason that this Bill is opposed by us.  Nearly everything that Deputy de Valera said with regard to what he thinks of the position here&mdash;that the circumstances in this country are bound to be unstable, that looking at the matter in the particular light of requiring public servants to declare their allegiance to the Constitution and Statehood is mean, despicable and irritating, and should not be continued&mdash;everything <Col N="1803" /> that Deputy de Valera has said points to the necessity of retaining this section in the Act.</P>
    <P>One other point of his is that this section is out of place in the particular Act.  I will deal with that.  Now, a very large portion of the moneys that are disbursed and used in the public administration through the local bodies are State moneys.  The Local Taxation finance account for the year ending 31st March, 1927, shows that £1,070,000 odd had been paid out to local bodies under the Local Taxation Account; a sum of £599,011 was paid out as an additional supplementary agricultural grant, and the normal income of the Road Fund for the year amounted to £612,000.  Normally, all this money is spent through the local bodies, and in addition to that you have State grants under tuberculosis schemes and national health schemes of one kind or another, and all this is paid out of State funds through the machinery of Local Government, for the purpose of carrying out work in connection with these grants.  So it is not out of place that such a declaration should be embodied in a Local Government Act dealing with general Local Government work, and it is essential, in view of the atmosphere in which we find ourselves, that we should make it clear to the public official himself and to the public who pay him for serving them, that the work of local administration is to be carried out in a detached spirit of simple service to the people who are paying for the service that is given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as this Party is concerned, we propose to support the Bill, not because this test is out of place in the Local Government Act, but because, in our opinion, this test, or any test like it, would be out of place in any Act that should be passed by this House.  So far as we are concerned, we are supporting this Bill or opposing this test, if you like, for the very same reasons that we opposed it when it was originally introduced in this House.  I certainly would not dream of opposing it on the grounds given by Deputy de Valera because, so far as I am concerned, I do not agree <Col N="1804" /> with most of what Deputy de Valera stated in moving the Second Reading of this Bill.  The Deputy stated that the Treaty&mdash;and I do not know why the Treaty should be dragged into it at this particular stage&mdash;was not established on the free will of the Irish people.  That may or may not be so. But it is a fact that the majority of the Irish people have set up this Assembly and that this Assembly has the authority of the majority of the Irish people.  I am going to go further and say that in my opinion, when the Irish Treaty was signed, the Irish people at that time got more freedom than they expected to get and that they were very glad to get it.  I may be quite wrong.  I am giving my opinion, and I think I am entitled to give it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy de Valera went on to say that the people of Ireland had a right to strive for greater freedom.  I quite agree with the Deputy, and so far as the Labour Party are concerned we never accepted the Treaty as the end-all of Irish freedom.  We accepted it as something to move forward from.  But I want to say this: That a minority&mdash; and, unfortunately if you like, at the moment, those who are striving for greater freedom are in a minority&mdash;has a perfect right to try to convince the majority of the Irish people that they should move for greater freedom.  But there are limits to the methods that should be adopted by the minority in order to convince the majority. I think it is quite right that every legitimate means that can be used without injuring the majority of the Irish people should be used to secure greater freedom than they have at the moment.  I do not see that there is anything very much to be gained by trying to belittle the prestige of this House.  If this House has the right to impose or put that test into an Act it has the right to take it out of the Act, and I hope the House will take it out of it, because you are not going to secure loyalty for this or any other State by such tests, and if you force men into the position, as Deputy de Valera said, that they have either got to subscribe to this particular test or to face the fact that those depending <Col N="1805" /> upon them will be hungry, then men will be forced in these circumstances to take the test, but the taking of the test will not necessarily mean that they have any greater regard for or will be in any way more loyal to the State than before they took it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government said there were people who took part in the attacks on the institutions of the State, and for that reason it was necessary to impose this test.  Assuming that it was necessary to do that, does the Minister claim that it is necessary to-day? Does the Minister think, for one moment, that by the imposition of this test he is going to secure the loyalty of any citizen of this State towards the institutions of the State?  I do not believe for a moment he will.  So far as I am concerned, I think we ought to try and face realities.  I agree with Deputy de Valera that we ought to get rid of all evidence of our unfortunate past, and for that reason I am going to vote, and this Party will vote, for Deputy de Valera's Bill.  I hope when we appeal to the Government to get rid of all the evidence of the unfortunate past that the Party which Deputy de Valera leads in this House will do their best to get rid of all the evidence of the unfortunate past so far as they are concerned.  This is not the time to be talking about dividing our people into two classes; this is not the time to try to fix the blame as to who is responsible for the division of our people. We have got to face the unfortunate fact that our people were divided, and that they suffered as a consequence.  I think we ought to try and aim at uniting our people, and I am prepared, and this Party is prepared, to go as far as we can with Deputy de Valera or with any other Party in this House to try and unite the people of Ireland, and to go as far as we can to achieve that greater freedom that Deputy de Valera speaks of.  But there is no use in getting back to what happened three or four years ago.  I think we ought to try and forget that and make a fresh start.  Both the Fianna Fáil Party and the Cumann na nGaedheal Party have many things which they should be anxious to forget.  All the blame was not on one side and all the honour on the other.  There were things done&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to add a few words to what the Minister for Local Government has said, and in reference to a few of the points that were raised by the leader of the Opposition. He accused us of going over the heads of the local bodies, and then suggested that this Oireachtas, in its laws, was entitled to demand, so far as local bodies are concerned, that local bodies should get faithful service to themselves.  The Government of this country, as I had occasion to remark before, is really carried out by two sets of institutions.  It is absurd to separate them, as the effort is being continually made here to separate them, as if on the one side you had local bodies functioning independently of the <Col N="1807" /> country in which they live, and on the other you had what apparently is to the members of the opposite side a monstrosity.  Let me point out that these bodies function, in so far as they do function within our Constitution and by the laws passed by this Parliament within the Constitution.  They have no other locus standi whatsoever. They are set up, they exist, and carry on their business by the laws passed by this Oireachtas, and only by these laws, and all we ask in the existing law, so far as local bodies are concerned, is not that men should sacrifice their political opinions, not that men should not wish for another political state of affairs in this country than exists at present, but that they shall not take illegal means to bring about that other state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Radical changes in the Constitution can be carried through, but all we want is that those who serve the State, either in the local bodies or in the Central Government, shall not use violence or illegal intrigues to upset the State. That is the limit of what is demanded in this particular section of the Act that an effort is now made to repeal. I am glad, at all events, though Deputy Morrissey is not voting for us, that he repudiated the arguments by which the leader of the Opposition demands a Second Reading for this Bill, but remember it is the arguments behind Deputy de Valera's contention which are the real things we have to deal with. I wonder whether people have sufficiently examined what is implied in the stand taken up by the leader of the Opposition.  I put it quite clearly to all the Deputies of this House: why should disloyalty to this State be something virtuous and heroic?  Why should it be continually boomed up, indirectly in this House and elsewhere, as if it were something not to be ashamed but to be proud of.  It is altogether unnatural, and the present Bill is really only, if I might say so, pandering to that very unnatural tendency to be disloyal to our own State. That was behind a great deal of the principal arguments used by Deputy de Valera.  Loyalty to the State, to the Irish nation as it exists in this organisation of the Oireachtas, is the only <Col N="1808" /> thing that is demanded from the servants of the local bodies&mdash;&ldquo;allegiance to the Irish Free State and its Constitution as by law established,&rdquo; not loyalty to a party.  There is no suggestion of that kind, and what I dislike about the Bill is that the Bill and the speech made in favour of it imply that loyalty to the State means loyalty to a party. The Labour Party continuously stressed this in a couple of debates in the House recently, that it should be made quite clear that loyalty to the State does not mean loyalty to any particular party, and the whole strength behind this Bill lies in confusing loyalty to the State with loyalty to a party.  The Government, so far as they have been able, have always striven against that conception.  The Army, the Guards or the Civil Servants or other people in the public service owe loyalty to the State and in no sense loyalty to a party.</P>
    <P>It is absurd to think that loyalty to the State is a political issue between two parties.  That is what was fundamentally unsound and rotten, so to speak, with the point of view at the back of this Bill.  Apparently the conception is that this State is identical with our party.  That is not so and it was never our wish that it should be so. We have striven as much as we could, to disabuse the public mind of anything of the kind.  The case for this Bill, unless that is done, loses a great deal, I might say almost all, of its plausibility.  There has been, even in the debates in this House, a lot of mischievous talk about the alleged party affiliations of public servants.  Because this Bill is in keeping with this particularly objectionable talk, is one of the reasons why I think it should be opposed and I think it should be opposed especially by the party that wanted a clear declaration that loyalty to the State was not loyalty to a party. The personnel of the Executive, so far as this State is concerned, is accidental. It depends on the majority will of the Irish people.  If, in the morning, they wish for a different Executive there are recognised methods by which that can be brought about, but whatever the Executive is, whether it is an Executive of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party or any other that is entrusted with the <Col N="1809" /> Government of this country it is unhealthy and morbid that a State, no matter what Executive it is under, should not be able to count on the loyalty of all its citizens and that effort should be made to elevate disloyalty to the State&mdash;the only State that exists, the State that has been established and built up by representatives of the majority of the people of this country &mdash;to the rank of something praiseworthy. I refuse to make the distinction that was made the other day in order to try and get out of the consequences involved in this Bill, the too subtle distinction&mdash;dangerous distinction from the point of view of the community and of the nation&mdash;between loyalty to the nation and loyalty to the State, that is the organised nation.  I may say that for us in this Party majority rule is no question of Parliamentary procedure.  It is something more fundamental than that.  There is no other State except the State that has been built up, with a great deal of trouble and a great deal of loss in many respects, by this Oireachtas.  It is reasonable, as I say, to expect from every public servant the allegiance that the State is entitled to expect from all its citizens.  Deputies who listened to or read the speeches that were delivered, say, on one clause in the Dentists Bill, on the repeal of the Public Safety Act, and on the Army Bill and who have examined the implications that are contained in many of the speeches and in many of the sentiments expressed in connection with these Acts and Bills, will understand what is involved in this particular question.  The same remarks would apply to the end of the speech of Deputy de Valera in regard to coercion.</P>
    <P>Deputies on the opposite benches apparently do not see, as far as I can judge their mentality by what they say, any distinction between laws imposed by the will of the Irish people and laws imposed by the will of the foreigner. A great deal of the force of their arguments depends on equating these two things.  If an effort is made to see that the will of the majority prevails&mdash;after all, that is what the law comes to, the will of the people as expressed here through the elected representatives of the people&mdash;an attempt is made to identify the effort to secure obedience <Col N="1810" /> to that law with the effort to secure obedience to a law that was altogether foreign and never was regarded as otherwise than foreign by the people of this country.  Disloyalty, therefore, to the Irish State and to the Irish Government has been, again and again, in this House, in this Bill and what lies behind it, made equal to disloyalty to or to an effort to overthrow a foreign Government. The law that ran in this country for a long time could not pretend to be an expression of the will of the people. That is not the case at present.  I do not mind whether Deputies on the opposite side disagree with me on that or not, but in this House, in this Oireachtas, and in this State that is a view that is fundamental for the Oireachtas and for the State.</P>
    <P>The whole tendency of the argument behind this Bill is to destroy the civic spirit.  In a country in which, owing to its past history, every effort should be made to build up a civic spirit and to create a feeling of solidarity, every effort is being made in the opposite direction by some individuals.  Now take some of the speeches that we heard about this Bill, and even about the Constitution itself.  I hope I am not misrepresenting Deputy de Valera&mdash;I do not always claim that I can understand the finer shades of his thought&mdash;when I quote him as saying that there were some portions of the Constitution he accepted and some that he rejected. Now what does that come to?</P>

      <P>It was being discussed, until the Minister's point just now, without discussing the foundations.  If we are going to get into a discussion of the Consitution and all its parts we are going into a much wider discussion, it seems to me, than the Bill before us warrants.  I do not think that that discussion has been yet started.  I do not agree that the past, in the sense of the incidents of the past, has been at all introduced into the debate to-night.  The reference to the Constitution was not made to-night. The Constitution is an Act of the Dáil, and that Constitution can only be criticised during proceedings for its amendment or repeal, the same as any other Act.  To-night there has not been any argument about the Constitution itself, and I would prefer that there should be no such argument.  If I am to accept the view that we are to go into &ldquo;fundamentals&rdquo; I should say that &ldquo;fundamentals&rdquo; is a very easy word for Deputies to use, but a very difficult word for the Chair to construe subsequently.</P>

      <P>I fully accept your ruling and shall avoid what I was going to say merely by way of illustration.  I really did not intend to quote or to refer to that speech of Deputy de Valera a few nights ago for any other purpose than the purpose of illustration, and I shall avoid seeming to run counter to your ruling, sir.  I shall not even refer to it by way of illustration.  What I want to point out is the attitude behind this Bill.  I think I have kept rigidly to the Bill and to what lies at the back of it.  I have gone into no historical reference so far as I know.  I had no intention of doing so, and as you, sir, have pointed out, I have not done so.  What I wanted to point out was that the whole attitude behind this Bill is that there are certain things that we can use&mdash;the law when <Col N="1812" /> it is on our side and the institutions of the law when they are on our side&mdash;and that we can reject when they are against us.  That, I hold, is a thing that is fundamentally unsound.  This Bill is not aimed at the political views of our opponents.  There is nothing to prevent a person thinking that this Constitution ought to be altered; there is nothing to prevent a public servant who takes this declaration, if he does so legally and constitutionally, working for what Deputy de Valera calls the larger freedom.  There is nothing in the Act as it stands and there is nothing in the declaration that is demanded from public servants to prevent their doing that.  There is nothing to prevent them trying to induce, in the ordinary, normal, constitutional way, the people to amend the Constitution&mdash; to amend it even vitally, to elect even a majority of representatives against the Treaty who would go in for repudiation of it.  There is nothing in that declaration that would prevent anybody from holding those views or working in a legitimate and ordinary constitutional way in furtherance of those views.  What I do object to is that the effort to remove this declaration presents a type of mind which regards loyalty to the State as the same thing as loyalty to a particular party.  That is one of the principal reasons that I oppose this Bill.  I believe that that attitude is fundamentally unsound and that this Bill is simply helping to keep alive that particular attitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to deal at length with the implications, tendencies and sinister motives that are behind this Bill, according to the Minister for Education.  One would imagine that what the Minister for Education defines as &ldquo;loyalty&rdquo; should become loyalty for every member of the House. There are some Deputies, on this side of the House at any rate&mdash;I hope on the other side also&mdash;who have loyalty to certain ideals, and I hope they will remain true to those ideals.  Loyalty to the State, the Minister says, is not loyalty to a Party, but at the time that this Act, which it is now proposed to amend, was passed into law, the Party on the opposite benches, as well as being in control of the Government of <Col N="1813" /> the Saorstát, were in control of the public bodies throughout the country. They were in a position to take action against the employees of these public bodies if they found that they were unsatisfactory in the discharge of their duties or that they were engaged in treasonable offences.  We have quite a long list of Acts on the Statute Book that deal with treasonable offences. Under this section of the Local Government Act, it was proposed that people should be dismissed from their positions without any charge or trial.  When we hear so much talk about constitutions and loyalty and the necessity for maintaining the State and for procuring the adherence of the citizens, we ought, at least, to give this minority, which seems to be the bane of the Minister's life, an opportunity of having their cases argued fairly and squarely in open court.  If they are found guilty, the Executive is in a position to deal with them.  As far as I know&mdash;and I have knowledge of a good many cases which happened under this section&mdash;these people were given no opportunity whatever to have their cases heard.  They were simply, in the words of the people who proposed this declaration originally in the Seanad, to be considered as men who &ldquo;paraded themselves as people looking for a Republic.&rdquo;&ldquo;If,&rdquo; in the words of Senator Gogarty, &ldquo;a man parades as a Republican, from any form of confused mentality, and if, while in that interesting condition, he injures the hand which feeds him, then he ought to be deprived of his livelihood.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not want to prevent the Deputy making his case, but it is a recognised rule that Deputies do not quote debates in the Seanad.  They can quote debates which take place here.  It is bad enough to be discussing one another without discussing individual Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. DERRIG Mr. DERRIG">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>Furthermore, when this Act was being introduced, the Minister for Local Government, of that time, said that one of the effects of it would be that if it were not possible to secure this declaration of loyalty from the employees of public bodies it would have the useful effect of preventing increases <Col N="1814" /> in salary; so that if one were to forego an increase in salary, one would presumably be entitled to continue in his position.  There are a great many people in the country who have not taken this declaration and who, by reason of the fact that they have foregone those increases of salary, are still holding their positions, although they are people who have the &ldquo;unnatural&rdquo; and &ldquo;sinister&rdquo; tendencies that the Minister for Education trembles so much about.  In a great many cases&mdash; I think I might say in all cases&mdash;the people who were dismissed from public employment were not dismissed by the action of the local authority which employed them.  The local authority, in most cases, endeavoured to secure that the persons employed would be maintained in their positions.  In most of these cases representations were made to the Department but, in spite of the efforts of the local committees, orders came down for the dismissal of the officials concerned.  In the case of the County Dublin Committee, when the teachers were dismissed by order of the Executive for refusal to comply with this test, we had the extraordinary position that while they could not be employed in one branch of the Department of the Minister for Education, in another branch they were actually able to maintain their position and to draw their salaries.  In one branch of the Department of Education they were to be regarded as treason-mongers and preachers of sedition, while in another branch, under the National School Regulations, they were maintained and kept on as teachers.  The teacher in charge of the Gaelic League classes in Rathfarnham and Dundrum, who was dismissed for refusing to subscribe to the test, was still kept on as teacher of night classes under the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Education has given this House an undertaking that the cases of the national teachers who were dismissed, or who were refused re-instatement, on grounds similar to those which obtain in the cases of the officials I refer to, would be reconsidered by him.  Are we to take it that one section of teachers are to have their cases reconsidered and that another section are still to be regarded as outlaws?  In the <Col N="1815" /> North of Ireland, when the teachers were being organised to refuse to take a similar declaration to the Northern Government, I have information to show that these teachers in the North were instructed and encouraged in that attitude by the Ministry for Education here in Dublin.  This Ministry, which encouraged teachers in the North to refuse to take the test, was actually enforcing it here in the South.  There have been a great many cases of hardship caused by this test.  To those of us who are interested in the language question and in the development of the Irish Ireland movement, it has seemed a great hardship that men who were associated with the movement since 1915 and even before it&mdash;men who taught Pádraic Pearse Irish and who were associated with every movement in connection with the advancement of national aspirations in recent times&mdash; should be driven out of the country. Their loss was very great.  Some of them were Irish scholars who would have been very valuable.  Not alone would they have been valuable in their classes, but I am aware of cases in which it would be difficult to excel them in the field of scholarship and literary work.  As a matter of fact, one of the teachers who was dismissed under the County Dublin Technical Committee has found a post since as a university lecturer.  The Irish teachers, who were the teachers largely concerned in this matter, have been treated rather unfairly I think by the Department all along.  They have been in a special position.  Some of them have not had qualifications, and when it seemed that they were going to settle down and to get a chance to promote themselves and become teachers on a more substantial basis, this test was thrown amongst them and the whole organisation of teaching Irish in the country became confused.  The bitterest opponents of the language movement in the West were given the opportunity not alone to attack the teachers, but to attack the language movement generally.  The Minister for Education knows that the introduction of this test was taken advantage of by opponents of the language <Col N="1816" /> movement to put an end to the teaching of Irish altogether under the local Technical Committees.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government, when this Act, which it is now proposed to amend, was being introduced, said that complaints had been made to him with regard to the county and assistant surveyors who had been breaking up bridges and doing other work of that kind, that when they were taken back into their employment the ratepayers made complaints to him that they were not willing that these men should continue to be paid out of public funds.  I challenge the Minister now to show us any case where any public body took up that attitude in the open. I know very well what happened.  When the Cumann na nGaedheal Party thought they were in the saddle, and that they would continue to remain there for all time, they had not even then, although they were in control of practically every public body in the country, the courage or decency to take up this question in the open and give the men concerned a fair trial.  They came up here and made complaints according to the Minister for Local Government.  He took very good care not to give any details of the complaints made.  If there were complaints that these men had neglected their work, I submit that the matter should have been discussed by the local bodies responsible for employing them.  As those local bodies consisted, in a majority of cases, of their political opponents, there was no question but that the interests of the State would receive a fair hearing.  But they were not given the opportunity, and on the pretext that complaints were being made in Dublin, which the Ministry did not think it wise to have discussed at the local bodies, these groundless complaints, of which no instances were given at the time, were made the basis for this attack on Republicans and for driving them out of employment.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Local Government said that public opinion outside is still in favour of the retention of this section.  If that is so, why are not the public bodies now given the opportunity to reinstate these men? They were not given an opportunity then for the very good reason that the <Col N="1817" /> Executive Council knew that they could not get rid of those officials in that way.  If it were left to the free choice of the local councils, they knew that they had as good Irishmen and as good officials as any they could get in their stead.  The Minister suggests to us now that just in the same way as the attack on the State at that time&mdash;which was over for two years before this thing came to pass&mdash;could be used as a justification for the introduction of this measure, he could stand up now and say that Deputy de Valera's attitude and the attitude of his Party is sufficient justification for its maintenance. I submit to the Minister that if he went down the country and stated that the changed conditions, and the fact that this Party is now represented in this House were a justification and an argument for still maintaining this section, he would find very few people to listen to him.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy de Valera that we ought to do what we can to reunite our countrymen.  The Ministry, in my opinion, has been very lacking and very backward in doing its share to bring that about.  If they take that step, if of their own free will they wipe out this section, and thereby put the men who have been dismissed, or who have refused to take the declaration, on at least the same basis as the national teachers&mdash;give them an opportunity of having their case heard and being reinstated&mdash;I submit that they will have taken a step forward.  I have mentioned the fact that there are people employed already who have not taken this declaration, and who, because they refused to apply for an increase of salary, were left in their positions.  It is also a fact that we have here on these Benches a Deputy who refused to take this declaration and who was appointed as a medical officer down in Galway in spite of the Executive Council. When we have a living embodiment here of the fact that public opinion is against this, that the people do not want it&mdash;and public opinion in a way may be wiser than the Minister for Education&mdash;we ought, I think, go a step further and abolish the thing altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like also to treat this subject seriously. Every man and woman in this country have votes, provided they have reached the age of 21, and are perfectly free to vote and vote in any way they wish. In order to give the greatest possible representation to minorities, there is a system of proportional representation. That is the position in this State&mdash;that is the Constitution of this State.  That seems to me to be undeniable&mdash;mathematically accurate.  Every man and woman in the State, if they have reached the age of 21, have a vote. There is nothing to stop them from voting&mdash;no coercion of any kind&mdash;and they vote under a system which gives the largest possible representation to minorities.  It is in that way that the Executive of the country is formed&mdash; that is the Constitution of this State. Moreover there is machinery provided for changing that Constitution, and it was provided with the consent of those people who have got the vote and the right to use it in the way I have set out. That is the Constitution of the country. It is to that Constitution that public servants are asked to give allegiance. The declaration set out in that Act is a declaration of that state of affairs&mdash;a declaration, as every man of any education knows, that implies the right to use every legal means, every means within the Constitution, to change the Constitution at any time, in so far as one citizen can do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, at this hour of the day in this country it is said that to ask public officials, to ask people paid with the taxpayers' money, to say that they will give allegiance to that state of affairs is monstrous, or to use the words of the leader of the Opposition, is a particularly mean thing to do.  If that is so, if Deputy Derrig is right when he says that public opinion is utterly opposed to that declaration of allegiance &mdash;and this is the important point, opposed to it for the reason that the Deputy himself and the leader of the Opposition gave them&mdash;if that is so, this country does not understand democracy and is not fit for democracy.  We are told that there is a greater ideal than the Free State.  What is it?  It might be a republic, it might be an Irish Ireland. <Col N="1819" /> Is any republican precluded from working for that ideal, from endeavouring to change that ideal by this declaration.  In one respect, and one respect only, is he precluded from doing so.  He is precluded from using violence for that purpose.  I want to know in what other respect he is precluded. That is a point I would like the Leader of the Opposition to deal with later on.  How is he precluded? In one way, and one way only, which is from using violence against the majority of the people.  Any minority is precluded from using violence against the majority of the people, but so far as he cares to use any other method he has the Constitution there open to him, the most democratic constitution in Europe, and he can use all the methods that are there.</P>
    <P>When Deputies tackle that position, they are driven back to one point.  The Leader of the Opposition indicated that point.  He said, in fact, that this Constitution was imposed by force upon the people.  What right has any representative of the country to say that? What right has any minority party to take up that position?  What right has any minority party to attempt to interpret the reason which forced the country to come to a decision?  If they have such a right&mdash;and it is admitted that they came to a decision on many occasions in favour of this Constitution &mdash;are they willing to give that right to any other minority in the country? Are they willing to give that right to a minority that wants us to return to the British connection and if not, why not? If you get away from majority rule once, where are you going to end?</P>
    <P>There is, I suppose, a small section in this country yet&mdash;I daresay they are very small&mdash;that would like to see this country ruled from England.  If Deputies opposite in a slight minority have now a right to say that as a minority they must interpret what is best for the Irish people by some other standard than the standards the people laid down for themselves, namely, the decision come to at the elections, has not any other, even though it is a small minority, the same right.  Has not the party to which we belong the same right if and when we become a minority <Col N="1820" /> party?  Where is democracy, and what good is your republican or Irish Ireland without democracy?</P>
    <P>You talk of greater ideals.  There is a greater ideal than any of these things.  There is an ideal without which neither the conception of republican or Irish Ireland, or any other conception can live, and that is that there is only one decent form of government which is majority rule. The people are forsooth coerced.  I deny the right of anyone to say that. I deny the right of any man or minority to interpret the reasons that have influenced the majority to come to their decisions.  With great respect that particular point is a quibble.  It is a quibble to say that the Treaty was a settlement induced by coercion.  It is a quibble to say the same thing about the Constitution.  Of course, there was coercion against the Irish, but equally there was coercion against the English, and there was never a treaty in any country, and never yet a contract in public or in private that there was not coercion on both sides. To come down to a prosaic matter, let me say that I never sold a bullock except under coercion.  I would always like to get more for it than I did.  As between states, no agreement was ever made without coercion on both sides. It is simply begging the question to rely upon the argument that there was coercion in regard to the passing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty.  There was on both sides.  And it is very hard to say on which side was the greater coercion.  I am quite sure that the English did not like to clear out of this country.  That argument was relied upon, for what?  To belittle the Constitution, to belittle the State institutions, to belittle the Government set up by the majority will of the people, and to allow anybody for whatever reason may seem to be good to him, to call himself an Irish Republican or an Irish Irelander, no matter what his real motives may be.  There are a great many people who call themselves republicans, and do not know the meaning of the word &ldquo;republican,&rdquo; and there are a great many who have the words Irish Irelander on their lips, and who have not the faintest conception of what it means&mdash;and all these for <Col N="1821" /> this reason are to be justified by that quibble to do what?  To injure the State and the State institutions, to flout the Constitution, and to bring the whole idea of a democratic state in this country into contempt.  We could not subscribe to that doctrine.  That is the doctrine put up by Deputy de Valera, and it is because that doctrine has been formulated in this country that it is absolutely essential to have such a test.  Is that a political test?  I stated what the Constitution of this country is.  Is it mere politics to ask for allegiance to that Constitution?</P>

I think he said his idea was that this was not good enough, but that we had to go on with it, and in the meantime there should be some rule of order.  That is, of course, exactly the position.  There must be some rule of order if we are to have civilisation, if we are to have any decent conditions. The rule of order is there, and that rule of order enables us to keep order, and it enables us further to change the rule; it enables us to go further any time we wish, any time the majority wish.  The minorities have their rights absolutely, but so have majorities. Minorities have the right to use all constitutional means to keep their point of view forward, to make as much out of their point of view as possible. But beyond that they have no right to go.  It thus comes down to this: that the only weapon&mdash;the only method is the better phrase&mdash;that is taken away from the minorities in this country at the moment is the weapon of violence, and that is what Deputy de Valera is pleading for.</P>

      <P>Deputy de Valera said that this was in the British tradition. Is it?  I have come to the conclusion that Deputy de Valera thinks that disloyalty to the English Government was treason; that disloyalty to a Government kept in this country by the majority of a foreign country was treason.  It is only on that basis that I can explain his present use of the words treason and disloyalty.  I do not believe that disloyalty to the British was treason, but I do believe that disloyalty to the majority will of the people of this State is treason, and I do believe that treason is a foul crime. I do believe that any man or woman who is not prepared loyally to accept the will of the majority of the people should not be paid by public money and should not be put into a public position.</P>
      <P>I do believe the State is entitled to adopt exactly the same rule in regard to State affairs as a prudent man would adopt in regard to his own business. Nobody is going to employ a servant who will betray him or who is prepared to do violence to him, and why should the State?  If the State refuses to employ such a man, what right has he to complain?  Let him go to some country that he can be loyal to.  No one has any right in this country who is not loyal to the will of the people. No one in this country should be allowed to flout the Constitution.  Anybody can do what in him lies legally to challenge it.  That is democracy.  If Deputy de Valera is really expressing the point of view of the Deputies who are sitting on his benches; if he is expressing&mdash;I believe he is not&mdash;the considered point of view of the people who voted for him, then there is a minority in this country that is not fit for self-government and that is incapable of understanding democracy.  When I hear of Republicanism and Irish-Irelandism here&mdash;</P>

      <P>With great respect, you will allow me to remind you that I think the words were actually used. The words &ldquo;fuller freedom&rdquo; were often used, and I am almost certain that the words I mentioned were used. When I hear people talking of greater freedom and of this and that idea, and a whole lot of ideas about this freedom, by whom is all this to be brought about?  By people who do not understand the meaning of the word coercion. We are told that this is British coercion.  Is it British coercion to uphold the rights of the majority of the people of the country?  Was that what the British did?  Is not that what we are doing?  Yet that is called British coercion.  I thought British coercion was coercion of the majority.  I know the real coercion that exists.  The only possible coercion at present is coercion by the minority of the majority, and that is British coercion.  I could use the word with some right, but the Deputy cannot.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Morrissey that we should try to unite and not divide the people.  We can never unite the people on the basis of Deputy de Valera's suggestion.  I do not agree that if Deputy de Valera got a majority of 90 per cent., any people can be united on that basis.  Such unity could not last.  No people can be united on the basis that any minority can challenge, can use any means to challenge, the majority rule.  It can never be done. You will never bring this country anywhere until ideas of that sort are killed. I do not care what will happen electorally. My point is that it cannot be done.  No good, decent or civilised conditions can be brought about, and no advance can be made in this country until the point of view that Deputy de Valera expresses is definitely killed in this country.  I have sufficient faith in the future of the country to believe that the people do believe in democracy and that they will kill those ideas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals with a declaration which is contained in the Local Government Act of 1925.  When that declaration was being debated in the Dáil in 1925 very many of the arguments that could be advanced against it were advanced by the Deputies present at that time in the Labour Party and I think that Deputy Esmonde and one or two other Deputies in the House opposed it.  This Bill is introduced very largely in the hope that a better atmosphere exists in the House now than existed then.  Apparently that hope has been killed.  The Ministers' speeches have indicated that there was never any ground for entertaining that hope. They are still intent on penalising men who are not prepared to give voluntary allegiance to the Constitution imposed on this State, the Constitution the Act says &ldquo;as by law established&rdquo; and as by the Public Safety Act abolished.  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture did not give us a very fair interpretation of that Constitution.  Such of the democratic provisions which it contains and which have survived the passage of the Public Safety Act will be maintained and vigorously maintained by the Deputies on these benches.  I have a distinct recollection that during the recent General Election Ministers of the Executive Council frequently stated that they stood for the abolition of certain of those democratic sections of the Constitution and for the revision of the whole system of proportional representation, the very sections which are now advanced in justification of the Constitution's existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that this declaration was introduced to deal with men who plotted to destroy the State.  Now, there is a Treasonable Offences Act and the Public Safety Act and a host of other Acts, and between them all I think it is not possible to think of the Constitution for three nights running without rendering yourself liable to imprisonment or deportation or execution. If a man even thought of plotting against the State, if he was even suspected by a policeman of plotting against the State, he could be arrested and placed in internment where <Col N="1826" /> he would be harmless.  This declaration was not enacted or inserted in the Act to deal with the people who are actively engaged in undermining the State or Constitution.  It was introduced to make it impossible for the men who have not got the national or political outlook of the Ministers&mdash;to make it impossible for them to get an increase in their salaries without taking the declaration.  The weapon of hunger is used.  Married men with jobs under Local Government boards were to be told: &ldquo;If you do not make this declaration you are going to starve and your wife and children are going to starve.&rdquo;  I can tell the House that many of those men did choose to starve rather than make that declaration, and it is a matter of note that there are a number of men at this moment without employment because they refused to take that oath.</P>

      <P>I understand there are very many such.  Perhaps we will arrange to supply the information. Although the Minister is Minister for <Col N="1827" /> Local Government, his Department may not have informed him of these facts.  I was going to suggest to the Ministry that they should for one moment cast their minds back over the road which they had travelled, look at the milestones upon it, so that they may realise the road they are going. I think I am correct in saying that at one period they publicly advocated the acceptance of the Treaty on the grounds that the Oath section in the Treaty would only be applicable to members of the Executive Council. The second milestone was reached when it became necessary to impose that Oath upon every member of the Oireachtas.  Then they went further, and a declaration similar to the Oath was imposed on public servants.  The next step they came to was to impose that declaration on the employees of Local Government boards.  If they keep going on in that direction it will soon be necessary to take a declaration before it is possible to live in the State at all.</P>

      <P>We had hoped that the drop of the nation into degradation of that kind had ceased, that we had hit bottom, and were on the rebound. This debate here has disillusioned us somewhat.  I am prepared to concede this: that the last step of the downward trail, the imposition of this declaration, was not deliberately decided on by the Executive Council, that, as pointed out, it was not in the Bill when introduced. It was not in the Bill when it passed this House.  It came into the Bill on the initiative of a rather reckless, unbalanced Senator from Donegal, and it came back here, and was accepted with enthusiasm by the Deputies on the Government benches.  We hear a lot about the majority will of the people.  Only twenty-six elected Deputies, elected by the Irish people, voted for this declaration out of a total of 153 Deputies&mdash;only 26 for majority rule out of the 153!</P>

      <P>In any case I want to point out that only one-sixth of the elected Deputies of the Irish people voted in favour of that declaration. We have been told that loyalty to the State is not to be confused with loyalty to a party.  Now, I very seriously suggest that if there is any confusion in the minds of the public between loyalty to the State and loyalty to a party in the State that confusion has been very largely created by the Government. They have not hesitated to play upon that confusion in the public mind at election times for the purpose of getting votes for themselves.  Mind you, I am not going to permit even the majority of the Irish people to define loyalty strictly for me.  Those of us who had the honour to participate in the Rising of 1916 will remember the flood of resolutions that were passed by Deputy McDonagh and by Deputy Leonard and others throughout the country denouncing the traitors and denouncing their disloyalty.</P>

      <P>Yes, I do not wish to argue it.  We know that practically every Board in Ireland was solemnly passing these resolutions about treason and disloyalty and a few years later every one of these Boards was passing resolutions to erase from their minutes the resolutions passed a few years previously. Loyalty is a relative term. There are certain sections in the Constitution, loyalty to which in my <Col N="1829" /> opinion, and in the opinions of Deputies here and in the opinion of the people who elected us, would be disloyalty to the nation.  And that loyalty not all your Public Safety Acts or Treason Acts are going to get from us.  We are prepared to recognise this assembly of elected representatives of the Irish people as such.  We are prepared to recognise their right to make laws for the twenty-six counties over which they have control, but we are not prepared to recognise their right to define loyalty to this Constitution as loyalty to the nation.  We have been told also that we here&mdash;the Minister for Education stated it&mdash;are unable to distinguish between laws made by the foreigner and laws made by the Irish people.  I suggest to Ministers, that the most obvious thing about this debate is that they have been unable to distinguish between the laws passed by the people and the laws imposed on this State by the will of the foreigner. Disloyalty, we are told, is not virtuous and decent and there is no fouler crime than treason.  In that matter the Minister for Lands and Agriculture and myself are in complete accord. Again I say that treason, like disloyalty, is a relative term, but what is disloyalty and treason to the Minister for Agriculture may not be disloyalty or treason to me.  For example, the Minister for Lands and Agriculture has proclaimed himself wildly enthusiastic about the oath.  I am not. He, I think, is prepared to accept the Treaty under which this House was established as a final settlement with England.  I am not.</P>

I would like to suggest to the Ministers, to Deputies in the Government party, and to the other Deputies here, that the fewer restrictions we have on individual opinion the stronger and the more virile will the national spirit become. We should abolish every restriction that is not absolutely necessary. Remember oaths are not fashionable in every country.  There is no oath imposed on the elected representatives of the people of France.  There is no oath imposed on the elected representatives of the people of Germany.  They are elected as representatives of the people, and as such they meet together and do the business of the people.  Let us get rid of all this nonsense about the oath. Let us take away these shackles of individual opinion, and let us build up that strong, virile, healthy, national spirit which I would remind Deputies is of very considerable economic value.</P>

      <P>This was referred to as a &ldquo;stepping stone to freedom.&rdquo;  A lot of soft soap has been used on the stepping stone since, and a lot of people have slipped off.  That has been forgotten. We are told now that it is absolutely essential in order to force people or persuade them if you like, to <Col N="1831" /> be loyal to the nation.  As Deputy Lemass has remarked, with truth, loyalty is a very relevant term because I think the President would repeat if I asked him what he said some time ago, that in matters of Irish nationality he yielded to no man.  I respectfully submit that if the President made that same remark in any part of the Six Counties he would be carried home on a shutter. We cannot define loyalty so easily as all that.  It made no difference to people who were employed in the British service whether an oath was imposed on them or not.  When they had the spirit of Irish nationality in them they helped during the time of the trouble in this country, although an oath of allegiance was imposed on them. I submit that forcing a thing on a man that he does not want, but that he may accept for economic reasons, is not going to convert him to loyalty to any State or Constitution.  That is not going to make him any more loyal, and it is time that that sort of thing was abolished in this country.  We are all, even those on the Government benches, moving towards the larger freedom, and still we put fetters on other men who might even be inclined to think along lines of greater freedom.  We are told here, of course, that Deputies on these benches do not understand what they are talking about.  We have been lectured time after time and treated as if we were children who did not know what we were talking about.  I acknowledge that the front Benches opposite have a monopoly of the aperceptive minds of the House, and I hope that, for the sake of posterity, they will bequeath their heads to the Royal College of Surgeons.  I know several people who would be glad to take them apart to see what makes them go.  The point is that if we are going to move towards any larger freedom we should not at this stage be imposing&mdash;</P>

It seems to me that if we are ever to move towards that larger freedom, this is not the time nor the place to impose oaths of allegiance, pledges, or tests on any <Col N="1832" /> section of the community.  There are several laws for dealing with those who may be inclined to use violence to attain the ends of greater freedom. There are plenty of laws dealing with that, but, as a Deputy on these Benches has remarked, this was not intended to deal with any of these persons who might be inclined to use violence.  It was intended as a weapon against those who, in my opinion, differed politically from those on the opposite Benches, and I hold it is time it was abolished.</P>

      <P>In facing this matter, of which I gave notice, we are not dealing with a simple question.  We are dealing with the manner in which the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is misusing its powers.  In bringing this small individual case forward, it might seem that I am improperly taking up the time of the House, but I hold that the humblest individual in the State, when a wrong is done to him, has a right to have it ventilated.  This unfortunate boy spent the last four years working as a temporary postman in Carrigtwohill.  During that period he has had foisted over his head two men, whose only claim to those positions was that they served in the National Army. We are told here that there is no coercion; we are told that there is no wronging of any individual, but I have here before me the reply given last week to a question I put down.  It states that during the period this boy was in this employment, the performance of his duties was satisfactory.  I have here the reply to another question to-day, which states that &ldquo;his intermittent temporary service of thirty-seven weeks gives him no claim to appointment.&rdquo; What is necessary for a claim for appointment in the postal service to-day?  What should be necessary but good, satisfactory service given in that employment?  Should not that be the only guide for any appointment? <Col N="1833" /> What do we find?  We find that this young boy is the sole support of a father, mother, a brother and three sisters, that the few shillings a week that this boy was earning as a temporary postman was the sole support of that family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We find that his claims have been completely overridden.  For what? For a gentleman who we are told has given nine years' satisfactory service&mdash;&ldquo;the successful candidate, in addition to other qualifications, has had over nine years' satisfactory service in the Department.&rdquo;  Now, what was the satisfactory service?  He served up to 1916, when he joined the British Army, came back in 1919 and served not longer than three weeks, when he threw his bag to the postmistress and told her he was getting a better job.  I am not going to deal with the condition he was in when he threw the bag to her.  Then we find that in the past six months he has been in the Midleton Union and he came out of it to get this job.  He served in the National Army for a short period.  He never served in the I.R.A.; he always served where there was pay going.  He has no dependents whatsoever. This is the gentleman who was put in to occupy a position which belongs, I say, by every sense of justice, to this young chap who has spent four years as a temporary postman there.  Is this matter going to continue?  Are we going to have this political patronage; are we going to have this rule that because an individual served for a week, a fortnight, three weeks or a month in the National Army, he is entitled to the position? If that is the foremost condition, the condition which every individual must have before he is entitled to the position, before he is entitled to any position whatsoever in the public service, it is time that that kind of thing was put an end to, once and for all, and we must put an end to it by some means or by any means.  We are faced with a wretched state of affairs in this.  I have in my mind at the present moment several instances of that patronage in East Cork.  I have in my mind at the present moment a young man who joined the British Army, served in it up to 1919, who was driven into that, I suppose, by the plea that he <Col N="1834" /> was fighting for small nations, who came home, joined the I.R.A., and refused to be duped by the people opposite who said he had complete freedom.</P>

      <P>Is that the kind of treatment we are going to have doped out?  Is that the patronage we are going to have doped out?  I state that the claim to employment in any public service to-day in the first place should be when a man has already given satisfactory service in that employment. I think that the Parliamentary Secretary must have been misled in this matter when he told us that this gentleman has given satisfactory service, and I would advise him to refer it back and find out a little more before he makes appointments of that class. This position is not worth so much that it should be made a political job of, but I think he should give it to the unfortunate boy who has had four years' satisfactory service, and who is the sole support of a family of five.</P>

      <P>The case made by the Deputy resolves itself under two heads: one, the particular case of this appointment which was made in the Post Office in question; and the other, the broad general question of the employment of ex-members of the National Army.  To deal with the particular appointment made here, I want to assure the Deputy that appointments such as these are not normally made directly by me, so that the question of promiscuous power and political patronage does not arise.  Appointments of a minor nature are made by the local postmaster.  They are made subject to certain definite regulations and rules.  That particular appointment, like all such appointments, would be made without reference <Col N="1835" /> to me, and no reference was made to me until the Deputy himself raised the matter in the House.  On the question of McCarthy's qualifications, as against the qualifications of the man who was recommended by the Deputy, on service alone, and it is upon that point that the Deputy is making the case, undoubtedly the man who got the appointment was the deserving applicant. He had nine years' service in the Post Office.  His record is shown&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. CORRY Mr. CORRY">

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>His record shows that his work during all that time was satisfactory and as stated in my answer.  That was placed against the case of a man who had only thirty-seven weeks' temporary service.  Undoubtedly, on this ground alone the case of the man who got the appointment is made.  The Deputy says that two auxiliary postmen have been appointed since this man made his application.</P>

      <P>I want to make the point clear before the Parliamentary Secretary leaves it.  The case in question, as I understand Deputy Corry wished to put it to the House, was this, that in the one case there was a temporary postman with service amounting to thirty-seven weeks, over a period of four years, who, on the admission of the Department, has given satisfactory service.  On the other hand, in the case of the postman who has had nine years' service, Deputy Corry definitely suggests that the Parliamentary Secretary may not be aware of the fact that this service was not quite regular, was not good, that he had left the service in a fit of temper in a certain condition. When the Parliamentary Secretary replied that his service was regular and good, is he aware of this particular instance, and would he call that good service?</P>

      <P>I quite understand the case made by the Deputy. The service of this man, during his <Col N="1836" /> period in the Post Office was regarded as good.  He started as a boy messenger. He continued up to the time he joined the British Army.  His record during that time was quite good, and it was continuous service.  That was placed against the record of the man who was on temporary duty from time to time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputies are able to place the Chair in a very awkward position on the Adjournment. The idea is that a Deputy makes his case.  Deputy Corry made his case, but Deputy Briscoe considered it necessary to make the case all over again by way of interruption of the Parliamentary Secretary.  If interruptions of the Parliamentary Secretary continue, the only option I have is to adjourn the Dáil.  If I adjourn the Dáil, the result will be that Deputy Corry will not get an answer, and, if he wants an answer, I presume he would be hurt if he did not get it.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is interrupted he will not be able to make his case, so that Deputies who interrupt are acting in an unfair manner and are preventing him from making his case.  Let the Parliamentary Secretary make his reply without interruption.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the statement of the Deputy that two other appointments were made during the same intervening time and that this man applied for a permanent appointment, it may be so, but I have no official information at my disposal at the moment about it, and the official files do not contain records of these temporary appointments.  I assume that the two temporary appointments were made in <Col N="1837" /> the same way as this other appointment was made, because the applicants had the necessary qualifications.  If that is not so, it is open to the Deputy to raise the matter again in the Dáil or ask a question in regard to the qualifications of the two postmen appointed in the meantime.  The case is made by the Deputy that this particular man in whom he is interested should not get the appointment, as he is in receipt of a pension of 16/- a week from the British Army.  On that particular point I have no information, and it is not a point on which we make inquiries.  I am rather surprised that the Deputy should make the case that this man should not get the position because he was in the British Army, in view of the vote that he gave here the other night.</P>
