      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>While the production of receipts in respect of subscriptions to the Dáil Eireann Internal Loan naturally facilitates repayment, my Department does not insist on such receipts, and repayment has in fact already been made in large numbers of cases where no receipts were available. Every application is considered on its merits, and where there is satisfactory evidence in support of the applicant's claim that he subscribed to the Dáil Eireann Internal Loan the amount of his subscription will be repaid with interest, as provided in the Dáil Eireann Loans and Funds Act, 1924.  I do not consider that at present any special <Col N="1280" /> machinery is necessary beyond that which already exists in my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CARNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there should be some information given to the people so as to let them know what the Minister has just stated, because in North Fermanagh, for example, where £1,725 was subscribed, there is much dissatisfaction, because people did not get-receipts, and consequently they have been unable to obtain certificates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Advertisements were issued in the Press asking the people who had subscribed to apply.  If the particulars given in the application coincide with the information which exists in the Department of Finance, repayment will be made in those cases. If people have applied and have not yet had their cases dealt with, it does not follow that they will not be repaid. Perhaps before the whole work of the repayment of the loan has been dealt with, it may be necessary to set up some special investigation machinery, but until we have gone as far as we can go in dealing with these cases first, I would not consider the setting up of such machinery.</P>

      <P>A circular has been issued to all Employment Exchange managers dealing with the recruitment of temporary labour required by the Post Office during the Christmas season.  The circular states that the order of preference to be accorded to categories other than ex-National Army men with dependents will be decided later.  The bulk of the workers required are not usually engaged until the middle of December, and the decision as to preference will be taken before then.  In the event of a small number of workers being required before the date on which the bulk of them are engaged the circular directs that only ex-National Army men with dependents are to be submitted for employment.  This is conveyed in simple language in the circular.</P>
      <P>I caused the usual reference in the posters to preferential treatment for ex-National Army men to be omitted for the reason that I will consider the claims of civilian workers with dependents before coming to a decision governing the engagement of the bulk of the workers in December.</P>

It reads:&mdash;&ldquo;It is stated that steps have been taken to bring about a large and immediate increase in the number of privately-owned buses.&rdquo;  My information <Col N="1287" /> is that these bus proprietors intend to dump 150 buses in the course of the next few months at a value including duty and carriage of £700 per body. That is £105,000 altogether.  In view of the fact that the dumping of this large number of buses into the country will effectively kill the demand for buses for a long time to come, will the Minister not reconsider his decision?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to move the Second Reading of this Bill.  The immediate object of the Bill is that the urban elections which are normally due to take place on the 15th January next will be postponed until June, and also that the elections for county councils <Col N="1300" /> due to take place in the beginning of June will be postponed until the end of June.  In so far as the urban elections are concerned, the change will mean that the elections will be held at a more suitable time both from the point of view of the persons voting and from a financial point of view as regards the business of the councils. There will be less dislocation of the work of the schools, and there will be a pretty definite saving by the proposal in the Bill that the urban elections will be held on the same date as the county council elections in sixteen urban areas. The electors in the urban areas are also voters in the county council elections. By having the elections on the same day there will be a certain amount of saving.  For instance, in the case of the Dundalk Urban District Council, there would be a saving of £185, one-third of which would be saved by the urban authorities and two-thirds by the county.  In the case of Rathmines the saving would be, approximately, £236, of which two-thirds would be saved to the county and one-third to the urban council.  There are 61 urban districts and 23 towns not urban districts, so that there will be a rather substantial saving.  The postponing of the county elections from the beginning to the end of June is to avoid the complication that at present arises when the new register is introduced every year on the 1st June.  It is proposed that the county councils elections will in future take place between the 21st June and the 1st July, inclusive.  Having the elections at the end of June will avoid the present complication with regard to the register.  Certain local authorities are at present dissolved, and the position with regard to these will be that, in the case of Cobh Urban District, Tipperary Urban District, Offaly County Council and Board of Health and the Cork Mental Hospital Committee, the elections will take place, but in the case of the urban districts of Trim, Ennis and Westport the elections will not take place.  The statutory period under which these bodies can remain dissolved will not have expired at the end of June next year, and, therefore, the Bill does not arrange that elections will take place in these particular places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1301" /> Should it so happen that circumstances in connection with these particular bodies would be such that an election might be warranted, then under the powers vested in the Minister an order could be issued, if so desired, that the elections be held in any or all of these places at the time of the other election.  In the case of Dublin borough and county, and to a certain extent in the case of Cork, there is a special problem, and the case of Cork really hangs on the fact that, arising out of the Greater Dublin Commission Report, the whole question of city management will have to be considered.  It seems undesirable that the Commissioner should be removed from Cork city until the Greater Dublin Commission Report has been considered and proposals formulated in the light of the consideration of that report.  In so far as Dublin borough is concerned, the statutory period for the Commissioners in Dublin city will expire on the 31st March, 1929.  It is hoped by that time to have fully considered the Report of the Greater Dublin Commission, and to have proposals made for the Government of Dublin city.  For that reason, it is considered undesirable that there should be elections either for the county council or urban or rural districts in Dublin.  It is proposed to postpone, elections in the county or county borough of Dublin until a date not later than the 31st March, 1929.  The Bill is intended to restart the regular triennial election period that really has not operated since 1914.  The Bill makes certain provision with regard to the taking up and laying down of office arising in a consequential way out of the introduction of the fresh triennial period. The Bill also makes provision by which the county councils will have authority for arranging or controlling their schemes of polling districts and polling booths, in the same way as the county councils now do so in respect to the Dáil elections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'KELLY Mr. O'KELLY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'KELLY</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as this Bill purposes to make arrangements for the restoration of the ordinary elections triennial or otherwise, of local bodies, <Col N="1302" /> we have no objection to it, but several people have mentioned objections to me.  While it is admitted there would be a saving in having urban elections and county council elections on the same day, nevertheless there is a fear that there will be confusion when the different lists of candidates are presented to people, especially illiterate and semi-illiterate people in the country. I wonder if the proposer of the Bill would give consideration to that aspect of the question.  The saving that would be effected is undoubtedly an advantage that makes an appeal to us, but we would like to have further consideration given to the question so far as it relates to having the elections for these two types of bodies on the one day.  We are not satisfied that it is necessary to postpone the elections for the boroughs of Dublin and Cork for such a lengthy period as is proposed The excuse is that the report of the Greater Dublin Commission will have to be considered.  That report was published practically a year ago, and surely one year ought to be enough for consideration even of such an important subject by the Department concerned, and to have gone carefully over it.  No doubt the Department went over the evidence as it was published during the time the Commission was sitting, which spread over a fairly lengthy period.  We are not satisfied that another year or more is necessary in order to give conditional consideration to that report, and for proposals in connection with it, or otherwise, to be brought before this House. We think that between this and next June would be ample time for dealing with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this side of the House we object on principle to the suppression of these bodies.  We have protested against that, and will continue to protest.  We do not see that there was any necessity, at any time, for suppressing these bodies, and we certainly do not agree that the suppression ought to continued any longer.  We see no just reason for it in reference to these two bodies, against which no charge of corruption&mdash;although frequently made in the public press and elsewhere&mdash;has ever been proved.  We object strenuously <Col N="1303" /> to the continued suppression of these bodies, and the taking away from the citizens of rights which they fulfilled to the satisfaction of those who had elected them in days gone by. Therefore we cannot accept the principle in this Bill, so far as it concerns the suppression of these bodies, and unless we get a promise that by next June the elections that ought to have been held long before now will be ordered by the Ministry we cannot agree to the proposal.  Similar things might be said with regard to the other suppressed bodies which the Minister referred to when introducing the Bill. However, there might be some bodies about which there might be discussion as to the advisability of allowing a little further time to put affairs, that may have gone out of order during the period of stress, into proper condition to be handed back to the people.  We feel, at any rate, with regard to the Dublin and Cork County Borough Councils, and the other bodies associated with them, that they have been suppressed improperly, and that we cannot give assent to a Bill of this kind, which proposes to continue much longer than is absolutely necessary their further suppression.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterDeLoughry" hpid="Mr. DE LOUGHREY Mr. DE LOUGHREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE LOUGHREY</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion, the Bill as outlined by the Minister, is one that reflects the opinion generally of the people of the country. As far as I could gather from Deputy O'Kelly's remarks I think there will be general agreement that June is certainly a better time for holding municipal and county council elections than January.  We all agree on that. It is certainly an advantage to have an election for the county councils and the urban councils on the same day. As well as a saving of money there is a saving of time.  People going to vote have a grievance if they are called on to do so in January for the urban councils, and a few months later for county councils.  I think there will be general agreement on that. and that there is no necessity to deal with the matter at any great length.  I would like to express my satisfaction at the indication that has been given by the Minister, that we are to return in local <Col N="1304" /> government to administration by the elected representatives of the people. While I say that I want to make it quite clear that, as far as I know, the Government were justified in every case in which they appointed commissioners. I do not agree that local government should be carried out by commissioners.  I think the people's representatives should govern, but, from whatever causes, we all know that interest in local bodies by the electors seemed to die out.  They did not take the interest they should in the local bodies.  Although the Government has been attacked for appointing commissioners I hold they were justified. I do not know any place in which commissioners were appointed where the local bodies did their work, or made any attempt to do so.  At the same time this Bill indicates that we are going to return to government by elected representatives, and we all hope the electors will show their interest in the elections of the new bodies that will have the spending of the rates and will elect men who will do their duty.</P>

    <P>I suppose Deputy O'Kelly would object to my saying that the Government were quite right in their decision with regard to Dublin.  I suppose I will be told that I am from the country, and that it is only Dublin people have a right to interfere.  I hold that every citizen should have a voice and an interest in the management of Dublin, in which we all have a pride.  Dublin is the capital of Ireland and, in addition, all citizens of the Saorstát contribute towards maintaining its importance.  The Government institutions, for one thing, the cost of which the people of the country contribute to, tend to make Dublin an important city, and we would all like to see Dublin not only the first city in Ireland, but the first city in the world.  The Government will have the support and the cooperation of everybody, I believe, who has the interests of the country at heart, and particularly the interests of Dublin, if they go slowly in their efforts to make it a great city, a city that we can all be proud of.  I stood up as one who has been a public representative <Col N="1305" /> for a great number of years to make it quite clear, as the Government have been criticised so severely because they appointed commissioners, that after making the fullest inquiry possible I am convinced that the Government have not appointed commissioners in any place where local representatives did their duty, and to express the wish that greater interest will be taken in local administration.</P>

I am glad that that state of affairs is going to disappear.  I would not like to say anything that would be taken as a charge against Cork.  The probability is that those elected in Cork and Dublin were doing their best and acting honestly and conscientiously, but I am sure Deputy French knows that most municipal bodies inherited a good deal of incompetency.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Kelly about the inconvenience caused by having the two elections on the one day.  I can give the Minister an instance where there were fifty-four candidates for urban and county council elections in one area, and great inconvenience was caused in connection with a large number of illiterate voters. There were nine vacancies in an urban ward and we had twenty candidates, and there were six vacancies for the county council, and we had eighteen candidates.  There were fifty-four names for the people in one ward to vote on.  I am certain, as a result, that the true opinion of the electors was not expressed when there was such a large number of names submitted to them. January is a suitable month in urban areas, where people have not to travel a long distance to vote, but for county council elections I agree that the month of June is the best.  But if there could be some arrangement whereby such a number of bogus names were not put up for the number of seats, as in the case I have mentioned, the objection would probably be lessened.</P>

      <P>I would like to supplement the remarks which have been made by Deputy Everett with regard to the holding of both elections on the <Col N="1307" /> same date.  Undoubtedly there would be a saving&mdash;possibly a considerable saving&mdash;on the rates as a result, but more important even than that saving is the securing of the opinion of the electorate in a clear manner, so as to ensure the efficient administration of local affairs.  I remember that on the occasion of the last county council elections in Dublin there was also an election for the Rathmines Urban Council.  I am not a very ignorant person, but when I got into the polling booth and got both ballot papers, not having taken the precaution of noting down the names I wanted to vote for, I was so confused that when I came out I was horrified to find that I had voted for a couple of Cumann na nGaedheal candidates.  In cases such as that cited by Deputy Everett, where a voter in a country town may be presented with two lists totalling over fifty names, there is bound to be confusion, and the result of the election is more chance than anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that the whole question of city management would have to be reconsidered, arising out of the Report of the Greater Dublin Commission, but, as Deputy O'Kelly has pointed out, the Greater Dublin Commission was set up in June, 1924, I think, and it held numerous sittings, reports of which were published, between that and November, 1926, when it reported&mdash;a full twelve months ago. Surely if the Department is doing its work the whole question of city management arising out of that report should have been considered before this. The Minister states that he hopes the report will be considered before March, 1929.  I think that it could easily be considered before then, and that legislation could be framed to give effect to its recommendations in time to enable the election for the Greater Dublin Council, or whatever body will be established, to be held in June of next year, that is, eight months ahead, the same time as the elections for other local bodies.  I would also like to know if the Government have accepted the principle of the Greater Dublin Report. Do they intend to introduce legislation to give effect to it?  Is that legislation <Col N="1308" /> being prepared, and when do they hope to introduce it?</P>
    <P>Deputy de Loughrey said that the Government were justified in suppressing the Dublin Corporation.  What was the justification?  We are entitled to know that when we are told that the action of the Government was justified.  In what way was it justified?  I understand that in Kilkenny borough the treasurer, or some other official, was responsible for the disappearance of a considerable sum of the ratepayers' money.  That did not happen in Dublin.  Why was the Kilkenny Corporation not suppressed?  There was evidence of serious mismanagement there, but there was no such evidence in the case of Dublin.</P>

      <P>I suppose so, as this is rather a sore spot with you.  I think the explanation offered by the Minister that the election for the Dublin County Borough is to be postponed for another 15 or 16 months, because the report has not yet been fully considered, is not the correct explanation.  It is obviously not the correct explanation, because the report could be considered, as I said, and legislation introduced in a much shorter space of time than that. Can we be informed as to what the correct explanation is?  We are opposed to this postponement and, being opposed to it, we are going to vote against this Bill.  While that section remains we will oppose the Bill through all its stages.  We believe that the people of Dublin should be entrusted with the administration of their own local affairs.  We believe that the action of the Government in keeping that control out of the hands of the people is no justification whatever for this postponement.  On this matter we stand to advocate the rights of the citizens of the city to have a direct say as to the manner in which the money collected from them in rates is going to be spent.</P>

      <P>I rise to make a few remarks on this Bill&mdash;not on any matter connected with my own constituency, but in reference to a matter connected with the County Dublin.  I notice that under the Bill the rural district council elections for the County Dublin are not going to be held until the year 1929.  With regared to the Balrothery Rural District Council, I understand that a lot of people in North County Dublin, workers and others, consider that this Council is not carrying out its work in the way it should, especially in regard to the manner in which it is treating the workers. Certain delays have taken place with regard to relief schemes in North County Dublin on the part of that district council.  As this district council will not, I understand, come in under the Greater Dublin scheme, I think the Minister has not made out a case why the elections for this rural district council should not be held next June.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interfere with the Corporation at all.  I want to say that it is quite apparent that as regards election for local bodies, the people do not come forward to the poll in very large numbers.  We had an explanation perhaps from Deputy Lemass as to the want of interest in local elections and as to the necessity for appointing Commissioners.  He said he was horrified, in voting for somebody perhaps on his merits as an administrator, to find that he was altogether wrong from the political point of view.  I think we have too much politics in local elections.  If we could concentrate more on merits in local administrators and pay less attention to politics we would be going in the right direction.  I rise to support the point of view that if you want to get representative bodies elected the way to do that is to have the two elections held <Col N="1310" /> together.  That I think is the wise course to follow both from the point of view of economy and from the point of view of having representative bodies returned.  In the case of minor elections you cannot get the people to come forward and vote.  I think if the two elections were held together it would have the effect of getting more people to come and vote.  I hope the Minister will adhere to his original intention of having the two elections on the one day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CAREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming as I do from an urban district I welcome this Bill and think it is a capital idea to have the two elections held on the one day. In Midleton, the town I come from, a local election costs £90.  We also have to pay our share of the election expenses to the Cork County Council. There will be a big saving of money, therefore, by holding the two elections on the one day.  I think you are also more likely to have a large poll by having the two elections on the one day than by having them on separate days. With regard to the point made by some Deputies that confusion would be caused by holding the two elections on the one day because of the use of two ballot papers, I do not think that is likely at all.  The ballot papers will clearly indicate that one relates to the urban council election and the other to the county council election, and as far as the electors are concerned I do not think they are so dense that they cannot read them.  As regards illiterate voters, of course no difficulty will arise in their case, because the names on the ballot papers will be read out for them by the presiding officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one point which I would like to bring to the notice of the Minister, and it is this, that I think the local authorities ought to be consulted when a list is being made out of the places at which polling booths will be situated.  In the town I come from this is a source of complaint for the reason that the people in the southern portion have to go to the northern portion in order to record their votes and vice versa.  I think it would be much more desirable, in the case of people living in the southern portion of the town, that booths for them were provided in the southern end and have <Col N="1311" /> the same arrangements for people living in the northern end.  I hope that matter will receive attention.  I welcome the Bill, because it will lead to economy in the expenditure of the ratepayers' money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that I am inclined to the view expressed by Deputy Lemass and Deputy Everett as to the confusion that will arise by holding the county council and urban elections on the one day.  There are, for instance, eleven representatives for one ward in the town of Wexford, while the area that takes in the town has seven representatives on the county council.  By holding the two elections on the one day, you will have, therefore, the people called upon to elect and vote for eighteen people on the one day.  I think the Minister will admit that will create a great deal of confusion even in the minds of educated people. They will get confused when presented with two large ballot papers with a big list of candidates printed on them.  In the case I have quoted it would, I think, be reasonable to assume that there will be at least 36 candidates, that is, two for each vacancy.  I fear it will prove a colossal job for many voters to mark the two papers intelligently.  I think the Minister should reconsider the position so far as that aspect of the question is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy who has just sat down made an appeal to the Minister to have something done with regard to the situation of the polling booths.  As far as I understand, that matter is left entirely in the hands of the local returning officer, whether the secretary of the county council or the clerk of the urban authority.  I think if proper representations were made to the returning officer on this matter that he would make arrangements to suit the requirements of everyone.  That, at all events, has been my experience. So far as the Labour Party is concerned, we are going to support the Bill for the good things that are in it. We are not going to vote against its Second Reading, but on the remaining stages we will take every opportunity <Col N="1312" /> that presents itself to vote against the clause which prevents elections being held in the cities and towns where commissioners have been appointed.  I make a last appeal to the Minister to reconsider his decision with regard to holding the two elections on the one day.</P>

      <P>What I would like to see is a re-grouping of the districts forming the electrol area. That is a cause of more contention in country districts than anything else. I know electoral areas for which they return nine members.  That, to my mind, is ridiculous.  First, you will have 30 or 40 candidates for that area and, secondly, what is everybody's business is nobody's business, and the nine men elected do not know what particular portion of that area they represent, and the business of the area is not properly looked after.  I could give an instance in County Roscommon, in one particular area, where nine members have to be returned. Four were returned from one particular end of that area and the other five were scattered around with the result that the largest portion of the area had no representation at all.  I think the districts ought to be re-grouped and instead of having nine representatives elected on the one ticket, there ought to be three areas and three elections, and you will do away with the confusion of having a large amount of candidates.  The voters would know their own men and whom to vote for.  I urge upon the Minister for Local Government to try and include re-grouping of the districts with a view to making the local election areas smaller than they are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had as much experience of elections as most members of the House, and have definitely come to the conclusion that there is scarcely any country in the world which can present such an intelligent electorate as Ireland or persons more capable of appraising the relative qualities of candidates.  Unless one is particularly interested in adherents of a particular political party not having taken the precaution of learning its list of candidates there is <Col N="1313" /> very little danger of the confusion which has been mentioned, and the saving effected is considerable.  It is well known, I think, in those districts where elections took place during the winter&mdash;January&mdash;that it was an unseasonable time, and that people had not a great desire to travel in order to vote, that canvassing and all the rest of it is difficult, that every effort should be made to limit the cost of national and local institutions, and that this is one way in which we can do this. Going forward a little bit, I wonder whether it is wise to bring political considerations into the realm of local politics.  After all, anyone with experience of local bodies realises that there are very marked political differences between very good administrators, that you will find from all parties an effort in connection with local administration to do the business which is set before them, apart from political considerations and opinions altogether.  That, at any rate, has been my experience.  There were members of the old Unionist Party of whom I had experience who were good and others who were bad administrators. There were members of the old Home Rule Party excellent administrators. Some members of the Sinn Féin Party to which I belonged were excellent; there were others to whom I would certainly not give that character. There is no monopoly of keen administrative capacity in any political party, and when it comes to a question of waterworks, a sewage scheme, a housing scheme, or anything of that sort, one's political opinion does not give any particular insight as to the best method of doing that work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem is not whether local authorities were rightfully or wrongfully disbanded during the last few years.  It is to get a new system better adapted to the needs and necessities of the moment.  Take Dublin as an example. It does not require any great examination into history to disclose that the control of the City of Dublin has varied considerably within the last hundred years.  You had the Municipal Reform Act of, I think, 1839 which gave the modern Corporation of which the great Irish leader of the time became the first Lord Mayor.  It was not <Col N="1314" /> a good Act, but was a marked improvement on what had prevailed previously, and later when the Local Government Act of 1898 came along, that marked a considerable difference in the administration of the city.  Now we have an opportunity of considering what is best in the modern circumstances, and I hesitate to agree with Deputy Corish or Deputy Lemass that time has been wasted to the extent of twelve months since the report came in.  Supposing it has.  We have now to consider what has been recommended in the report. We have got to send recommendations to the draftsman, to get legislation introduced, and to deal with it here.  All those steps will take a considerable time.  Is it likely, with the best will in the world, that it is going to be done before March, 1929?  At most, what is hoped to be saved is nine months.  Are we going to divide on this measure for nine months?  If my advice were asked I would say that it ought not to be done by June.  It is not a political question.  It is a question we will be judged on by the people who give votes.  We think the Act, when introduced and considered in all its phases, will exhibit, in the course of time, infirmities which might be remedied if we had taken a little more time and given a little more consideration to its subject matter.  The question is what can we do now to deal with a new situation. Anyone who has had experience of public administration in Dublin or Cork realises how complicated it is. Deputy O'Kelly is well aware of one particular phase of the Sinn Féin programme which had to be abandoned in the light of experience.  The protest against the police rate had to be abandoned for the reason that it was discovered if the policy had been insisted upon something like twelve or thirty thousand pounds worth of valuation would escape all liability and the persons responsible for the consolidated municipal rate would be saddled with a cost of a halfpenny in the £1.  I was certainly amazed, year after year, in connection with the administration of the city, its ramifications, and so on. The only question which, I think, divides us on the merits of this measure is: can the report which has been <Col N="1315" /> made be considered and can legislation be introduced so as to allow for election to the cities of Dublin and Cork earlier than March, 1929?  Deputies have said June next year.  I do not think it is possible.  I do not think it would be wise, if it were possible.  I think it would require more consideration and ought to get it, and I hope, as a result of that longer and better consideration, that it will reflect credit not alone on this Bill but on the City of Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter which I consider of sufficient importance to bring under the notice of the Minister, and that is the extraordinary number of eligible voters who have been omitted from the voters' lists in recent years.  I understand the rate collectors are responsible for making out these lists, and I suggest that the Minister ought to take steps to bring the matter under the notice of the county councils, or the rate collectors, so that it will not occur in future.  Innumerable people with large property and eligible in every way are left off.  I would be sorry to suggest deliberately left off. There is one Party that takes more interest in elections than others, and this is a matter of very great importance. These large rate payers have had no opportunity of voting at several elections in succession.  I certainly stress the point as very important, and of not being of particular advantage to any Party, as it interests all.</P>

      <P>So far as the statement made by the President with reference to the report is concerned, I find myself in entire agreement with him. It is not a matter upon which the House should be divided.  But I am at a loss to know why it is that the case of Cork should await the publication of the report of the Greater Dublin Commission. I do not want to express an opinion one way or the other as to the desirability or undesirability of the appointment of Commissioners in the case of Cork and Dublin, but whatever may be said for Dublin, I do know there was no case of corruption proved against the Cork Corporation.  At the same time, I must say that perhaps in Cork we were lucky in regard to the <Col N="1316" /> Commissioner.  The Commissioner has done some very useful work.  In connection with the whole business, if we are to be perfectly frank and honest with ourselves, we must admit that throughout the whole administration in this country there was a certain amount of corruption. That cannot be denied, unless we want to blind ourselves absolutely to facts.  It is perhaps a habit of mind we have got into for many years to assume that we are all angels and that our administrators have been archangels, particularly those who are anxious to get into public life.  The Cork Corporation undoubtedly did make mistakes, but I suppose all human institutions make mistakes.  We are told that to err is human.</P>
      <P>I submit that there is a phase of this question which possibly has not struck many Deputies; that there is a lack of public and civic spirit growing up as a result of the continuation of the system of Commissioners.  Whatever may occur in connection with the Greater Dublin Report, that is a phase of the question which I am sure should appeal to Ministers.  There is no doubt, as I said, that perhaps we have been lucky in the Commissioner.  We have some little experience in Cork of certain Commissioners who were equal to any Czar of Russia that I ever heard of. But so far as the present Commissioner of Cork Borough is concerned, I think he has given a certain amount of satisfaction. While wishing for the return of an elected representative body modelled on the lines somewhat of the old Corporation, I hope that careful inquiry will be made as to reforms effected and other matters, and also to be sure that there is a general demand on the part of the people for the return of this old institution.</P>

      <P>From my experience of elections, I have no hesitation in saying that we are much more likely to get the electorate to record their views on the different candidates and proposals put before them in June than in January. Therefore, I plump for June.  Something has been said about the delay that has arisen in giving legislative effect to the recommendations of the Greater Dublin Commission.  As one who has been in the Dáil for some four or five years, I have nothing to say against the Government for delaying legislation, but I have a great many accusations to make against them for rushing legislation.  Personally, I am extremely glad that this important matter has been left over, and that legislation in connection with it has not been rushed, as it has been in connection with other matters.</P>
      <P>A further advantage from the delay is that we will have the views of the Deputies who now form the Opposition. If this measure had been introduced earlier, we would not have had the advantage of those views.  I think it is desirable in local, as in Parliamentary elections, that every encouragement should be given to electors to record their votes.  There has been too much apathy amongst all parties in the past, and in connection with local elections I know of no factor that is more likely to increase that apathy than removing from voters the obligation to pay rates. I do not know of any greater incentive to electors to vote than the fact that they are personally responsible for the payment of the rates.  They will have an interest in seeing where the money is expended, and in those who will have the spending of that money.  If we want to promote a real civic spirit in city and urban areas, the responsibility for paying the rates ought to be on the individual householder.</P>

Without having an opportunity of estimating in full what the saving will be, and of running through the various divisions to get an idea of the chance of confusion, I find it difficult to make up my mind as to whether the confusion should be risked for the sake of the economy which is proposed to be effected by it. However, on that matter, it is possible that on the Committee Stage we may be able to get further information, and may be able to make up our minds definitely about that.</P>
      <P>The other matter is a more serious one from our point of view.  We all know, when there is a rush of work and a number of things going on, each contending with the other for precedence, that, unless pressure is put on, the legislation which has been indicated by the President with reference to Greater Dublin might be unnecessarily delayed.  We are anxious to see Dublin governed once more by its own citizens, and Cork once more governed by its own citizens, and unless we get some assurance that the time is going to be shortened, we will be compelled to oppose this Bill on the Second Reading. There are more than six months from now until June.  I expect this measure has already received consideration by the Executive Council, and that, perhaps, the heads of the Bill which it is intended to introduce have been sent to the draftsman already.</P>

The general pressure of public work prevents due consideration in detail of them here. and what we are anxious about is this: that the Bill should be brought in as soon as possible.  We think three months from now should be sufficient time to get the heads of the Bill presented, and get the Bill prepared.</P>

      <P>The report was furnished over twelve months ago, and now if we are to wait until March, 1929, it is going to lie with the Minister, or wherever it is, in cold storage for another four or five months.  If we want it brought out and settled we have to put pressure of some kind, and we believe that another three months &mdash;say, until March&mdash;would be quite sufficient time to get that Bill considered by the Executive Council. Another month would give time enough to have it prepared, and then we would have a month or so in which the Bill could be properly discussed in this House.  So that we think that it would be possible if the Executive Council get a move on to have the Bill in time for the June election, and that the part that seems to penalise the people of Cork and Dublin and other places, could be omitted.  We would like to know from the Minister for Local Government, or from the President of the Executive Council, whether there is any chance of getting this brought forward by June?</P>

      <P>I do not see the slightest possible chance.  The Executive Council has not yet considered the Minister's recommendations on the report. But apart altogether from that, even if the Executive Council had so considered it, and agreed on the heads of the Bill for the draftsman, I see very little possibility of getting the Bill from the draftsman at any earlier period than three months from the date on which he is presented with the Bill. It must be remembered that the springtime of each year entails much more work on the draftsman than any other time.  The Finance Bill and other Bills that have to be considered take up a considerable amount of time and I do not see any likelihood whatever of this Bill coming from the draftsman within four or five months from now.  I <Col N="1320" /> hesitate to think that the Bill will come from the draftsman within six months even with the best will in the world.</P>

      <P>I am interested in the civic rights of the people of Cork, being a member of the Cork County Board of Public Assistance.  On that Board we have ten representatives from the Cork County Council.  The Cork Corporation are entitled to six.  Commissioner Monahan represents the six from the Corporation and has only one vote.  I do not think it is fair on a board like that, where the interests of the rural population are represented in such numbers that the citizens whose interests come into direct conflict with them should be deprived practically of representation.  I do not think it is fair or just that the citizens should be deprived of their proper representation.  On one occasion, recently, Commissioner Monahan, who is also in charge of the Cork Mental Hospital, threatened the County Council with a writ for the non-payment of money which should be paid to the Mental Hospital.  That money amounted to £5,000 but it was already paid and the Commissioner, afterwards, admitted that he had overlooked the payment. Does the Executive Council think that a Commissioner who overlooked the payment of £5,000 and threatened the County Council with a writ, is a better person than direct representatives elected by the people of Cork?</P>

      <P>I want to protest most strongly against the elections being arranged for June.  I do not think the constituency I represent is alone in the view that I present on its behalf.  It is most important, in my opinion, that, as Deputy Good says, the people should be got to vote.  In the constituency I come from, at the last June election, in the Achill district, there were 1,300 migratory labourers away in Scotland and England.  In the Ballyhaunis district and in other places a similar state of things obtained.  The holding of elections in June would disfranchise a <Col N="1321" /> number of voters.  There are other constituencies, how many I know not, that would suffer in like manner from a June election.  This is so important I could not help protesting in the strongest manner against the arrangement. I consider it is too serious to let pass without protest.  I hope this arrangement will not be final, and, in fact, I hope it will not take place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFrench1927" hpid="Mr. FRENCH Mr. FRENCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FRENCH</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to the Bill in so far as it makes for the postponement of the elections of the dissolved bodies.  The fact that certain bodies have been dissolved has been interpreted by some people as a definite accusation against the character of these bodies and their members collectively and individually.  To my mind, the Minister for Local Government is postponing unnecessarily the calling together of those bodies, or giving the people an opportunity for electing their own representatives.  I personally express disappointment that there is not, through the Bill, a definite change which I think the people of the country were looking forward to when anticipating the introduction of the Bill.</P>
      <P>There is an idea amongst a considerable number of people that the existing bodies, as they are at the moment, are too large, and that if the membership were reduced it would tend towards greater efficiency.  I am one of those who believe that.  I would frankly state it in formulating a Bill affecting the future administration in the Borough of Cork, and I would advocate a reduction of the number from 56 to somewhere between 16 and 20.  I think that would tend to more efficiency, and I believe that what could be said of the City of Cork could be said of almost every county council and urban council throughout the country.  I am rather disappointed that such an improvement was not suggested by the Minister in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to be led into a controversy, for instance, against the present Commissioner in Cork.  Like Deputy Anthony, I am not going to deny the fact that he has done a certain amount of good.  But I think Deputy Anthony might also have suggested that there was nothing he performed that could not be performed equally <Col N="1322" /> well if the members of the Borough Council of Cork were allowed to remain in office.  The Minister for Local Government has in his office a statement of the defence made by the County Borough of Cork. I am prepared to stand by that defence, and I am prepared to make that defence before any Deputy here.  I am prepared to make it before any three Deputies on the opposite benches, and I am prepared to say and to prove that there was no case established at the inquiry in Cork against the integrity and honour of any member of the Cork Borough Council.  I am prepared to stand on that.  The matter is old now, but the fact that a body has been dissolved allows an individual to stand up and say that the bodies that were dissolved wantonly neglected their duties or refused to do their duties.  There was no such charge proved against them.  It was easy to set going the forces which were behind the dissolution of the Cork Corporation, but since these forces are now absent there is no need of further reference to them.</P>
    <P>I want to stress the point that Deputy Corry has made.  At the present moment the South County Board of Public Assistance is composed of ten members of the Cork County Council. The Borough Council of Cork, that is, the Cork citizens, are entitled to five representatives on that Board.  Commissioner Monahan represents the Borough Council.  He has one vote there.  I think I am right in stating that he, himself, publicly resented the position he was left in, when he was voting for the whole contribution from the City of Cork to the whole scheme of the South County Board of Health, and he was left at the mercy of the ten members of the County Council.</P>

      <P>The Minister suggests that the Cork Mental Hospital Committee of Management will be reformed after the June elections.  Will the same apply on the Board of Management and will the city be again represented by an individual, and will the individual have only one vote?  I am not really questioning the matter of votes.  It is a matter of <Col N="1323" /> opinion.  I am one of those who believe that really five Corkmen can express the needs of this institution better than one individual could express them.  I am not saying this now in any personal sense.  I believe that as regards the old Poor Law system inasmuch as it referred to the workhouses, the improvement, at any rate in the Cork Union, justifies the change from the old to the new.  Making that definitely clear, I would suggest to the Minister to give us some argument, for instance, as to whether Cork stands on a par with Dublin.  I am admitting that I am prepared to agree to a change as from the old to the new, but I cannot see how Cork is on a par with Dublin.  The President said it was impossible to bring in legislation for Greater Dublin in time for the June elections, but if there is an excuse in the case of Dublin there is no excuse in the case of Cork. There is no suggestion for a Greater Cork.  All we want is to have Cork as good as it was in 1922.</P>

I say that if there is an argument for postponing the elections in Dublin, there certainly is no argument in the case of Cork.  I do not want to be put in the position of admitting a comparison between the old body and the affairs as administered at the moment.  It has been suggested by Deputy Anthony that everybody must remember there was corruption in public life in Ireland.  I must say that I found perhaps less corruption amongst public representatives than I found in my ordinary experience in commercial business.  Public representatives have not been corrupt, speaking generally.  To my mind, there was less corruption in public life than in ordinary commercial business.  That is my view about this matter of corruption in public life.  I am certainly going to admit that things happened that might better not have happened.  But they happened far less in public bodies than they did in ordinary business.  On that I am prepared to stand.</P>

      <P>I mean ordinary commercial enterprise.  I must certainly say that the people of Cork must be assumed to be as good judges of honesty as the people that Deputy Good represents.  The honesty of a people is reflected in their public representatives. And the sooner Deputy Good gets that fact into his head the better.  No man can tell me that commercial life is one hundred per cent. honest and that the administration of public affairs, because it happens to be somewhat democratic in Ireland, thank God, is going to be the hall mark, the absolute hall mark of dishonesty and corruption.  Let us have a definite case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FRENCH</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be drawn into that, but I can turn round and tell the Deputy that the rates have been increased in Cork, so that if you had a reduction in Dublin you had them increased elsewhere.  I would like to know from the Minister when will the Deputies of this House have an opportunity of getting the information that would be of use in this matter?  Would it be infra dig, would it be asking too much, would it be asking for something that we are not entitled to get if we were to ask if he would give us some idea of the intention of the Executive in this matter?  I suggest that, as one who definitely believes that every Deputy is interested in the future of local government in Ireland, and I believe that the measure to be brought in should be a Bill framed on the advice of the whole House rather than a measure fostered by one party.  You have here the position that we want to get down to something solid and definite in local administration, and whatever criticism, at any rate, will come from these benches will be offered more in the spirit of advice than in a party spirit.  If it could be possible to get this Bill through without division no one would be more pleased than I.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HANLON</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to say that I am in entire agreement with the views of Deputy Lemass and Deputy Corish as to the confusion that is bound to occur by having two sets of ballot papers and two different presiding officers at the polling booths.  Confusion is bound to result from the holding of the county council and urban council elections in the same room, using different coloured ballot papers.  It has been pointed out that in many cases there would be twenty or thirty candidates and although we may be very highly educated in the matter of elections as, no doubt, we are&mdash;although perhaps the President himself on one occasion had some difficulties over an election&mdash;the average elector will find this proposed method very confusing.  As regards the President, I think on one memorable occasion he had difficulty with his ballot paper.  Under this proposal the elector would be getting not one but two ballot papers.  In the case of the President he had only one ballot paper and he had only one election to deal with and yet he did not fill the paper up properly. I think the people in the urban districts if they are handed two ballot papers with ten or fifteen names on each will hardly be likely to do their duty in marking them correctly and we will not have good councils as a result of the confusion at the elections.</P>
      <P>Anyone can understand the position at the polling booths where possibly there are fifteen or twenty candidates on each paper and one can realise the state of mind of the elector when one considers the confusion that arises out of one ballot paper alone not to mention two.  Before he finally decides on this matter, if there is no very serious objection to it I suggest the Minister should consider amending the Bill so that the elections should not be held on the same day and in the same booth, I refer to the urban elections and the county council elections.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. BOLAND Mr. BOLAND">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BOLAND</NameTxt>
      <P>I also object to the delay in the elections for Dublin.  I do not see what further advantage Deputy Good's people have to gain by disfranchising the citizens.  The citizens of Dublin well know, and I am sure the President knows it better than anyone here in the House, that for many years a great tug was going on between the Chamber of Commerce and the Dublin Corporation.  It was a most extraordinary thing to see that the people who stood for the citizens' rights for many years gave in when they got control themselves.  That was a most extraordinary position. The Commissioners have done very drastic things since they came into power.  The principal object, to my mind, for which they were put there was to reduce the wages of the workers. They have got on fairly well in that line, I must say.  The last reduction in the wages of the workers was followed a fortnight or three weeks later by an increase of £200 per annum for each of the three Commissioners. That is one point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A short time ago a lease was given to the Tramways Company&mdash;I suppose Deputy Good and his friends are interested in that&mdash;for another forty years. The tendency in the old Corporation was that at some day or another a party would get into control which would put the Tramway Company in its place.  They were fighting, as the President knows, for the lighting of the city, and there was a constant pull between the Chamber of Commerce, Deputy Good's people, and the people's representatives to prevent the lighting of the city falling into the citizens' hands.  Luckily, although we had not our full freedom, we did not hand it to the Chamber of Commerce, and it remained in the citizens' hands. I do not know what further schemes may be on foot to delay the elections for another twelve months.  When the time comes I suppose we will be told there is another fait accompli, and we can do nothing more about it.  When the time does come we are going to see that Deputy Good and the people he <Col N="1327" /> represents will get their right share of representation and no more.</P>

      <P>The Dublin citizens will also know, the President included, that the Corporation of Dublin, when the people were properly represented about 1898, took over a legacy from Deputy Good's people, the Unionist element that had run this city, and that gave it the name of dear, dirty Dublin.  When they tried to extend the boundaries they got the bankrupt townships of Clontarf and Drumcondra. They put down new drains, and they improved the city in every way, and then they got closed down.</P>

      <P>It is a matter that has to be inquired into.  We would like to know what game is on foot.  Is it simply the difficulty of carrying through the elections, or is there something else like a tramway lease put in the way?  I believe that that lease would not have fallen in for another seven years.  Perhaps I am not right, but why did they not wait until the new body was elected before the lease was given to the Tramways Company?  I think those matters are relevant to what is under discussion. Why should the nominees of the Government have given away a lease of the streets of Dublin to the Tramways Company which has always been inimical to the interests of the citizens? A big point has been gained by starting labour on the down grade.  You would think they would have more decency than to increase their own salaries by £200 a few weeks later.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. COBURN Mr. COBURN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COBURN</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in agreement with many of the provisions in this Bill, especially as regards the holding of the elections on the one day and the postponement of the urban elections from January until June.  That has been done at the express wish of many of the urban centres, because in making their estimates they were under the impression that the elections would not be held until June and therefore they failed to make any provision for the holding of an election in January.  As regards the <Col N="1328" /> suspension or dissolution of the Corporations of Dublin and Cork I wish to state that perhaps if those bodies had looked after the business affairs of their respective cities a little better and left out the political side, these Corporations would probably be still in existence.</P>
      <P>I wish to make my position clear.  I am not an advocate of filching all powers from the people.  I am strengthened in that opinion by what prevails in England, and after all, England did not become great by doing things wrong. At the present time, she is not willing to take away any powers that are conferred upon, or that the people enjoy. Consequently I think that the Government should lose no time in providing that the people of Dublin and Cork see to it that if these powers are restored they will look after the interests and safeguard the interests of the ratepayers who reside in those cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly agree with holding both the urban and county council elections on the one day, and I do not think that confusion will exist to the extent which we are led to believe by the statements of some Deputies.  It is about time that we in Ireland, considering the amount of money spent annually on education, should be able to have, at least, sufficient education to mark a few ballot papers on the same day.  For that reason I am more or less in agreement with the provisions of the Bill and I hope that in the near future the rights that have been taken away from the citizens of Dublin and Cork will be restored. If you take away rights from the people they will, perhaps, ultimately cease to take any interest in local or national affairs.  A great deal has been said for the dissolution of the Dublin Corporation but I would like to suggest to the people who are always too ready to magnify the faults, or rather the supposed faults, of that corporation to cast their eyes a little northwards and magnify in the same way the faults committed by the Belfast Corporation. In justice to the Dublin Corporation I think it should be said that they have carried on the affairs of the city, at least equally as efficiently as their neighbours up North.  I will support the Bill, especially as the elections will be held on the same day, thereby, as <Col N="1329" /> the Minister for Local Government has said, effecting a considerable saving to the ratepayers in urban centres.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the confusion that may arise by holding both the urban and county council elections on the same day, I should say that the matter was very carefully gone into before I included it in the Bill, and I am quite clear that a little more consideration of the matter would show that confusion is not likely to be as great as has been suggested, if, indeed, there is likely to be any great confusion at all.  There was a time, as Deputy O'Hanlon stated, when district councillors and urban councillors were elected on the same day.  The proposal here involves that, so far as urban people are concerned, they will have the urban councils to vote for and in the urban districts, whilst voting for the county councils on the one day they will also vote for their urban representatives. It is not, I submit, placing too great a strain on townsmen to ask them when voting for the county councils also to vote for their town representatives. The point has been urged that that system provides great difficulty for the illiterate section of the population. I do not think that we ought to cut out a thing that is a clear economy of money and of time, simply to cater for a section of our population which, considering, as a Deputy has said, the amount of money spent on education, we ought to expect would be very rapidly passing.  If we did not take them into consideration, it might be worth while to hand over the money saved to the Minister for Education to see what he could do for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On further consideration everyone, I hope, will agree that the most suitable arrangement is to have elections on the one day.  The point has been raised about the large number of candidates creating some confusion.  We have already powers by which county electoral areas can be regrouped, if there is a case made for doing so, and the same applies to urban districts.  In Section 14, there are powers given to the county councils for the convenience of voters to make schemes for polling booths.  I think we have already powers with regard to the other point. <Col N="1330" /> As to the question raised by Deputy Shaw about voters not being on the list who ought to be on it, he referred to some people who were not able to vote at several consecutive elections.  There is responsibility on the proper officials for having the register correctly made out, and very drastic steps have been taken by the Department from time to time to see that that duty is properly carried out.  It is, I am convinced, a very difficult duty and, while the Department will do everything on its side to see that the register is true and accurate and as perfect as possible, there is responsibility on the individual voter, for whom arrangements are made yearly to inspect the register at suitable places, to see that his name is included and if not to make his claim. That particularly refers to people who complain that they have been off the register for a long time.  There will be as good a register as possible, and nothing will be left undone to see that slackness is not tolerated.  Several persons have, as a matter of fact, been severely taken up departmentally because they failed in their duty on the matter, but we do ask for some of that civic spirit, about which Deputy Anthony spoke, particularly on the part of those who have complaints to make that they are not on the register. Deputy Kilroy raised a question about migratory labourers.  So far as the county council elections are concerned, we simply changed the date from the beginning to the end of June, and the month of June is practically left unchanged. It may be worth taking notice of that point, but these labourers have suffered under the same difficulty for years past.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>That would give ground for complaint, undoubtedly, but if you put back the elections earlier than the 20th June you get into difficulties with regard to the register. As regards the position of Dublin and Cork, I did not anticipate that I would leave Deputy Lemass under the impression that the existence of the Greater <Col N="1331" /> Dublin Commission's report was the complete explanation of our proposition not to have the Dublin elections before June next.  I must say that if there had been time to complete the examination of that report in time to have legislation introduced the elections in Dublin would take place in June.  I do not know that the question as to the dissolution of the Dublin and Cork Corporations really arises on this matter. So far as I am concerned, steps were taken to dissolve them, and they were dissolved, and legislation was introduced which enabled those Corporations to be run by Commissioners up to, but not later than 31st March, 1929.  I am prepared to leave the matter at that for the purpose of getting the present legislative proposals discussed on their merits.  In my opinion, you cannot hope to get the Greater Dublin Commission report sufficiently examined and legislation introduced and dealt with in this Dáil sooner than the beginning of 1929. The best contribution that anyone can make to the proper solution of the problem of Dublin and Cork is to realise the fact that underlying the whole question of the government of these cities is a big financial problem and a big engineering problem.  As a matter of fact, I have a small committee thoroughly investigating the whole financial aspect of the Greater Dublin report, so that there will be nothing left unsurveyed when we come to put down definite proposals, and nothing of financial importance will be left unprovided for.  At the same time I have an engineering committee looking into the engineering and general physical side of the Greater Dublin report.  Nothing will be left unsurveyed in that direction either.</P>

      <P>I cannot say. All I can say is that I hope to urge on the work of examination in such a way that I could put a case before the Executive Council, let them take their decision on it, then let it go to the draftsman and give him fair time to <Col N="1332" /> see that in framing his legislation everything is properly covered, and then give this House sufficient time to consider the matter thoroughly.  I hope to be able to do that, and allow the election on the new basis not later than the 31st March, 1929.  I am stretching my hopes when I say that, because the problem is a big and intricate one.  I quite appreciate the value of pressure, but pressure that would obscure my judgment, or make me rush others into a consideration of important matters in a way that would not be fair having regard to the importance of the subject they have to consider, we ought to avoid, because it would not do any good.</P>
      <P>Deputy French stated that proposals for the governing of Dublin and Cork should be considered in a non-party way.  As to the question of the new arrangements for the government of our city, I certainly can say that as far as I am concerned I am facing it in a non-party way, and I do not know anyone with whom I am in touch who does not look on it as an important and detached problem.  Whoever can contribute towards an effective solution of these problems can have all the credit and acknowledgement to which they are entitled.  Some Deputies consider that because a body is dissolved there is a suspicion of corruption and all that implies. I think the President stated on a particular occasion that he came across very little corruption in public life, either in the Dublin Corporation or elsewhere.  If steps were taken to dissolve Cork and Dublin Corporations it was in the interests of better organisation of civic government, and better efficiency and economy.  I do not want to raise the question as to whether or not that has been accomplished, because we ought, I think, put that behind us and look at the provisions of this measure to see if it provides the way in which we can better order our local government elections in future, and in the case of Dublin and Cork face the question as to whether there are not matters so intricate and important as to warrant the spending of a little extra time in their consideration.  That really is the point that has to be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cassidy asked why elections <Col N="1333" /> for certain rural councils in Dublin were not allowed to take place.  We considered the whole question of County Dublin.  The town of Balbriggan lay outside the sphere likely to be involved in any Greater Dublin boundary, and the Bill provides for the election of the town council in Balbriggan next year. So far as the other rural councils are concerned, not only are they to some extent involved in the Greater Dublin area, but there is also the point that the Poor Law Commission's report has made certain recommendations.  County Dublin is the only place where rural district councils exist, and as a result of the consideration of the Greater Dublin report and the Poor Law Commission's report, it may not be necessary to continue the rural councils in Dublin, so that there is little justification for having an election for these next year when they may not be required to exist for more than two years.  In the consideration of this Bill both on Second Reading and on the Committee Stage I would ask that we simply face the question as to how we can best order local government elections through the country generally, and in the case of Dublin and Cork how we can best make a contribution towards seeing that the future government and administration of these two important cities will be placed on the most effective and efficient basis, giving satisfaction not only to the citizens of these cities but to the country generally.</P>

      <P>If the city is suffering any disability with regard to representation on the South Cork Board of Health or the Mental Hospital Committee, if the Deputy has any representation to make in the matter I will see to what extent there is power at the present moment to give representation on these bodies other than the Commissioner.  That is a matter that I think can best be dealt with if referred to me as a separate case.  As to the Cork Commissioner being continued until such time as we take decisions with regard to Dublin, the Deputy has made a suggestion that implies that a definite and perhaps big problem is involved there, and I think he is aware that there are a number of very prominent citizens in Cork who, I think, were going to sponsor a Bill dealing with the government of the city at one time.  I do not know why they left it aside, whether they were influenced by the fact that the Greater Dublin Commission had reported and wanted to see what was coming out of the consideration of matters in connection with Dublin.  We are certainly going to come up against the consideration of principles and matters of organisation which would be of use perhaps when fully considered before the question of Cork is dealt with. Cork will perhaps not suffer particularly in waiting for an additional twelve months before decisions along these lines are taken.  If the Deputy <Col N="1335" /> suggests now that the Cork Corporation ought to be elected in June, that would be simply rushing the matter, and he could not tell whether he would be sorry for it or not.  Really nothing can be lost by postponing the matter for an additional twelve months, particularly when by doing so there will be, I hope, the benefit from having the whole problem of Dublin considered. This is only 1927, and one does not know what might happen in Cork when it starts growing.</P>

      <P>I will not go so far as that, but I will say frankly that anybody who has had experience of, for instance, the South County Board of Public Assistance must recognise the great change for the better that has been made within the area under its control.  It is undoubtedly a credit, and credit is due in a small way to the members of the original Board of Public Assistance.  But I contend that the Commissioner, although he is absolutely competent and a man of merit, has not intelligence equal to the intelligence of five individuals, who would possibly be able to give advice equally as good as his.  The city is suffering from the absence of four individuals, who should be working and serving it economically under the scheme.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £150,000 chun íoctha an mhuirir a thiocfidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch 31adh Márta, 1928, chun síntiúisí chun fóirithint ar dhíomhaointeas agus ar ghátar.</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £150,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1928, for contributions towards the relief of unemployment and distress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a fact that not as many applications have been received this year from local authorities for grants for the relief of distress as we have had in recent years.  That, I think, may be attributed in part to the fact that there was no money available for such grants in the Estimates.  However, certain applications have been coming in, and I am sure that we will have a considerable number of further schemes submitted to us within a very short time.  In most years since the setting up of the Saorstát sums have been allocated for such grants as are now proposed.  In the year 1922-23 the sum actually expended was <Col N="1339" /> £339,000 odd; in 1923-4 there was none; in 1924-5 there was £380,000 odd; 1925-6, £336,000 odd, and last year there was £30,000 odd.  In each of these years greater sums were voted, but the figures that I have given represent the amounts actually expended. In previous years, a certain part of the relief grant was expended on road work.  It is not intended on this occasion to expend money on road work, except in a district where no other useful work can be found, and where there is a great deal of unemployment, but as far as possible an attempt will be made to spend the money on other schemes, such as the preparation of sites on which building might afterwards take place, and water or sewerage schemes.</P>
    <P>There is just one type of road on which money could be expended, and that is the bog road.  In previous years&mdash;for instance, 1924-5 and 1925-6 &mdash;a good deal of money was very usefully expended in the making of these bog roads, and a great deal of relief was given in districts where there was considerable distress and a very great need of employment.  But apart from that particular type of road, the endeavour will be to do other works, because, as has already been explained, a substantial sum of money is available from the Road Fund, and so far as road work is concerned, the endeavour will be to expedite the expending of the money available in that way.</P>
    <P>The proposals of local authorities will be considered by the Department of Local Government and recommendations will be made to the Department of Finance.  Other proposals may come through the Land Commission which would be responsible for such things as bog roads, or from the Department of Fisheries which might undertake small works to assist navigation&mdash;approaches to piers, work on piers or any small marine work that could be carried out. It has happened on several occasions that when an attempt was made to expend the whole sum of money available in the winter season, from say the beginning of December to the end of March, sometimes schemes have had to be undertaken which involved a <Col N="1340" /> further vote in the next financial year. It is difficult to expend the exact sum that may be laid down, and have it expeditiously expended.  We will try as far as possible to have this sum expended in the financial year, and on the other hand not to undertake work which would either have to be left unfinished or which would involve the provision of substantial sums in the coming year. We do not want to commit ourselves to that.  This year, as in previous years, we will endeavour to have the local authorities supply part of the money for any works carried out.  Our endeavour always has been to have the money made available by way of a grant supplemented out of the funds of the local authorities.  We have sometimes said to local authorities, &ldquo;You are contemplating a proposed drainage scheme and we will give you 25 per cent. of that.&rdquo;  As far as we could we have generally tried to decline to sanction works carried out solely out of the grant.  We have tried to get the local authorities to put some of their own moneys into them so that the amount of the grant made available might be stretched.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, impossible to provide by means of this grant for every sort of unemployment.  There are large numbers of people unemployed who cannot be reached by any form of public works. They are not suitable themselves for taking part in public works.  On the other hand the experience is that where money can be put into circulation in a district by means of public works, even those who cannot be employed and who do not benefit directly, do get opportunities themselves of some employment arising out of the expenditure of money and in that way distress, generally speaking, is relieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that in my opinion the sum mentioned by the Minister for Finance is hopelessly inadequate.  There is no doubt, to my mind at least, that there is as much distress now as there was at any time from 1923 onwards.  To think that you are going to give relief that is going to be of any use with a sum of £150,000 from State funds, is to think something that is not right.  The Minister implied in his speech that because <Col N="1341" /> he had not received as many applications from local authorities, therefore, it followed there was not as much distress this year as in previous years. I have no doubt now when the local authorities get to know that the Government are going to provide a sum of money, the Minister for Finance will have more applications this year than in previous years.  I wonder if the Minister, in making that statement, had in mind any application that had been made to the Land Commission for relief schemes.  This sum of £150,000 gives an average of £6,000 per county. If we take it that there are, say, only 60,000 people unemployed, and I am sure the number is at least that, the sum mentioned by the Minister works out at less than £3 for each person unemployed, and that is expected to carry them over the winter.  The Minister, of course, made the statement that the local authorities will be expected to put up some money themselves.  The local authorities, particularly in the areas where distress is greatest, are not in a position to put up money themselves and the Minister ought to keep that in mind.  No member of the House, other than a member of the Executive Council, can move to have the Vote increased, but I would ask the Minister to face up to the fact that there is as much distress this year as in any of the years from 1923 up to the present.  I think that the Government ought to make as much provision for the relief of distress this year as they did in previous years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose we will be told that there is a sum of one and a half million pounds available for roads.  In that connection I would like to say that a considerable sum of that money has been ear-marked for certain classes of work which cannot be carried out in the winter months, such as tar-spraying and tar-painting.  Work of that kind cannot be done on roads in the winter months, and, therefore, a considerable portion of that money will be held up until the summer and to that extent it is useless.  I cannot understand how the Government arrived at this figure of £150,000 or why they think it is adequate. I must only come to the conclusion that they are not aware of the <Col N="1342" /> actual position of the unemployed in the country because if they were they would certainly realise that that sum would not provide the necessary relief. From what I have heard of the conditions in Dublin city and county and in Cork city I believe that the whole of this sum of £150,000 could be given to these two counties and cities, and that it would not be sufficient to give relief to all those in need of it, not to talk of the rest of the country.  Certainly an average of £6,000 per county is not going to give the relief that is necessary, and I hope the House will ask the Minister to increase the grant.</P>

      <P>With a great deal of what Deputy Morrissey said I agree, but there was one fallacy that he gave utterance to.  He said that the local authorities in many cases could not afford to undertake work themselves. Is it not exactly the same with the Government? There is no great bottomless purse into which the Minister for Finance can put his hand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>What I meant to convey was that many of the local authorities had exhausted their borrowing powers, and that, therefore, they are not in a position to borrow money even if they were inclined to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I observe that Deputy Morrissey did not exactly say that.  Of course the Government have not exhausted their borrowing powers, but they cannot go on borrowing indefinitely. Eventually the interest on the loan will come out of the pockets of the ratepayers and the taxpayers; in other words the ordinary citizens of this country, and that is why more money may not be made available, though I entirely agree with Deputy Morrissey as to the great distress that does exist. I hope more money will be made available, and that this is but a first instalment. Deputy Morrissey will remember, I think, that in 1924 we had the supplementary estimates for the relief of distress.  If this money is all expended before or soon after Christmas, I hope the Minister will not hesitate in the spring to bring forward another estimate.  I was not clear from the Minister's statement if this money will be made available for the <Col N="1343" /> purpose of providing water supplies for towns which have not got water supplies at present.  There are one or two schemes in Balbriggan and Skerries, for example.  The local council provided their schemes, but owing to the fact that the area of charge is wide and covers the rural area, in which the people are not interested in those schemes, they have not been able to carry them out.  If a certain amount of help were given, not the whole cost of the scheme&mdash;a little bit of sugar helps the dose down&mdash;the fact that a free grant was obtained from the Government might persuade both the guardians and the other authorities to supply the remainder by loan.  The same applies to the provision of drainage and sanitation for dwelling houses. There is a scheme of that character badly needed in Swords, and if this money were available it would be useful.</P>
      <P>There is another suggestion which might trench on the borders of order, but I hope you, sir, will be generous.  I understand within the next six weeks a large number of men, amounting to more than 1,000, are to be discharged from the National Army.  They will come on the labour market at a bad time when it is already flooded.  We are not so generous to our soldiers as other armies.  In the British Army a man going to be discharged receives a month's leave with full pay and ration allowance to enable him to look for a job.  I suggest if there is any delay in having schemes put forward by local authorities, some of this money might be placed at the disposal of the Minister for Finance to enable him to give leave to men going to be discharged and to give them a month to find a job. It is hopeless to find a job from a place like the Curragh or Finner Camp.  A job is only found by a man who goes to look for it, and he has to look very hard at present.  We ought to treat our soldiers with a little more generosity than we do.  I believe if some of the money were made available it would relieve the hardship likely to be caused by excessive discharges at this period of the year.</P>

      <P>I agree with <Col N="1344" /> Deputy Morrissey that the sum is not adequate.  I know a bigger sum could be supplied.  I am not going into that point now, but I am going into its administration. I believe it will be administered through the county councils. Are the engineers of the county councils to have any independence in this? Are we going to have the system of political graft that we had for the past three or four years when the local county councillor of the area said who shall and shall not be employed, the guiding principle being what way a person voted or was going to vote? Leaving out the question of the National Army altogether, there are men with large families of from seven to ten, and in my own area, in work on the roads, these men have been disregarded and single men put on who had no connection with any army simply because a local councillor has power to say to the surveyor or engineer that they shall go on and no one else.  If we have any humanity, and if we are not out for a system of political graft, the guiding principle in the administration of this grant should be the most necessitous cases.</P>

      <P>As a member of the Westmeath County Council, and one who has a considerable amount to do with the road grants, I beg to say that they have passed a resolution that married men with families get first preference for employment on the roads, and that single men with dependents get second preference.  If there is any fault to be found the matter ought to be brought before the county council. I agree, to a certain extent, that it has not been carried out as strictly as it should be.  I have given innumerable recommendations to people for employment on the roads, and I challenge any man in Westmeath to say that I ever asked his political opinion, or whom he voted for.  This is a subject on which I could say a good deal, because I have been challenged repeatedly with the very opposite side of the story, that the persons employed are put on by gangers who have certain other political opinions, and I believe that on the balance they have had far more employment than those who support the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  That is <Col N="1345" /> a matter I intended to raise at the last meeting of the county councils, but I had to be here and could not do it.  I am in agreement that the poorer the man is and the larger his family, the more the preference that should be given to him.  I hope to be able to attend the next meeting and ask why that rule has not been more strictly carried out.</P>
      <P>I would like to say a few words in connection with the grant that has been given.  I agree that the amount may be all right for a first instalment, but from my knowledge of the unemployment that exists it will not go very far towards the provision of employment even for the limited number who may get work.  At present, on the roads in Westmeath, most of the men are only working one week in the month in the rural areas; particularly owing to the fact that farmers are in as bad a position as labourers, there is no employment on the land.  In the labourers' cottages all those men are unemployed. I suggested the other day that, as being the Chairman of the Board of Health, I would find myself in a difficult position during the winter because the sum available will not be able to prevent starvation in that county.  Unless we are able to do something in connection with obtaining an advance we cannot put even 5/- a week into a house which has nothing going into it.</P>
      <P>I intended to mention a point on Deputy Redmond's motion connected with this.  £1,300,000 was set aside for the building of ex-soldiers' houses.  I am not in a position to say how much of that was spent, but I am in a position to say that 8 houses were passed for Athlone.  An inspector was sent there six months ago to look after the sites. He went and nothing since was heard about it.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister to consider the advisability of allocating portion of this money for a scheme of reafforestation.  This is the time of the year when such work could be put into operation.  In the district of East Cork, and in the town of Fermoy there is at present a considerable number unemployed. There are hundreds of acres of waste land which could be bought for a small sum of money and vested in the State.  Reafforestation would be work of a reproductive kind and give employment to a large number in that locality.  There is also a water scheme in contemplation which could be put into operation, and it is very badly needed there.  If portion of the money were allocated for these works it would give employment to a large number during the winter months.</P>

      <P>I regret very much that the Minister has only seen his way to allocate such a small amount for the relief of distress.  In County Wicklow we have a balance of only £12,000 ear-marked for trunk roads.  I wish to remove any wrong impression created by the statement of the Minister for Local Government that money was available for any particular road and that it was the fault of the County Councils if they did not avail of it.  In the County Wicklow, it is only the amount certified by the engineer of the Roads Department that is paid to the County Council. I know of an instance where, in the opinion of the engineer, there was one man too many on the road gang.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attention of the County Surveyor was called to it and the man was instantly dismissed.  With only £12,000 available eighteen men were dismissed last week.  We have over 3,000 unemployed in County Wicklow and notwithstanding that £45,000 was allocated for the trunk roads there is great distress prevailing.  The Board of Health has passed a resolution calling upon the Government not to ask the ratepayers to be assisting able-bodied men when it is the duty of the Government to provide for them.  The Board estimated for £12,000, for the relief of the poor <Col N="1347" /> and £13,000 has already been spent in relieving over 1,200 able-bodied people who would be drawing unemployment benefit if the insurance scheme was extended. These 1,200 people have been unable to obtain one day's work during the last twelve months.  As a result of want of money, large numbers of widows and aged people, not in receipt of old age pensions, have had their Home Assistance considerably reduced so that those people who are unable to obtain work could be assisted.</P>
    <P>The Board of Health passed a resolution calling upon the Minister to give a substantial amount for the relief of distress.  Kynochs factory, which employed a large number of men, has been closed down, as also have the mines in Avoca.  The chemical works in Wicklow are practically closed.  There is practically no work in the rural districts, so that there was never such distress prevailing as there is at present in that county.  A sewerage scheme for Little Bray has been submitted, which would absorb at least 200 of the unemployed. Only about 20 per cent. of the money required would be spent on materials, so that a large amount could be spent on labour.  In Arklow a large amount of employment could be given if money were allocated for the extension of the waterworks.  The Wicklow Urban Council have also appealed to the Local Government Department for a grant for the extension of the waterworks.  There are over 350 insurable persons in that town who are at present unemployed. Up to the present we have heard nothing regarding these schemes, and are awaiting a decision from the Minister as to whether some of this money could be allocated for them.  Even amongst the fishing folk of Arklow there is a great deal of distress.  The fishing season has been a very bad one, and I suggest that some of this money should be allocated towards relieving those men who are unable to make anything out of the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I have already stated here that it is practically impossible to bring home to Ministers the seriousness of the present unemployment problem.  I would, however, point out to them that they were never faced with a graver problem than <Col N="1348" /> that which now faces them.  If words fail to convince Ministers of the necessity for providing people with food and shelter, then I say to the working classes and the unemployed that different means will have to be found, and a different attitude adopted by people outside, in order to bring home to the Government a sense of their responsibility in connection with the treatment of the unemployed.  The amount allocated is altogether insufficient.  While it may be useful as temporary relief in a small number of cases, it would not in my opinion relieve the distress at present prevailing in Wicklow, Wexford and Kildare.  We ask the Minister to allocate portion of this money for sewerage and water schemes submitted by public bodies, and also to the county councils to be spent on any road, for which no other scheme is put forward, when distress prevails in a particular locality, so as to afford temporary relief to unemployed persons coming up to Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrPatrickJODowd" hpid="Dr. O'DOWD Dr. O'DOWD">

      <P>I say with Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Kennedy that the amount voted is totally inadequate, and I hope it will be used only as a first instalment.  I am glad that the Minister has put in the forefront as essential works, water and sewerage schemes.  Water and sewerage schemes are part and parcel of the public health of the nation, and which will well repay before long any money expended upon them.  I called the attention of the House to the state of affairs existing in the town of Elphin.  Other Deputies have asked for grants for towns in their constituencies, but I suggest that for the town of Elphin there certainly is a prima facie case for an immediate grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government will bear me out when I say the water supply of the town has been condemned and that the sewerage arrangements are most primitive.  Plans and specifications have already been submitted to the Minister and the Board of Health, and everything is in order if the money is forthcoming.  I agree with Deputy Cooper that in the towns even a small grant would induce the local authorities to borrow the remainder of the money and to start the <Col N="1349" /> work.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to remember in the allocation of this grant that there are two water schemes and two sewerage schemes ready to start in the County of Roscommon at the moment&mdash;one in the town of Roscommon and one in the town of Elphin. The Minister said he wished this money to be spent on work that would be finished in the financial year.  But the Minister must know that water and sewerage schemes could not be undertaken now and finished in the financial year, so I ask him to reconsider that. Some few years ago a three hundred acre area was set aside in Roscommon for reafforestation.  The County Committee the other day made recommendations to the Ministry about the area. If any of the money were available&mdash; I dare say if we only get £6,000 it will not do for all the schemes&mdash;three hundred acres for reafforestation are available.</P>
    <P>Speaking of bog roads, I mentioned before that there is an area in the extreme north of the County Roscommon depending to a large extent on migratory labour.  The migratory labourers this year had a very bad season in England and Scotland, and they are in dire distress at the moment. If Deputy Conlon were here perhaps he could bear me out when I say that in 1925 at the time of Roscommon by-election some bog roads were started&mdash; the roads which the Minister now mentions as being suitable.  These roads were left unfinished after the election. I refer to the roads in the district of Drumshambo, and Cootehall in North Roscommon.  If any money is available for bog roads in Co. Roscommon I urge the Minister to remember those.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister for Finance disburses all the money to Roscommon, Kildare and other places, I should like to put in a word for the City of Dublin.  As I have already pointed out in this House, unemployment in the City of Dublin is very acute.  Dublin is up against a double problem, having to deal with its own unemployed and also with the very considerable number of unemployed that come up from the provinces. If the money is to be allocated in the way that seems to be in the <Col N="1350" /> minds of some Deputies, namely £6,000 to various units, I humbly suggest that as far as Dublin is concerned a sum of £6,000 is entirely inadequate.  If we are to deal with this question at all the present grant of £150,000 must, in my opinion, be only a beginning.  I agree with Deputy Cooper when he said that if this sum is found to be inadequate&mdash;and there can be no doubt in the minds of many Deputies that the sum is inadequate&mdash;I hope the Minister will come again to the House at a later stage and ask for a further sum.  One statement made by the Minister for Finance caused me considerable uneasiness. He said, I think, that a large number of men were unsuitable for employment on public works.  I happen to have large numbers of that very type of man coming to me and I have been promising them that work will be available and that a sum of £150,000 is to be allocated for that purpose.  Does the Minister suggest that none but able-bodied men will get employment in the disbursement under these schemes?  I think it is a terrible thing to have those men advanced in years, but still capable of giving decent and efficient service to the State, deprived of work, and that work given to younger men.  It would appear to me that some very selfish element existed in carrying out such a method of dealing with unemployment.  Whenever I recommend a man advanced in years, invariably that man comes back to me and never gets a chance, but if I send a big, strong, strapping young fellow the Commissioners are sure to pick him out at once, as if they feel they are going to get value for their money.  I ask the Minister to consider that this portion of the problem requires sympathetic attention.  If the scheme is to be carried out on such a plan as that&mdash; and I hope I am wrong in inferring that&mdash;there is going to be great heart-burnings amongst many of the hardworking men advanced in years who are well able to work but who may be turned away, left with nothing to do, and no hope of employment.  I ask the Minister to make some suggestion or statement which will ensure that those advanced in years will be considered in the disbursements under these schemes. I have at least fifteen or twenty men <Col N="1351" /> of that type whom I have been promising from day to day that they will get employment.  If that statement of the Minister is true these people will get no consideration at all.  I hope the statement is untrue, and I ask the Minister to relieve my mind of that uneasiness before he concludes upon this particular subject.</P>

      <P>I am rather at a disadvantage in not being here when the Minister was speaking.  I understand his remarks conveyed the idea that in the allocation of this grant he is not disposed to agree to its being expended on the making of roads.</P>
      <P>Personally, I think it is rather a good idea, but in some parts of the country it will be very difficult to find suitable employment for the men, for there is a great deal of unemployment, unless the Minister is in a position or cares to vary the conditions under which he now seeks to have the works done.  In connection with the matter of the clearance of housing sites, I think it is rather a good thing that the Minister has agreed to permit the local authorities to spend this money, any of them who are lucky enough to get a grant on the clearing of housing sites.  This will be much help afterwards in the matter of the housing problem.  Because, very often, the initial expense of clearing housing sites adds a great deal to the rent which the councils have to charge.  The clearances of sites in a great many cases cost as much as £20 to £30 per house. In that connection I might mention that a great many urban areas are in need of money for the purpose of clearing away housing sites, and it will be necessary to have certain roads or avenues made in connection with the schemes that these councils have in mind.  I hope the Minister will be able to vary the conditions he now lays down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with sewerage, I understand that the Minister is disposed to give grants for sewerage works in the various towns, and, like Deputy O'Dowd.  I believe that a great deal requires to be done in this respect in a great many of the towns and cities of the Saorstát so far as sewerage works are concerned.  In a great <Col N="1352" /> many towns a system of box sewerage prevails, and box sewerage is injurious to the health of the inhabitants. This is a matter that should be attended to at once.  A question arises as to whether or not money will be available to enable certain urban authorities to purchase sewerage pipes out of the grant.  I know well that it is not a desirable thing to advocate that an urban authority should be allowed to purchase materials out of the grants allocated to them for unemployment, and I do not want to advocate that.  As the Minister knows, the borrowing powers of a great many public authorities to-day have reached their limits.  I might point out that the limit was not fixed since money began to depreciate within the last five or six years, and, as a consequence, these urban authorities find it difficult to secure money to enable them to carry out necessary sewerage works.  I would like the Minister to state if along with getting a grant from the Government the local authorities which require to do some very necessary sewerage work will be permitted to borrow from the Local Loans Fund the amount of money which would be required to enable them to purchase sewerage pipes.  It is well to have that now, because the Minister or his Department may say that if a local authority is lucky enough to get a grant they would not also agree to let them have a loan from the Local Loans Fund.  That loan might be necessary to enable the local body to carry out a scheme of sewerage work.</P>
    <P>I am glad to hear that the Minister is disposed to give some of this money as a free grant to enable certain local authorities to provide a better water supply.  One of the towns in my own constituency of Wexford, the town of Enniscorthy, is at the moment contemplating the provision of a better supply of water.  Anybody who is familiar with the town knows that the amount of water which is being supplied there at the moment is not half sufficient to supply the needs of the people.  A letter has been already sent to the Department of Local Government and Public Health, accompanied by a resolution asking that a grant should be given to enable the council to carry out this very worthy object, and I hope <Col N="1353" /> that the Minister will give this application from Enniscorthy the consideration which it deserves.  In my constituency of Wexford there are, unfortunately, great numbers of unemployed. In my own town of Wexford, owing to the fact that there has been, as everybody admits, a decided depression in agriculture for the last five or six years, the foundries there are working with a very small staff.  Deputy O'Hanlon the other day, in his statement on the tariff motion, suggested that Irish wheelbarrows and Irish shovels should be placed in the hands of the Irish farmers before we talk about tariffs.  I would, in turn, suggest to Deputy O'Hanlon that he would urge on the farmers that they should get behind the handles of Irish ploughs and not be importing them from Bedford. If the farmers applied themselves to the support of the manufacturers of their own country better than they have done or have been doing, they would not have to pay so much poor rate as they have been paying and we would have more people in employment.  In the year 1920 we had between 450 and 500 men employed in manufacturing agricultural implements in one particular firm in the town of Wexford.</P>
    <P>To-day in that firm there are only 210 people employed.  There are in that town two similar firms, and the proportion of men working now in these firms as compared with the number working in 1920 is still less than in the one I have mentioned.  In consequence of that, the town of Wexford is in a bad state so far as employment is concerned. I hope when representations are made to the Minister for Finance that he will have no hesitation in coming to the relief of the local council in the only way in which he can come to their relief.  In dealing with the unemployment motion the other day, I mentioned New Ross.  For a number of years in New Ross there was a tannery, and that tannery at one time employed 150 men.  Quite recently that tannery has been closed down.  There is a brewery in New Ross which, for a number of years, also employed a great number of men, and it is now practically on the verge of being closed down, <Col N="1354" /> so that that town, too, is in need of relief.</P>
    <P>Speaking of towns, and having in mind also rural areas, I am wondering what schemes could be considered by the Minister and the councils concerned in so far as the relief of unemployment amongst the rural workers is concerned. It is very hard to find any employment other than road work in rural areas, and in some parts of Ireland to-day there is as much distress and distress as acute in rural areas as in the urban areas That aspect of the situation must not be lost sight of.  I am wondering, like other Deputies here, how this £150,000 is going to be allocated in fairness to every part of the State.  Like them, I consider that the amount now about to be distributed is altogether too small, and is altogether too little to deal with what everybody agrees is an acute problem. I do hope that this £150,000 will be only a beginning, and that when the committee which President Cosgrave has promised to set up is set going we will have an interim report from them very soon as to what can be done, and that some money will be available to follow up this £150,000 for the relief of the distress that is prevailing amongst our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarney" hpid="Mr. CARNEY Mr. CARNEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CARNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I thoroughly agree with those who have said that this grant is totally inadequate for the purpose of the relief of unemployment.  To my mind, the Executive Council in dealing with this matter have not alone been short-sighted, but they must have been suffering from a double cataract. These grants for the purpose of the relief of unemployment relieve it temporarily for three or six weeks, and then we have the whole question of unemployment coming back to us again like a boomerang.  The object, to my mind, should be if there is any attempt to relieve unemployment, to relieve it permanently, if that is possible.  Take into consideration the constituency of Donegal, which I have the honour to represent, I question if there were £6,000 allocated to that constituency whether that £6,000 in the matter of relieving unemployment would last as long as a snowball on a hot plate.  Because were it not for the fact that the sons and daughters and parents of <Col N="1355" /> families in Donegal are sending money from America, from Scotland and from England, from twenty-five per cent. to fifty per cent. of the population of Donegal would simply cease to exist.</P>
      <P>It would be almost impossible to enumerate the different things which require to be done in that constituency, not to talk of the rest of the country. For example, if the particular Department which deals, or rather is supposed to deal, with the geological survey had carried out their duties as they should have done they would have been able to point out that in Donegal we have deposits of lead and silver in Gortahork and Glentogher.  Perhaps if these mines were being operated we might be able to use some of that silver in making these Yorkshire works of art which we will have on our new coins.  If these mines were in operation they would give a lot of employment in those areas.  We have also deposits of mica which are very valuable, and I think if they were exploited properly they would be the means of bringing a lot of money into the areas in which the deposits occur.  We have white mica, which is used mainly for the purpose of making the arc lamps that are used in increasing numbers by the medical profession.  We have also deposits of marble, and if any Deputy has enough money to spend he can see the marble church at Dunlewey, made from the famous Dunlewey marble.  We have different kinds of granite and other classes of building stone, and if the quarries were opened up they would certainly give a lot of employment in different areas and keep boys and girls from flocking to America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Heffernan told us the other day that we had no coal resources in this country.  Now, unless the businessmen of Belfast were suffering from the effects of mass hypnotism, they must have been absolutely in error when they mistook the materials they got from the Arigna coal mines last year as coal.  I saw it passing through on lorries to Belfast during the coal strike, and it certainly looked like coal to me, but, of course, I do not know what Deputy Heffernan might think about it. It requires seven miles of railroad to <Col N="1356" /> connect the Arigna coalfields with the nearest railhead, and the building of it would give immediate employment. Then, with the opening up of the coalfields, there would be employment given in the mines, one man operating a coal bed last year inside three weeks employed about 200 additional hands.</P>
    <P>It is hardly worth while talking about £150,000 it is so inadequate. Even if the Government had to raise a loan for the purpose of carrying out work which would be reproductive, they should do so, and I am sure they would get assistance from all parts of the House.  Deputy Cooper&mdash;I am very sorry to see he is not here now&mdash;was very solicitous about the welfare of the men who are about to be discharged from the National Army.  He says it is a very difficult thing to advertise or apply for a job from the Curragh.  I quite agree with him, because there were some thousands released from the Curragh internment camps, and they found it so difficult to advertise for jobs, or apply for jobs, that half of them had to go to America and the other half are living in this country in semi-starvation.  It is grand to see Deputy Cooper taking such an interest in our soldiers.  There are numbers of ex-Connaught Rangers in this country, and from what I can see the majority of them are unemployed. Some who were released from prisons are dead, and some have emigrated. Let me read a short extract from a letter written by one of these ex-Connaught Rangers: &ldquo;I do not like to be worrying you, but what can one do?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>These men are unemployed, and I want to point out that there should be no differentiation made between these men and the men of the National Army referred to by Deputy Cooper.  The letter runs:&mdash;&ldquo;I do not like to be worrying you, but what can one do?  I have not got a day's work since I came home from prison, and it is breaking my heart to see my poor widowed mother dying a lingering death from slow starvation.  I have <Col N="1357" /> lost my pension as well, and I have wished many times since I came home that I had been shot in France&rdquo;&mdash;in which case, of course, Deputy Cooper would have marched under the Arc de Triomphe in commemoration of his death.  It is hardly worth while talking about £150,000, which is totally inadequate. As I said before, this question will be coming back on us again like a boomerang, and no serious attempt has been made by the Government to deal with it as it should have been dealt with; that is, not alone to give a sop for the purpose of relieving or partly relieving unemployment temporarily, but they should have made some attempt to relieve the unemployed permanently.</P>

I do not intend to delay the time of the House with any long contribution to the debate, because I know the Minister will have to deal with numerous points that have been raised by Deputies, and I do not want to shorten his time.  Not having the advantage of hearing the Minister's statement, I am not quite clear what portion of this money will be spent by the respective departments.  I would like to feel sure that a considerable amount of the money will be put at the disposal of the Land Commission in order that an opportunity may be afforded in isolated places to have schemes of sewerage and the improvement of waterworks and other such schemes carried out, and in order that some portion of the money that is intended for the relief of unemployment will reach the people in the very remote portions of the country.</P>

      <P>I would like also to have an assurance that some provision would be made to undertake marine works, the construction of slips and the improvement of piers where such work is undoubtedly necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member of a local authority I have some knowledge of the fact that local authorities have been asked very often to contribute to the improvement of marine works which are at present in <Col N="1358" /> a dilapidated state.  Owing to the state of their finances there is considerable difficulty in getting local authorities to do anything substantial in that direction. In many places piers that could be a source of revenue are very dilapidated, and moneys that could be collected, if there were reasonable facilities given to those using the piers, are not collected and, consequently, the position is one that would need examination with a view to the expenditure from the Central Fund of money in that respect.  As regards water works and sewerage works, I am glad that the views of Deputies who contributed to the debate on unemployment have in this respect been met by the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is unanimity about the entire inadequacy of this grant, but it is, at any rate, an earnest of the fact that the Government realise, to some extent, the problem that obtains in the country, and I re-echo the hope that it is the first of many instalments which will be needed to come to real grips with the problem.  It is the natural inclination of Deputies to speak about their respective constituencies and, in view of the fact that all sorts of schemes will be advocated by Deputies from various parts of the country, I feel that at the moment that tends to confuse the position, and I rather prefer to deal with the matter in a general way.  There is no question about the fact that in many villages and towns schemes for improved water supplies and sewage have for a long time been delayed.  The conditions with regard to sewage in the average small town are absolutely primitive.  They have been hung up for generations in some cases, and the conditions are really a menace to public health.  Money given to services of that kind will contribute materially to removing that menace.</P>
    <P>In cases where local authorities would be willing to undertake a portion of the expenditure for marine works, I feel that it would be right that portion of this money should be given to such authorities to supplement their contributions for carrying out such work.  I have had an example recently of good will on the part of a local authority which has very little money to spend except on the bare essential <Col N="1359" /> services in my constituency.  The improvement of the pier at Courtmacsherry was under consideration, and a scheme was put to the local authority and examined by the engineer.  An expenditure of nearly £800 was voted by the county council, but when the scheme was subsequently examined, it was found the contribution would be inadequate, and consequently the money could not be used.  It would simply mean that the work could not be properly carried, and it would look as if public money had been wasted if it were attempted.  I suggest that such cases might be dealt with in the connection I have mentioned arising out of the disbursement of monies voted for the relief of unemployment.  It is, at any rate, very clear that very much more than this money must be given in the immediate future, and I join with Deputy Corish in expressing the hope that when the President is in a position to make an announcement next week as to the personnel of the committee to be set up in connection with this whole question, we will have that body settling down to do the work and proceed with it quickly in view of the absolutely destitute conditions prevailing.</P>
    <P>I trust that in the disbursement of the money the Minister will remember that it is necessary to spend a good portion of it in remote rural areas.  I have heard it said often that money of this kind spent on public works is very unsatisfactory, that there is a poor return, and that it is not always well spent.  During the last three or four years, I had many examples of money advanced from the Land Commission and other Departments, and I always found that it was honestly and well spent, and that the people who were given employment, in spite of the statement to the contrary made here, were very anxious to do their best to earn that money honestly.  I have seen people who were charged with the expenditure of such money taking great pains to see that it was spent economically. I feel that it will be an encouragement to the people in remote rural areas, who are expecting in the immediate future some relief at the <Col N="1360" /> hands of the Government, that they will be able to feel satisfied as a result of this debate that the money will not be spent in any particular district, or on any particular work, but will be distributed in the most economic way possible, not to people of any particular class, but for the betterment of all the people who can be benefited as a result of its expenditure.  I feel that there are very big and pressing needs in my constituency, but I prefer to devote some other time to dealing with them.  I hope in future we will have many occasions of this kind in which we can discuss expenditure of public money in many other directions with a view to coming to grips with what is, in my opinion, the most important problem which we have at the moment in this country.</P>

      <P>Like other Deputies, <Col N="1361" /> I approve of the Government action in endeavouring to deal with this problem, and my only cause for complaint is with regard to the inadequacy of the grant.  To my mind, it is totally insufficient to deal, even in a small way, with the destitution and povery that exist in the City of Dublin alone.  We have 8,000 unfortunates signing up at the Dublin Labour Exchange, and practically within a month we could use the whole of the grant in the city.  It would give but very little help indeed to the numbers who are now in great want.  I ask the Minister for Finance, and especially the Minister for Local Government, to see that this grant will be spent in such a way that it will be an addition to the work ordinarily done out of the rates, and that it will not be used in any way to save the rates as regards the doing of ordinary work.  It should be used in the way it is intended, as a special relief grant to meet an emergency.  If there is any attempt to apply it for the doing of ordinary work that should be done out of rates that would not be spending the money according to the wishes of the House, or of the Minister responsible for the grant.  I hope the Minister will see that large sums out of this grant will not be spent in materials.  These should be purchased by the local councils for ordinary work.  I have a reason for urging that the money should be used specially for the relief of distress, that the whole amount should be spent in wages, and that any council getting this money for relief schemes will not be allowed to save any money it may have in its lockers.  I would also like to impose on the councils certain conditions, as was done in the days gone by. They should be required to provide whatever material is necessary to carry out relief schemes so that the whole of the £150,000 will go in wages.  I am sure the Government had in their minds that this money should go into the homes of the unemployed who require immediate relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point I wish to emphasise is with regard to the physical fitness of men selected for employment where relief work is being provided.  You will find a class of men in the City of Dublin who, through poverty and hunger, are <Col N="1362" /> broken down.  You will find a large number of men of from 50 to 60 years of age broken down, and they have families dependent on them.  When they apply for work to private employers they are rejected because of their appearance.  No opportunity is given to them to get employment.  I hope that will not happen in connection with this grant.  It should not happen that because a man is probably unable to give a 100 per cent. output he should be refused work.  If such a thing should happen I hope the House will immediately avail of the opportunity to attack the poor law system as applied in Dublin, and which differs from that of the country, so that if a man is cast aside and gets no opportunity of getting anything from this grant other means will be found of relieving him.  I hope Deputies will press upon the Government the necessity of finding other means of giving immediate relief to families of individuals of that kind.  I think the Government are making efforts to meet the situation, but I feel confident that of the 8,000 signing up in Dublin not half of them will get a day's work on any schemes brought forward under this grant.  If the class whom I have mentioned, and who have dependants, are refused employment I hope the Minister for Local Government will make some effort to alter the poor law system which compels a man to go hungry because he cannot produce a doctor's certificate.  Many hundreds in the city are being supported by the St. Vincent de Paul Society and helped by the Roomkeepers' Society.  These societies are heavily in debt and are making appeals on behalf of people who should be helped under the poor law system.  I ask the Minister for Local Government to get a report from the various St. Vincent de Paul centres as to the conditions that exist, and if he does I am sure he will make some effort to deal with the poverty and destitution in the city.</P>
