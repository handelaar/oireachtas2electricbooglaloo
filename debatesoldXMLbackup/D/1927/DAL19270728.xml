      <NameTxt>Mr. ANTHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether in view of the fact that the judgment of the Privy Council in the Wigg and Cochrane case was delivered several months ago, and that this case dealt only with the calculations of the pensions and gratuities of Civil Servants retiring under Article 10 of the Treaty, and that the functions of the Civil Service Committee are primarily to decide the question of allowing or disallowing retirement, he will state why the work of this Committee cannot at once be resumed without affecting the financial adjustments to be considered consequent on the Privy Council's decision.</P>

      <P>The judgment referred to raises not merely financial but constitutional and legal questions of far-reaching importance.  As has been already stated in reply to recent Parliamentary questions on the subject, the matter is under consideration.  I am not in a position to make any further statement at present.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister undertake that the Act of 1920, which definitely states that no officer may be kept in the Service for more than two years from the date of his application to retire, will become operative, because, as he must be aware, there are many men waiting three and four years for discharge under this Act?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SHEEHY</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for <Col N="1028" /> Finance whether he is aware that a deputation of the Kinsale Public Boards interviewed the President in Bandon, last autumn, as to the matter of the Kinsale Pier Debt, which debt, the local boards argue, has been overpaid, and that the balance still being pressed for is not lawfully owing; and whether as the settlement of the question is one of urgency, considering that the debt presses on the township and harbour to the detriment of any further development, he will have the matter investigated with a view to cancelling the balance still stated to be owing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN (replying)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  I cannot, however, accept the suggestion of the local boards that the Kinsale Pier Debt has been overpaid and that the balance still being pressed for is not lawfully owing. I have already fully considered the case on more than one occasion, and I regret that I cannot go beyond the concession offered to the Harbour Authorities in March, 1924.</P>

      <P>That is a matter that will have to be put to the Minister himself, but I am not sure that there is very much chance that it will be received in view of what is stated in the answer, that the concession offered was one beyond which the Minister feels he cannot go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JINKS</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that according to the custom followed at the Sligo Unemployment Exchange persons unemployed must sign on six consecutive days in order to obtain payment of benefit; that dock labourers at Sligo are usually unemployed for four or five days at a time, when they then may get two or three days' employment discharging boats, and upon again becoming unemployed they are called upon to make what is called a &ldquo;repeated&rdquo; claim in respect of the days they previously signed for, necessitating awaiting payment of benefit for a further period of six days, and whether the Minister will, in view of the hardships inflicted upon the working classes in this connection, remedy this condition of affairs and so amend procedure that unemployed persons will draw the benefit to which they are entitled whether they be signing for one, two or more days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Unemployment Fund was established to provide for unemployment that is continuous after six days total unemployment. It is an insurance fund, and consequently subject, like all insurance funds, to compliance with such conditions as actuarial considerations may require.  Workers are not entitled, as the Deputy assumes, to benefit if they do not comply with the conditions under which benefit is payable.  The procedure described in the question is that laid down by the Unemployment Insurance Acts and could not be altered without legislation, which, having regard to the present state of the Fund, would involve an increase in the existing rate of contributions that I do not consider would be justifiable.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that the rents of 24 Sligo Corporation dwellings erected at Cleveragh and Ballytivnan, Sligo, in accordance with the Department's scheme dated 22nd March, 1922, are so high, in consequence of the short period fixed for the repayment of loan, that the tenants find it impossible to pay these rents, and have petitioned the Corporation to have same reduced to a reasonable figure, and whether the Minister is prepared to enter into negotiations with the bank, or banks, to extend the period of repayment of loan from 15 to 30 years, and so enable the Corporation, while adding no additional burden to the rates, to reduce the rents in accordance with the wishes of the tenants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SHEEHY</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether Government engineers specify asbestos slate for houses assisted by Government grants, to the detriment of Irish slate, and if so, why; whether he is aware that the Irish quarry proprietors complain of this as unnational and harmful to Irish industry and promoting unemployment, and whether some organised effort could not be made whereby Irish slate will get preference in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>The technical experts of the Department do not specify asbestos slates for houses assisted by Government grants, to the detriment of Irish slates.  Generally speaking, they advocate the use of Irish slates wherever possible, due regard being had to the fact that roofing in artificial slate is considerably cheaper. In the general outline specification preference is indicated for the use of first quality slates, preferably from the Killaloe, Carrick-on-Suir, Benduff, or other approved quarries in Saorstát Eireann, and asbestos is merely included as an alternative.  Owing to the excessive cost of building, the Department has produced, for the assistance of local authorities, an outline specification for small houses of reduced standard.  They are what is commonly known as the Drogheda type.  It contains every possible retrenchment in costs consistent with durability. This suggested specification includes asbestos as the roof covering, but local authorities are quite free, and are encouraged, <Col N="1034" /> to use Irish slates if the location of the houses and other factors as regards price warrant that course.</P>
      <P>Any practical proposal which will lead to the more extensive use of Irish slate will receive the fullest and most sympathetic consideration, and any alleged causes of complaint in so far as local authorities are concerned will be inquired into.</P>

It is for that reason that this has been answered in the way it has.  I thought that was a natural assumption.

      <P>On reading the newspaper reports of yesterday's debate I find that I am reported as using words which I sincerely regret.  On looking at the Official Report I find that there is some difference between the report in the newspapers and that report.  The Official Report of my speech says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Executive are like mariners who have lost their rudder and who are sailing out on a sea of passion seeking for blood and revenge.  I am afraid from their examples yesterday they are even prepared to endanger the destinies of this State in order to satisfy that revenge.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In regard to the events of yesterday, I desire on behalf of my Party to make a short statement. We felt very acutely the allegation of the Minister for Education that we were trying to make &ldquo;the biggest capital we could&rdquo; out of the event of some Sundays ago, the inference being, as we took it, that all our protestations of sympathy were hypocritical and insincere and that the assassination of Kevin O'Higgins was being used by us for party advantage.  That inference, which, I think, was a natural one, we <Col N="1039" /> resent emphatically.  We enter our absolute denial of it and protest against it.  I want to say, further, that when we are charged with shirking our responsibilities and washing our hands of any possible consequences of any act that we are required to undertake, or any action which is the consequence of our duties as Deputies, we spurn and denounce that charge as unwarranted and without the slightest shadow of foundation.</P>
      <P>It is a legitimate Parliamentary statement to make, but it has become the habit of Ministers to make such statements in regard to this Party.  We have our responsibilities here and we have endeavoured, in the last five years, to act up to those responsibilities. We have never shirked the issue and we shall never shirk the issue.  If the responsibility comes to us, we shall accept it.  If the responsibility for the government of this country comes to us, we shall accept it, either alone or in association with the Farmers, the Independents, or the National League. Or we will support any of these elements in forming a Government and give them general support.  We will, if necessary, endeavour to carry on the business of this country, if in the position of a Government, without the powers which are sought in this Public Safety Bill.  We are not going to shirk any responsibility.</P>

      <P>The President yesterday associated himself emphatically and publicly with the statement of the Minister for Education.  When this Party left the House in indignant protest, the President, repeating by epithet what he has frequently alleged in public, said that we were cowards and afraid to face responsibilities.  We are not going to assist in the conduct of business in this House by the Persident or the Minister for Education until that allegation against us of dishonour, insincerity and hypocrisy is withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two different allegations.  One allegation is that the death of the Vice-President was being used by a particular Party for the purpose of making political capital.  That allegation stands by itself.  The other accusation to which Deputy Johnson has alluded is in my judgment, on a wholly different footing.  If these statements are to be taken at all, I think they should be <Col N="1043" /> taken separately.  We are accustomed, both here and in the country, to considerable latitude in public speaking. We are accustomed to charge and counter-charge in political matters. The charge that particular people are washing their hands of responsibility has been made a not inconsiderable number of times both here and elsewhere. That is a matter which, in my view, can be resolved by speech and counter-speech and in other ways.  The other allegation is quite different.  I think if Deputy Johnson would address himself to that question and that question alone, it might be solved.  But I understand him now to be asking for the withdrawal of two separate and distinct statements.  I may, perhaps, be going outside my proper function, but, in my judgment, the two matters are wholly different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make your mind, A Chinn Comhairle, quite easy on that matter.  I recognise quite well that it is within the competence of any member of the House to make allegations with reference to responsibility against a Party or an individual in connection with public affairs.  I do not treat that in the same light as the other allegation, but, as there was no attempt at or sign of withdrawal of one allegation, I considered it right and proper that I should make the position of this Party clear on both those matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Should there not be a withdrawal of all allegations on both sides?  Nobody has done more for the good repute and honour of the Dáil in the past than Deputy Johnson.  Deputy Johnson yesterday allowed himself, in a moment of passion, to violate the rules of order by making allegations which he did not&mdash;I followed his statement closely&mdash;express any regret for. The Minister for Education made clear yesterday that he did not consider the sympathy of the Labour Party in the tragedy that occurred a fortnight ago insincere.  Perhaps he would repeat that to-day.  I think that both sides should express their regret for the incident yesterday, which reduced the Dáil to the level of Chambers which have been less fortunate.  If that were done, I think we could get on with the business. <Col N="1044" /> I know that the repute of the Dáil is dear to Deputy Johnson, and it is dear, too, to the country.  It is not good for the country, and it is not good for us to go on in this kind of way. Cannot both sides express regret and let us get on with the business we are called here to do?</P>

      <P>There is one consideration which should be borne in mind in this matter.  A considerable number of statements were made in the course of the debate on Tuesday and Wednesday.  Some of these statements have not been withdrawn. A Parliamentary assembly cannot work on the basis that members cannot make charges without afterwards withdrawing them.  That simply cannot be done.</P>
      <P>People must have liberty to make political charges; but there is a certain kind of charge in a certain kind of atmosphere that should not be made. I think Deputy Lynch's statement yesterday was very unfortunate, and I think he is to be congratulated upon having withdrawn it.</P>

      <P>The statement made by Deputy Hogan (Clare), not quite of the same nature, regarding the Minister for Industry and Commerce, was that instead of a lust for humanitarianism he had a lust for blood.  That, perhaps, was merely made for the purpose of contrasting two particular words.  Might it not, in all the circumstances, be better left unsaid and, having been said, might it not be better withdrawn?  The statement of the Minister for Education with regard to making political capital out of the assassination of the Vice-President did not, in my judgment, express exactly what the Minister for Education meant and should not now, I think, be entangled in any other statement made by the President or anybody else and should not be connected with any statement that the Labour Party are not prepared to accept their responsibilities.  I feel, not for the sake of the Minister for Education, not for the sake of Deputy Johnson or the Labour Party, but in honour <Col N="1045" /> of the memory of the late Vice-President, the particular statement made about his assassination, and the incident arising out of it, might be now forgotten.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly had Deputy Johnson not intervented with what I consider, with the President, a statement that was very unfortunate and that completely queered the pitch, this incident that has occurred to-day would not have occurred. Had the withdrawal on the other side been not merely the one unfortunate statement&mdash;the Deputy made a more unfortunate statement afterwards when he accused some members of the Executive Council of murder&mdash;had that been withdrawn, and had Deputy Hogan's statement been withdrawn, I could have explained quite clearly what I meant.  But I consider the fact that these things were not withdrawn, these and various other allegations, and no attempt was made to withdraw them; that Deputy Johnson utilised the opportunity for a further attack, for a rubbing-in, for a making more difficult of the whole situation.  Had it not been for that, I could have explained quite clearly what was meant. As regards what has been indicated by the Ceann Comhairle, I do not think there is a Deputy in this House who had more respect for the late Vice-President than I had.  I had for him a tremendous admiration.  I made it quite clear yesterday, before the Deputies on the opposite benches left, that I accepted to the fullest possible extent the sincerity of their expressions of sympathy.  I repeated that when they were absent.  Never for a moment did I question it, nor do I question the horror with which they, like every other decent citizen of the State, heard of the assassination.  Now, as to the actual statement, in so far as that statement&mdash;and I admit the actual words used&mdash;implied that the Labour Party were using the assassination of the Vice-President in order to make political capital out of it, that, as the Ceann Comhairle has explained, obviously was not what was in my mind.  What was in my mind was explained by Deputy Gorey afterwards, <Col N="1046" /> that the Labour Party were making political capital out of the Bills which the Government felt compelled to introduce as the result of the assassination.  Now, my expression of belief as to what the Labour Party felt as regards the Vice-President's death would have come immediately, even after the very inadequate withdrawals that came from the opposite benches, had it not been for the very unfortunate intervention of the leader of the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £10,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st day of March, 1928, for Secret Services.</P>
      <P>This is a Vote in addition to the sum which has been already obtained. Deputies are aware of the manner in which these moneys are disbursed; the Minister for Finance explained it within the last few weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we should have a little more information.  I think in the earlier disucssion upon this Vote it was pointed out that there have been each year very considerable proportions of the total sum voted handed back to the Exchequer.  The Minister has not given any indication as to whether the sum required now is in addition to the total sum that was voted in the earlier stages of this session.  I am to assume that the purpose of this additional Vote is to assist the officers of State, the police, the Criminal Investigation Department and others, to ferret out and put down <Col N="1047" /> organisations which aim at the destruction of the State.  I am quite prepared to say that for that purpose it is right that a sufficient sum of money should be at the disposal of the Ministry for secret service when it is known that there are secret service organisations on the other side endeavouring to subvert State institutions. I think that the method of adding to the efficiency of the police organisations is the right and proper way to put down the conspiracy that is presumably aimed at in the Public Safety Bill.</P>
      <P>It has not been stated, in the presentation of this estimate, that all the steps that could have been taken within the limit of the Secret Service Votes of past years have been taken.  If it is now seen that there is a need to meet attacks upon the State by a more efficient secret police activity, why was that step not taken when the money voted in previous years was available? I would put this proposition to the House: that it is more in accordance with the requirements of the case to equip a police force to enable them to seek and make arrests of criminals and offenders of various kinds than to proceed by way of increasing punishment and arming authorities with increased powers.  I think it would be not ill-advised that the fullest possible trial should be made of an efficient police force with the powers that already exist before you increase those powers in almost indefinite ways, without being sure that your police force is going to be more efficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not opposing this Vote, but I would like to have some information as to why the Vote is required, in the sense that sums of money were at the disposal of the Minister to make efficient the secret service organisation, but were not used.  Consequently, presumably the police force was less efficient than it is now to be assumed it will be, having a greater sum of money at their disposal.  This Vote, in effect, is a confession of inability in the past to equip the police service with the methods of detection that they now seem to see possible when they have <Col N="1048" /> a larger sum of money at their disposal.</P>

      <P>That was a matter which received consideration, and upon which we asked for advice. The general consensus of opinion was in favour of a lump sum rather than an annuity.  The lump sum avoids the annual presentation of a vote in connection with the matter, and we thought, in all the circumstances, it would be more satisfactory, bearing in mind the equation of the lump sum to what the proposed annuity was, and calculated accordingly.  This sum will be given to trustees for investment.  It will liquidate any liabilities there were against the estate of the late Minister, and will provide for his widow and children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move &ldquo;that the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1927, be read a second time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of the Bill is to put an end to the present anomalous condition of things in which persons avail of the electoral machinery which has been provided by the State for the selection of members of the Oireachtas to offer themselves for election without having any intention of taking their seats or of undertaking their duties and responsibilities of the office which they seek. This futile performance has now gone on for five years.  At every general election and at most of the bye-elections candidates have been put on what is described as the abstentionist programme. These candidates claim that such votes as they obtain are votes against the Treaty settlement.  Some of them, no doubt, are.  That they can all be so regarded is more than doubtful. During the recent election everything possible was done by the abstentionist group to cloud the issue.  No two of their candidates appeared to be of one mind.  Some of them were against the Treaty; others pretended that they were merely opposed to the oath which it contains, and it was consistently sought to delude the people into the belief that the oath could be removed without violating the Treaty.  The situation was further confused by allegations of Government extravagance, by promises of employment, of relief from payment of debts, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But even if the maximum claim be conceded the position would be that the opponents of the Treaty are in a minority of one-third of the electorate. The issue of the Treaty has now been before the people at least three times. It is time that parliamentary institutions <Col N="1051" /> were protected from prostitution by a minority.  This country has been run on the most democratic lines.  Every adult has a vote; Deputies are elected on the basis of proportional representation, so as to render the legislature as nearly as may be a picture of the electorate.  The rights of minorities are amply recognised and provided for.</P>
    <P>But the majority has its rights, too. The majority of the people of this country have declared in unmistakable terms that they desire to work out their destinies peacefully under the constitutional liberties and parliamentary institutions which they enjoy.  This they cannot do if a minority is to be permitted to play fast and loose with the basic principles of democratic government in their application, if they are allowed to persevere in their effort to bring parliamentary institutions into disrepute.  There is a place where the voice of the people can be heard in council, namely, in the Oireachtas.  The Oireachtas is the place provided for that purpose, and it is the only place.</P>
    <P>It has been charged against the Government that this measure is an attempt to make political capital out of the assassination of the late Vice-President. Nothing could be further from the truth.  A very little reflection should make it obvious to the weakest intellect that the accusation is entirely unfounded.  As long as the Fianna Fáil Party contested elections upon the basis of non-acceptance of the Treaty and the Constitution, as long as the Treaty and the Constitution were in issue, so long did there exist a strong reason, a strong inducement to voters who desired the continuance of these instruments, to support the Party which had brought them into being, and which had defended them for five years.  The effect of the present measure will be to remove that inducement, to give the people a choice, unhampered by the fear that the result might be a Dáil so broken up into little groups that stable government would be impossible. Clearly the passing of this Bill, so far from giving a political advantage to the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, will do the exact opposite.  It will remove a handicap from the other Constitutional <Col N="1052" /> Parties in this House, it will enable this House to be completed, and it will give the electorate a greater freedom.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>We propose to oppose this measure.  I am not going to make the charge that this Bill is introduced to make political capital out of the present situation.  I quite agree that the passing of this Bill will probably not, as the saying is, bring any water to the mill of Cumann na nGaedheal, but that fact itself is not sufficient to satisfy us that the measure is justifiable now.  Our Party are influenced in their opposition to this measure because of the time and the circumstances.  Perhaps we may be blamed because of the mentality with which we approach this problem.  However, we have also to take cognisance of the fact that perhaps other Parties are approaching the problem in a mentality that is probably not favourable to the solution of the whole difficulty with which the country is confronted.  We do not dispute for one moment that it would be a very good thing for the country to have 152 representatives in this House.  Responsibility for government would be distributed over a greater number of people, and incidentally when each representative would have to come here and stretch the trace side by side with his colleagues, when, after a trial, and after the chaff had been sifted from the wheat, the country would come to examine the position, they would, perhaps, be better judges of the value of representatives, and I feel that the Government and the people's representatives would then be the best that the people could procure.  They would be elected on their merits, on their ability to do the country's work in the Parliament of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know quite well that it is very easy to criticise Deputies who come here and do work, and that it is very difficult to criticise the people who do not come here and do work.  We know this House is open to examination and to criticism, and Deputies here suffer that every act of a representative in disabilities when facing the electorate, particularly Deputies who have tried to do something.  We accept all that as being true. <Col N="1053" /> The object of this Bill, as stated by the President, is to get a full House, a truly representative assembly.  But can that be achieved by this Bill?  You can undoubtedly fill the seats in the Dáil, but will those who fill them be representative of the country?  That is the question.  Whether we like it or not we have here a political problem which, in my view, will not be solved by the Ministry's methods.  Rightly or wrongly, a certain volume of opinion objects to elected representatives making a declaration of faithfulness to the King as head of the Commonwealth. Indeed, I do not know that there is any great enthusiasm at all for that declaration on the part of any number of representatives, either those who come here or those who do not come here. Personally I have not any very great enthusiasm for it, and although I recognise that we can do what we consider best for the country, it adds nothing to our ability to do our best that we have to make this declaration, just as, on the other hand, it is not the obstacle to national effort in the Dáil which the people outside the Dáil declare it is.</P>
    <P>Recognising, however, that the abolition of the oath has a good deal of support in the country, I do not think that the Ministry is justified in the step it is taking.  They may get 152 elected persons to come here, but getting representatives is not the important thing.  What we want to aim at rather is to get a Dáil that is truly representative of the opinion of the country.  I feel that this Bill will not give us that kind of Dáil, that we will not have a body of opinion here that will be truly representative of the opinion of the country.  That people have not a right to do wrong has now been debated over a number of years.  I believe they have a right to do wrong if they so choose, in spite of what other people may say, and I believe even that a minority of the people have a right to disfranchise themselves if they so choose, so long as they do so acting legally and constitutionally.</P>
    <P>I confess that I feel that the attitude and policy of Fianna Fáil is injuring, to some extent at least, the credit of the country, but, on the other hand, there is no short cut to stability, and <Col N="1054" /> while we must do all we can to encourage it, after all, stability is rather a thing of natural growth.  I feel that we cannot create the right conditions through a method of pressure that will undoubtedly have reactions that will not be favourable to that natural growth which in the end is the only thing that stands or lasts.</P>
    <P>No matter what the President or his Ministry may think, the agitation against the declaration is not likely to be dropped.  On the other hand, it can be carried on in the Dáil, and if this Chamber, through representatives here, decides some day later to take up the question with England, no one can foretell what may happen.  Our Party did not go before the electorate claiming a mandate from the people on this question of the oath.  We hardly discussed it at all except when interruptions from a crowd, here and there, compelled us to make a declaration on it. But, on the other hand, we question the wisdom of the Dáil making it obligatory by an Act on representatives or individuals going before the electorate seeking support to become their representatives to have to make a declaration which, later on, by an act of the representatives of this country in conjunction with the representatives of England, may be removed or altered in our Constitution.  I do not think that such a disability should be inserted in an Act of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>As I said yesterday, when debating the other Bill, I am very strongly convinced that if the present position is permitted to continue for the three or four or possibly five years which would be the life of the present Government, and which is not unlikely, that when another General Election comes along, not through an act of this Dáil and not through any act of the present Ministry, but by the act of the people themselves, those who go before them seeking a mandate to represent them will be asked by the people whether or not they are prepared to make a declaration to the Constitution.  I would prefer to leave it to the people to make that demand from those who seek to be their representatives.  Further, I feel that if three or four years are allowed to elapse before the country has to go <Col N="1055" /> through another General Election that the great body of the electorate will not be satisfied to give their support and their votes to men merely to abstain and to keep away from the Chamber where the work of the nation is done.</P>
    <P>I and my Party feel very strongly that there again time would do more to solve this problem for the Dáil and the country than anything that we can do by passing this Act.  On the other hand, you may pass this Act, but you will contribute nothing to a solution of a problem that is here not for our day but for generations, a problem which undoubtedly must be got rid of and must be solved in some other way than by the method the Ministry proposes. We feel very strongly that the Ministry should not introduce this Bill at the present time and should not put upon the Dáil the obligation of asking support for it.  We believe that it could very well wait, and that perhaps when it became a matter of urgency and when the country was again faced with coming to a decision as to who are to be responsible for carrying on the affairs of this State for another three, four or five years, that then the electorate themselves, the sovereign people, would compel men to make this declaration which the President wants to compel them to make through an Act which, in my view will not have that effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party went through the last general election and previous general elections and bye-elections while making it well known that so far as the oath is concerned it gives it very little importance.  We were not going to fight an election on the question of the oath, its retention or abolition.  We think that the oath device is a bad one, no matter of whom it may be required to be taken or in what conditions.  We think that an oath of allegiance is one that ought not to be imposed on, or required of, any Parliamentary representative.  I admit that there is a certain amount of logic in the case which says that as the men who are elected are obliged to take the oath by the Constitution so the candidate for election, at an election under <Col N="1056" /> that Constitution, is presumed implicitly to have accepted the liability to take that oath.  That is unquestionable. But to me it seems to be an unwise and impolitic procedure, quite apart from the present circumstances, to deal with this Electoral (Amendment) Bill in this fashion, independent of any other matter relating to electoral law, and particularly when we are not, so far as one can know, likely to have a general election within the next three months. I say that the Labour Party has never taken the view that the oath is a matter of supreme importance.  We believe that the Oireachtas, under the Constitution, has all the powers that are required to develop this country to the utmost that it is possible to develop it within a considerable time&mdash;I will not say how many years&mdash;and in my belief one does not need to attempt to alter the form of an institution until the activities of that institution are impeded by the form, and so far as I have been able to see within the last five years, no activity of any kind, on the part of the Government of this country, has met any obstacle in the way of putting into effect its desires, its intentions, or its will.  And while saying that it makes one very often angry and cynical as to the people who are making trouble and so much fuss about the oath which is an oath to the Constitution which gives power to the elected representatives of the people, and to the people at the back of their representatives, to do anything that they require to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With Deputy Baxter I realise that we must consider the circumstances in which this Bill is introduced.  The Minister for Agriculture, I understand, made it quite clear that this is one of three Bills indicating part of a whole policy, and that it has no particular value of itself.  I presume he meant only of value because it is part of a trio of Bills.  I think on that account, if on no other, that this Bill ought to be opposed on Second Reading without prejudice to what members may think of the Bill which may come forward dealing with electoral reform at some future time.  We have been told that there is to be a considerable scheme of electoral reform, and I would have <Col N="1057" /> imagined that would be a scheme which might be examined by a committee representative of Parties before introduction to the House, and I think it would have been the right thing if such a step had been taken before this small part of what is presumably a larger scheme had been introduced.  Speaking of the logic of this Bill, if one were dealing with it as a matter apart from politics, and the political effects of any activity, and if one wanted to arrive at the condition that elected people ought not to be allowed to make of no effect the votes of the people, there is another way of dealing with it which I think much preferable to this, a way which would leave the authority in the hands of the people, by making the appeal to the people themselves.</P>
    <P>We had in the last Dáil the case of a member who was elected at a bye-election and who was absent for many months.  In addition, having once taken his seat, he remained absent.  Now, it seems to me to be a perfectly reasonable and logical proposition that if any person elected to the House does not take his seat within a reasonable period of time, or, having taken his seat, declines to attend the House for a given period of time, that that automatically makes a vacancy in that constituency, and gives the people an opportunity of electing a successor.  I think that would be a preferable way of dealing with this question rather than requiring a candidate to take an oath before election. But there is another very serious consideration. How is this going to be made effective without depriving the electors of the right to nominate a perfectly loyal and constitutional member who may not be in the country at the time of the election, who may be ill and unable to make a declaration, who may, in fact, be in prison, or who may have been expelled the country by the decision of the Ministry?</P>
    <P>A year ago Deputy Cooper and ex-Deputy Esmonde paid a visit to Australia in furtherance of certain activities which are associated with the duties of membership of the Dáil.  Had there been an election&mdash;it was not impossible&mdash;sprung upon the country during the absence of those Deputies, it would have been impossible to make a <Col N="1058" /> nomination of either of them.  Were any Deputy or any citizen imprisoned, and if it was the desire of certain people to test the feelings of the people regarding that imprisonment, as has been done so often in Irish politics, there is no likelihood&mdash;I do not say it is impossible&mdash;but there is little likelihood of them being able to get that declaration from the prisoner under the scheme outlined in this Bill.  A Peace Commissioner is not a regular officer operating throughout the Saorstát, and I am not sure that a commissioner for oaths has a commission for anybody if he does not reside within the British Dominions or Great Britain, so that there is a very extensive barrier against the election of people who might well be required as candidates under our electoral system.  I think it is an effective barrier against the election of any person who, at the time of the election, is not in the country and is not capable of taking the oath.  It is not so very long since&mdash;perhaps the President will have recollection of it&mdash;when even this Ministry gave urgent advice to people within this country not to take their seats in the Parliament to which they had been elected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>They gave urgent advice to people not to take their seats in the Parliament to which they had been elected.  Fundamentally, in my view, and it is a personal view, there is a much more serious objection.  Ministers and Deputies have declared many times that we have retained the right of the people, by the very phrasing of the Constitution, to exercise all powers of government and that all authority is derived from the people of Ireland.  It is true that it says that all powers and authority shall be exercised through certain machinery set up by the Constitution, but the ultimate right lies with the people even to change the Constitution, even to denounce the Treaty.  So long as the people are clear and have the direct question put to them, whether they wish to denounce the Treaty and change the Constitution, they have a right to do it&mdash;not a constitutional right, but a fundamental, natural right to do it by other <Col N="1059" /> machinery than that of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Let us assume this as a possibility, namely, that a majority of the people determine in the course of years that they will no longer recognise this Constitution, that they will no longer be willing to accept the Treaty, and they are persuaded by political elements outside the Dáil that the non-oath policy is the right one.  How do you desire that people having possibly&mdash;I put it merely as a possibility&mdash;that view can give expression to it?  If you debar them from the opportunity of electing people, of giving their votes to candidates with a certain policy, you are inevitably driving them to other methods.  This is undoubtedly an outlet for political aspirations&mdash;a foolish one if you like&mdash;and it is, perhaps, quite illogical, but the right of voting for people opposed to the Constitution is an outlet.  The retention of this freedom to these people is not really a very great evil.  I have suggested a further appeal to these people, periodically if you like, every six months if necessary, and if they are prepared to elect people who will not take their seats, then by all means, after a period of time, give them an opportunity of electing somebody else, but do not close down the opportunity to people to give expression to a political view, even to the extent of a revolutionary view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is far better to let revolutionary expression be through a vote than through a revolver or a rifle.  It is not the value of the oath or the evil effects of the oath that I am concerned with in this matter, but I think it is an unwise proposition to deal with this Bill at this time, even if I agreed with every clause of it.  My further objection is that the Bill is going to make it impossible for electors to elect a person who would, in the normal course of his life, take such oath, and twenty-five of them if necessary, but by the accident of circumstances and time he is not available.  He should not be debarred from being elected, and the people who support him should not be denied the opportunity of nominating him.  There are other objections, to which no doubt expression will be given in the course <Col N="1060" /> of the discussion on the Bill, but I urge on the Dáil that these reasons justify the non-acceptance of the Second Reading motion.  As I say, there are differences of view as to the merits of the Bill.  There are differences of view in this Party as to the merits of the Bill, as to the principle involved in it, but there is general agreement that the surrounding circumstances, the conditions under which this Bill is introduced, make it inadvisable that it should be pressed to a Second Reading to-day.</P>

      <P>Let me deal with one point first. Deputy Johnson made a point that people might decide to nominate a person who may be overseas or in prison, and that that practical difficulty was an overwhelming objection to this Bill.  That is not so.  That is a Committee point and can be dealt with later.  There are obvious ways, which I need not indicate, of dealing with that, and Deputies may put it aside for the moment.  The Dáil may take it that my position in regard to this Bill is, quite frankly, that it is a Public Safety Bill.  Not putting a tooth in it, that is the position of the Government.  It is as much a Public Safety Bill as the other.  That is our position, and, while I may be very often definite and, perhaps, one-sided in my view, I cannot understand any other point of view on this Bill.  I am frankly unable to understand the point of view of Deputies who think that the attitude of the Party against which this Bill is directed is not a direct threat to the State and to the Constitution.  The Party against which this Bill is directed has for five years been endeavouring to prostitute the Constitution.  That statement was made by Deputies from other Parties in this House, and it cannot be denied. It is the fact with regard to the referendum and also with regard to the oath.  It is an effort to belittle and prostitute the Constitution.  The whole tendency of the actions and propaganda of that Party is clearly directed towards engendering hatred and contempt for the Constitution and for the people who are endeavouring to work it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1061" /> Further, that would be so even if this particular Party were moderate and strictly constitutional in its language. But the Party against which this Bill is directed, in addition to attacking the Constitution in that way, go very much further.  Their spokesmen constantly explain that their present attitude is due to the stress of circumstances, that their whole object is to create a situation where revolutionary forces can work, and that it is merely an interim attitude.  Deputy Baxter and Deputy Johnson and other Deputies know that these are the statements of the leaders, statements made to ordinary citizens in the country, that their attitude is merely interim.  The leader of that Party, when launching it six months ago, stated openly&mdash;and it was in line with everything he said for the last four years; I do not go back to the civil war, to his responsibilities, to his invitations, and to all sorts of violence&mdash;that the differences between majority rule and minority rights would yet have to be bloodily fought out.  Other prominent men throughout the country have always kept the threat of the gun behind their activities.  They have openly stated that their attitude at present is merely interim.  They never denied the right of the minority, as long as it was strong enough, to vindicate its policy in arms. That party has been attacking, not so much individual members of the Government, but the Government itself, the Oireachtas, which represents the majority of the people.

      <P>You can answer it again.  Of course, anybody who faces up to it must realise that there was. Here you have people definitely denouncing this Government as &ldquo;agents of England,&rdquo;&ldquo;tools of England,&rdquo;&ldquo;Ministers going over to England selling their country,&rdquo;&ldquo;traitors,&rdquo; and a junta.  And that has not influenced in any respect the men who hold the guns! Supposing that party had adopted the Constitution, realising that the people, whatever else they did, or did not, had decided that the Constitution had to be worked, and had come into the Dáil and taken their part in shaping the policy of the country, would the gunmen be as strong to-day? If any Deputies believe that, then I cannot argue with them.  Every attempt is being made, even here, to confuse the minds of the country, both with regard to the provisions of this Bill and the old subject, the oath.</P>
      <P>Deputy Baxter started off with the statement that nobody was enthusiastic about the oath to the King.  Surely we ought to realise that &ldquo;the King&rdquo; is only a constitutional way of saying the Government elected by the majority will of the people.  Surely, at this hour of the day, with all the education we have and a Constitutional Government for five years, a leader of a party at least should think it his business, if he has not realised that already, to think about it and not to add to the confusion that is being caused by ignoramuses in the country who talk about &ldquo;the King&rdquo; and &ldquo;the oath.&rdquo;  I cannot understand the Deputy's position.  Constitutionally, there is no doubt whatever about it, the King is no more than the Government elected by the majority of the people. Yet, people say they have no enthusiasm for it.  Is it not hard to blame the ordinary citizen, the small farmer and the farmers' sons who are taken in by that sort of thing, when leaders of parties here give it the support of their authority?  I have every enthusiasm for the oath.</P>

      <P>I have every enthusiasm for the oath, and so long as the oath is an oath of allegiance to the Government, constituted by this Oireachtas, representing the majority will of the people, I have every enthusiasm for it, and it is only muddle-headedness and mixed thinking that talks about want of enthusiasm.  Deputy Johnson advanced rather new theories for him.  The people have a right not only to change the Constitution in a constitutional way, but they have a right, if the majority wishes, to change the Constitution in an unconstitutional way &mdash;a fundamental right! That was the proposition he put forward.  I entirely agree, but will the Deputy realise what way they have if the majority of the people decides at any time to change the Constitution by any other methods than constitutional methods.  They may do so, but they have only one means of doing it&mdash;violence.  Deputies must realise that there is no other way.  Any attempt to find a half-way house leads inevitably to violence.  To use the Constitution at present, as it is being used, leads inevitably to violence.  If Deputy Johnson has not stated that, he often stated something that was very like it. We are at one on the point.  A majority may change the Constitution.  I will not even argue whether they have a fundamental right to do it.  But they have only one method, and that is by violence.  I want to make that clear to the country, and the idea of this Bill is to make it clear to the country that this tinkering with the Constitution and this prostitution of the Constitution must inevitably end in violence.  And if this Bill does that, then it will have effected its purpose.  People may say this Bill will drive certain sections of the people to violence.  What is the meaning of that?  What does that imply?  It implies that there is a section in this country who, rather than <Col N="1064" /> accept the Constitution, which, twice at least, has been approved by the majority of the people, are prepared to use violence.</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows that interruption is not to the point.  I will come to it.  That is what it implies.  If there is a minority in the country who are determined to use violence rather than use the Constitution as a means of changing the Constitution, then the sooner that fight is over the better. That is my view.  I think, after five years, the time has come to make up our minds about it.  If there is a section in the country who rather than use the Constitution are prepared to resort to violence, the sooner, for the good of this country and the people of this country, that fight is over the better, and it is the duty not only of the Government, but of this Parliament, to deal with that fight or resign.  It has been repeated in this debate that the oath might be changed by agreement afterwards, and that the Treaty might be changed by agreement.  As far as I am concerned, let any majority that likes come into the Dáil and change the Treaty in any way they like, not only change the oath, but change every clause in the Treaty, in any way they like, declare a Republic or go back to the Union.  A majority of the people have a right to do one or the other. Let them come in and do it.  We are not stopping them.  What we are trying to effect is that the representatives who get a majority will at least take the responsibility.  We are trying to obviate the position where you have a party outside who will not take the responsibility here.  Some of them, at least, would never have the guts to take the responsibility for it, and that is really what is keeping them out. They want a majority here to do it for them, and to take all the chances there are.  That is what we want to avoid. We are not changing the constitutional right of anyone to change the Constitution. Our position is that you can have no seriously-thought-out or considered change unless it is done by <Col N="1065" /> people who have afterwards to take the consequences.  I think this Bill is vital.  I think now is the time for it. I say again in times like these, the phrases I deprecate are &ldquo;Put it off,&rdquo;&ldquo;Do it in some other way,&rdquo; accompanied by the pious suggestion that &ldquo;A lot more may be done in six months or by Tibbs' Eve.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>If he says that, of course, I cannot argue with him on the belief that it is one, but as far as I am concerned, according to the latest statement made by the leader of that Party, I cannot accept it as settled that Mr. de Valera and his Party are an unconstitutional Party.  He has previously preached the doctrine of violence, but he has stated for some time past that he has given over that doctrine, and, though his objects may be to alter the Constitution, or even to renounce portions of the Treaty, I do not think that <Col N="1066" /> because that is his aim, if he acts in a constitutional way towards that aim, that he and his Party can be described as unconstitutional.  The Minister's speech reminded me very much of speeches that I listened to and heard of in the days of my youth.  When Parnell was asked what would become of him and what would he do when he and his party were being sought to be suppressed by the British Government, his answer was: &ldquo;Captain Moonlight will take my place.&rdquo;  The Minister seems to suggest to-day&mdash;in fact, he has gone a very long way towards suggesting&mdash;that the sooner violence breaks out in the country the better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>If other Deputies are to be allowed to proceed in this House, I can claim the same right. What I was endeavouring to say was that apart from whether the authorities in the country are identical or not, the principle is the same principle that is endeavoured to be formulated and acted upon by the Minister and his Government to-day.  That is that a party which avowedly is acting constitutionally, whether the Minister believes it or not&mdash;the party states that it is&mdash;should be frustrated by direct Parliamentary measures from taking that course, I say that frustration will be the sure and rapid means of driving it into revolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that it is the duty <Col N="1067" /> of this Parliament to deal with what he has described as that fight.  I will ask him a question now.  Is it the duty of the Government to precipitate and to hasten that fight?  Is it the duty of the Government, instead of trying to encourage methods on the lines of peace, to encourage methods on the lines of violence?  I believe that that is the real upshot of the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>I was sorry to hear him state that he believed that inevitably the action of the Fianna Fáil Party would lead to violence.  He said that all this tinkering with the Constitution must end in violence.  I respectfully beg to disagree with him there, and I think that in removing this means of expression of public opinion&mdash;because that is practically all it is&mdash;the Minister and his colleagues are removing perhaps the only safety valve between this country and violence.  It is a safety valve. These people have been elected according to the electoral law of the country and they have refused to take their seats.  No one can accuse me of being in favour of an abstention policy.  I was not in favour of an abstention policy, or all that went with it either, in days gone by, and I am not here to defend that policy.  I think it is possibly foolishness in the extreme.  That does not get away from the fundamental fact that if certain electors in the country choose to elect certain people, and they choose to take a certain line of action that it is within their constitutional right to take, that it is not the business of this House, especially at this time and in this way, to dictate to the people&mdash;because that is really what this Bill proposes&mdash;as to what representatives they should return and as to what policy, especially as to what constitutional policy, should be advocated and acted upon by those representatives.</P>
    <P>We hear about the disfranchisement of the constituencies.  I say that it is not our business, if the constituencies choose to disfranchise themselves.  It is the people's business.  If the electors see that they have been fooled, that certain people are not taking the course which the electors were led to believe <Col N="1068" /> they would take if elected, very soon there will be a sufficient amount of public opinion in the country to make those representatives know, at any rate, that the next time they go forward for election they will have to make their position clear and that they will stand very little, if any, chance of being returned.</P>
    <P>This is a matter, to my mind, that fundamentally affects the people and not us here in this Dáil.  It is unfortunate, it is lamentable to say that one-third of the representatives of this State will not take their place in this House.  But is this Bill going to make that section of the people represented in this House if it is passed?  If this Bill is passed, it is true you will have a fuller House.  But will you have representatives of one-third of the people who say to-day that they will not have representatives in the House?  Certainly not.  The effect will be that you will inevitably drive these people who have these views&mdash;which I deprecate perhaps more strongly than any other Deputy&mdash;to other methods, and I am afraid, from the tone of the speech of the Minister for Agriculture, that that is what he wants, because he said that this tinkering with the Constitution, as he calls it, must end in violence, and that this Parliament must deal with that fight, as he described it.  My attitude is to put off that fight as long as possible, and, if possible, for ever.  I do not want any revolution or any civil war in this country.</P>

      <P>This Bill is not, on the face of it, an amendment of the Constitution.  At the same time it is an amendment to the spirit of the Constitution, because in that Constitution there was an oath which we have all taken and subscribed to, and which I join with the Minister for Agriculture in saying that I see no reason for not taking or subscribing to&mdash;and I am not ashamed of doing either one or the other.  But there is nothing in the Constitution to say that before a person submits himself for election he shall necessarily state that if elected he is prepared to take that oath.  Surely the people are not such fools that sooner or later they will not insist upon every candidate that goes forward at any subsequent election making his position clear in this matter.  What right of control have we got over candidates going forward for election?  Will it come to this shortly: that if a candidate goes up for election and makes certain pledges to his constituents and breaks them afterwards he will have to resign his seat, or will have to take a declaration before he goes up for election that every pledge that he takes will be kept? I do not see myself why that should not be.</P>

      <P>If we insist, because some candidates who went forward at the last election let the people think they were going to take their seats here, and have not done so, that, therefore, they should be made to take a declaration henceforward that they will take a certain course, I think that it is going too far.  I think that it is too great an interference upon our part with the will of the electorate.  There is a great deal to be said for the point of view that this state of affairs should cease.  Certainly it should cease.  But it can only thoroughly cease, and properly cease, in one way, and that is when the people come to realise that their ends will not be served by electing men who will not take their seats in this House and will not take the <Col N="1070" /> oath.  Then there will be no prospect of driving a large section of the people into the camp of the revolutionaries; there will be no prospect of an immediate civil war, or a speeding up, or precipitating or hastening of this fight that the Minister for Agriculture is so anxious that we should deal with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was heard of this Bill during the general election?  Was there a word said about it from any platform?  If there is justice or merit in these proposals, how is it that they were never mentioned before?  I never heard or read a syllable either from a public platform, or in the public Press, or at any time in this House during the four years that I have been here, suggesting that such a step as this should be taken.  Why is it taken now?  The Minister frankly told us.  He says that it is taken for public safety.  I say that it will not secure public safety.  I do not say that it will disturb public safety.  I do not go so far as that, but I say that it will incur the risk of disturbing public safety, which leaving things as they are will not.  If there was no necessity or urgency for this Bill during all those years, what is the urgency and necessity for it to-day? It is being linked up with a measure to prevent and repress crime and criminals.  How is this Bill, when passed, going in any way or in any degree to bring the murderers of the Vice-President to justice?  How is it, further, going to prevent even a similar atrocious tragedy taking place?  It has been suggested that this crime, which we all deplore and regret, and which the country deplores and regrets, was, in some way or other, linked up with the policy of Fianna Fáil.  I think there is about as much truth in that&mdash;that this atrocious crime was linked up with the policy and actions of Fianna Fáil&mdash; as there is sense or statemanship in linking up an Electoral Bill like this with the Public Safety Bill, on which we have been engaged during the last few days.  I think they have nothing to do with one another.  It has not been shown that the country will be more secure or more free from possible turmoil and strife if this Bill is passed than it will be if it is not.  On the contrary, I am forced to the conclusion <Col N="1071" /> that the very fact of passing this Bill at the present time, the very fact of linking it up with the Public Safety Bill, the very fact of indulging in the old habit, so well known in the days of the British administration of this country, of linking politics and crime will incur a risk&mdash;a grave risk&mdash;for which I certainly do not feel that I could take responsibility.</P>

      <P>In principle, I do not object to this measure.  I am not an abstentionist and never have been. I rise, like Deputy Redmond, to utter a warning regarding the wisdom of introducing and enacting this measure here and now.  I am glad that the Minister for Agriculture has told the House that there is no doubt about the purpose and the object for which this measure is introduced.  He told us that it was introduced as a Public Safety Bill.  I would like to know from the Government if it is a Public Safety Bill or Public Safety Bills they require. Have they taken, under the strictly-so-called Public Safety Bill, the powers they require or have they not?  Or have they put down a series of thimbles with a pea under each so that they will be sure of catching everybody?  I say to the Government in absolute good faith that in the Bill, designated the Public Safety Bill, they have very ample powers to deal with any crime that has been committed or is about to be committed.  I say to the Government most seriously to take in that measure&mdash;in an amended form, if it is thought prudent on the part of the House to amend it&mdash;all the powers that are necessary to repress assassination, murder and crime but not to enact in the name of Constitutionalism and Parliamentary Government a series of Acts that will provoke any element in the country.  It is thought by many, who are supporters of Constitutional institutions, outside this House that the Government have, by linking up those measures, gone a step too far.  I agree with that opinion, and I say again that there are ample powers in the Public Safety Bill, strictly so called, to deal with all forms of crime, no matter by whom or by what means committed.  I <Col N="1072" /> would ask the Government most seriously, not that I am opposed to the principle of this measure, but as a matter of discretion and to avoid the danger of a public explosion, to drop this Bill and confine themselves to the Public Safety Bill, strictly so-called.</P>

      <P>There has been a lot of talk within the last two days about the magnificent wording of the provisions in the Constitution regarding the liberty of the individual and public right and so on, as if it were those things in the Constitution which mattered and as if there was anything worth speaking about in the Constitution and in its language if it did not provide us with and guarantee us the institutions that we have here for ordering the government of the country and securing peace to the people.  The measure before us has, as its purpose, to secure the existence and the power of the Dáil.  There will be nothing left for us out of any clause of our Constitution if we cannot preserve the existence of the Dáil and its authority and control in the country.  We cannot do that if we are going to allow a situation to grow up by which, gradually, different parts of the country are to be cut off from connection with the Dáil&mdash;cut off from having representatives here.  The authority of the Dáil comes from the fact that the people who come here are the elected representatives of the people and that they come with powers complete and full to order in every way that may be required the life of the country.  They come here to see, with the administrative machinery at the disposal of the Dáil&mdash;the Army, the Police and the Civil Service&mdash;that the measures representing the desires of the people which are hammered out here are given effect and force in the country.  Some of the weakness that our people in the country suffer from at present arises from the fact that the authority, the strength and the efficiency of the Dáil to do its own work is being undermined by the policy of abstention which Deputy Redmond thought worthy of condemnation some time ago but does not seem to think worthy of it now.</P>

      <P>I am sorry if I misunderstood the Deputy.  It is no use introducing Public Safety Bills to enable your administrative machinery to cope with criminals if the fount of your authority is to be undermined and destroyed.  If you look around the country, you will find that some of the districts in which the greatest percentage of absentee votes were cast are very backward, out-of-the-way districts. Just as we have to carry primary education compulsorily to our people, to a certain extent, we shall, apparently, have to carry political education to our people, with the exercise of a certain amount of compulsion. We put a measure before the Dáil which will have the effect of strengthening it as an institution by preventing false or specious pleas keeping away the additional members required here if the work of the Dáil is to be properly done.  It is because of recent circumstances that it has been forced on the Executive Council that a continuance of this weakening, with&mdash;owing to want of understanding and want of education&mdash;the possibility of further weakening of the personnel of the Dáil, cannot be allowed.  The Dáil has to regard the present Bill as one which provides for the completely filling up of this institution with representatives of the different parts of the country, in order that its deliberations may be full and complete and in order that the different parts of the country may be properly represented and linked up, as is provided by our Constitution.</P>
      <P>It is argued that this is the wrong time to take this step.  There may be differences of opinion on that.  It is interesting and helpful to us to realise that, even while different members and different Parties in the Dáil may consider this to be the wrong time to introduce this measure, they admit that there is nothing wrong in principle in the measure.  That is helpful.  It is the responsibility of the Executive Council to size up the situation and to arrive at their own decision.  It is their duty, then, to make recommendations to the Dáil as to what they think should be done, and this represents their recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask Deputy Baxter, as leader of the Farmers' Party, to explain <Col N="1074" /> more fully, in fairness to himself and in fairness to others, his meaning of the phrase, &ldquo;The people have the right to do wrong.&rdquo;  The interpretation that can be placed on that may mean much.  We pass here legislation of all kinds marking out as offences&mdash; whether criminal or otherwise&mdash;many acts that a person might think he was entitled to do.  For instance, a person is prevented from putting his dustbin outside his door at a particular hour and thus obstructing the pathway.  Are we to understand that a person has the right to do that?  Are we to understand that a person has a right to shoot an Executive Minister if he is so inclined? In fairness to himself and in fairness to all of us, I think Deputy Baxter should comment further on that statement.</P>
    <P>Various suggestions have been made as to how the position that is sought after might more easily be got.  If I understand rightly, Deputy Johnson considers that one way would be to allow professed absentees, whether they profess themselves to be so or not when as candidates, to go up for election, declare their seats vacant after a particular time, and then have another election.  Anybody who has had experience of elections, anybody who realises the cost to the State of the carrying out of elections on any kind of a large scale, or even the tiresomeness and cost of having successive by-elections in any one constituency, will realise that a very good case might be made against such a proceeding as that.</P>
    <P>While Deputy Baxter feels that the public are likely at the next general election to find out in a very definite way from candidates whether or not they are going to take their places in the Dáil, the machinery is certainly not there.  Everyone has had experience of the way in which the issue before the last general election was confounded. There is one straight way of clearing this particular issue, and that is by getting a declaration from candidates that they are going to shoulder their responsibilities here, that they will take their places in the Dáil and shoulder the responsibilities that come to them here.  Deputy Johnson points out that without an immediate declaration of the present seats that may be <Col N="1075" /> involved, this measure is unnecessary. It gives those people who are in the absentee position to-day a better chance of considering their position, a better chance of considering how their future ought to be shaped.</P>
    <P>Various Deputies from different parts of the House have taken upon themselves the duty of pointing out that there is no connection between the Fianna Fáil policy of to-day and the policy of assassination that certain other people in the country have apparently adopted.  I think there is such a thing in chemistry as a body that is called a catalyzer, a body that has this effect, that without its presence in a situation another body could not have the particular reactions that it is able to have.  Personally, I think, and am convinced, that the abstentionist Party in the country to-day is a catalyzer for assassination and murder, and it is because that is so to a very large extent that we have to declare ourselves very definitely here as to what is our policy with regard to abstention and with regard to people who would organise an abstentionist party in the country.  If the seats are not being declared immediately, it gives those who stand for abstention to-day plenty of time to think over the matter and see where they and their policy are tending.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. BRENNAN Mr. BRENNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BRENNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to say a few words in support of the opposition to the Bill; firstly, because I think it is an attempt to perpetuate and make more secure in our Constitution one clause which is more responsible for instability in the State than anything else.  Another thing struck me very forcibly when I heard the speech made by the Minister for Agriculture a while ago.  He told us that he considered Fianna Fáil as an unconstitutional Party.  I think this House is quite free to believe from that that they are to be brought within the meshes of an illegal association, and if they are to be brought within the meshes of this illegal association, and if the powers to be conferred upon the Executive Council by virtue of the Public Safety Act are utilised, there will be no need for this Bill because they will have all those people deported; they will not <Col N="1076" /> be in the country.  They have, at least, that means of dealing with them.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, I partly thought that if they got through with the Public Safety Bill they would not bother about this measure, as they would have nobody to apply it to.  This Bill contains a double-barrelled feature which, to my mind, brings about over-lapping. I think it would be quite enough, certainly there would be a lot of commonsense in it, and probably it would meet with no opposition in the House, if the Government brought in a Bill which would declare that after a certain period&mdash;the second part of the Bill does that&mdash;the candidate who did not take his seat would automatically be unseated and disqualified.  I think that should be quite sufficient without making him swear before he is nominated that he will take his seat if elected.</P>
      <P>Irrespective of what the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Redmond, or anybody may say about the oath, and no matter how it is tried to convince the people that the oath is only an oath to the Constitution, we will never be able to get a large proportion of the people, including myself&mdash;and I may be muddle-headed, as the Minister said&mdash; to believe, as I believe, that as long as the King is referred to he is there.</P>

      <P>We are apparently proposing to deal with people who will not agree to take the oath in the Constitution in a very different manner to that which other countries adopted in the past.  The British Constitution contained an oath, and in 1847 there was a man named de Rothschild elected who refused to take the oath.  Did they put him out?  They did not.  He sat in that House eleven years without taking the oath.  He sat below the Bar.  He did not take part in the discussions, but he was not removed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. BRENNAN Mr. BRENNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BRENNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason was this: that oath contained a provision to which he would not subscribe.  It happened to be a religious provision, <Col N="1078" /> but that did not alter the case.  That man sat in the British House of Commons for eleven years below the Bar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BRENNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I have already said so.  At the end of eleven years, when the House of Commons was appointing a Committee to draft amendments to an Oaths Bill before the House of Lords, they appointed Baron de Rothschild Chairman of the Committee. In 1851 a man named Mr. Solomon was elected.  He also refused to take the oath for the same reason.  He insisted on taking his seat.  He was below the Bar, and on one occasion he came above the Bar, and he was not noticed there until he had voted three times. What did they do?  They simply put him below the Bar; they did not put him out of the House; he remained there.  If those things have been done elsewhere, if the right of those people has been acknowledged, and if the oaths in other Constitutions have been changed to meet the wishes of elected representatives, I do not see why we ought to&mdash;well, pass this Bill to-day, at any rate.  I do not think that a case has been made for the Bill, and I believe the Government will be very well advised, even at this time, to withdraw at least the first part of the measure. Probably if they did that we would be all agreeable to the remainder.</P>

I am not, and never have been, seriously alarmed about the wording of the declaration which I was obliged to take as one of those who stood for election, having agreed to accept the Constitution.  To that extent I am not opposed to the principle of this Bill.  The Minister for Local Government, and I presume he expressed the view of his colleagues, appeared to be alarmed at the extent of the vote given for the Fianna Fáil in the recent general election.</P>

      <P>I have given this matter careful consideration, and I believe that the proposal that Deputy Johnson has put before the House for a solution of this problem is the right and proper one, and one that would detach this Bill from the other obnoxious Bills with which it has been associated, because this is part of the scheme, as the Minister for Lands and Agriculture stated.  If people ever got votes under false pretences the Fianna Fáil Party got them&mdash;a Party close on fifty.  Let us then, at the earliest opportunity, for the sake of the people who have been deceived, give those people an opportunity of reviewing their decision.  The only way it can be done, and done at the earliest possible moment, is by adopting the suggestion put forward by Deputy Johnson.  If that is the Government's desire, if they are anxious to give the people who have been deceived an opportunity of reconsidering their point of view, then declare those seats vacant within a specified time.  I would vote for such a proposal, believing it to be the right way to do the thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil candidates in the last general election led people to believe, by the extravagant language that they used, that this oath was a deadly poisonous pill, but we have been told by one of their representatives, whom we were glad to welcome here, that <Col N="1080" /> it is not an oath at all.  Look at the fine, healthy, contented-looking appearance of Deputy Belton.  If we believed all we have been told about this deadly poisonous pill Deputy Belton would either be suffering from a nervous breakdown or he would be dead after taking that declaration.  The assurance that Deputy Belton has given in the Press and from this House to the people who are outside, and who believe that this was a deadly poisonous pill, should enable them to examine their consciences before they compel this House to take action which will enable the people who voted for them to review their decision.</P>
    <P>There is only one thing which prevents me from voting for the Bill as it stands, and that is a statement made here yesterday, and, I believe, repeated to-day by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture.  I say quite honestly that, as a member of the Labour Party, I would vote for this measure were it not for the fact that it is associated with the other Bill, to which we have taken genuinely serious objection.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health talked about giving political education to the people by compulsion&mdash;by compulsion, mark you!  I do not believe in that policy.  He referred to Deputy Baxter's statement that the people should have the right to do wrong, and asked if they should have the right to put dustbins outside their own back or front doors without the permission of the local authority. Has that any bearing upon the issue we are discussing, as to whether or not people, at the right time and in the right way, have the right to say that the Constitution should be amended in a constitutional way?</P>

      <P>So far as I am concerned&mdash;and I look upon this as a very serious matter, and I was chased from pillar to post in the constituency I represent on this particular issue&mdash;I made my position quite plain.  I invited defeat by stating that I would come in here again and take the oath I previously took without any mental disturbance. That is why I feel I am bound to express my view on the Bill and to give my reasons for the opposition to it in its present form, particularly at the present time, and especially after what the Minister for Lands and Agriculture said.  The Constitution, in my opinion, can be altered in a constitutional way, and I am not prepared to give facilities to people to alter or amend it in an unconstitutional way.  We who are here have, regardless of Party, accepted the Constitution, willingly or unwillingly, and if we have accepted it the proper way to amend it is through the medium of this House.  I believe that the Constitution should be amended in a constitutional way.  I believe it could easily be done so as to allow those public representatives who are now outside to come in here and ease their consciences if the people decide to send them in.  The way to do it is by moving a resolution, if and when any Deputy thinks fit to do so, requesting the President to open up negotiations with the people with whom we negotiated the Treaty and who made this clause the tied one in the Constitution.  It cannot be amended by meetings and by resolutions passed at Burgh Quay and elsewhere, and we had better make up our minds on that. It being agreed by the Minister for Local Government, and I know the other Ministers agree to it also, that the people in the last election were deliberately deceived by Fianna Fáil candidates, give the people opportunity to examine their consciences and review <Col N="1082" /> their position, and the only way to do that is by declaring these seats vacant. There would then be vacancies in every constituency and the people would have an opportunity of reviewing their decision.</P>
      <P>If they confirm their previous decision it would be their own responsibility, but at any rate they would get a constitutional way of deciding, one way or the other.  Those of us who were in the old Dáil are well aware that a Cabinet Committee was set up by the late Ministry to inquire into the flaws in the Constitution that could be amended, as a result of the experience of its working for the previous three or four years.  Did that Committee&mdash;presided over by An Ceann Comhairle&mdash; recommend that this amendment should be made in the Constitution?  That Committee made its report to the Government before the last General Election.  If it made this recommendation, and if the Government made up their minds that that recommendation was going to be put into effect they should have told the people straight and fair that they were going to do this if they were returned to power. This is a big issue of policy.  We have had Deputy Gorey, on the other hand, in response to an interruption from this side of the House, saying, &ldquo;We want another fight.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I have given a fair explanation of my position in regard to this whole matter.  It is a question as to whether the people should be given an opportunity immediately&mdash; and the sooner the better&mdash;to review their recent decision.  But at any rate it was the responsibility of the retiring Government to make a proper and a straightforward declaration to the people on this very important issue on a question of policy when they were looking for their votes.  At any rate I want to make it quite clear so far as I am concerned that the declaration I had to take has caused me no mental disturbance in the wide world since I took it.  The Minister for Local Government said that the abstentionist policy of the Fianna Fáil Party was undermining the Constitution.  I believe now, as I have always believed, that an abstentionist policy can never succeed in any country unless it is backed up and supported by a military organisation. I believe further that if the Government had not, in this alarming and uncalled-for manner, brought in this Bill, the policy of abstention was going to kill the abstentionists, and that the people who were deceived as a result of the exaggerated statements and false promises made would make it impossible for any abstentionists&mdash;at any rate for as large a number as were returned in the last election&mdash;ever to be returned again.</P>

      <P>I think that there is very little use in Deputies who are opposed to this measure endeavouring to make debating points and putting before the House the fact that certain precedents were followed in the British House of Commons which were different from what we are following. I asked the Deputy to explain that point.  The whole thing could be summed up by the words &ldquo;religious scruples.&rdquo;  The particular position that we have got to deal with is no question whatever of religious scruples; it is a deliberate attempt, as was rightly said by the President in his opening statement, to bring Parliamentary institutions into disrepute.  The point has been made in this debate that the Bill will not get representatives of these people into the House.  I beg to suggest that there is no foundation for that argument, for I am of opinion, and I am sure most Deputies will agree with me, that the ballot box is still open at any time, that any Party can be returned to this House, the Party which Deputy Redmond leads, the Labour Party, the Independent Party, or any Party that will be hostile to the Government that is now in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the ballot box is a clear means for giving constitutionalism full and free play.  We have heard a great deal about the cutting off of those so-called constitutional rights of a minority party, but we have heard exceedingly little of the rights in this House which the majority party have. It is perfectly clear that the Treaty issue has now been settled by the recent election once and for ever, and that the only question that remains is this, that it is high time, in the opinion of the people, that Deputies who are elected to the Dáil should come in and take up the responsibilities which that election placed on them.  Great play was made here to-day by some Deputies of the power of the King.  I do not think any Deputy was really serious in suggesting that the power of the King, as far as this particular question is concerned, is a power that would cause any uneasiness at all.  I would point out that the power of the King is simply symbolical: it is simply a symbolical linking up of the various States <Col N="1085" /> which go to make up the Commonwealth of which we are a unit.</P>
    <P>From the time that the Canadian Pacific Railway was built that was the first link which rendered practically useless the prerogative of the King.  That was the first step, and the second step that rendered the prerogative of the King practically worthless was when Canada sent ambassadors to Washington.</P>

      <P>I am in perfect agreement with your ruling, but I think that we on those benches should point out that that is absolutely the case.  I would like to turn now from those issues which, in the opinion of the Speaker, have really no bearing on the Bill to the issues which have a real and a vital bearing on it.  We suggest that the introduction of this measure is the most statesmanlike one that any Government, under existing circumstances could possibly introduce.  It is very moderate in scope and will undoubtedly prevent the disfranchisement of the people in the future.  What are the effects of the policy of abstention? I suggest that they are very widespread. There have been very harmful economic effects from the policy of abstention. Abstention has been most prolific in preventing the normal development of the country; it has <Col N="1086" /> created a feeling of financial insecurity in the country and a feeling of insecurity for the investment of capital. As a business man, speaking with considerable experience, I suggest to the House that it has been one of the means of considerably shortening the credit of this country.  As Deputies know, the tightening up of the credit terms of any country is a matter of very great importance indeed.  Especially is it of great importance if there is a feeling of insecurity amongst capitalists oversea.  Hitherto business men in this country were in a position to use the capital of other countries for the carrying on of their business, but this policy of abstention has led to a general shortening and tightening up of credit in quarters where this country had been accustomed to deal.  It has, in my opinion, increased unemployment. At all events, the Bill now before the House will enable the public to see for themselves where the country really stands.  There is still uncertainty at the moment, amongst the plain man in the street, that anything may happen.  We may have different opinions in this House, but there is the opinion that at any time the Fianna Fáil Party may come into the House and precipitate a General Election and may do a great many other things besides.  I think that in the interests of the country it is time that this feeling of insecurity were done away with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree absolutely with the Deputy on the other side of the House who said that the people were grievously fooled at the last election.  In Dublin City North I found that the Fianna Fáil Party had a dual policy.  They had one policy on their platforms, where they said that they were not going into the Dáil, but I discovered, as one in close touch with the real democratic elements of this city, that there was a widespread feeling amongst the people that Fianna Fáil were undoubtedly going into the Dáil.  I can go further and say that they had a huge advertisement printed in the Press with the words, in block letters, saying &ldquo;We are going in.&rdquo;  What meaning could that have for the ordinary man in the street, or what inference was he to draw from it?  It was a clear move on the part of the <Col N="1087" /> Fianna Fáil people to deceive the electorate. Speaking as one of the representatives of Dublin City North, I can say this, that I am firmly convinced that we would have obtained two more seats but for that particular policy which Fianna Fáil employed.  I agree with Deputy Davin&mdash;perhaps it is a point against ourselves&mdash;that our organisation did not rebut sufficiently that attitude, but it was an attitude that did us a considerable amount of harm.  Perhaps I shall not be saying anything that I should not say if I state to the House that there are a great many members who think that the Government have not gone far enough in the Bill they have introduced.</P>

      <P>We have been pressing &mdash;if Deputy Belton will allow me to proceed&mdash;on the Government the suggestion that was put forward from the other side of the House, namely, to declare vacant all the seats which Fianna Fáil won at the last election.  Simple as it may seem the Executive took the view&mdash;a view which they were perfectly entitled to take&mdash;that if they so decided they would be closing up an avenue for the exercise of constitutionalism on behalf of Fianna Fáil. They were not prepared to take that view and therefore they introduced this measure, which is very moderate in scope, but which for the future will be very practical in effect.  I have no doubt but that the whole country will be behind the Government in the introduction of this Bill.</P>

      <P>The speech of the Minister for Agriculture more than an hour ago, seems to me to have knit the issue upon which we are shortly to divide, and the sooner we divide the better.  His words, as taken down by me, I hope correctly, were as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;If there is to be a change in the Constitution the sooner the fight is over the better.&rdquo; Because an extreme section, a minor section of the Opposition, has reverted to physical violence the National <Col N="1088" /> Executive see suitable opportunity to join battle with their strongest political opponents at the expense, as before, of the whole country.  This fight between political Parties for domination over the lives and livings of the peaceable citizens, must be stopped sooner or later, and the sooner it is stopped the better. For the very same reason that I intend to support any measure clearly intended for the detection of murder, or the prevention of murder, I oppose every section of this peculiarly provocative and I fear, deliberately provocative, Bill.</P>

      <P>As the only member sitting on this side of the House who was a member of, and sat in, the Second Dáil, I think it is only right that I should make my position perfectly clear.  I desire to say at the outset that I was rather surprised to hear the statements made by the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Agriculture, especially the latter when he said it was with great enthusiasm, or at least with enthusiasm, that he took this oath.  I do not think the Minister for Agriculture would have made that statement in the Second Dáil when the Treaty was being debated.  The debate in the Second Dáil on the Treaty hinged around the oath.  Everyone there admitted, including Deputies like myself who voted for the Treaty, that we would only be prepared to take the oath under duress; but everyone there said that the first opportunity presenting itself to remove the oath would be taken advantage of.</P>

      <P>Everybody.  I am perfectly clear on that.  The note sounded by all the speakers, not alone on the anti-Treaty side but on the Treaty side, was that the Treaty would be acceptable were it not for that oath.  As I have said, I was rather surprised to hear the Minister for Agriculture say that he took it with enthusiasm.</P>

      <P>I did not.  I have not changed so far as the oath is concerned. I took it under duress, and so far as I <Col N="1089" /> am concerned any occasion that will present itself to me where I can by my vote remove it, then I am going to vote for its removal.  What I object to in this Bill is that it is a perpectuation of the oath as such.  As I said, we all agreed in the Second Dáil that we were to take it under duress.  The late General Collins stated, in the course of the Treaty debates, that the Treaty was to be taken as the stepping-stone for greater freedom, and I think everyone acquiesced in that view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my position to-day.  That was the position taken by every section in the Second Dáil regardless of what the Minister for Agriculture says.  That was the opinion sent broadcast and given expression to throughout the length and breadth of this country in 1922, and there is no use disguising that fact now.  Deputy Byrne, who has just sat down, stated that Fianna Fáil misled the people during the recent General Election.  In my constituency they used the same manoeuvres that he has stated they used in North Dublin City. I have no doubt in the world but that a great many people were deceived, but could we not leave this to the good sense of the people?  If the people were deceived in the recent election, surely they are not going to allow themselves to be deceived again.  The Minister for Local Government stated that the people were cut off.  A great many of these people decided themselves to be cut off, and decided to disfranchise themselves, and surely we must take it that these people have come to the use of reason and have sufficient intelligence to think for themselves.  I believe that if the people are left to themselves that eventually they will see the futility of voting for a Party who are not coming in to represent them, and also in view of the fact that the country is economically ill at the moment, and the further fact that these people made promises so far as old age pensions, unemployment and other things are concerned, and that they have made no effort since the General Election, when they talked so much about these things, to remedy <Col N="1090" /> the unhappy state of affairs that prevails in the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government stated that the country wants to be developed, and that the country is crying out for development.  It is news to me that this country cannot be developed without an oath and without this Parliament perpetuating a clause in the Treaty which makes it obligatory on Deputies to take an oath.  As I said before, I am perfectly satisfied that the passage of this Bill is not going to ease the situation.  If these people are not enabled to present themselves for election as T.D.'s they are going to create an impossible position, a position of uncertainty in other directions.  You are not going to get rid of these people by a wave of the hand or the passage of this Bill that is now presented to us. The only way to bring these people to a sense of their responsibility is for the people themselves to be educated to such an extent that they will turn them down at the next election.  You are not going to remove this menace, and it is a menace, by this Bill.  I certainly have no sympathy with Fianna Fáil. I had to fight that Party in my own constituency harder than I had to fight any other party.  I did not mince my words so far as it is concerned.  I told them on every occasion what I thought about them.  They certainly endeavoured in every way they could to try and keep me out, but at the same time I am not going to be a party to perpetuating in the Constitution an oath that everybody in the Second Dáil &mdash;I repeat this&mdash;stated that they were taking under duress, and that they would remove at the first opportunity that presented itself.</P>

      <P>I am afraid, in connection with this Bill, that I cannot compliment the President in the same way that I was forced to compliment him on the Bill which he introduced yesterday.  I must, however, repeat what I said yesterday, namely, that his colleagues on the Front Bench have spoilt the somewhat plausible case which he made when introducing this Bill.  It may be a case of &ldquo;save me from my friends,&rdquo; but his friends have been his worst enemies in this matter. I want to correct the statement which the President made, and I am sure he will accept my correction.  Although I spoke at over one hundred meetings at the election on behalf of Fianna Fáil, I never once mentioned the oath.  To be quite candid with this House and with my Party outside, I was far more concerned with economic problems than I was about oaths of any kind.  I fought the election on the economic issue.  I did say, and with truth, that the Government that we have had in this country since Griffith and Collins went down had not developed the country nationally, industrially, economically or financially according to Irish national aspirations.</P>
      <P>On that issue I fought the election, and I may have said, and I do not claim that my language was extravagant, that it had deceived the people. Probably I might have said, and I would be justified in saying, that it had betrayed the confidence of Nationalist Ireland.  I agree with Deputy Baxter when he said that, whatever grounds there might be for introducing legislation of this kind, now is not the time to do it.  The arguments put up in support of this Bill are most puerile.  I am sure that in this House I will not find many matters on which I can agree with the Minister for Agriculture, but I agree with him in this, namely, that he has cleared the air.  He has stated in unequivocal language the purport of this Bill, and he has stated what it is hoped the Bill will bring about.  He is spoiling for fight, and he wants it here and now.  He says that that must come, and the sooner we have it over the better.</P>

      <P>I do not know what is required that I should withdraw.  I made the statement based upon a memory of a speech made by a Minister which was altered before it was circulated to Deputies.  I do not believe that there was any deliberate fault on the part of any member of the staff.  I believe it was the result of a correction made by a Minister, and so far as the staff are concerned they acted quite innocently.  I said I believed it was done.  I believe it was done.  I cannot withdraw that.</P>

      <P>I can only say that the officials of the reporting staff are experienced persons, and the editor of debates and all the reporting staff have got very clear instructions as to what they are to do.  They make an endeavour&mdash;and a very difficult task it is on occasions&mdash;to report exactly what is said here.  There are certain kinds of statements which they certainly would not report.  The insinuation that some skilful and intelligent Minister humbugged an innocent member of the reporting staff does not seem to be correct.  I do not think it happened in that particular form. Any insinuation from anybody that the official reports are doctored&mdash;that is what Deputy Johnson meant&mdash;is untrue, unfounded and unworthy.</P>

      <P>Statements were made by Deputies in favour of this Bill that Fianna Fáil deceived the people in the general election.  I do not want to go into the facts of that, because it has brought about strange relations between me and my Party, and I do not want to deal here with what is to me and others a very delicate subject. There is, however, no argument in it, and it has been well dealt with by Deputy Corish.  &ldquo;Deceive me once, you are to blame.  Deceive me twice, I am to blame.&rdquo;  If there is any substance in the statement that the country has <Col N="1096" /> been deceived by false propaganda by any political Party, can you not trust the country?  Give it another chance and it will not be deceived, but if it is deceived a second time with its eyes open, then it is good enough for it.  I do not want to go over the ground which I went over yesterday and the day before, although a similar opportunity has been presented to every Deputy by the statement of the Minister for Agriculture that this is a Public Safety Bill.</P>
      <P>I, certainly, as a member of Fianna Fáil, protest against the points raised and the pointed point&mdash;if I may put it that way&mdash;that has been made from the Ministerial Benches to link up Fianna Fáil with any gunmen.  When we heard about the first of this series of bills, we were treated to a long statement of a sensational character of the discoveries that were made covering a few years.  One would think that the active members of that organisation numbered some thousands.  We were not told how many units there were in that organisation, and nobody in this country could adumbrate better on secret organisations than one or two of the men on the Front Benches. Why was it not done?  Why did we not get some idea of the size of the organisation?  Was not it all done to cause sensation at this moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not deal with the views expressed at the Second Dáil which discussed the Treaty, though I could, because I was in attendance at all the debates&mdash;I was not a member, of course.  I will not discuss what the opinion was regarding this oath, or alleged oath, but it is certainly news to me to find any volume of Nationalist opinion in favour of taking the oath, whether it was an oath of allegiance or otherwise, voluntarily to the King of England.  That is news to me, and it explains perhaps a lot of things that have happened in the last few years.  It explains a lot of the weaknesses of the administration, when the policy of Birkenhead succeeded, and the policy of Collins was turned down.  I would advise the Ministers to read the notes of an unpublished speech of Michael Collins and to read also a statement <Col N="1097" /> made by Birkenhead a few weeks ago, when he said he always stood for self-government for Southern Ireland, but that he never stood for self-government for the whole of Ireland, and even if the whole of Ireland wanted it, they should see that they should not get it, because, he said, &ldquo;we made a plantation in Ulster, and that plantation was made for a purpose, and we must maintain that purpose.&rdquo;  Hence partition. He said: &ldquo;It would be a distinct financial gain to us to have a Parliament in Southern Ireland.  They will deal with any revolutionary movement.&rdquo; And have not they got it?  It is criminal on the part of Ministers who went through the fight and went through the organisations, secret and open, for the last thirty years to bring about a situation to make that fight, to come before this House and before this country and brand as criminals the very men that they swore into that secret movement.  Let us be fair to ourselves.  I am sorry the Minister for Local Government is not here, but when he was Chief of Staff in 1921, he, with Mr. de Valera and the late Mr. Brugha, went through this country at a time when the Dáil had agreed on a basis of negotiation with Lloyd George to find some means of accommodation within the British Empire, when they had agreed to scrap the Republic.  They went through the country swearing over young men to defend the Republic and gave them guns to defend the Republic. I am sorry the Minister is not here to challenge him whether, the following year, he tried these very youths and put them to the wall and shot them for having the guns he gave them.  I want to ask those Ministers also why this fight was continued, and why the youths were asked to go out with those guns to fight for a Republic from 1920, when in 1920 you could have got a partitioned Ireland, the same as you have got.</P>

The Public Safety Bill was debated at length.  The Deputy himself made a speech on it.  Whatever he had to say on that Bill he has already said, as far as the Second Stage went.  On this Bill he will have to keep to the question of the Bill, which is whether this particular form of affidavit should be imposed on people when they are being nominated for election.

I would like to put some queries to the President.  Of course, he is not obliged to answer me, but I want to put them, in order to clear the air, and to clear the mind of the public.  Is what is called the oath in the Treaty mandatory in the Constitution?  Has the Executive Council approached the British Government with a view to the deletion of Article 17 of the Constitution? If not, will they do so?  I know he is not bound to answer me, but I put these questions in order to clear the air, and if the Executive Council assures the country that the power for the deletion or retention of the oath does not rest with them, it will go a long way towards clearing the air and bringing about normal conditions in this country.  I hope that in the last few days when I may have spoken with some heat, that I have not been in any way personal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make one or two points.  This Bill has been described by the Minister for Agriculture as a Public Safety Bill.  So it is, to a certain extent, to such an extent that he is justified in describing it as a Public Safety Bill.  It has nothing at all to do with the detection or the <Col N="1100" /> punishment of crime, but to my mind it has a good deal to do with the prevention of crime.  It is an effort to put an end to a continuance of a state of affairs that has evil tendencies and will have evil consequences.  The Deputy seemed to miss the point altogether that the Minister for Agriculture intended when he referred to it as a Public Safety Bill.  So long as the Fianna Fáil Party is allowed to exist as a semi-constitutional body&mdash;nobody can make the claim that they are a constitutional body while they defy the Constitution and carry on an agitation in the country for the removal of the oath&mdash;so long as they are able to carry on that organisation in the country, so long will they have a body of young men in the country recruited to their ranks, so long will they have a nursery for mistaken super-patriotism, and there is a very short step from mistaken super-patriotism to crime; so long will we have detection and so long will we have punishment.  I remember being a boy, and I remember the feelings of a boy, though my memory may fail me in other matters.  I remember the feelings of a boy of 15, 16, or 20 or 21.  The present state of affairs is not fair to the younger generation.  It is not fair to youthful sentiment and enthusiasm. I speak of a father responsible for my own children.  I want them to get fair play in the future.  I want the the children of the country to get fair play in the future, and to that extent, and to that extent only, this measure is a public safety measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Detection and punishment of crime is not the only function of a Government. It is a more humane function to try and prevent the raising of material for future crime followed by punishment. If you allow the soil to be prepared for a crop of this description what can you expect?  Is it any wonder that you will have crime followed by detection, punishment and death?  Exception was taken to the words of the Minister for Agriculture and to an interjection of mine.  I think I am expressing the mind of that Minister when I say that he wants no fight.  Neither do I, but if a fight is going to come, then I say, let us have it now.  I prefer doing my <Col N="1101" /> own fighting, rather than bequeathing it to my children.  I am the last one who wants a fight&mdash;and I hope Deputy Anthony will take my interjection as meaning this&mdash;but I am the last one to shirk a fight when it comes.  It must be forced on me, and it must be forced on the Executive.</P>
    <P>It is said that the remedy for this situation rests with the people.  I say it does not.  The legislative remedy for it rests with the Dáil, and the representatives sent here are no longer representatives if they cannot suggest remedies for the proper government of the State.  We know that at the recent election&mdash;Deputy Davin and others referred to it&mdash;several influences contributed to the return of forty-four Republican Deputies.  The people in every constituency were told that these Deputies were going into the Dáil&mdash;it did not apply only to Leix and Offaly and Dublin.  Appeals were made to people who had grievances, or who had suffered from the operation of the laws passed in the last five years.  Appeals were made by certain people and even by Deputies to the worst instincts of the people.  They were told that land annuities would not have to be paid, that taxes would not have to be paid&mdash; or, at least, that there was a possibility of avoiding them&mdash;that debts would be impossible to collect, and that there was the prospect of a good time in the future, such as some people had in 1922.  The aggregate vote which Fianna Fáil received at the election was not a vote for a republic.  People voted for them who did not even know the meaning of a republic, or cared two pins for it.  More than 50 per cent. of the votes received by them were based on other considerations besides republicanism. The oath had no meaning for them whatsoever.  They did not care two pins for it&mdash;neither do I, or some of the people who remain outside the House because of the oath.  To me it is an oath to the sovereign people of this country, as it is to every Deputy. When people talk of the oath they mean an oath to the sovereign people of this country, whether it is a President is at the head of the State or any King. Everybody knows that the oath is to <Col N="1102" /> the sovereign people of the country, and we owe no allegiance to anybody else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. COBURN Mr. COBURN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COBURN</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words in opposition to this Bill. Almost three hours have been occupied in discussing a Bill which, from the point of view of its utility to the economic and industrial welfare of the country, should only take five minutes.  The first objection I have to the Bill is that it is denying a right to a large section of our people that is at present enjoyed by them owing to the Constitution.  If this section choose to elect Deputies who will not take their seats, that is their own business, and not the business of this House.  I would remind Deputies on the Government Benches that there are certain disabilities attaching to Deputies who do not take their seats&mdash;that there are certain financial losses, so to speak.  Candidates have to lodge £100 before they can be nominated for election, which they forfeit if they fail to take their seats.  As regards abstention from the Dáil, I believe that in a very short time the people who elected these Deputies will see the futility of it, just as the majority of the people saw the futility of the abstention policy when the Treaty was signed in 1921.  I am not one who is going to deny the right to this very large section of our countrymen to do whatever they think fit.  The Government Party took special care during the election to convey the idea that there was no alternative to their policy except the Fianna Fáil policy&mdash;in other words, that if the people did not vote for the Government Party, they were to vote for the Fianna Fáil Party, to the exclusion of the Independents, the Labour and National League Parties. We are now asked to pass a Bill to exclude the representatives of this very large section of the people.  I think that is most unwise, and I ask the Government to withdraw the Bill, especially as this is a most inopportune time for introducing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I object to this Bill for the reason that if the Government really meant to do something that would be of use to the country I think they should have incorporated in it a provision for the reduction of the present number of Deputies, because I believe that the <Col N="1103" /> present number is far and away beyond the needs of the country.  By reducing the number by at least fifty&mdash;which is practically equal to the number of abstentionists&mdash;an annual saving of from £20,000 to £25,000 could be effected.  That would be something in these days of economic depression, when farmers are finding it very difficult to balance a slender budget at the end of each financial year; when fathers of families are idle and their wives and children are ill-fed; when the factories are sending forth hundreds of employees in black despair on to the dole, and when thousands of young Irishmen are fleeing from the country to seek a living in America and far-off Australia.</P>
    <P>It would mean something if the Government introduced a Bill of that kind.  I will vote against this Bill, because I believe it is futile, and that I, as a representative of the people, should not be asked to come here and lose my time discussing Bills that will be of no material benefit to the country when I could be more usefully employed trying to pass legislation for the relief of unemployment.  By relieving unemployment we would do away with a great deal of the despair and of the fears that seem to be general in the country at present.  I believe that if the Government withdrew the Bill and let time do its work, as time has already done its work as far as the past history of the country is concerned, they will have reason to congratulate themselves, and I am sure that if in the near future they come forward with a Bill that will meet with general approval every Deputy will support the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. ANTHONY Mr. ANTHONY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ANTHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to vote against this Bill, but finding myself in agreement with at least some of its clauses, I wish to explain the reason why I am going to vote against it.  The fact that it is taken in combination with other Bills, and that that combination is an indication of the future policy of the Government, is the chief reason which actuates me in voting against the Bill.  It would appear from the discussion to-day that some of us in this Dáil are becoming the advocates <Col N="1104" /> of the elected representatives who are absenting themselves from the Dáil.  I, for one, am not going to be an advocate for these people.  If they are opposed to measures of this kind, their place is within the Dáil and not play-acting and engaging in tomfoolery outside. Too much trash has been spoken about this.  I want to know are we honest with ourselves.  If anybody wants to know what value is placed by a very large number of our people on an oath, let him visit the District Courts any day in the week, or the Land Court. How many false oaths will he see taken there?  I say that because I am honest enough to say it.  There are many more false oaths taken in one day, even in Southern Ireland, than would damn all the Saints in Heaven.  Let us be quite honest.  A lot of moonshine has been spoken to-day about bringing people into the Dáil and making the passage easy for them.  We have been condemned off their platforms as people who are traitors to the best interests of Ireland and to Irish nationality, because we came into the Dáil.  Are we to make the passage into the Dáil easier for these people by advocating certain measures or passing certain Bills?  I, for one, refuse to do it.  As I have said, were it not for the fact that this Bill is linked up with other Bills, and that that to me indicates the future policy of the Government, I would not vote against the Bill, but I am compelled, owing to the reasons I have stated, to vote against it, and I do so with very much regret.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to speak on this Bill, because I think that everything that can be said for and against it has been said.  But one or two statements which have been made disturbed my mind somewhat, and I should like the President to deal particularly with these.  I am not disturbed by the fact that 44 representatives who have been elected have decided to remain outside the Dáil, but by what may be the consequences if statements made by a responsible Minister represent the mind of the Government in connection with this Bill. When you take the Bill in conjunction with the Public Safety Bill, and have it described as a Public Safety Bill, <Col N="1105" /> and a responsible Minister states that the abstention policy of Fianna Fáil must inevitably lead to violence, and if there is going to be a fight let us have that fight at once and get shut of it, it seems to me to be almost the next thing to a declaration of war and more civil strife. I should like the President to state if that is the mind of the Executive on the matter, because, in reply to a question, which I think was put by Deputy Redmond, &ldquo;Was Fianna Fáil an unconstitutional organisation?&rdquo; the answer was &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  These two statements, to my mind, are very disturbing &mdash;not so much as regards whether we are going to make the path smooth or thórny for the 44 men to come in, but in so far as the country is concerned, which has only just emerged from civil strife after a revolution.  If we have to go back to that civil strife, I hope every Deputy who votes on this Bill will carry the responsibility of it.</P>

      <P>I deprecate the introduction of this Bill at the present stage, as I deprecated yesterday evening the introduction of the other Electoral Bill.  I think this Bill might more opportunely be brought forward at a later stage. We must, however, have regard to the governing principle in considering what view we should take on this measure.  I cannot support the fundamental absurdity of persons being allowed to stand for election for the purpose of representing the people in this House and then refusing to take their seats&mdash;taking up the attitude that they want to be elected, but that they will not sit.  That is a proceeding which turns the Constitution into a farce, so far as they are capable of doing that.  The people of this country ought to be taught to respect the Constitution. Those who are adopting this attitude are teaching disrespect of the Constitution.  To my mind, that is the governing principle in connection with this measure, and, therefore, I shall support it.</P>

      <P>The last Deputy has said much of what I desired to say. I intend to vote for the Second Reading of the Bill.  Membership of this <Col N="1106" /> House is a very real thing and involves very real responsibility.  To my mind, any candidate who presents himself for election, having definitely decided that if elected he will not sit as a member of the House and assist in its work, is attempting to reduce the proceedings of the Dáil and of election to the level of a farce.  I regard this Bill as a declaration, on the part of the Dáil, that that attempt will not succeed.  I shall regard the passing of the Second Reading of this Bill as making that declaration in a definite way.  So far, I am completely with the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;that this is the right time for making that position perfectly clear.  I propose to vote for the Second Reading.</P>
      <P>While I say that, I feel there is force in the contention that an Electoral Bill ought not to be passed in a hurry, and that, particularly in view of the fact that by-elections are pending, it would be unfortunate to hurry such a Bill through.  Therefore, I suggest that the force of the declaration, that this House will not permit any attempt to tamper with or undermine its authority, can be secured without interfering with the principle in the other issue to which I have alluded.  I would make two suggestions.  The first is that, like the Constitution Bill which we dealt with yesterday, this Bill should receive a Second Reading to-day, and then be suspended until the Autumn Session.  If that does not meet with the approval of the Government I would urge, secondly, that the operation of the Bill should be suspended for three months.  I think it is a pity in electoral matters to pass in a hurry legislation which would affect elections which are pending.  I have no hesitation whatever in voting for the Second Reading of the Bill as a declaration that this House will not support any attempt to undermine its vigour and its value.</P>

The purpose of the measure is to tell the people of this country that there must be respect for the Parliament of the people&mdash;that those who contest elections must take their places in the Parliament of the people.  What is the necessity for it?  The necessity for it is the stability of the State.  People have come to me within the last month or six weeks asking me what is going to happen, or what is likely to happen&mdash; what are the possibilities of seventy-seven members being elected who will not come in here, and what issue will be presented to the country if, on such an occasion, seventy-seven members agree to stay out and seventy-five decide to come in.  Is that a nice picture to conjure up?  What does it portend?  No matter what the conditions are outside, does it portend peaceful conditions in this country?  When business men are considering whether or not they are going to develop, when industrialists are making up their minds whether or not they are going to start <Col N="1108" /> industries here, is that a consideration that is present to their minds&mdash;the stability of the State and ordered political conditions in the State?</P>
      <P>What is the connection between the advent of this measure and the Public Safety Bill?  Every single act of an unconstitutional character towards this State demands the serious consideration of the Executive Council, demands action on the part of the Executive Council, demands the attention of the Oireachtas and the introduction of such measures as will deal with the situation created.  When people say that we have had reassuring statements from those who are controlling the Fianna Fáil Party, I say it is time we got them. We had them before.  We had them five years ago.  We were told that there was a constitutional method of setting our differences, and that we should not depart from it.  What was the departure?  Had the departure the support of the people?  Was the departure against the people?  Is it from those who make statements now condemning the terrible crime that was committed that we are to seek safety&mdash; from mere pronouncements by them? We had these pronouncements before. I accept, unreservedly, the condemnation of the crime which came from the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party.  What I regret is that there was not included in that condemnation an expression of hope that those who were the perpetrators of that crime would be brought to justice.  There is no revenge in that statement&mdash;none whatever.  Whoever is in control of the Executive of this country will have to administer justice&mdash;justice as it is laid down in our statutes. We have got to administer it, and at no time can we say: &ldquo;You must not institute a prosecution in that case.&rdquo;  We have not done that, and we are not going to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present position of the Abstentionist Party in this country is unconstitutional; it is anti-constitutional; it is a danger to the Constitution, and it invites contempt of the Constitution. I say that that situation must be ended. It so happens that upon this Party, with the support which it gets, falls the unpleasant task of bringing close up before the people the dangers which <Col N="1109" /> there are in the situation and of taking what appears to be unpopular action. I have no fears for unpopular action. When I am offered, on one hand, the vacating of fifty-one seats, and putting these to nomination, I say, viewing the matter in the most charitable manner from the abstentionist point of view, this is the easier method.  There are five years yet for these people to review the present position&mdash;five years yet in which they can come in here.  To declare fifty-one seats vacant would not give direct representation to the 300,000 voters who voted for the Fianna Fáil policy.</P>
    <P>Let us not deceive ourselves or deceive the public.  This is the fair method&mdash;a much fairer method than the other.  The other is the more direct and, perhaps, the stronger method, but certainly it is not as fair to the various quotas through the country which returned forty-four people who will not come in here except the oath be amended in some way.  How is it to be amended?  I stated how it could be amended yesterday.  It can only be amended by the President of the Executive Council opening negotiations with the British Government, asking for an alteration of that clause, asking for an alteration of the Treaty.  That is the constitutional method of doing it. Nobody in this House who is going to vote against this Bill will deny that. No single Deputy will deny it.  No single Deputy will deny that, if the occasion should arise when you would have seventy-seven people out of 152 elected who would support Mr. de Valera's policy, you would have a situation fraught with great danger to the stability of the State, to the peace of the people, to their rights, and to their liberties.  Are those serious considerations for us?  I believe they are. They are serious considerations calling for solution from us.  They are certainly worth five minutes' consideration even if that five minutes' consideration involves a six-minute contribution from the Deputy for Louth.</P>

      <P>I should like to give, for the benefit of the people outside, <Col N="1110" /> what my view of this oath is.  It is a binding oath, and when I take it I mean to keep it.  I believe that a public representative who takes that oath should take it with the intention of keeping it.  When people introduce the names of those who signed the Treaty of accommodation&mdash;great, big citizens, some of the greatest and biggest men who ever represented this country&mdash; they should remember what a big advance they have got upon the other Dominions.  The oath in South Africa is as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;I (A. B.) do swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty the King (or Her Majesty the Queen, as the case may be), his, or her, heirs and successors according to law, so help me God.&rdquo;  In Canada the oath runs:&mdash;&ldquo;I do swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Victoria...,&rdquo; altered according to the reign of the particular sovereign.  What is our oath?  It is to &ldquo;bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of the Irish Free State&rdquo; and to &ldquo;be faithful to H.M. King George V., his heirs and successors by law in virtue of the common citizenship of Ireland with Great Britain and her adherence to and membership of the group of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is nothing in that of which any honest Irishman should be ashamed; nothing in that to warrant unconstitutional methods; nothing in that to appal any honest citizen, having in his mind the history of the last five years, standing for election before the people.  We say that now is the time to reassure the public in this country, now is the time to give notice, five years before another election is going to take place, that the people who are candidates in the next election will be people who will have to undertake to come in here if there be any political advantage in it.  If a certain number of people stay outside, they can criticise everything that is done inside, every single act from the first piece of legislation introduced down to the last sixpence that is spent in connection with ink or anything of that sort, and that is not fair to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The abstentionist policy which is now <Col N="1111" /> being pursued by those outside this House is not on a parallel with, and has no comparison with, the abstentionist policy which was pursued by the Sinn Fein Party from 1916 to 1920 or 1921. It has nothing to do with it, and the success of that policy from 1916 to 1921 is the institution which we have here <Col N="1112" /> to-day, is the liberty which we enjoy to-day, and that liberty, by reason of this and other measures, we are asking the Dáil and the Oireachtas to preserve and conserve for the people of this country.</P>

      <P>Can we have any indication of the intention with regard to the completion of business and when the adjournment is to be taken?  I do not know how Deputy Johnson feels about the business, but on behalf of my Party I would like to say that we hoped the Dáil would have adjourned three weeks ago, but, of course, the unfortunate event that has occurred prevented that.  There is a desire on the part of many Deputies that the adjournment should be taken as early as possible.  We have no objection to the Committee Stage being taken to-morrow if that will facilitate an earlier adjournment; we would be pleased if it would mean that.  Seeing that this Bill has gone so far, we do not think that very much can be done to amend it; there is not very much likelihood of amending it.  I do not know whether or not Deputy Johnson wants an adjournment at all, but some of us do, and we are very anxious that it would come at the earliest moment.</P>

      <P>My desire with regard to this Bill is that it should be amended and that time should be given for the preparation of amendments.  A considerable number of amendments have been circulated to the Public Safety Bill, which will take time, and it does not seem to me to be possible to reach this Bill to-morrow if the Public Safety Bill amendments are to be taken to-morrow.  I certainly think that time should be given for the preparation of amendments to a Bill of such considerable importance as this is, and which admittedly requires amending.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any urgency about this Bill?  This would give no time to draft amendments and no time to consider them.  We have met the Ministry on the question of the Public Safety Bill.  We have had about fifty amendments to it handed to us to-day, and in the intervals of the debate we have tried to consider them and to consider their bearing.  Have we got to do that all again to-morrow? Is the urgency so great?  This Bill really anticipates another General Election; it should become law before another General Election, but I agree with <Col N="1114" /> Deputy Thrift that either there ought to be a date fixed on which it is to come into operation, or, preferably, that it should not be pressed until we have some more time for its consideration.  There would be no weakness in that attitude; there would be no indication that the Government does not intend to proceed with the Bill.  It would be merely a concession to the very many claims on the minds of Deputies.  One may require to put down amendments to this Bill.  I have got to give still more consideration to the amendments to the Public Safety Bill, and I have a meeting of the Public Accounts Committee to-morrow.  It is not possible to do our duty if Bills are going to be rushed in this way.  I would suggest, in regard not only to one Party but to all Parties, that it would be fairer to the Dáil to leave this Bill over until we have more time to consider it, and I would appeal to the President to do so.</P>

      <P>The essential thing is to show a determination to pass the Bill.  That, I think, we have shown.  There is a belief, I think, amongst a considerable number of people that passing Electoral Bills hurriedly is bad.  Particularly in view of the fact, as I said before, that by-elections are impending, I would add my word to what has been said asking the President to hold up the Bill further.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be more than desirous of trying to meet Deputies, and I am prepared to give consideration to what Deputy Thrift has said about this Bill coming into operation at a particular time.  But I cannot emphasise too much what I have said already on the Second Reading, the desirability of having fixed in the people's mind the fact that this will be the law for the future.  The opinion of the Executive Council is that these two measures are necessary and that they should be passed into law.  Members of the Executive Council are just as desirous as other Deputies to wind up the session and to adjourn.  It has been for them just as onerous and as exhausting as it has been for other Deputies, and I believe that it would be in the best interests of the Dáil that <Col N="1115" /> the business should be concluded as early as possible.</P>

      <P>The point to be borne in mind with regard to this subject is, how long may we be faced with the activities of these conspirators? Let us remember that five years ago active military operations were in progress throughout the State.  I detailed at some length the other day how what might be called active military operations stopped in 1923.</P>
      <P>We had got most of the dumps.  We are still getting them, and, as each dump is got, greater hostility is shown by those who remain in the conspiracy.  Although we have had peace to a very large extent, and it was never more pronounced than during the six months prior to the assassination of the Vice-President, that one act occured five years after the disorders first started.  That shows that we had better take a big view regarding this matter.  I fixed the period of seven years, bearing in mind that it is over five years since the disorders first started.  Bearing in mind what I have stated, that as each dump is located and captured, the menace removed, and that certain people may find themselves still more opposed to normal conditions being restored, I want a period to elapse beyond the electoral campaign in this country.  The Bill is such that if there is no need for these sections being put into operation they will not be put into operation, but they will be there as a corrective and as a means of combatting any recurrence of armed violence which might take place in the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say that I cannot support either Deputy O'Hanlon's or Deputy McMenamin's amendment. There is no use in leaving loopholes and allowing a man to say: &ldquo;If I can get out of the operation of this Bill for one year, I will be safe.&rdquo;  I wish to endorse Deputy Baxter's amendment.  I think five years is sufficient. The President says that if the Bill is not needed it will not be put into operation, but some provisions lie within the Gárda Síochána.  Section 15 renders all members of the Gárda Síochána immune from wrongful arrest provided he says that he is arresting a person because he has treasonable documents upon him.  I do not believe that in 999 cases out of 1,000 the Civic Guards will abuse that provision but there is a conceivable possibility that you might find, here and there, one man who might try, either to impress the authorities with his zeal or to gratify private spite, to abuse Section 15. That section takes away the right of the ordinary citizen to sue for wrongful arrest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that five years is a reasonable period.  It brings the question before a new Dáil.  Though I heard it suggested that the Dáil in its earlier stages is not the best body to consider the Bill, I hope that in five years hence we shall not have an entirely new Dáil, but a Dáil with twelve or eighteen months' experience.  I think that the policy of pushing the Dáil to its extreme length of existence is a mistake.  I think five years will be sufficient to round up the small gang of men who have set themselves to terrorise this country, not only the Government of the country, but anybody who has a mind of his own.  I hope and believe that it will not take five years to round them up and eliminate them from the life of the <Col N="1122" /> State.  I suggest that Deputy Baxter's amendment is reasonable and is one which could be adopted without blunting the weapon or weakening the arm which I trust we all like to see the Government wielding against crime.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to speak to the amendment put down in the names of Deputy Rice and Deputy O'Hanlon. This is a Bill which is clearly only justifiable, if ever, at a time of public emergency, public disorder or civil war.  The Minister has argued that it is one which should be maintained in being, in inactivity, for seven years from now, because of the possibility that though they may, by the powers of the Bill, drive out all that is evident in the way of insurrectionary activity or conspiracy, there might be someone left up to seven years, and that therefore all the powers in the Bill should remain.  If the Bill has to be passed through the Dáil, it ought not operate for more than one year, and, if it is necessary to be renewed, it should be renewed year by year.</P>
      <P>There is one aspect of this Bill to which I would like to call attention, and that is the fact that by Section 3 it has to have effect as an amendment of the Constitution, and, unless something new takes place in the way of an extension of the period during which the Constitution itself may be amended, it may be altered by the ordinary process of the law.  That period expires, I think, in a couple of years' time. Then nothing can be done in the way of revoking this without the referendum, because it is, in effect, an amendment of the Constitution.  That means making the Bill permanent unless we are prepared to submit the question to a referendum, and we have to assume, while discussing this Bill, that the present constitutional provisions regarding the referendum and the changes of the Constitution are to remain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1123" /> According to Section 3, the Constitution is amended by the passing of the Bill, and the amended Constitution will remain, and this Bill, in so far as it has amended the Constitution, does not sink into nothingness at the end of seven years, but remains as a Constitutional amendment.  I put that forward as a proposal with some diffidence, but I think it is worthy of consideration. The point raised by Deputy Cooper is of quite definite practical importance. Apart from the special courts which are to be set up by proclamation, there will be nineteen sections of the Bill which will be ordinary law, and for all the time during these seven years it will be within the power of the Executive to deport or order the expulsion of a person, and, failing expulsion, to commit him to prison for six months' hard labour without any modification of that sentence, and no appeal from it. That is a provision that is to remain for seven or five years, if the President's proposition is agreed to by the House.  It is one which ought not remain except during the time that the House is satisfied that a state of disorder, unrest, or public emergency exists.</P>
    <P>So it is, of course, with the very wide powers of Section 15 in respect of the Civic Guards.  These powers certainly should not be given, but, if they be given to them, they should be given for as short a period as possible.  Martial law has given, as we know, powers to soldiers and police to stop people, search and arrest them, or to stop them, search them, take their goods and chattels from their pockets, and let them pass on with no record of what was taken from their pockets.  That was done during the period of martial law, and it is quite possible to be done under this Bill.  If it is to be done at all, it should be for as short a period as possible, and if, at the end of that short period, it is found desirable to extend the powers for a further period, it should be done by a deliberate act of the Oireachtas.  One might say, further, with regard to the other extraordinary powers, that they ought only be allowed to operate for the shortest period which <Col N="1124" /> the Dáil considers necessary.  Then, on further application to the Dáil, if it is still found necessary, the period could be extended.  But, in my opinion, it is very necessary that we should not give these very wide powers, powers which are only justifiably given in times of disquiet, general disorder or civil strife.  The powers should be retained in the hands of the Oireachtas, and not be given for so long a period as five years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentRice" hpid="Mr. RICE Mr. RICE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. RICE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I might be in a better position to meet the views put forward by the President if this section were at the end of the Bill instead of at the beginning, because then I should know what amendments would be agreed to by the Government, or given by the House to certain sections, and whether I think the amendment is vital or material to the Bill, as it stands at present.  I cannot assume at the moment that these vital and material alterations will be made.  The Bill, as it stands at present, is one giving extraordinary <Col N="1125" /> and drastic powers to the Government.  I regret, and we all regret, of course, the necessity&mdash;I do not deny the necessity for extraordinary powers at the present time&mdash;but I take that view because the necessity of introducing a Bill of this kind at the present time is detrimental to the interests of the country.  It is an unfortunate necessity; it is injurious to the credit of the country.  I think it will still further injure the credit of the country if this House declares that these extraordinary powers are not merely necessary but are necessary for the very long period of seven years, or even for the long period of Deputy Baxter's suggestion, of five years. Therefore, while perhaps a year may be a short period for which these powers may be put into operation, I do not agree that these powers should be given without reconsideration for a period of either seven or five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down this amendment because, in the first place, I did think the period of seven years rather long.  On the other hand, may I say that the case made from practically every side of the House, particularly by the Parties who take strongest exception to particular sections in the Bill, was to the effect that whilst the present Executive might be entrusted to not unduly outstep the limits of commonsense in the exercise of these powers, there was no knowing what another Executive might do.  I heard Deputy Rice make the point about the injury to the credit of the country that might be caused by having to pass this Bill at all, but particularly by having to continue it in operation for a period of <Col N="1126" /> seven years.  I agree that there is injury to the credit of the country by its introduction.  We cannot help that. When the Emergency Powers Bill was introduced here there was a point made which I must say influenced me.  It was that in a sense the introduction of a measure like this, asking for any emergency powers, frequently in the Dáil has really a more unsettling effect than to put an Act on the Statute Book and leave it for a certain, perhaps rather lengthy, period.  It is a question as to whether or not the advisable thing to do would be to come back to the Dáil in a year or two years and ask for approval of this measure or a similar measure, or pass this for a period of five years.  That was what was in my mind when I put down this figure five. My own view is, when this Bill is passed and becomes an Act, that after a period of a couple of years, if nothing unduly takes place, very many people will have almost forgotten that it was passed, and should anything untoward occur which would necessitate the Ministry at the time taking these powers, they would have them and could use them, and, perhaps, using them then might really be less injury to our credit than having to come to the House and ask for these powers, and perhaps get them after fighting across the House as to whether or not they should be given. On the balance, my view is that it is, perhaps, more sensible from the point of view of the injury to our credit. If they are going to misuse them I have no hesitation whatever in saying that there is no Party in this House will stand up more strongly against their misuse by the members of the Executive than our Party will.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is not merely the misuse of powers but the possession of such powers and the use of them legally.  That is the point of view that I want to impress upon Deputies. The power is there to do things. That power ought not be put into the hands of the Executive except under extraordinary conditions.  The case is made in regard to these powers that they are asked for because of the extraordinary <Col N="1127" /> conditions.  If those conditions pass the power should pass.  If it is required to extend them, it is not the discussing of the Bill that is going to damage credit; it is the existence of the conditions requiring the Bill that is going to damage credit.  The case that Deputy Baxter makes regarding the desirability of having proclamations made frequently does not really affect the discussion as to the wisdom of having a long period; because in so far as the extraordinary courts are concerned it has been pointed out that the proclamation in effect means a discussion in the House.  So that so far as the extraordinary court is concerned that is <Col N="1128" /> going to happen in any case, and any damage to credit that is going to be caused will be done by that.  In regard to the normal provisions, my objection to some of them is that they are so drastic and out of reason for normal times that the period should not last as long as five years, and that the occasion for the reintroduction of a Bill itself is the cause of the discredit to the country rather than the discussion of the measure.</P>

I put the question that the words &ldquo;seven years&rdquo; stand, declared that question negatived, and proceeded to put the other questions in their proper order, putting first the question that the word &ldquo;one&rdquo; be inserted, and, when that was defeated, I was going to put the question that the word &ldquo;two&rdquo; be inserted.  If the Deputy will cast his mind back to the proceedings in other places he will find that that is a very common procedure.</P>
