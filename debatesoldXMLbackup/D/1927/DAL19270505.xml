      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving the Second Reading of this Bill, I would like to refer briefly to what I said about three years ago when I introduced a Bill to extend the rights which the General Medical Council at that time were believed to have with regard to this country to make arrangements and carry on those arrangements to a further date until such time as a new scheme for this country could be thought out.  On the Second Reading of that temporary Bill I indicated my own point of view that a change would have to take place and some time later on, after this matter had been subjected to a certain amount of discussion and consideration, a statement was made indicating the point of view which the Executive Council had with regard to the control of medical practitioners qualified and resident in this country.  That indication of policy raised a certain controversy to which I need not refer now to any great extent, but at that time it was stated that the policy of the Executive Council was to secure that nationals of this country who obtained their medical qualifications in this country should, during their professional life in this country, be subject to the control of a body composed entirely of Irish nationals, and that the conditions for their obtaining qualifying diplomas and all the conditions under which they studied should be entirely in the hands of that body composed entirely of Irish nationals.  This Bill does, in fact, carry out that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the domestic side&mdash;there is an international side which is referred to in the schedules&mdash;it is made quite clear that under this Bill there is to be established in the Free State a separate <Col N="2151" /> medical register under a Free State Medical Council, and that consequently nobody will be allowed to practise medicine in the Saorstát unless registered in the Free State register established under this Bill.  It is further provided that no person can be struck off the Free State register except by the Medical Council of Saorstát Eireann, and as far as qualifications and degrees are concerned, it is established that the curricula of studies, leading to medical diplomas, will be supervised by a Council of Irish nationals.  On the other side, it is further laid down, by agreement, that the General Medical Council will continue to register on the General Register whatever persons have been trained and qualified in the Free State, and for the purpose of the keeping of that register will continue to exercise supervision over the curricula bodies which give diplomas entitling to registration on the General Register.</P>
    <P>The representation on the General Council is continued as heretofore with one exception.  Previously there was a representative appointed by the Crown for Ireland.  That situation ended on the setting up of the Free State, and the legal position was under the Adaptation of Enactments Act in England that the right to nominate by the Crown previously for Ireland became the right to nominate for Northern Ireland. That is stereotyped in the agreement, and the representative for the future will be the representative for Northern Ireland, appointed by the Governor-General of Northern Ireland. The reciprocal arrangement is that we here continue to admit persons who are registered in the General Register to registration on the Free State Register on the payment of whatever fees are demanded from our own students.</P>
    <P>I need not go through the sections of the Bill.  The Bill proposes to set up here a separate council with complete control of the medical curriculum of the bodies giving qualifying diplomas. That Council will have the completest control in regard to the admission to the register of Irish nationals, and to the striking off from that register for felony, misdemeanour, crime, or what <Col N="2152" /> is called unprofessional conduct. There is one section as far as the domestic side is concerned, to which attention has already been drawn, and there is another section to which I would like to direct attention myself.</P>
    <P>Under Section 28 of this Bill an arrangement is set out to put an end to what has been described as an objectionable feature of the Medical Acts as they have up to this existed.  There is laid down here special provision giving the right of appeal in the case of people who are struck off for what is described as infamous conduct in the professional sense.  That is a complete change, and a complete break away from the Medical Acts so far as they operated here previously.  This is regarded as a very necessary provision.</P>
    <P>The other point to which attention has been drawn is the composition of the Free State Council, which is referred to in Section 3.  That Council is to be abody of nine, one of whom is to be nominated by the Executive Council, one is to be the joint nomination of the Colleges of Surgeons and Physicians; two are to be elected by the registered medical practitioners resident in the Free State, and the remainder are nominees respectively of the three Colleges of the National University, one representative from Trinity College, Dublin, and one representative from the Apothecaries Hall.</P>
    <P>Attention has been called to this section specially because it is alleged to contain an injustice.  The injustice is said to be that the Royal Colleges of Surgeons and Physicians are only given a joint nomination, whereas all the other bodies mentioned are given a representative each.  The position with regard to this is easily explained.  All the bodies who are mentioned in paragraph (b), sub-section (3) of Section 3 do, in fact, give, each and every one of them, a diploma which qualifies a person to practise medicine in this country.  University College, Dublin, gives a qualifying diploma in medicine and surgery, which is essential to practising medicine in this country. The Apothecaries Hall gives a diploma which entitles a person to practise medicine and surgery in the country. Trinity College, Dublin, does the same, <Col N="2153" /> and the other two colleges of the National University do the same.  The College of Surgeons does not give any diploma which entitles the recipient of it to practise medicine in the country. The College of Physicians does not give a diploma which entitles the recipient to practise medicine in the country. The diploma must be a conjoint diploma given after an examination held by the joint bodies.  Nobody can be licensed to practise medicine in this country having received merely a diploma from the College of Surgeons. Neither can a person practise medicine in this country having received a diploma merely from the College of Physicians.  There has to be a conjoint examination, and there has to be a qualifying diploma given by the joint bodies&mdash;the College of Surgeons and the College of Physicians.  So that there is definitely given, under this proposal, a nomination to each body which can give a qualifying diploma. It happens in the case of the College of Surgeons and the College of Physicians that these two bodies must join before a diploma which entitles to practise can be given.  That is the foundation for the proposal here.</P>
    <P>That is one way of looking at the position of this Council.  There are, possibly, other ways by which the Council might be built up.  The one that was taken was the institutions which held examinations, the result of which entitled to practise medicine and surgery in the country.  There may be other ways of looking at it.  One way has been rather suggested already, and that is, that one should take the institutions and see the number of students that were qualified by those bodies.  Unfortunately those who have adopted that line of argument have failed to make a distinction between the students who enter for medicine and the students who ultimately emerge as qualified men.  To take the entrants to medicine in any year in any of those colleges and to found any argument upon that makes no allowance for the large number who disappear at various stages of the medical course.  If that, or anything like that, is to be the foundation upon which this Council is to be raised, it should <Col N="2154" /> be the graduates who have qualified in medicine in those institutions.</P>
    <P>I have here a series of figures which shows the graduates who qualified in medicine in the five years 1921 to 1925. I have not the figures, as yet, for 1926, but I can get them quite soon.  They may be interesting to use for purposes of debate afterwards.  In the University of Dublin in the five years 1921-1925, there were qualified respectively, 51, 72, 98, 75 and 95, or a total of 391. In the Royal Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons&mdash;the conjoint examination&mdash;in these same five years, the graduates who qualified numbered 65, 53, 64, 55, 58, or a total of 295.  In the three Colleges of the National University&mdash;I have not those divided, but I can get them segregated later&mdash;in the same five years there were qualified: 149, 163, 132, 185, and 190, or a total of 819.  Those qualified from the Apothecaries Hall in the same period were 6, 6, 2, 6, and 2, or a total of 22.  So that as far as graduates qualified in those places in the five-year period are concerned, the totals were:&mdash;From Trinity College, Dublin, 391; from the National University of Ireland, 819; from the joint Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons, 295, and from the Apothecaries Hall, 22.  Leaving the Apothecaries Hall out of consideration for a moment, if one was to take it as between Trinity College, Dublin, the National University of Ireland, as a group, and the Colleges of Surgeons and Physicians together, the comparison is very nearly what the allocation of nomination would be&mdash;very nearly what is, in fact, set out in the Bill: one to Trinity College, Dublin; one to the joint Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons; something more than two, but less than three, on the proportion, to the National University.</P>
    <P>There may be other ways, perhaps, of forming this Council, but the procedure that was adopted was, more or less, what was found to hand: that the qualifying institutions should be allowed to nominate, but when one came to look at those qualifying institutions, one segregated those which of themselves can give a diploma which entitled to practise.  When that was done the College of Surgeons had to be <Col N="2155" /> joined to the College of Physicians, as only by that junction can a qualifying diploma entitling to practise be given. There should be in addition to those a member nominated by the Executive Council and some number of members &mdash;two it is stated here&mdash;to be elected by the practitioners of the country.  It is obvious that the qualifying bodies should be given representation as separate entities, and that the whole representation should not be given to the vote of those practising in the country, because a great part of the duty of the Council will be to supervise the educational system, the courses of training, that the medical student has to get, and it is necessary that those who are in control of the authorities that do give diplomas should have a fairly substantial representation on that body.</P>
    <P>But there is a further point that has to be borne in mind, if one is to go on numbers&mdash;that this Council is to take charge of the professional lives of those doctors who elect to remain in this country for the period of professional practice, and that a mere allocation of seats on the Council determined by means of an enumeration of the students who qualitfy would not be fair.  This Council is to be the body dealing with those who elect to remain at home, and there would have to be some appreciation of the percentage of students who qualify in any of the qualifying institutions mentioned, and who, in fact, do remain at home for their professional lives.  If that percentage be taken, I think it would be roughly accurate to say that a great deal more than fifty per cent. of the students of the National University of Ireland do intend, and do, in fact, make their practice at home; that much more than fifty per cent. of the students who qualify in Trinity College, Dublin, do, in fact, go abroad, and that about fifty per cent. of those who qualify from the Colleges of Surgeons and Physicians do go abroad.  So that on the percentage of those who, in fact, are being trained to look after the nationals of this country, those figures would have to be subjected to still further division.  An argument may be <Col N="2156" /> used afterwards founded upon those figures and I leave the matter for the time being.</P>

      <P>I think the Branch Council could quite easily supply the figures that the Deputy requires, and I can make an effort to get them.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just this consideration: that if you take the number of entrants in a year you cannot expect the number leaving in a year five years later to be greater, and the total number of entrants for the three years that we know of would give a very different set of figures from the number given for those qualifying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>On the international side, while, as I say, the Executive Council had the policy that students of this country who attended a training course in the country, who got a qualifying diploma here, and who intended to practise here, should be entirely under the supervision of a Council composed completely of Irish nationals, there had to be some attention paid to the other side&mdash;that in fact a very large number of those who get qualifying diplomas in this country leave and live their professional lives outside the country.  An attempt had to be made to discover if it was possible to get an arrangement which would safeguard the nationals who intended to practise here, and, at the same time, would continue the rights which qualified men in the country up to this possess of going abroad, and of getting their entrance to the General Medical Register, and in that way secure qualifications which entitle them to positions <Col N="2157" /> in Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Dominions.  The agreement which is the First Schedule to the Bill is the result of the attempts that have been made.  The net result of this First Schedule is that it entitles those who do get qualifying diplomas in this country to have their names entered upon the General Register, and to get whatever rights which entrance upon that register brings with it; while at the same time there is no over-riding power given to entrance on the General Register so as to, in fact, negative anything done by the Free State Council with regard to the expulsion of members from the Free State Register.</P>
      <P>The point at which it seemed there was likely to be conflict was in this matter of expulsion.  A case might easily be imagined of a doctor being accused of what is described as infamous conduct in the professional sense, and on being subject to an investigation and trial there might be a decision against him by the Irish Council, and in his favour by the General Council. One had to ensure that in such a case the doctor expelled from the Irish Register by the Irish Council could not assert his rights on the General Register, and come back again to this country, despite the fact that the home Council had decided that his conduct merited expulsion.  That can no longer happen.  A doctor who has qualifications entitling him to registration on both registers, who commits an offence of the sort described, who is adjudged guilty by the Free State Council, and struck off the register, and is, at the same time, adjudged not guilty by the General Council, and allowed to remain on the General Register, cannot assert his General Register right so as to ensure his registration again in this country after previous expulsion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the main point that had to be met in the agreement and that point has been very definitely asserted and has been met in Section 4, subsections (c) and (d) of the First Schedule.  Sub-section (3) of the agreement indicates that for the purpose of keeping the General Register, and only for that purpose, the Medical Acts continue as heretofore, save where amended by this Schedule, and that <Col N="2158" /> the powers of the General Medical Council and of the Branch Council shall continue as heretofore, for the purpose only of the keeping of the General Register.  There were two subsidiary points which had to be attended to.  They are set out in subsections (5) and (6).  Sub-section (5) was to meet the case, which at one time seemed likely, of a body which is now entitled to give a diploma qualifying for entrance on the General Register ceasing to be merely a college and becoming a separate university. That seemed likely to happen at one time in the case of Cork College, that it might break away and become Cork University instead.  In that case it looked as if a new agreement would have to be entered into in regard to the right of that new university to hold an examination leading to a diploma, but which right might have disappeared under the new conditions, and that point is attended to in sub-section (5) of the Schedule.  Sub-section (6) deals more with machinery than anything else.  It sets out to avoid the inconvenience and embarrassment of having a doctor here who committed an offence, say of the unprofessional conduct type, who had his name on both registers being subjected to investigation by two bodies for the same offence, and the arrangement in this sub-section provides machinery to avoid the embarrassment that might otherwise occur.</P>
    <P>The net effect, then, is what I have described, that what the Executive Council laid down in 1924 as the best policy has been achieved, that the control of those who carry through their course of education and get their diplomas for qualification purposes in this country, during their professional lives here are subject only to the control of the Irish body, and in addition there has been achieved that those students who wish to have their old rights, if and when they went abroad, are now entitled to the same rights as they previously held.</P>
    <P>It has been said of this Bill that it leaves the position very much as before.  That phrase can only be used by one who has entirely misread the Bill.  The position is not as heretofore. <Col N="2159" /> The jurisdiction of the General Medical Council with regard to removal from the Register of any Irish practitioner is very definitely limited.  The jurisdiction of the General Medical Council with regard to the supervision of the courses leading to a diploma entitling to practise in this country disappears. The jurisdiction of the General Medical Council over those students who, qualifying here, elect to practise in England, still remains, as it is only right that it should remain, and the right of the General Medical Council, through the Branch Council, or in any other way which seems suitable, to supervise the courses entitling to registration on the General Register, still remains, as it is only right that it should remain.  But there have been the very big changes that I have spoken of, that in the matter of supervising the courses leading to examination, and in the matter of regulating the examinations which come at the end of these courses of study, in the matter of controlling the professional lives of those who continue to practise in the country, and, finally putting an end to the professional life of any man practising in this country, the General Medical Council has in fact lost whatever power it once had in this country. Whatever of their powers are continued now relate entirely to the purpose of the keeping of the General Register.</P>
    <P>It may be said, and it has been said, that inasmuch as the students who are exported are the majority at the moment, obviously the Free State Council will have to pay more attention to the wishes of the General Medical Council than to what they think beneficial to the students of this country, because they will have to cater for a greater number of students, and these in fact are the exported ones as things are.  That may be the case at the moment.  It is not necessarily the case.  It is not incumbent on that Council to pay attention to the wishes of the General Medical Council with regard to courses of studies.  I understand that there has been before the General Medical Council a plea put up by the Irish representatives for many <Col N="2160" /> years that a certain portion of the examination should be increased in difficulty. If that point of view still holds with the Irish representatives, then they can ensure, as far as Irish qualified men are concerned, that a stiffened examination test will be held.  If, on the other hand, which I hope would be a most unlikely event, they decided that the courses here were too difficult and that there should be some relaxation as far as practice in this country is concerned the Council may do what it pleases with regard to the qualifying diploma.</P>
    <P>It is meant that there will be a general relation between the General Council and the Free State Council, inasmuch as so many of our students go abroad at the moment, and if that state of things continues that will always have to exist.  But it is not necessary that it should continue.  In fact to a great many people it seems undesirable and a great waste that it should, and if the Council sees that there is a tendency for the number of students to diminish, for them to get into other occupations, if other professions become more important in relation to the country's needs, then the Council has power to do all that is necessary to aid a change to other professions. While the present state of things continues there is bound to be a very definite relation between the two Councils.  It may be said that there is not the completest and the most absolute form of reciprocity as between the two countries on this.  There are, possibly, two small points on which reciprocity could not be said to have been achieved.  But neither can a demand for that be reasonably put up unless one can accept the corollary to that demand, which would necessarily be that representation of Irish qualifying bodies on the General Council should cease.</P>
    <P>For the future we will have a separate Free State Council controlling the professional lives from beginning to end of medical men practising in this country, and we will have in addition a certain number of Irish representatives attending the meetings of the General Medical Council, supervising not merely <Col N="2161" /> Irish education, but the education of those Irishmen who left the country to practise abroad, and also helping to supervise the educational courses and examinations of those students who pass examinations in England, Scotland, or Wales.  For many years to come there undoubtedly will be a very close liaison as between those two bodies.  In fact, it would seem desirable that there should be the closest possible liaison between those bodies. But if the Council here, if the practitioners, if the qualifying bodies think that that particular liaison should be broken, it will be in their power to cut clean away.  The Bill is midway between simply continuing the old state of affairs, in which the establishment of the Free State would be neglected for the purpose of medical education and the old powers of the General Medical Council with regard to education and examinations would still continue as before, and particularly the power with regard to the control of medicals in their career afterwards, and it stands midway between that situation and what was put up at one time as the alternative, that there should be a complete break with the old system, and that without paying any attention or giving any heed to the fact that a very big number of medicals do, in fact, leave this country to practise elsewhere, that we should have proceeded to set up a Council here simply having regard to Irish medicals who are going to qualify here and live their professional lives here.  This, I hold, has achieved the best points of both.  It gives the Free State Council the completest control that one could imagine over the students qualifying and living here in their professional capacity, and at the same time it has made arrangements which will allow those students who want, or are driven to go abroad in their professional capacity, to get all the rights that were previously secured to them under the control of the General Medical Council.</P>

      <P>While I cannot move the amendment, I can perhaps get the information which the amendment was put down to get.  It seems to me that if we are guaranteeing the capital and the mortgage certificates <Col N="2163" /> to be issued it would only be in keeping with the whole tone of the Bill that the debentures should also have a State guarantee.  Though I cannot move my amendment, there might, perhaps, be something in it which would be worth the consideration of the Minister.  Would the Minister consider the question of guaranteeing debentures issued by the Corporation? Personally, I cannot well see what occasion would arise for the issue of debentures.  I am not sure that such issue is necessary but, if issued, it ought to have some guarantee just as the other issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to give some further justification for issuing debentures.  I cannot see the necessity for them.  There are three means of providing funds.  These <Col N="2164" /> are the ordinary share capital, the mortgage certificates, and the deposits. This is the fourth means for getting capital.  I do not see the necessity for it, and I do not consider it advisable that there should be a means of this kind.  Debentures have to be issued on the assets of the Corporation, so far as I can see.  The first charge on the assets will be the certificate holders, and I cannot see how debenture charges could be put before them.  Debentures are issued on the security of the assets of the Corporation only as a second charge, and they would not be a marketable security.  It is inadvisable to provide security if it is not marketable. If the debentures are not guaranteed they will not be taken up by the public, and the credit of the Corporation will consequently be injured.  I think we should have some explanation as regards the necessity for providing these debentures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The certificates will be the first charge on the security set aside for that purpose.  There will also be other securities set aside, but not in the pool against certificates.  The Deputy asked me what particular case I have in mind in which it would be advisable for the company to issue debentures. I have no case in mind.  I do not visualise a specific case in which it will be necessary for the company to issue debentures, but conceivably, it might arise.  There will probably be a large amount of assets unpledged, and it may be more convenient to borrow from the bank on debentures.  Why not give that right, especially when you limit the debentures to the paid-up capital?  If the Deputy asked me to name a set of circumstances under which debentures will be issued for temporary accommodation, I could not do it.  I know it is likely that there will be assets of the Corporation unpledged, so far as certificates are concerned. It may be that the Corporation might decide that they will avail of a loan temporarily on debentures, and why not give them the right to do it?  We must assume that the directors will be competent men, and that they will exercise their discretion properly. If they do not do so, they might injure the Corporation unwisely.  The Deputy <Col N="2165" /> wants me to justify the insertion of this section giving this power to the Corporation.  I think the fair way to put it would be to ask the Deputy to justify the removal of that right from the Corporation.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I move&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert before Section 20 a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  As soon as conveniently may be after the formation and registration of the Corporation a register of chattel mortgages shall be set up in every Circuit Court Office and shall be thenceforward there kept and maintained in accordance with this <Col N="2166" /> section and the regulations made thereunder.</P>
    <P>(2)  Subject to compliance with the conditions prescribed by or under this section for the registration of a chattel mortgage, every chattel mortgage shall be capable of being registered within seven days and no longer after its date in the register of chattel mortgages maintained under this section in the Circuit Court Office serving the area in which the farm of the mortgagor is situate or, where such farm is situate in two or more areas served by separate Circuit Court Offices, in each of the several registers of chattel mortgages maintained under this section in the said Circuit Court Offices respectively.</P>
    <P>(3)  Any person party to a chattel mortgage (whether as mortgagor, mortgagee, or surety) or the legal representative of any such person may register such chattel mortgage within seven days and no longer after its date in any register of chattel mortgages in which such chattel mortgage is capable of being registered under this section and such mortgagee or, with the consent in writing of the mortgagee, such mortgagor or surety or his legal representative may at any time remove such chattel mortgage from any such register.</P>
    <P>(4)  Whenever the principal moneys and interest secured by a chattel mortgage are fully repaid the mortgage shall forthwith remove such chattel mortgage from every register of chattel mortgages in which it is registered under this section.</P>
    <P>(5)  No chattel mortgage shall be of any force or effect unless or until it is duly registered in accordance with this section and the regulations made thereunder in the register or every register (as the case may be) of chattel mortgages in which it is capable of being registered under this section, and a chattel mortgage so registered shall cease to be of any force or effect if and when it ceases to be duly registered in such register or every such register (as the case may be).</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2167" /> (6)  The contents of any register of chattel mortgages maintained under this section shall not be published or disclosed, nor shall any copies thereof or any part thereof be issued to any person save only and except&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  any person in the employment of the Corporation and duly authorised in writing in that behalf by the Corporation may at any time inspect and take copies of any such register or any part thereof; and</P>
    <P>(b)  any person in the employment of a recognised bank and duly authorised in writing in that behalf by such bank may at any time inspect and take copies of any such register or any part thereof; and</P>
    <P>(c)  an under-sheriff may at any time inspect the register of chattel mortgages maintained in a Circuit Court Office serving the area or any part of the area for which he is the under-sheriff; and</P>
    <P>(d)  an officer employed in a Circuit Court Office and performing duties formerly performed by the under-sheriff may at any time inspect the register of chattel mortgages maintained in such Circuit Court Office; and</P>
    <P>(e)  whenever the Supreme Court or any Judge of the High Court or the Circuit Court directs that a copy of the portion of any such register relating to any particular chattel mortgage or alleged chattel mortgage be furnished to them or him, such copy shall be so furnished accordingly, and such Court or Judge may disclose or publish such copy or the contents thereof to such extent and in such manner and subject to such conditions as in their or his opinion justice may require.</P>
    <P>(7)  The High Court or the Circuit Court or the Supreme Court on appeal from the High Court may at any time cause any register of chattel mortgages maintained under this section to be rectified (whether by variation, addition, or omission) in such manner as justice may require.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2168" /> (8)  The Minister for Justice may by order make regulations in relation to all or any of the following matters, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the form and contents of the several registers of chattel mortgages maintained under this section;</P>
    <P>(b)  the keeping and maintenance generally of such registers;</P>
    <P>(c)  the mode of registering a chattel mortgage in such registers and the evidence to be produced for the purpose of such registration of the due execution of such chattel mortgage;</P>
    <P>(d)  with the consent of the Minister for Finance, the fees to be charged and taken in respect of the registration of chattel mortgages in such registers, the removal of chattel mortgages from such registers, the inspection of such registers and any other matter relating to such registers;</P>
    <P>(e)  the general preservation of the secrecy of such registers and in particular the evidence of authority to be produced by persons claiming to inspect or take copies of such registers:</P>
    <P>(f)  after consultation with the Minister for Finance, the persons who are to be deemed to be recognised banks for the purpose of the provisions of this section relating to the inspection and taking copies of such registers.</P>
    <P>(9)  The expenses of carrying this section into effect shall, to such extent as shall be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>As Section 20 stands, it provides for a chattel mortgage being registered in the central registry.  The amended section makes only one change.  It provides for registration in the Office of the Circuit Court.  The idea is to provide against the following contingency. A sheriff gets a decree from a judgment creditor and proceeds to execute it.  He then finds that there was a chattel mortgage against the stock and that he is open to an action for illegal <Col N="2169" /> seizure.  That is a contingency that should not be allowed arise.  The only way out of it is to have a register in each Circuit Court Office.  Most sub-sheriffs are in the offices of the Circuit Court and, as I understand, all sub-sheriffs' work will gradually merge in that of the county registrar.  Under this section if a decree reaches a sheriff, he will consult the register. He will then know whether he can seize as he will find out whether there is any mortgage on the stock.  I think that that is absolutely necessary. Merely to give the sheriff the right to inspect the central register was not sufficient.  It would take some days to do so and the sheriff might find, after a day or two had elapsed, that he was not in a position to make a seizure immediately.</P>
    <P>A week later, however, he might make a seizure and find out that in the meantime a mortgage had been registered. Under this section he could consult the register and see whether there is a mortgage on the stock.  This, no doubt affects the secrecy of the register to some extent but I do not see how that can be avoided.  I think the real point about registering is that no entry on the register can appear in &ldquo;Stubbs' &rdquo; or other papers circulating in commercial circles and containing entries of judgments.  So long as the entry does not appear in those gazettes and is not known to everybody who is willing to pay a fee of one shilling, secrecy to a great extent is maintained. I admit that a larger number of people will know that registration takes place in each county, but that cannot be avoided as we must protect the sheriff and make it easy to administer the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister explain the order of carrying out the work of the Corporation?  How will applications be made to the Corporation? I want to understand something about the machinery.  If you are to have a separate register in each Circuit Court area will you also have a central register?  If that were so, would it not be better to have a central register and a copy of the particular portion of that register for that particular area <Col N="2170" /> available to the sheriff in such area? I think you must have something like a central register.  Otherwise, I think there must be difficulty with regard to the operations of the Corporation.  If you are to have two registers, it seems to me it would be more advisable that the real register should be the central register and that there should be a copy of the portion of the register applicable to the particular area served by the Circuit Court available to the Circuit Court officer.  The question of secrecy does arise to some extent.  If the register is kept in the county town, the borrower will feel that the transaction is less secret than it would be if the register were kept centrally and part of it only made available, on requisition, to the court registrar or the sheriff of the county concerned. If there are to be two registers, I do not know how this scheme is going to work.</P>

If so, is there to be a central register kept by the Board of Directors in their office or is the decision merely with the bank outside as to whether a mortgage will be given or not?  If given I presume an entry will then be made in the local register?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not.  They will also decide what security they will require.  If they decide that they will require the security of a chattel mortgage, then there are provisions here which make it necessary that the chattel mortgage shall be registered in the local registry.  That is carried out by the solicitor, as a matter of course, with the county officer, in the same way as any other legal transaction is carried out.  The view of the Department of Justice is that it is more expedient to have it done that way than to have a central register.  There is no need for a central register if you have a local register.  Of course, there will be a register in the banks of every mortgage they give.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister might outline his ideas with regard to the practical working of this arrangement.  On the Second Reading of the Bill, I think Deputy Good raised a point as to the effect on farmers' credit of the introduction of this system of chattel mortgages.  The idea is a new one in this country, and it is impossible to forecast the actual working of the scheme.  The introduction of chattel mortgages is going to make a very big change in the credit system of the country&mdash;perhaps a bigger change than we realise.  The extent of that change will only be appreciated in the course of time.  But we must try and foresee the possibilities, and deal with them to the best of our ability. In my opinion, the introduction of this system of chattel mortgages will mean that the shop-credit of farmers will be curtailed if not wiped out altogether.  It is for us to consider whether that is advisable or not.  Personally, I think it would be a good thing if a great deal of the shop-credit <Col N="2172" /> given to farmers were abolished.  But if that is to be done, there must be an adequate substitution of credit.  The farmer must be able to get credit from some other sources, because he requires credit.  He will have to get credit through the joint stock banks or through the Agricultural Credit Corporation. If the Corporation fails them, some farmers will be placed in a worse position than that in which they are at present.</P>
      <P>As regards secrecy in clause (b) of sub-section (6) the ordinary banks are entitled to get information with regard to chattel mortgages.  In actual practice banks get information for their customers from other banks.  I should like to know if it would be possible for the banks to impart the information they get about these chattel mortgages to their customers.  That would ease the situation greatly, and the question is one of considerable importance to the farmers.  I think the Minister should give us fuller information as to what, in his opinion, will happen in the working of the Corporation in connection with this section.</P>

      <P>The Deputy pointed out then that other countries had a system of chattel mortgages and that they provided additional security for the farmer.  I agree with him there. Everybody knows the difficulties of establishing a suitable form of chattel mortgage.  The Deputy has not peculiar knowledge on that subject at all. I tried to solve the difficulties.  My solution is no ideal solution.  But it is my way of dealing with the matter, and I am open to be shown how it can be dealt with in better fashion.  There are certain considerations that have to be reconciled.  On the one hand, you must have a certain amount of secrecy, and on the other hand you must try to protect the ordinary creditor.  This is the best way I can think of doing that, and if there be a better way, I am open to consider it.  I do not think for a <Col N="2173" /> moment that this scheme is going to remain in its present form for ever.  I believe it will have to be amended&mdash; perhaps in a year or two years.  If it has not to be amended, I shall not be disappointed, but I shall be surprised. My opinion is that the chattel mortgage has got sufficient discussion in this country, and in every other country, and that we will not get any further until we test it and discover how it works out in practice.</P>
      <P>I have tried in this Bill to establish a chattel mortgage for the banks.  We had to go into the question of who should have this chattel mortgage, and we decided that the banks and the Corporation should have it.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of secrecy, we decided that it was necessary that there should be secrecy to the extent, at least, that the transaction would not get into &ldquo;Stubbs,&rdquo; and would not be known to the public.  But it is very hard to keep anything secret in this country.  Without eviscerating the whole idea of chattel mortgage, we had to try and protect the ordinary creditor and this is the way we have done it.  There may be a better way. I am open to suggestions.  The banks will have access to the register of chattel mortgages&mdash;every one of them. Otherwise, they could not lend to people on mortgage themselves.  I think nobody has denied that the particular body who can lend money on chattel mortgage should have access to the register.  It is pointed out that the banks may publish to their own clients the contents of that register.  I cannot help that.  Banks are extraordinarily secretive.  They do not publish my overdraft or Deputy Heffernan's deposits. When all is said and done, it cannot be charged against the banks that they publish other people's business. That is their golden rule.  I do not think that the Deputy need fear that any investigations the bank will make will tend to make the register more open than it ordinarily will be.</P>

      <P>I have been waiting to hear the hosts behind the Minister on this and other subjects which we have been discussing during the past week.  I have not noticed any particular <Col N="2174" /> eagerness to occupy the time of the House on the part of those Deputies who have been in the past deprived of an audience by the Opposition Benches.  We were told on Friday last by the Minister's colleague that the reason why different matters had not been discussed from the Ministerial Benches was because the Opposition Deputies had so hypnotised the supporters of the Government that they were afraid to call on the Ceann Comhairle for a hearing.  Now, it appears that other factors have intervened and that it is not the Opposition Benches which are the cause of the great distress of the Deputies on the Government Benches. Currency, Finance and other Bills of that kind of equal importance to this have been allowed to pass through and the Opposition Benches have not occupied an immense amount of time; yet the Government Benches have not shown any particular eagerness to discuss, and enlighten the House on, the merits of the respective Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has introduced an entirely new section with an entirely new idea.  On the last reading he told us with emphasis how important it was to maintain secrecy if this chattel mortgage idea was to have a fair opportunity and be successful.  He has now introduced a new provision which admittedly is lessening the expectation of secrecy.  I do not understand what the real objection is in the minds of people to letting the public know how much they have borrowed, but undoubtedly there is an objection, and the Minister has pointed out how important it is that this general psychological factor should be recognised if this proposal is to be given a fair trial. The under-sheriff in every county is to have access to the information, and, I think, if there is any value in the case made by the Minister before, it is very much lessened by this new provision. The Corporation might well be trusted to keep within its archives any information that may be obtained, and so in respect to a bank.  But can you rely in the same way upon the under-sheriff? The under-sheriff will work, very likely, through his clerks, and if there is to be any importance attached <Col N="2175" /> to the idea of secrecy, there is something more required than this particular provision.</P>
    <P>The sub-section reads:&mdash;&ldquo;The contents of any register shall not be published nor shall any copies...be issued.&rdquo;  Let us assume the possibility that the under-sheriff who inspects the register does, in fact, disclose the contents. What follows?  Nothing at all.  There is no obligation of secrecy in this section.  There is no penalty for breach of secrecy or publication. Nothing follows except, perhaps, a note of the fact that the under-sheriff has published the contents; of course, there is the possibility that he will not be given an opportunity to publish such information again.</P>
    <P>There is an insufficient prohibition here, if it is desired to prohibit at all. There surely ought to be some obligation on the under-sheriff to keep to himself any information that he may obtain from the inspection of this register. If the public, and particularly the borrowing public, are to have very great regard for this secrecy provision in this Bill, the under-sheriff ought to be prohibited, and the banks, too, from publishing the contents of these registers. Such information as they obtain should be only for their own use.</P>
    <P>Deputy Heffernan suggests that the banks may pass over the information to a neighbouring bank.  If they may do that, they may pass it over to another neighbour who is not connected with a bank, a shopkeeper, and the facts may spread by that means unless there is an obligation placed on the banks and on the sub-sheriff, but that obligation does not yet appear in the Bill.  I am assuming it is a very desirable thing to protect the secrecy of this register, and if that is desirable &mdash;I do not know why it should be&mdash; then this section does not assure that secrecy shall be maintained by the people authorised to inspect the register.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no choice in the matter.  I do not know anything <Col N="2176" /> about the value of secrecy in this matter.  I am taking the word of the Minister on the last occasion that it is a very important thing that there should be secrecy.  I think the secrecy is less under the new provision than under the old.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving it as my own opinion that as much secrecy as possible is desirable.  I agree that this register system is not as secret as the system under which there is only one register; but I think the disadvantages of one register are sufficiently important to justify dropping a little of the secrecy, and going to this system.</P>
      <P>The Deputy suggested there should be some penal sanctions attached to this section against the under-sheriff in the event of the wrongful disclosure of the contents of the register.  It is quite clear what the under-sheriff may or may not do.  It is quite clear what he is legally bound to do and what he must not do.  The section sets out that the contents of the register shall not be published except to any person in the employment of the Corporation, any person in the employment of a recognised bank, the under-sheriff and officers of the Supreme Court, the High Court or the Circuit Court.  In other words, the person in charge of the register cannot publish except to these people.  That is the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next question is, can it be enforced and will there be leakages?  I am clear that there will be leakages; even with the central register there will be leakages, but not quite as many. The next question is how to reduce the leakages to the minimum.  I do not know that there is very much in the suggestion that we ought to add a clause to the effect that if the person in charge of the register discloses its contents to anybody other than the person entitled, or if the person to whom it is disclosed makes a wrongful use of the information, that person should be liable to some criminal penalty.  These are all public officials and, if they misconduct themselves, they may be dismissed.  The main con sideration is that, from the point of view of the Minister for Finance, it would be a very serious offence to disclose the contents of the register and <Col N="2177" /> there would be a feeling that any disclosure would be followed by serious disciplinary action.  I suggest that is a more effective sanction than any sanction we could insert in the Bill by way of imposing a penalty for disclosing information.</P>
    <P>At the moment I consider it would not strengthen the section to include any sanction other than what I have mentioned.  I will consider the matter, however, between this and the Report Stage.  It would be absurd to insert in any Act of Parliament some provision to the effect that the bank shall not disclose information.  That would be totally unnecessary.</P>

      <P>The influence on the minds of borrowers will be very considerable. The difficulties will be, perhaps, much greater than one can see at the moment.  The officials of the county registrar's office must do the work; subordinate officials must do it. This information will undoubtedly be in the hands of very considerable numbers of people.  It would not be right to suggest that the information will filter through indiscriminately, but people who know conditions with regard to the administration of these offices will be more suspicious of what is likely to happen, and what is likely to be told than they would be in regard to a central office about which they knew nothing.  In fact, because of their ignorance they would accept it that from the point of view of secrecy the central office would be more effective than would the offices of which they had knowledge.  There are difficulties on both sides.  I feel that the keeping of the register in the offices of the Circuit Court will make many intending borrowers doubt whether or not their neighbours will know.  Borrowers will consider they are safer with the central office.  I certainly favour the central <Col N="2178" /> register as against the register kept in the offices of the Circuit Court.</P>

      <P>I think it would be a great mistake and a great blot on the Bill if it goes out that there is not real secrecy in regard to the borrowings that may take place.  It is one of the most important matters in the Bill.  I do not think it could be too strongly stressed that borrowing should be quite a secret business.  When a man borrows money he does not like it noised abroad all over the district that he had to get money to improve his land, and that he was hard up.  If the feeling of secrecy is lessened it will have a very bad effect.  Of course, the under-sheriff must be protected.  He cannot be laid open to an action.  I do not think it is impossible to work out some system to prevent unauthorised people out of pure curiosity finding out particulars about their neighbour's affairs that they have no right to know.  Over-curiosity on the part of people should be punished or restrained by some penalty.  Something should be done to make it quite clear that enquiry into matters they have no right to know will not be allowed, and that any borrowing that is carried out will be as secret as it possibly can be.  Only the sub-sheriff and people connected with the Corporation and the banks should know anything about these borrowings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>All this is not so helpful. Are we to go back to the one register and if so, what about the sheriff's position?  I believe a secret register is necessary, but I think there is a tendency to overdo that.  I know the more secret it is the better, but I do not agree that people will not borrow unless they are absolutely satisfied that there is the very closest, the greatest, secrecy.  People know perfectly well whether or not the mortgage or the loan becomes known they will borrow.  As we are on this question of secrecy, of course it is something that is rather peculiar to this country and, I think, to the farmers of England and Scotland.  It is not found in other countries at all, notably in America.  This dislike of publication of the fact that a man in a certain business is borrowing money for the <Col N="2179" /> purposes of his business is simply an indication that our commercial education has not advanced.  Whether we are to blame for that or not is another matter. But we should try to get back to the point of view that is normal in every commercial country.  An enterprising man would have all his money invested in his business and whenever he gets a reasonable opportunity of borrowing money at a rate of interest that would enable him to make a profit he seizes it.  He does that as a matter of course.  I think that we should get to the point of view in this country that borrowing money for commercial purposes or agricultural purposes is a legitimate, normal function.  However, there is no use preaching on this question because there is undoubtedly a dislike of publication at present. When a man is short of money and can get money without going into &ldquo;Stubbs' &rdquo; he ought to be satisfied enough.  I think he will.  I adopted this as a compromise between a secret and an absolutely open register.  It is the best I can do.  I have heard no better proposal.</P>

      <P>I wonder would it be possible for the Minister to leave the section as it stands if he cannot find some machinery to make it simpler. I feel, knowing the machinery that will have to operate in this matter, that a great many people will undoubtedly be suspicious and perhaps with some justification.  You cannot possibly carry on the work of keeping a central register in the Circuit Court Registry without subordinate officials having to do the work.  It goes on then to the office of the sub-sheriff.  There again subordinate officials will have to do a considerable amount of the work&mdash; typists and others&mdash;and I feel strongly that the attitude of mind of our people would be very different if their feeling was that the central register was a document kept in the office of the Corporation, away from local knowledge.  I think it should be possible for the Minister to adhere to his original proposition to keep a central register.  Around that he can get some simpler machinery.  I emphatically <Col N="2180" /> say again that it is not at all going to be satisfactory.  There will be complaints.</P>

The difficulty, as pointed out by Deputy Baxter, is that the register will be there in the office and will be open to inspection undoubtedly by a number of subordinate officials.  The information will be available to a number of officials.  My point of view is that we ought to have this thing as secret as we can or else have no secrecy at all.  I believe the day will come when we will have to abolish secrecy with regard to it.  I think it is a mistake to have this secrecy but the conditions in the country are such that if this thing is to work at all we believe and the Minister believes we will have to have secrecy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>to impose on the mortgagor the obligation to preserve and keep safe the farming stock comprised therein and (save as may be otherwise authorised by the chattel mortgage or the mortgagee or may <Col N="2181" /> be necessary for any intended lawful sale) not to remove such farming stock from his farm and, if so required by the chattel mortgage or the mortgagee, to insure and keep insured such farming stock in accordance with such requisition.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), (f), line 40, to delete all words after the word &ldquo;farm&rdquo; to the end of the paragraph.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with the question of insurance with regard to stock which are the subject of chattel mortgage.  The mortgagee has power to insist if he wishes, that the mortgagor shall insure his stock before he will advance money.  I have heard many people complain that it is an injurious provision and one that will prevent the working of this arrangement at all.  The cost of insurance in such a case would be very excessive. The insurance of live stock in this country is a very high charge and particularly if it goes as far as insuring against all kinds of mortalities and fire and matters of that kind.  There is not very much that I can say on the matter except that it is considered that it will add considerably to the charges to the mortgagor and such a provision should be left out of the Bill altogether.</P>

Yet the bank says: &ldquo;We agree, provided you insure so many.&rdquo;  If the bank insists on insurance, what good will your statement be in the matter? It is for the bank to exercise its discretion each time an application is made for a loan.  If you were to ask my opinion I could say that the bank would very often insist on insurance in the case where the security was pedigree stock.  I certainly could not say that they would never insist on insurance in any other case.  Meantime you must give them the right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 21, which is an important one.  It reads:</P>
      <P>In page 12, before paragraph 2, to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister and the Minister for Lands and Agriculture may if and whenever they so think fit by order made by them jointly authorise certificates of charge to be issued against any class or classes of securities specified in such order and may by such order impose such restrictions as they think fit as to the proportion or amount of any particular class of security (including first mortgages on land) to be included in the securities against which a series of certificates of charge may be issued, and may also by such order authorise certificates of charge to be issued although the Corporation does not hold as security for money advanced by it first mortgages on land to the nominal amount of one hundred thousand pounds.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 3 of the Schedule reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Before issuing a series of certificates of charge the directors shall place under the control of trustees, in such manner by transfer, sub-mortgage, deposit, or otherwise as shall be approved by the Minister, good and sound first mortgages on land held by the Corporation as security for advances made by it to a nominal amount not less than the nominal amount of such series of certificates.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2184" /> The proposal is that the securities against which certificates are to be issued shall be placed in the custody of trustees.  I believe that is common with every other company.  The idea is that the trustees will manage and watch over the stock of the certificate holders.  These trustees will be mainly banks or a body like the Currency Commission. They will have very important functions to perform.  They will have to see that the pool of securities is always kept quite sufficient to meet the amount of certificates issued against the pool.  I can conceive that the pool will be composed of all sorts of securities: mortgages on land, charges against, say, the general assets of a creamery, and even a certain amount of joint and several securities, and, perhaps, some chattel mortgages. Even though the certificates are long-term documents, I can conceive that it would be quite safe to issue certificates against a pool containing all sorts of securities, provided the certificates were well covered by the pool.  It would be the duty of the trustees to keep the pool always up to the mark and see to it that it was not depleted; that when short term securities were liquidated that they were replaced by equally good securities of the same or a different kind or by cash invested.  I have not the slightest doubt that that is not only perfectly safe, but even conservative finance.  It will be seen that the duties of the trustees in connection with this Corporation will be very important. There will be no difficulty whatever in getting trustees.  I should say that the ordinary banks would be always glad, for the usual fees, to manage securities of that sort, or a body, say, like the Currency Commission.</P>

He cannot arrange his programme that way.  He may perhaps have to seize on two hours' notice.  That sort of an arrangement would not work at all.

      <P>In the absence of the Minister I should like to acknowledge the great pains and the great care he took in considering this matter. It has been under consideration for a long time, and no unnecessary delay took place.  Those who are acquainted with the delicacies of the situation&mdash;if I may so describe them&mdash;realise perfectly what a difficult task it was, and I certainly pay my tribute to the work which the Minister for Industry and Commerce put in with regard to this matter.  I think it is very satisfactory that a solution of it has been found, a solution which, I think, will get its due meed of praise from both sides of the controversy, because I suppose we will admit that there were two sides to it. There was, unfortunately, a good deal of feeling expressed, and a good deal of doubt given expression to by many people that this particular agreement would not be arrived at, and that the schools here would suffer.  I regret that so much stress was laid on that, because the people who gave expression to those ideas certainly injured the schools.  They did not wish to do it, but there was some damage done.  Now, all the time we had in mind the necessity <Col N="2187" /> for keeping these schools up to their full standard, and I am glad now, after the long period that has elapsed, that a settlement has been arrived at which, in practice, I think, will be found to be an excellent one, one which secures the schools, one which secures all national rights in this matter, and one which, I hope, will work smoothly in the years to come.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked my Parliamentary Secretary to interview the Whips of the different parties in connection with next week's business. I am fairly satisfied that if we sat late on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of next week that would enable us to dispose of next week's business. That might be more acceptable than to meet on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.  If that were agreed to, then I would propose that the next Stage of this Bill be taken on Wednesday next, and that the adjournment this evening should be until Wednesday. If we sat late on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of next week for the disposal of next week's business, I think it would only be necessary to meet afterwards for one or two days to consider any amendments that might be sent down by the Seanad to the Bills before it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the President would give us a little more light on this.  The Finance Bill and the Appropriation Bill are down for consideration on Tuesday next, and I assume that there will be some amendments to the Finance Bill and some discussion on the Appropriation Bill.  I do not know, of course, what the House will do regarding the late sitting, or regarding discussions, but it does not seem to <Col N="2188" /> me to be of any advantage if there is the probability of having to come back the week after to rediscuss Bills coming down from the Seanad.  I take it that if the Seanad completes any Bills this week, they will be available for discussion in the Dáil some time next week.  What is the view of the President regarding procedure in the case of Bills that are only now being considered by the Seanad?  What I am driving at is: Has the President made up his mind as to when there shall be a dissolution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>From all the calculations and estimates that I have made of the time required for the various measures, I should say that it will be possible to dissolve on the 24th or 25th May, and that it would be possible to deal with the Bills mentioned by Deputy Johnson&mdash;the Finance Bill, the Agricultural Credit Bill, and the Appropriation Bill&mdash;next week.  Although there may be amendments, I should say that one stage would dispose of them.  I cannot deny to the House this right, at any rate, that the House is doing its business in considering those measures.  It is considering them at a loss of time in going through the electorate.  There are other people busy with the electorate, and I do not like to put an undue strain on attendance here, in view of the imminence of the election.  I am satisfied, from the examination I have made of this programme, that it would be possible to get through the business we have by sitting on three days next week&mdash;Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.  Assuming that the Seanad is in a position to deal with the various Bills sent to them, Tuesday, 24th, and Wednesday, 25th May, should be sufficient to enable us to deal with any amendments made by the Seanad.  It will have been observed that the management of the business of the Dáil has been such that a fairly constant succession of Bills has gone to the Seanad&mdash;that it has not been a matter of sending three or four Bills to them on one day, but that the sending of Bills from the Dáil has been such that it was possible for the Seanad to consider them.  Although a number of Bills will be before the Seanad, I should say that with a little accommodation <Col N="2189" /> it would be possible for us to receive them all back by the 24th instant.</P>

      <P>If we come back on the 24th May to discuss, say, the amendments to the Electricity Bill made by the Seanad, how long will it take the Dáil to deal with those amendments, which then may have to go back to the Seanad again?
