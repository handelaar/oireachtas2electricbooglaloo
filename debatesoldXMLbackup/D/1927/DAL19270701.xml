      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state who constitute the present Board of Trustees on the Upper Inny Drainage District, comprising portions of Counties Cavan, Meath and Westmeath; when this Board was elected, and whether statutory notice was given of the intention to have these trustees elected; if so, where was this notice published and when was the election held; if he will also state if any audit of the accounts of this Body has recently been held and by whom, and, if he is aware that this Body levied a rate for 1927-28 of four times the amount of the rate agreed upon between landlord and tenant and approved of by the Land Commission at the sale of the Oliver Nugent Estate, Clontyduffy, etc., Mountnugent, in 1914, and if this action has the approval of his Department.</P>

      <P>The last election of the Drainage Board for the Upper Inny Drainage District of which the Commissioners of Public Works are aware took place in the Boardroom. Castlepollard, on the 11th October, 1920, when the following twelve proprietors were elected to form the Drainage Board for the District: Willoughby J. Bond, Farragh, Longford; Patrick Cooney, Carpenterstown, Castlepollard; James Cullen, Slieveboy, Castlepollard; Daniel Davitt, Castlepollard; James Holmes, Newcastle, Coole; E. J. Hope, Gartlsndstown, Mullingar; <Col N="296" /> Thomas Hopkins, Multyfarnham; James Kelly, Multyfarnham; Thomas Markey, Ballinalack, Rathowen; James MacDermott, Ballinamel, Coole; Thomas Smyth, Garrysallagh, Mt. Nugent; Patrick Weir, Benison Lodge, Castlepollard, with L. M. Coughlan, Castlepollard, as secretary.</P>
      <P>On the resignation of Mr. Coughlan in December, 1925, the Drainage Board. appointed Mr. J. P. Doran in his place. The Commissioners are not aware whether the usual statutory notices, i.e., an advertisement in some one or more of the newspapers circulating in the district, and the affixing of a copy of the notice to the outer door of the principal office of the Drainage Board were complied with, as there is no statutory obligation on the Commissioners of Works in the matter. The audit of the accounts of the Drainage Board is a matter solely for that Body as is also the levying of a Drainage Rate.  The Commissioners have no power to intervene in these matters and they are not aware what rate was struck for the year 1927-28 by the Drainage Board.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce a question last evening respecting the Supplementary Estimate for the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway.  The estimate was postponed at the desire of the Minister.

      <P>I think leave was given yesterday for dealing with the Supplementary Estimate that Deputy Law mentioned but no order was made.  When the question of taking the Supplementary Estimate was discussed last evening on the Minister's main estimate an agreement appeared to have been reached that the Minister would consult Donegal Deputies so that a time would be agreed upon with them.  Nothing definite was done about it.  The Minister is not present now but presumably he will be ready to take the estimate at some time that would suit Deputy Law and Deputy White.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of the Currency Bill, 1927.  As Deputies are aware, the Currency Bill was introduced into the last Dáil and passed through all stages up to the Report Stage.  In the course of the Committee and Report Stages a considerable number of technical amendments were passed.  As originally introduced, the Bill was based on the Banking Commission's First Interim Report. <Col N="298" /> As it was necessary in the course of the Bill's progress to elaborate matters which had only been dealt with in a broad and general way in the Report of the Commission it was found that certain details in it could be improved by amendment and so far as possible we met any objections that were raised and we sought any advice that could be obtained.  I think in the stage it reached in the last Dáil the Bill was fairly water-tight.</P>
      <P>Deputies may be aware that the Currency Commission was appointed about fifteen months ago because it was found amongst other things that there was no such thing in this country as legal tender which could be identified as such.  The ordinary British currency note is not legal tender.  The only British currency note which would be legal tender in this country is the currency note which was issued before the Treaty.  Probably the number of such notes in existence is fairly small and at any rate they could not be identified.  Furthermore various joint stock banks had a note issue which appertained to the whole of Ireland and there was no fiduciary limit which had reference to the Saorstát.  It was necessary that the fiduciary issue should be divided as between the Saorstát and Northern Ireland because the Saorstát is a definite, fiscal, financial and economic unit.  It had also been complained that there were not all the facilities that were necessary in the matter of agricultural credit or business credit.  In view of these matters, and in view of the necessity of causing no alarm or taking any action that could cause any reasonable apprehension, it was decided to appoint a Commission to examine the whole question.  The terms of reference were:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To consider and to report to the Minister for Finance what changes, if any, in the law relative to banking and note issue are necessary or desirable, regard being had to the altered circumstances arising from the establishment of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission consisted of Professor Henry Parker Willis of Columbia University as Chairman.  He was for <Col N="299" /> some time Secretary of the Federal Reserve Board of the United States. He held other very important positions in regard to banking in the United States, has written on banking and has carried out investigations in regard to banking and currency matters, and in particular in regard to agricultural credit.  Other members of the Commission were Senator Jameson, Director of the Bank of Ireland; Mr. O'Connell, Director of the National Bank; Mr. F. J. Lillis, Director of the Munster and Leinster Bank; Mr. Smith-Gordon, Director of the Industrial Trust Company of Ireland; Mr. Campion who had been in the service of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and who also had experience in connection with questions of agricultural credit; Mr. Galloway, a Director of the Ulster Bank; and Mr. McElligott of the Department of Finance.  Deputies will see that about half the members of the Commission consisted of representatives of the joint stock banks in this country.  It was necessary that the banks should be very strongly represented on the Commission because reform which had not the concurrence of the banks could not be successfully carried out.  Certainly no such reform could be safely carried out.  As I pointed out on previous occasions in the Dáil, there is no matter on which the Irish people would more readily take panic than changes referring to currency or the credit of the banks. Mr. Smith-Gordon was Assistant Secretary of the I.A.O.S. and was associated with its work in this country.  He has written on various economic and credit matters.  Mr. Campion had experience in the service of a State bank, a Central bank, in one of the States of the British Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>In regard to this matter of note issue, both bank note issue and legal tender note issue, the Commission were able to come to what was very nearly a unanimous conclusion.  One member of the Commission, Senator Jameson, presented a minority report but in a great many directions the minority report is in something like agreement with the majority report.  The matters on which it differs are considerations, I <Col N="300" /> think, of a somewhat minor character. By the report of the Banking Commission it is proposed and also by this Bill that a legal tender note issue be instituted here.  That legal tender note issue will be issued, controlled and regulated by the Currency Commission. It will be backed £ for £ by British sterling so that no exchange variations can occur as between our currency and the currency in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>It is provided in the Bill that at the London agency of the Commission any person presenting legal tender notes must receive British currency in exchange.  The British money which is presented to the Currency Commission for legal tender will be held in the legal tender note fund and will be invested as to the main part in interest-bearing securities, and dividends obtained from these securities will go to the general fund of the Commission.  That fund after paying the expenses of the Commission should provide for certain reserves.  The surplus remaining after paying the expenses will go to the Exchequer.  It is anticipated that something like £250,000 a year will go to the Exchequer as a result of the issue of legal tender notes.  These notes will take the place of the British currency notes which are at present in circulation, and they will also take the place of secured bank notes.  The present bank note issue is of two kinds. although the two classes are not distinguishable to the public.  It consists of the fiduciary issues of which the security is the general assets of banks.  In addition to the fiduciary issues there are excess issues which have to be covered pound for pound by British currency notes held by the banks or by British currency note certificates, so that secured notes issued by the banks here are practically the equivalent of the British currency.</P>
    <P>Our new tender notes will take the place of the actual British currency notes in circulation.  At present our Exchequer obtains no profit on that circulation.  The profit goes to the British Exchequer.  The existing bank note issue will be substituted by a new and consolidated bank note issue.  The fiduciary issue of the various banks was fixed in 1845.  It <Col N="301" /> was a privilege which certain banks had and others had not.  As I have said, it was a fiduciary issue fixed for each bank with reference to the whole of Ireland.  No limit is fixed for the Saorstát.  That was a matter that had to be dealt with in some radical way. It would not be possible to fix new limits for an issue for certain banks, and to leave other banks without a note issue.  It would not have been reasonable or possible to fix a Saorstát limit and say that a certain amount of the existing fiduciary issue of a bank related to the Saorstát, and the other amount related to the remainder of Ireland.  It was necessary to deal with that point in a somewhat more radical way than that.  It would not have been desirable either merely to have given a note issue to the banks that had no note issue and in that way put them on a parity, for these fixed limits of fiduciary issues had no relation at all to the existing state or requirements of the country.  They were simply accidental figures arrived at on the basis of the notes of these banks outstanding, and the limits were fixed in 1845.</P>
    <P>The tendency at present is to take from ordinary banks the right of note issue and to confine that right to a central bank.  If the Commission here had gone the whole hog in the matter of standing for the modern trend they would probably have recommended the taking of the right of note issue from the banks and would have recommended the setting up of a central bank, confining the note issue to that bank.  Instead of doing that they took a course which was something in the nature of a compromise, and which will give us a system something like that which exists in the United States. It is proposed that the consolidated note issue be allocated to the various banks, and that it be re-allocated from tune to time and be supervised and regulated by the Currency Commission, so that while the Currency Commission will not perform the function of a central bank, in a general way it will perform certain of the functions in regard to note issue.  It will be an independent Commission on which not only the banks but the general public <Col N="302" /> will be represented.  The Commission will consist of six ordinary members and the chairman.  Three of the ordinary members will be elected by the joint stock banks, and three of the other members will be appointed by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The chairman of the Commission will be elected by the ordinary members, or in default of his election by them he may be appointed by the Minister for Finance.  The ordinary members of the Commission will hold office for three years, so that it will not be possible for a Government which might find itself in budgetary or financial difficulties to put sudden pressure on the Commission to alter its policy for the purpose of improperly helping the Government out of its difficulty.  The chairman of the Commission will hold office for a period of five years.  I think by the constitution of such a Commission we have got the best balance possible.  We have got full representation for the banks and banking interests, and we have got the best sort of representation that could be secured for the general public, because the Minister for Finance in nominating representatives is precluded from nominating more than one State servant.  His other nominated representatives must be interested in business or industry in the country.  I think by that means we have got a board which will be independent in the exercise of its functions, and which will be sufficiently conservative to conduct the business of the Commission on sound lines, and which will be responsive to the credit requirements of the country.  The basis, as I have said, of the new consolidated note issue, unlike the old fiduciary note issue, will not be a fixed amount. There is a limit of £6,000,000 for the initial period of two years, but within those two years, under certain conditions, it is provided in the Bill that the limit may be exceeded, and subsequently every three years a new limit will be fixed with reference to the requirements of the country.</P>
    <P>That is a much more satisfactory and much more scientific method of meeting the credit requirements of the country than the system that we have known <Col N="303" /> hitherto of a simply fixed limit of note issue.  The basis of the issue of consolidated notes either in general or to the individual banks will be the liquid sound advances of these banks.  It must not be taken and cannot be taken that the bank will have notes issued to it up to the limit of these liquid sound advances.  The proportion of notes which any bank gets out of the total issue will depend on the amount of liquid sound advances which that bank is making and has made.</P>
    <P>I think that because of this new basis of the issue of notes we will have the credit requirements of the country better met than they have been in the past. and I think that the institution of the new system is going to have a very good effect upon the banks.  As Deputies are aware, I have never agreed with the popular criticism that one hears of the banks; but at the same time I do think it is a fact that there has not perhaps been sufficient attention paid by the banks to the national requirements of the country. Certainly there has been no such thing as a currency or a credit policy here. There has been no machinery for giving effect to such a policy, even if a policy could have been evolved.  Now we will have the machinery for giving effect to the policy.  We will have, under the new conditions, the likelihood of a definite credit policy suited to the needs and requirements of this country being evolved.  This will turn the eyes of the banks to our own machinery here.  Heretofore banks have paid a composition stamp duty of 7/- per £100 on bank notes.  We have since the setting up of the Free State got a composition duty on the notes issued by the banks as their note issue at headquarters here in Dublin, including of course in that the National Bank which has its headquarters in London, but which has no British note issue.  The Northern Government has got the composition on notes issued in Belfast, irrespective, of course, of where they circulate.</P>
    <P>On the new consolidated note issue up to the limit of £6,000,000, we will get a composition stamp duty in future. of 30/- per £100, and, on such portions <Col N="304" /> of the consolidated note issue as exceeds this £6,000,000, we will get a composition duty in place of the old duty of £2 per £100.  The new arrangement will bring the Exchequer an additional revenue of something between £250,000 and £300,000 per annum.  That is a factor of some importance in a country like this.  In addition to that it will provide us with what we have not got at the present time&mdash;a legal tender.  It will provide us with a more modern and more scientific system of note issue.  It will I think lead to the development of a definite credit policy in this country, suited to the needs and requirements of the people.</P>

      <P>I interested myself in this Bill in the last Dáil.  I do not propose to repeat what I then said, or indeed to say anything which would lead to a mere repetition of the discussion which then took place.  I only rise for one purpose.  I then did state the opinion, for what it was worth &mdash;and I do not claim to be an expert in the matter&mdash;that, as far as I could see, the Bill was based on a wrong principle, that principle to which the Minister has just referred, connecting the amount of note issue with what is called in the Banking Commission's Report, the liquid sound advances.  In the discussions that took place then or since I have seen nothing to induce me to change the opinion I then expressed. I simply rise to say that I still hold that opinion, but I neither then voted against the Second Reading nor do I now intend to vote against it for the simple reason that it is true as the Minister has said, that the Bill is based on the Banking Commission's Report which was signed with almost unanimity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMENAMIN Mr. McMENAMIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMENAMIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few inquiries on the text of this measure.  It will be obvious to the House that this is a measure transcendant in its importance and highly technical in its construction. The duty devolves on us here, irrespective of parties, to see that this measure, on which the future of this country is to stand or fall, should pass from this House in as water-tight a condition, so <Col N="305" /> far as the financial security of the nation can be provided for, as it is possible for us to make it.  The Minister has just said that this measure when it was left off in the last Dáil, if I correctly understood him, was water-tight.  There are now just one or two criticisms, questions or queries that I want to put to the Minister in this respect, merely to test that statement. I only read over this measure last night, because coming in for the first time to the House last week, every day's work was a quite sufficient matter for the time being.</P>
      <P>In reading the Bill over it occurred to me that there are two portions of this measure which are not only the foundations of the measure itself but which will be the basis of the future security of the nation.  The first part is the backing for the legal tender and the second part is the preservation of the custodianship of that backing when it is lodged.  If you look at Part V of the Bill you will see that the issuing banks can issue a prescribed tender and lodge a draft payable at sight in London or lodge with the Currency Commission securities to the amount of the tender issued at the current value of the tender&mdash;that is to say, the value of the legal tender issued at the time of the issue of the notes. It occurred to me on reading that subsection that it left itself open to what might be a non-liquidated liability on, behalf of the taxpayers of the country in the future.  For example, if the issuing houses purchased British securities in London or elsewhere at par, or at 95 or at 90, and lodged them with the Currency Commission as security for the issue, at the end of 10 or 15 years the market value of that scrip may be so depreciated that it could be got at 50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a provision in the Bill that any deficit that may arise will be paid out of the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof.  I would like to ask Deputies, irrespective of parties, are they as representing the people of the country, prepared to undertake that unknown and unliquidated liability? First the scrip purchased is paid for. Secondly, the bank that issues the tender is protected because any deficit <Col N="306" /> that arises in regard to its security is met out of the Central Fund.  Are we, on behalf of the nation and acting as its trustees, prepared to undertake that liability in order that these other people should be protected?  These are the main considerations.  You have first this question as regards British securities and the value thereof.</P>
    <P>There is another thing that occurs to me.  Let us assume that while these British securities would be absolute security at the moment of purchase, it may well be that the social order in England may be changed and that we would have, perhaps a condition of affairs that we had a few years, ago in Dublin and throughout the country, when German marks sold at a penny a thousand.  This is an element we should carefully examine and if possible, protect the taxpayer against.</P>
    <P>Part VII of the Bill deals with the reserves of the Currency Commission, and the provisions, as set out, are in themselves quite good so far as they go. In so far as it is provided that the Currency Commission shall hold various securities, it is within their discretion to decide the kind of securities they may hold, but they are bound to hold some securities of this nature.  But provided that they do comply with the provisions of the Bill and that they hold these securities, where is the guarantee to the nation that the securities are, at any specific moment, held by the Currency Commission?  So far as I can see there is no restriction&mdash;I am, as one of the trustees of the nation, putting this to the Minister&mdash;and I see no provision in the Bill which makes it incumbent on the Currency Commission to have these securities available for inspection at a specific moment.  Is there any provision under which any individual, say the Minister for Finance, may go to the Currency Commission and say: &ldquo;I want to see now the entire six million pounds' worth of securities&rdquo;?  I think that Part VII ought to be augmented in order that there can be some check, so that the nation can be absolutely sure that the Currency Commission do, in fact, hold the securities that were handed over to them.  So far as I see, that is one of the defects of this measure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="307" /> If those two things were made absolutely water-tight we would have laid the foundation in so far as the root of the question of sound finance is concerned. As regards the second portion of Part VII, I would like to ask those who represent the staple interests of the country are they prepared to take the future unliquidated liability that is provided for in the measure by making good out of the Central Fund any deficit that may arise on the purchase and sale of these securities?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidLeoOGorman" hpid="Mr. O'GORMAN Mr. O'GORMAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'GORMAN</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution to the debate will be very small.  The Minister for Finance told us that it was the custom to charge 7s. per £100 on the note issue of the banks, and that the future rate will be 30s. per £100. He claims that that will be a source of profit.  I wonder was he serious when he made that statement?  It will be a source of profit to the Exchequer, but it will be a source of loss to the general public.  Does the Minister or anybody here doubt that the banks will pass on that charge?  I believe that instead of being a profit it will cause a loss to anyone who will have to deal with the banks or who will have to borrow.  I hope the Minister will abandon the claim that it is a source of profit.  Personally, I think that interference with the currency or coinage is a mistake. I was once at a circus, and the funny man in the circus showed the people how to get rich quickly.  He said: &ldquo;Take a pound note, fold it across and you double it.&rdquo;  That seems to me to be the system of our Minister for Finance.  The wealth of a country lies in its production and not by juggling with finance.  Our flocks and herds, our butter and eggs&mdash;in them the wealth lies.  Juggling with currency and coinage will not enrich us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting to hear from Deputy O'Gorman that he is moving towards the time when the basis of currency will be flocks and herds and grain.  The criticism that Deputy McMenamin made has, I think, a basis of soundness.  The question that he will have to answer, as I have had to answer, is whether it is well that there should be a continuation of <Col N="308" /> the present system in which there is not even the security that is referred to in the Bill.  There is no legal tender in the country.  There is not the security, as I say, which he refers to. Whatever risks there may be attaching to it, there is at least a formal security. Again, we are faced with the question whether we desire that the credit relations between Great Britain and Ireland shall be on a parity; whether, as a matter of fact, we shall be anchored to London, or shall go forward entirely independent.</P>
      <P>If Deputy McMenamin and Deputies generally are in favour of the change to absolute separation in that respect, we are undoubtedly going to create a good deal of doubting and questioning as to the opportuneness of that change.  The Banking Commission reported, and their report was generally received with approval, that it was not desirable to make that change, that it was not desirable to make that separation. Consequently, I am prepared now, as I was on the last occasion when this Bill was discussed, to acquiesce in it, because I believe it is not making any radical change, and I do not think this is the last Bill dealing with currency and credit questions.  I think, as a matter of fact, the proposals in the Bill, after a few years' experience, will make for a further change&mdash;a centralised note issue under the direct authority of the State and no secondary note issue, that is, a note issue which is not legal tender.  I do not think the Bill institutes a radical change.  Because of that fact, it has not created very much commotion in circle?  which are supposed to be chiefly interested in this problem.  I think Deputy McMenamin will have to answer the question whether, in fact, he desires there should be a radical change, with an Irish reserve of gold, or whether he is prepared to go on, as at present, with no legal tender in Ireland, with no absolute security and not even with the assurance that there is gold behind the securities which are behind the Irish currency.  That is the difficulty I see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question has to be answered whether we are to go on simply as we are, marking time and depending even <Col N="309" /> more definitely than we will be under this Bill, on London and the Bank of England, or whether we are prepared to make a much more radical change than is proposed in the Bill.  I think the general view of the country is that it is better not to make that radical change.  Personally, I am not able to say that the time is ripe for the radical change which I think will eventually come.  But as I think some change is necessary, and as legislation is required to have legal tender for this country, probably the scheme proposed in the Bill is as little harmful as any other.</P>

      <P>The Minister has alluded to the Report of the Banking Commission.  There have been, I think, three Reports from the Banking Commission.  I should like to know from the Minister if a final Report has yet been made, and, if so, whether it will be published.</P>

      <P>The Final Report is being made, and will be published.  It is in draft.  I do not know whether or not it has been yet signed by every member of the Commission, but it is in the concluding stages of preparation. I do not think I need say very much in reply to Deputy Thrift.  The system of basing note issue on or relating it to liquid sound advances is a system which is very widespread.  There is a tendency, I think, to adopt it even more generally at the present time. The proposals in the Bill have the backing of our Irish Joint Stock Bankers, who do not err, I think, on the side of rashness.  If any criticism could be advanced concerning them it would be that they are conservative.  Deputy McMenamin seemed to be under the impression that people would lodge securities with the Currency Commission, that they would get legal tender, but that the securities would remain their property and might be redeemed by them at some future time.  That is not the provision in the Bill.  In the ordinary way, people will get legal tender notes by paying for them in British currency.  The Commission, in certain circumstances, may accept a draft on London, if it approves of the draft, or it may accept direct transfer of securities.  If it got cash, it would be <Col N="310" /> obliged to invest that cash in securities. The securities which are transferred to it will be its property, just as if it bought them with the cash it received for legal tender notes.</P>
      <P>At present, we are entirely dependent on the monetary stability of Great Britain.  If there were inflation to-morrow, whether to a greater or lesser degree, we would be involved in the consequences of it.  At the present time, we have absolutely no protection against the effects of British monetary policy.  There is no doubt that, under the provisions of this Bill, if the British Government pursued a financial or monetary policy which led to rapid depreciation in the value of British securities, we would suffer or we would, when we saw it about to happen, have to alter the arrangements provided for in the Bill.  In any case, the possibility would be open to us of altering the arrangements provided in the Bill and we would have machinery which would at once enable us to escape the effects, to a large degree, of unsound British financial policy.  We have no reason to fear that British financial policy will be unsound. There are great advantages in having no variable rate of exchange between this country and Britain, and consequently, until we have some grounds for believing that the British Government is going to pursue some very unsound policy, I think there is no reason for making any changes in the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the holding of reserves and securities which should be held on behalf of the legal tender note fund, there will be a half-yearly valuation, and the accounts of the Commission will be submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor-General to be audited on behalf of the Dáil.  It will be the duty of the Commission to satisfy the Comptroller and Auditor-General that it holds the securities it ought to hold.  When Deputy O'Gorman referred to what the increased duty on the notes will be based on he ignored the fact that we are adopting a new and a more elastic system, a system which will be beneficial to the banks, and which will, I think, enable them to pay this additional sum without <Col N="311" /> passing it on.  As regards the major part of the profit which this new system will bring the Exchequer, that will be a profit that has heretofore gone and is at present going into the British Exchequer.  That is the profit on the legal tender notes which will take the place of British currency notes, or bank notes which were backed by British currency notes.  I think that the Deputy underestimated the importance of financial systems and financial arrangements.  Perhaps there are other people who overestimate it, but I think if the Deputy believes that our monetary and credit arrangements have little or no effect on production he is misreading the situation.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;That&rdquo; and insert instead thereof the words:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;a Select Committee, consisting of eleven Deputies, to be nominated by the Committee of Selection, be appointed to revise the salary to be paid to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle of Dáil Eireann as fixed by paragraph 4 of the Report of the Committee on Salaries and Allowances, dated the 15th January, 1923, which was adopted by Dáil Eireann on the 24th January, 1923; that the quorum of the Committee be five; and that the election of a Leas-Cheann Comhairle be deferred pending the presentation of a Report in the matter by the Select Committee.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say at the beginning that this is not the first move in a policy of indiscriminate and undiscriminating reduction of salaries.  At the beginning of the last Dáil, when the Committee <Col N="312" /> made certain recommendations regarding rates of remuneration for officers of the Dáil, they were without experience, and consequently had to rely upon procedure in other places and on what were estimated to be the duties of the various officers.  I think it will be generally recognised by those who were members of the last Dáil that there was an over-estimation of the importance of the office of Leas-Cheann Comhairle and an over-estimation of the salary value, shall I say, of the office.  We are, therefore, now in a most opportune position, I think, to reconsider the question of the salary to be attached to the office.  We are at the beginning of a new Dáil; there is no question of the personal relations of the late holder of the office coming between Deputies and their judgment as to what is right and fair to the ex-holder; we may discuss and consider the matter entirely afresh with a view to the duties attached to the office, based upon our experience of the past.  My view is that the duties of the office do not warrant the payment of a salary of £1,000, that that is a matter that has a right to be considered, and the question will at once arise as to what would be considered to be legitimate and fair remuneration for the office, if the office is necessary.</P>
    <P>I think the office is necessary, and I think that it is desirable at least that the holder of the office be in receipt of a salary over and above the allowance for expenses that he receives as a Deputy.  His duties may be more onerous than the duties of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle of the last Dáil, but while in one respect they may be more onerous, in another respect they may be less onerous than was anticipated.  For instance, the same duties did not devolve upon the last Leas-Cheann Comhairle as were anticipated in respect of Private Bill legislation, or in respect of the various committees over which it might have been thought that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would have been required to preside.  While it is desirable that the Ceann Comhairle should have somebody to throw responsibility upon while he cannot be present, or when he requires to be relieved, all these requirements can be well satisfied <Col N="313" /> by the appointment of a Deputy who, while continuing his duties to his constituents as a Deputy, can also undertake the duties of Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>
    <P>The moment is opportune, as I say, because there is no personal factor coming between the decision of Deputies in their view of what is reasonable and fair and their view of what is due to the holder or the ex-holder of the office.  If we appoint a Deputy to the office the question at once arises as to whether we are treating that Deputy fairly if we make any change in the rate of remuneration.  Therefore, I urge the House to agree that it is undesirable to make an appointment, and then to give consideration to the rate of remuneration.  Any person who is appointed to the office before reconsideration has been given to the question of salary would have a right to consider that the salary would remain at the rate that has been in operation. It is because I think that no appointment should be made until this matter has been considered that I ask the House to defer making the appointment until that reconsideration has been given.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the office might be filled by a Deputy working in an honorary capacity.  That might be possible if we were to expect that for the future Deputies elected to this House would be people who had other means of livelihood, private means of one kind or another.  If any such doctrine as that were adopted by the House, of course it would change the whole face of the legislative assembly and completely alter the representation scheme that has been adopted.  I think it is, perhaps, unreasonable to lay down as the permanent condition of things that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, who will have responsibilities, as any Deputy who reads the Standing Orders will see&mdash;responsibilities which, in the absence of the Ceann Comhairle himself, are equal to the responsibilities of the Ceann Comhairle&mdash;should undertake those responsibilities without remuneration. I am ruling out the view that has been expressed that this should be an entirely honorary office. On the other hand, I think the duties of <Col N="314" /> the office have been less onerous than we anticipated, and that they do not warrant us in paying a salary of £1,000 per annum.  I therefore move my amendment, without naming the sum which is, in my mind, fair and reasonable, but leaving that question for discussion by the committee which will be set up if the amendment be passed.  I merely urge the House not to make the appointment until this question has been considered&mdash;not to prejudice consideration of the question by making the appointment beforehand. I ask the House to agree with my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask whether I would be in order in moving an amendment to Deputy Johnson's amendment.  The terms of the amendment which I would propose would in effect be that an investigation should be made into the question of the salaries and allowances of all the officials and members of the Dáil.  As Deputy Johnson has said, the time is opportune for an investigation into the question of salaries for the reason, as he stated, that there was a committee set up in 1923.  But I submit that during the last four years the general condition of the country has so changed that it would be well at any rate to have a revision and re-investigation of the whole matter.  While not against Deputy Johnson's proposal in principle, I think that it is too narrow, and that instead of setting up a committee to inquire into the salary of one official, it would be expedient to set up a committee on the lines and with the terms of reference of the committee set up in 1923 to go into and investigate the whole matter.  Therefore, with your permission, sir, I would propose by way of amendment, after the word &ldquo;revise&rdquo; in the second line of Deputy Johnson's amendment, to delete from the word &ldquo;the&rdquo; to the end of the amendment, and to substitute therefor the following words:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;And report on salaries and payments suitable for the various offices held by Ministers, the Ceann Comhairle, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and Teachtaí of Dáil Eireann and of officials of Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These words are taken from the <Col N="315" /> Terms of Reference of the 1923 Committee. I am aware that under the Constitution the salaries of Ministers already appointed cannot be interfered with in the same Dáil, and personally I may say while on the subject that, if I had anything to say in the matter, I would certainly not be in favour of their reduction.  I think that Ministers as whole-time servants of the State distinctly earn the present salaries allotted to them, but I do think that to propose to have one official's salary investigated, while not making a general investigation, is not the proper way to approach this matter.  The country is going through a very severe economic crisis.  There is a tremendous shortage of money and a considerable amount of unemployment.  Our adverse trade balance is, if anything, slightly upon the increase, and I think it would be a good example for us to set up this committee once more to reinvestigate and consider whether the salaries and expenses now enjoyed by officials and Deputies are not in excess of what they should be.  But to set up this committee would not in any way make it necessary that either the salaries or allowances should be reduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>With a view to seeing whether they are proper salaries and allowances at the present time in view of the committee, just as the committee of 1923 did.  This would be a far better way to approach the question than merely to single out one salary and suggest that it requires revision.  There is a motion on the Order Paper for Wednesday next, and I suppose I would not be in order in referring to it.  If my proposed amendment were not acceptable to Deputy Johnson or the Dáil, I would ask Deputies to consider whether it would not be wise to defer setting up this committee for this one specific purpose, as proposed by Deputy Johnson, until they have considered <Col N="316" /> the motion down in the name of Deputy Hewson for Wednesday next.  That motion, it is true, suggests that there should be a general reduction, but if it were proposed, as it might be, that further inquiry should be set up as to whether the present salaries and allowances were proper, in view of the existing economic situation, I suggest that that would be the proper way to approach the subject. To tell the truth, the real method of approach in the interests of economy should be to have a general investigation into the whole Civil Service, but that would not arise upon the motion before us, and if we are to make a beginning, as suggested by Deputy Johnson, in economy in the conduct of our own House, it would be far better to have an investigation into the salaries and allowances of all the officials and members of the Dáil, rather than to single out one particular instance.  That is the reason why I put forward the amendment suggesting that while agreeing in principle that the time is opportune for investigation, that it is not only opportune in regard to the salary of the official in question, but distinctly opportune to the salaries and allowances of the other officials and of Deputies.  I ask, therefore, for leave to move the amendment.</P>

      <P>The main question is a motion for the election of a Deputy as Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  Deputy Johnson's amendment proposes that the election should not be proceeded with pending an investigation into the salary attaching to the office.  That amendment is quite relevant and in order.  Deputy Redmond is proposing a further amendment suggesting a wider investigation. The position, I think, is that Deputy Redmond's amendment would not be in order.  It goes outside the scope of the main motion which concerns merely a particular office.  I allowed Deputy Redmond to proceed, because, although I think a formal amendment on the lines proposed by him is out of order at this particular moment, the argument that a general, rather than a partial, investigation should take place appears to be relevant.  I therefore, cannot accept <Col N="317" /> Deputy Redmond's amendment, the matter of which I think should be brought forward by way of a motion rather than by way of an amendment to Deputy Johnson's amendment.  I am not, therefore, accepting Deputy Redmond's further amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Committee which was set up to consider this question in 1923 consisted of recommendations in respect of eleven items.  Deputy Johnson takes from that report one particular item and his amendment comes before us at a time when a nomination is made in respect. of the office of Leas-Cheann Comhairle. My information is&mdash;I did not learn it until a couple of days ago&mdash;that the consideration of the salary attached to this office was before the Committee on Privileges during the lifetime of the last Dáil.  I would personally have preferred if the matter were brought before the last Dáil in respect of the new Dáil and not now when a nomination is made, because whether we like it or not, the fact of the matter is that this amendment is brought up when a particular nomination is put before the Dáil.  Eleven items are contained in the Report of the Committee which sat in 1923 and the salary attached to the office of Leas-Cheann Comhairle is one of these.  The Dáil is the most important institution of this State, and this office, in connection with which a nomination is now before the Dáil, is the second most important office in this most important institution of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are we asked to consider in order that the business of this Dáil will be concerned with the consideration of a couple of hundred pounds? Let us suppose, for a moment, that a reduction is recommended of a couple of hundred pounds.  For the space of a week the most important institution in this State is not to be provided with the services of the second most important office-holder in this institution. That does not appear to me to be by any means a correct perspective of the situation.  I am not satisfied that a mere reiteration of the number of meetings of the Dáil that are held, and a comparison of the number of days the Dáil sits, with the number of days in <Col N="318" /> the year, give a true picture of the services of the person who occupies the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle. One is presented with a picture of attendance here in the office or here in the Dáil at the hour of 3 o'clock on Tuesday until 8.30 on Tuesday night, and so on until Friday&mdash;attending on three days from 3 o'clock until 8.30, and attending here at 12 o'clock on Friday, putting his hat on at 4 o'clock, and walking out into the country, to spend whatever time he likes in amusement, and so on.  That is not a correct picture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the Deputy's business to have drawn something like that, if he were going to make a recommendation here or going to ask the Dáil to reconsider the matter with a view to reducing the salary, because the time of the Dáil is not wisely spent in considering a reduction of £200 unless a case is made out for it. The Committee which recommended this salary contains the names of members of various parties.  In January, 1923, having had an experience of three or four months, and the Leas Cheann Comhairle at that time having been laid up since the middle of December, the office being filled by somebody else in the meantime, even at that time there was consideration for him. We have had four years to reconsider the matter; not alone had we four years, but we had another Dáil, and the matter never came before us.  It is all nonsense to say that we have now got no occupant of the office to whom any disrespect might be shown if we were dealing with his salary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To return to the number of hours of attendance, the hours of attendance are not from 3 o'clock in the afternoon until 8.30.  I have had the honour of waiting on the Ceann Comhairle in his own office here as early as 10 o'clock in the morning and as late as some hours after the Dáil had adjourned.  It might be said in respect of my own office that I was free at 8.30 last night, but the duties of my office did not terminate until close on 11 o'clock.  The duties of the office of Leas-Cheann Comhairle, in <Col N="319" /> my view, would require practically whole-time attention from any person fulfilling the normal duties of the office. We have sat repeatedly until 10.30 o'clock at night.  I presume it will be admitted that a day's work is put in from 3 o'clock until 10.30, but it is not to be concluded that the person who occupies the office of Leas-Cheann Comhairle does not attend here until 3 o'clock in the afternoon.  I have been considering whether or not it would be reasonably possible for the holder of this position to transact any other business, to take part in any private business, and I satisfied myself that if I were the controller of a business, and that the holder of this office were one of my employees, I would not be satisfied with the attention he could give in any service, taking into account the length of time and the hours of duty he would require to spend here.</P>
    <P>This proposal of a single office of the State to be considered by a Committee and to leave us without the assistance of a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, does not appeal to me.  Deputy Redmond's suggestion does appeal to me on more grounds than one, not solely with a view to reduction.  I explained here on other occasions, some years ago, that a Deputy travelling from Donegal, West Cork or Kerry, and spending ten or twelve hours in the train coming up, and ten or twelve hours in the train returning, and a few days here, gets by no means his expenses from his thirty pounds a month, and is there any consideration for that?  Deputy Redmond's suggestion, to my mind, is a great, big comprehensive suggestion, one that merits our most serious consideration within a short period, but I am not at all satisfied that the respect due to this institution is shown, or can be shown, by accepting this amendment. I am not satisfied, from what I have seen of the attendance given by Ministers and by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that you can expect people's physique to stand the strain of continued hours of duty and continued attention to duty.  There are various duties which fall upon this office in the normal sense which call for very considerable attention, and a considerable number of <Col N="320" /> hours of duty.  We have occasionally Private Bills to consider, and to my mind the study, care, attention and exposition of those Bills in this House would require the services of a Leas-Cheann Comhairle in putting them before us.  I hope the Dáil will reject this amendment.  I hope the Dáil will provide this institution with the holder of a second office, and that the Dáil will not agree to consider the question of a reduction of salary by perhaps one or two hundred pounds, and waste its time by depriving us of the services of this officer.  I hope the Dáil will in time consider the suggestion that has been made by Deputy Redmond, and consider the whole question, and not a particular item out of a large number of items that ought to be considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>In spite of the very strong case made by the President for rejecting Deputy Johnson's amendment, I am going to give it my support. In doing so, let me be quite frank in saying that no personality whatever has entered into my mind in giving my support to the amendment.  I do not know that any individual was before Deputy Johnson's mind, or that that was in any way responsible for making him put down this motion.  I would be surprised, I confess quite frankly, if he were influenced by that fact.  The case that Deputy Johnson has made seems to me a good case.  He is specific in asking that this Committee of Selection be appointed to revise the salary to be paid.  I am sure that every responsible Deputy in the House will agree that salaries should be paid for services rendered.  I say that salaries should be paid to Ministers and to Deputies for services rendered.  If we are to go on that, and if a Committee is to be set up to investigate and make reports, then the salaries of some Deputies will grow to be much bigger than they are, while the salaries of others will grow to be much smaller.  If the service rendered is to be the basis upon which payment is to be made, then Deputy Johnson is one whose salary will grow. There are few Deputies who have had as much experience of the work done in this House and done by officials, the <Col N="321" /> Ceann Comhairle or Ministers, as Deputy Johnson, and few are more competent to pass judgment on the work done.</P>
      <P>It may be that this House is particularly fortunate in having our present occupant of the Chair.  The Ceann Comhairle is a man of ability and he puts a great deal of energy into his work.  It is true, perhaps, that that is a factor in lessening the work that is to be done by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and that possibly it weighs with us in determining whether or not there should be an investigation of the work to be done by the future occupant of the office of Leas-Cheann Comhairle. I admit that, to some extent, I am at a loss to know just how much this new occupant of this position will have to do.  I feel that there is every reason for an investigation as to whether or not his salary should be revised.  I do not think that even the President himself will stand up for a policy that simply we must pay for our dignity regardless of the consequences. I do not think it is right that the President should ask the House to agree simply because a certain post exists that a salary must be paid to the occupant of that post regardless of any other consideration.  I am not prepared to subscribe to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that the House should support Deputy Johnson's amendment that this Committee should be set up.  Let the President, by all means, go before that Committee and make the case which he has made here, and let the Ceann Comhairle be invited before that Committee of investigation to outline just exactly the duties of the occupant of the office.  I agree with the President that for one hundred pounds or two hundred pounds we should not do something that would, perhaps, not be justifiable in the circumstances; but on the other hand, I feel that the opportunity is given us now to examine this position, to see the duties which the occupant of the office will have to perform in the future, and making all allowances for the dignity of this House, which every Deputy has the right to do his best to sustain, give the occupant of the post a salary commensurate with the work that is to be done. <Col N="322" /> In saying that, I am not ruling out of account what Deputy Redmond has in mind and what evidently another Deputy has in his mind.  My interpretation of what we may do in these other circumstances when this other proposition comes to be considered may be very different to Deputy Redmond's point of view.  But we are not going to go into that now.  We will have an opportunity later of passing judgment on this bigger question that the President says he would like to have considered, but we have got an opportunity to-day, and we can say whether or not an investigation should be made.  I can see no valid reason on the part of the President for objecting to an investigation.  I do not know what Deputy Johnson will have to say to this, but if I were a member of that Committee and if, on investigation, a case were made to me that the duties of the office entailed such attendance and work as to satisfy me that the salary at present attached to the office should continue to be paid in the future, I would support that, but I confess that it has yet to be proved to me that it is necessary to do so, and for that reason I am supporting Deputy Johnson's amendment to have a Committee set up.</P>

If Deputy Johnson's motion was for a joint committee of the Dáil and Seanad to consider the emoluments of the Deputy-Chairmen of both Houses there would be more to be said for it, but what reasonable justification can there be for reducing the salary of an official who does help to do a considerable amount of work, and retaining the same level of salary to an official who is never practically called upon to fill the Chair?</P>

      <P>That is the reason that I suggest a joint committee should be set up to go into the matter, and begin simultaneously in both Houses. I do not think the Seanad would object. There is one other reason that I do not think was alluded to in this debate, and which, to my mind, vitiates the whole effect of the amendment.  The committee which sat in 1923 and framed Standing Orders for Private Bills, cast the whole responsibility of the supervision and conduct of Private Bills in this House upon the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  There were no Private Bills and no Private Business in 1923.  That is a very severe and onerous responsibility, and it is concerned with matters affecting hundreds of thousands of pounds.  I was Chairman of one Private Bill Committee myself, involving expenditure of something Like £250,000 on the harbour of Limerick. <Col N="324" /> All these come under the direct supervision of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  If he does his duty properly, he has to acquaint himself with all the details and particulars of those Bills; he has to see that good committees are appointed to consider the Bills, and he has to be, in connection with the matter, absolutely disinterested.</P>
      <P>The President put forward the view that he would not employ any person holding the office of Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  The matter goes further than that.  Not only should the Leas-Cheann Comhairle not hold any other employment but he should not be engaged in any occupation in connection with which Private Bills could be promoted. He should not be a railway director and I do not think he should be a director of a bank.  He should not be interested in tramways or in motor services.  We put the occupant of this office in a semi-judicial position and surely the salary of £1,000 is not excessive.  I believe that argument might appeal to Deputy Johnson's Committee.  But the argument against the setting up of that Committee, is, that until we have a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, we are at a great disadvantage in dealing with Private Bills. There is a Private Bill pending now, on a subject that I can only describe as of gigantic importance.  It deals with the harbour of the city of Cork. Is that harbour to wait?  Is the employment that the Bill will give in Cork, when passed, to wait while the Committee is investigating what the Deputy-Speaker in South Africa, in Australia, in New Zealand, and the Falkland Islands is receiving?  The practical inconvenience of such a postponement, to my mind, outweighs that argument.</P>

      <P>As I intend adopting the unpopular course of voting for not reducing the salary of a Government official, I crave the attention of the House for a few minutes to say why I shall adopt so strange a course.  As I understand the position, it is that in the year 1923 a former Dáil set up a Fair Wages Committee.  That Committee passed a Fair Wages Resolution, which was accepted by the House and has since been acted upon. I can hardly credit the idea that the Deputies on the Labour benches would not back me up in supporting a Fair Wages Resolution passed four years ago, and against having it turned down now.  I should like to know from Deputy Johnson how far that resolution is to extend.  Is it to be confined to a particular office or any particular type of office, or is it to go the length of the Free State, and are all Fair Wages Resolutions to be applied alike?  I am in favour of fair wages, I do not care who the officials are.  I would like to pay officials fair wages, and I intend to vote for the resolution moved from the Government benches, as put forward in its entirety by the President. I listened with much attention to the proposition Deputy Redmond put before this House, a proposition which was founded on good sense.  He suggested that the time may have arrived &mdash;I do not say it has arrived; it is a matter for consideration&mdash;when a committee should be set up to investigate the salaries of all officials and, I take it, all employees.  When that time has arrived, I should be quite prepared to support an amendment that the committee should have the power to investigate <Col N="326" /> and review all salaries paid to officials, ministers and employees.  That committee should also have power to consider whether they should reduce salaries, and whether they should increase salaries if necessary.  You cannot have it all one way.  You cannot take an isolated office with a comparatively small salary attached to it.  That is not the way to tackle the question. Having that view and adopting an unpopular course in not being willing to reduce the salary in this particular case, I am going to support the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House ought to be grateful to Deputy Johnson for bringing forward this amendment, and the result it has had.  We were almost amazed, when we heard the President congratulating Deputy Redmond; a kind word from the President to Deputy Captain Redmond!  Of course, Deputy Redmond sought to perform something that would have helped the President's position in this matter; he raised a smoke-screen.  Deputy Redmond started off by saying that this amendment was too narrow.  I suggest what is really wrong with the amendment from Deputy Redmond's point of view is, that it is too definite for him. It is an amendment that he would have to vote for or against, and Deputy Redmond spent ten or fifteen minutes in trying to make his position clear. When we heard Deputy Jasper Wolfe chiming in, then, indeed, we had three very strange bed-fellows.  Deputy Wolfe pretended to be terribly surprised at Deputy Johnson trying to reduce fair wages.  There is an actual surprise in store for Deputy Wolfe, I presume, when he finds the Minister for Industry and Commerce supporting fair wages.  The President talks about the duties of this office and the amount of work that had to be done in this office.  I imagine most Deputies thought that there would be considerably less legislation in the next four or five years than in the last four or five years.  Therefore there would be less work.  I would point out to the President and the House that almost everything he stated about the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is true of every other Deputy in this House who does his <Col N="327" /> work.  Our work does not begin at 3 o'clock either.  If the Deputies of this House do their work as it should be done, they should start at 10 or 11 o'clock in the morning, particularly if they visit some Departments.  We all know the amount of time lost before any work can be done there.</P>

      <P>I quite agree. Really, all this talk about a general survey of the whole position put up by <Col N="328" /> Deputy Redmond and supported by the President and Deputy Jasper Wolfe, is all so much humbug.  It is a smoke-screen, a deliberate attempt to evade a very definite amendment, and all the House is asked to do is to set up a committee. The House is not being asked now, as the President tried to convey, to reduce the salary; it is asked to set up a committee which will inquire into what work is to be done by that particular officer, and whether that particular officer is worth £1,000 a year or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>On the main question, I desire to enter a protest against the election of the Deputy named in the main motion as Leas-Cheann Comhairle because in my opinion, to the best of my belief, he does not possess one of the essential qualifications that I think a person elected to that position should possess, namely, a thorough knowledge of the Irish language.  The Constitution of this State says that Irish is the official language and in the Standing Orders it is laid down that it is open to Deputies to address the Dáil in either Irish or English.  I hold that a person occupying the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle who does not understand Irish will not be in a position to carry out the duties of that office to the fullest extent to which they should be carried out.  It is further mentioned in Standing Orders that all orders and official documents shall be issued in the Irish and English language, and in the absence of you, sir, it will be the duty of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to superintend the issue of all such documents, and although he may be assisted by a very competent staff, the responsibility will be his and he will be forced to take the responsibility of authorising the issue of all such documents, the contents of which he does not exactly understand.  It is the policy of the party opposite, the policy of the Executive Council, to encourage in every way the Irish language in this State.  They have made it a compulsory subject for all examinations for persons entering the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have insisted upon its introduction into the schools, and have urged in some cases very strongly&mdash; amounting almost to coercion&mdash;public servants to take up the study of the Irish language.  Men and women, I believe, have lost their positions through their failure to give the language the place it should hold in the life of the State.  I take the President at his own word.  He stated that this position was the second most important position in the most important institution in the State.  The Dáil is now asked to support for the second most important position in the most important institution in the State a <Col N="330" /> person who has no knowledge of the official language of the State.  Irish is the official language of the State.  That is stated in the Constitution.  English may also be regarded as the official language, but it is stated definitely in the Constitution that Irish is the official language.  The proposal is a bad encouragement to those who have taken up the burden placed on them throughout the country of official public service, and who made efforts to study the Irish language, to do their duty and everything possible in order to comply with the spirit of the Constitution to bring the national language back to its rightful place.  The proposal will be pointed to by many of these public servants, on whom pressure was brought during the last three years, and on whom pressure is still being brought, as a bad example on the part of those who are proposing it.</P>
    <P>I do not know if many Deputies will so soon after the election forget the pledges they gave.  Many Deputies now present, possibly all Deputies, were asked a definite question by the Gaelic League, whether they were prepared to do their utmost to advance the Irish language in the Dáil, in all Government Departments, and in the public administration generally.  Many Deputies now listening to me answered that question with a very definite &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;  I have a list of their names, and amongst them I find those of Deputy Séamus Burke, Deputy McFadden, Donegal; Deputy Finian Lynch, Deputy Peadar Doyle, Deputy Richard O'Connell, and others that I need not name.  I put it to Deputies that now is the time that the definite pledge they gave on the eve of their election has to be carried out. The issue at stake is plain to everyone. I think the House would be setting a very bad example, and would in fact be giving away the question of the revival of the Irish language, if it supports for this most important position a person who has no knowledge of the Irish language.</P>

      <P>This Estimate represents an item that has become usual in regard to the grant to the London-derry and Lough Swilly Railway for three lines run by it for the Free State Government.  It is a recurring item, and the amounts vary from time to time.  The amount this year is fixed at £6,500, which is £500 less than the amount last year.  When that sum has been paid, the payments made by the Free State Government and by Northern Ireland will be equal.  The payment specially allocated to this area is £6,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am explaining that the £500 represents the payment of an additional sum to the moneys originally voted last year.  When that £500 has been voted, if it will be voted, then the sum paid by the Free State Government will equal the sum paid by the Northern Government.  Of the remaining £6,000 this year, an equivalent sum is to be put up by the Government of Northern Ireland towards this group of railways.  We are paying the expenses of the running of three Government <Col N="334" /> lines.  The Estimate has come along here year by year.  When it was last spoken of in the Northern Parliament, a statement was then made that the Government there thought it was desirable that the management should go into conference with other representative people so as to see if there is any chance of amalgamating the lines so as to give a better and a cheaper service for Donegal. That matter has been postponed, but it will be taken up and looked into in greater detail.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately the Estimate has to be brought up year after year.  The whole matter is based on an old arrangement which needs revision.  It is in fact revised from year to year by the raising of these Supplementary Estimates.  The dilemma that we find ourselves in is that if the amount is not paid the railways must close down.  I do put it to the House that it is worth the payment of these sums of money in order to keep transport of any kind open in the County Donegal.</P>

      <P>This railway is in a most peculiar and most unfortunate condition.  The mileage is approximately one hundred.  Of this 100 miles, 96 are in the County Donegal and four in Northern Ireland.  Of course owing to that position of affairs this railway has not come in under the grouping system.  It has been kept open by grants from the Free State and from the Government of Northern Ireland.  The grants from both Governments, along with the receipts earned by the railway, are inadequate to bear the overhead expenses.  Not a penny has reached the shareholders for the past four or five years.  Of course I am not speaking in the interests of the shareholders or in the interests of railway managers.  I am speaking merely as a Deputy representing a very large area of the county served by this line.  The position of the line is somewhat parlous.  Bus and lorry competition and the aftermath of the coal strike last year have practically depleted the resources of the Company.  I may parenthetically remark with regard to the bus and lorry traffic that the bus and lorry workers are not subject to an eight-hours day.  Neither are they paid <Col N="335" /> the standard rate of wages equal to the wages paid to the National Union of Railwaymen.  In addition, there is a large amount of boy labour employed on these buses and lorries, and it is obtained at a very cheap rate.  Unless there is a revision of the working expenses immediately, this line must inevitably close.  I suggest that some form of accommodation should be arrived at between the Board of Directors, the representatives of the railwaymen, and the State, with a view to putting this railway in a position that it will be able to earn its overhead expenses.  It cannot be expected that the taxpayers will continue from year to year to pay out sums of from £5,000 to £6,500 to keep the line open.  A choice must be made between the closing down of the line or else the reduction of its over-head expenses.  I know that the closing of the line would be a disaster to the area which it serves.  It would throw us back on bus and lorry competition. These would immediately raise their fares for passengers and their freights for goods.  These increased rates and fares would have the effect of increasing the cost of living in the area, and that cost of living is already high enough.  The people would be unable to bear the increase.  I believe that an opportune time has arrived when some arrangement or some proper accommodation should be entered into between the three interests that I have named, and this accommodation should be entered into within a short time.  I refer to the Board of Directors of the railway, the representatives of the railway workers, and the State.  I believe that if a conference of this description were held that some sensible and practical means would be found whereby the railway would be kept open.  That would be an advantage to the district, and it would save a large number of people from being thrown out of employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMENAMIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister what stage these negotiations with regard to the Donegal railways are in at present?  Is there any prospect that these negotiations will take practical shape, and if <Col N="336" /> they are going to take practical shape in the Transport Bill forecasted yesterday, will the Minister insist that it will be conditional on the railway coming within the control of the general transport system of the Irish Free State? Failing that, then there is the withdrawal of the subsidy.  It is obvious that the condition of this railway in particular is due to the fact that it is on a very limited mileage, and that it has very limited resources, and that it has, what every institution of this kind must have, overhead charges that bring about and assist, to a very large extent, in crippling its resources.  I would suggest to the Minister that when he is introducing the Transport Bill that he referred to yesterday, he should put it to the Directors of this company that if they do not agree to amalgamation and come within the general transport system that he hopes to bring about, he, as representing the State, will withdraw the subsidy that has been given out of the national revenue for the upkeep of this railway.  I think that the present condition of affairs cannot go on, because, as Deputy White stated, this line is there in a hamstrung, helpless, dying condition, and is of no service to itself or to the community. because the life has been sapped out of it by lorry and bus competition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LAW</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot agree with the last speaker that this line is quite useless.  On the contrary, while many of those who have travelled over it have no cause to bless it, yet I say that on the whole there is no doubt that even in its present condition it is giving considerable service to the community. I believe it is capable, if and when the fishery industry in Donegal is revived, of being of still greater service. I very much deprecate any such suggestion as has been made by Deputy McMenamin.  If it is not possible&mdash;I can see that in certain particular circumstances it is difficult&mdash;to bring this line within the general scheme of amalgamation of railways, I would very much deprecate anything in the way of a suggestion for the withdrawal of the subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dáil will kindly bear in mind that this particular line is the subject of very exceptional circumstances indeed. <Col N="337" /> The Lough Swilly Railway Company, as Deputy White has stated, lies partly within the areas of the Free State and the Northern Government, with headquarters in Derry.  It operates a few miles of railway within the Northern Boundary.  The actual amount of line owned by the company is very short.  On the other hand, the mileage worked by the company both in respect of the Carndonagh extension, which, I imagine, more particularly interests my friend Deputy White, and the Burtonport extension, which more particularly interests me, is a very long one.  The line was originally built at the beginning of this century under an Act of 1898, confirmed by an Order in Council of the same year.  Under the Provisional Order, which recites in the first place that an inquiry had been made under the Tramways Act, and that articles of agreement had been signed for the making and maintenance of this line, and that a guarantee had been given by way of presentment by the then Grand Jury of Donegal, charging certain areas of the county with liability for the interest at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum in perpetuity upon portion of the share capital, the line was built.  The rest of the line was built out of State funds, and it was built precisely because the British Parliament was impressed by the fact&mdash; and I desire to impress this matter upon the Dáil, which, I am sure, will not be less alive to the interests of Tirconaill than was the British House of Commons&mdash;that the opening up of that very remote part of the world, and very poor part of the world, was an essential item of public policy.  I do press upon the Dáil, that it is a matter of real public policy that the line should be maintained.</P>
    <P>Now, that line has had a period of comparative prosperity for some years, and several things have in recent times operated against its prosperity. There have been two things in particular, as Deputy White pointed out, that in recent years operated against it. The competition of lorry traffic, which, I imagine, is particularly severe in the Carndonagh area, is one.  There has been a great increase, common to all the railways in this country, in the <Col N="338" /> upkeep charges, both in regard to management and labour, and finally there has been a loss of traffic which has operated very seriously on the line in recent years, through the falling off of the herring industry.  A great part of the traffic of this line formerly&mdash;the most remunerative part&mdash;was due to the large amount of fish, both salmon and herring, that were taken over the line as fresh fish for the British markets.  In recent years unfortunately &mdash;for some years since after the war&mdash; the herring migrations have failed to visit our coasts in the same quantities as formerly.  I am afraid the Minister for Fisheries has often been blamed over the default of the fish.  There has been a great falling off in that traffic, but I am glad to tell the Dáil that there are considerable signs of revival, and I know that in the Buncrana area, which is served by this line, and generally around Lough Swilly, and to some extent on other portions of the coast, there are signs of the herrings coming back.  I press that as a material point upon the Dáil and upon the Minister, and I hope he will consider it when he is dealing with the matter of a subsidy. We have been promised special consideration by the President, and I am quite certain that the promise is going to be fulfilled; he promised us that a great and serious effort is going to be made for the improvement of those areas.</P>
    <P>One of the industries upon which the residents of Donegal most depend is the fishing industry.  I would urge upon the Minister that it would be a very unwise thing and it would be quite wrong, when spending money in other directions for the improvement of the Gaeltacht, to do anything which would militate against the revival of those areas by allowing a line which does, even in its present condition, serve a very useful public purpose to be closed down.  I press that point very strongly upon this assembly.  As Deputy White has indicated, whatever is done for this line will be all for the good, and there will be good results.  I have not heard any immediate threat, but I have indeed heard rumours of the possibility of the withdrawal of the subsidy, and I press on the Dáil and on <Col N="339" /> the Minister the desirability of having that subsidy continued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to say very much on this Estimate, nor do I intend to take any very strong exception to it to-day; but on principle I think this House cannot accept it that our transport problem must be faced by a Government Department agreeing to subsidise transport in a particular area for an interminable period.  I want some indication of the Minister's policy in this matter.  Is he looking forward to a time when, because of changed conditions which may be brought about, this subsidy will not have to be paid? Will he indicate that in this matter he has no policy but is just acquiescing for the present because of the conditions in Tirconaill?</P>
      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with the people who live in the area served by this particular railway.  It is a very remote area indeed.  I appreciate the fact that if the line were closed down to-morrow it would be a great disaster for the people at the present time and would injure the prospects of development of that area in the future.  I should not desire that.  On the other hand, I must object to Ministerial policy which means the subsidising of transport in one area at the expense of the country as a whole.  The problem should be solved in some other way. The solution must be found by the parties most interested.  The people to be served by the railway have undoubtedly an interest in the matter. and the workers and the shareholders are likewise interested.  I do not know what the attitude of the shareholders and workers is with regard to the question of overhead expenses.  I do not know how far overhead expenses are responsible for the present condition of the railway.  I think the Minister would help towards the solution of the problem by indicating that it is not going to be the policy for all time that the Exchequer shall contribute annually, by way of subsidy, to the running of a railway in a particular district at the expense of the country as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speaker referred to what he described as a &ldquo;principle.&rdquo; The issue thus referred to could not be discussed with advantage <Col N="340" /> here this evening.  But when Deputy Baxter comes along, as he comes now and as he has come before, and in a half-hearted way protests against subsidies or doles, as he and his Party describe them, I would ask him, before we have a full-dress debate on this question of subsidies and doles, to examine his own conscience and to tell the House, when we have an opportunity of discussing the matter at greater length, whether or not he objects to the Agricultural Grant. That is a dole, or a subsidy, provided by the taxpayers as a whole, who include the railwaymen and the railway managers.  I leave the matter there, with the request to Deputy Baxter to examine his own conscience before we have a full-dress debate on that important question.</P>
      <P>I should be interested to know whether Deputy White agrees with Deputy Baxter or not.  The Deputy has taken very good care that he did not object to the subsidy, but he makes a plausible and a pitiable appeal to the Minister and to some unknown person &mdash;who, perhaps, is not in the House&mdash; for a conference or star-chamber inquiry as to how the overhead expenses of the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company can be reduced.</P>

      <P>This House is not a conference chamber, and if Deputy White&mdash;I give him credit for bringing this question forward with the best possible intentions&mdash;wants to make a good case, he should come here with figures showing the revenue and expenditure and how the money is allocated by those responsible for the management.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy White has tried to make a case.  I assume that the man making a case for a star-chamber inquiry is the man who would produce some proof that the company is in the pitiable condition he endeavoured to-day to show it was in.  The gist of the speeches of Deputy White, Deputy McMenamin and Deputy Law amounts to a charge against the Minister for <Col N="341" /> not having included the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway in the amalgamation scheme, under the Railways Act of 1924.  An amendment was moved from this bench during the Committee Stage of the Railways Bill, which is now the Railways Act of 1924, that the Londonderry and Lough Swilly line be brought within the amalgamation scheme.  I leave Deputy White to answer for himself as to what he said or did when that amendment was before the House.  I do not say how he cast his vote.  I leave it to himself to answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. WHITE Mr. WHITE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WHITE</NameTxt>
      <P>Did not a technical contingency arise owing to portion of the line being in Northern Ireland and the greater portion being in Donegal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has brought this suggestion forward&mdash;whether it be a good or bad suggestion&mdash;two years late.  I suggest to Deputy McMenamin that whatever form the Transport Bill will take it will not be, as he thinks, the same as the Railways Amalgamation Bill.  I am not, and I have never pretended to be here, a direct representative of the railwaymen or of any section of the railwaymen.  I believe this railway is managed by one of the ablest railwaymen in the country.  I do not know whether Deputy White has had any consultation with the general manager or with the directors of this railway company.  I do not suggest that the general manager would attempt to deceive Deputy White or any other Deputy regarding the financial position of this railway, but even a Deputy like Deputy White might have his leg pulled by the general manager or some of the directors of this railway company.  I suggest that there has been some leg-pulling in this particular matter.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy White is so satisfied that there is a case for reduction of over-head charges, I suggest to him that he should, during the weekend, try to get hold of the balance sheet of the Company, or that he should get some figures from the Minister or from the general manager or directors, which would help him to prove the case. I say quite frankly that the railwaymen <Col N="342" /> of all grades employed on the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway would not look forward with any pleasure&mdash;quite the opposite&mdash;to the closing of this line.  As far as I know, the relations between the management and the workers on that line are at the present time very friendly.  There is a medium of approach.  There is a certain way by which the workers can approach the management, and by which the management can approach the men.  That avenue of approach is open now, as it has always been open. If Deputy White wants to convey a message to those on whose behalf he is making this plea&mdash;be they shareholders or directors&mdash;I would remind him that the same avenue of approach is available now that has always been available.</P>
      <P>In the negotiations that took place between the railwaymen's representatives and the management of the railways regarding wages and conditions of service, concessions were given to the Londonderry and Lough Swilly line and other small railway companies, and the workers on the Londonderry and Lough Swilly line are to-day working at a wage ten per cent. below that of the employees of the Great Southern Railways Company.  I do not know whether Deputy White is aware of that, but the general manager of the Londonderry and Lough Swilly line is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Law referred, in passing, to the type of rolling stock which this company uses for the accommodation of the travelling public.  I suggest to Deputy Law that, if he wants to have a good view of the railway system covered by the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Company, he should ask the directors&mdash;one of them is a member of the other House of the Oireachtas, and I am sure he would be glad to oblige &mdash;to give him an opportunity, with his colleagues from Donegal, of travelling over the system in the luxurious observation car used by the directors. Nobody who has had the privilege of travelling in that luxurious observation car could come to the conclusion that this is a poor or impoverished railway company.  If Deputy Law, Deputy White and Deputy McMenamin would approach the general manager, who is <Col N="343" /> a very courteous man and always anxious to oblige in matters of this kind, I am sure he would place that car at their disposal, and after a journey in it they would know more about the system and about the countryside than they know to-day.</P>

      <P>This Chamber is not a conference room.  If a conference is necessary between the management of this railway and representatives of the workers employed on the system, that conference can be held if approach is made in the proper way.  I say that without making any conditions as to the terms of reference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy White attends that conference, I might also have the same privilege.  If I have, I will insist on the Deputy proving his case by figures.  If he wants to make a case of this kind either in this House or in conference, he should provide himself with figures.  The Deputy will not overawe the representatives of the railwaymen at that conference, if and when it comes about, by making general statements such as he has made here to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. WHITE Mr. WHITE">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the railwaymen who would attend such a conference would know something about the method of making out railway balance sheets.  Even Deputy White would find it very difficult to find out from railway balance sheets, as they are now presented, what the actual position of a particular railway company is, and perhaps the Minister would find it equally difficult.  The Minister probably knows more about the working of this company than about any other company, because in this case he has to serve as a super-auditor; he has the right to go in and examine their accounts before he puts forward the Estimate.  I hope that Deputy White <Col N="344" /> will get down to the facts and find out whether there is actually a case to be made for the reduction of the overhead charges of this company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself on this Vote more or less in agreement with all the Deputies who have spoken, with the exception of Deputy McMenamin, and against his contention I would lean very strongly.  I am very much in sympathy with what Deputy Law has said on the whole matter, as opposed to Deputy McMenamin's point of view, and even in opposition to the implications underlying Deputy Baxter's argument.  There may be a good policy in continuing the subsidy if by paying it one is getting out more cheaply than by having a general reorganisation and a final settlement in regard to these lines.  I am not saying that that is the case, but I am not at all sure that there is a great deal to be gained, from the point of view of State contributions. by having a final settlement made instead of having this year-to-year Vote. From time to time in moving this Vote I have indicated that we would do all in <Col N="345" /> our power to make some approach towards a final settlement, but there has nearly always been an obstacle. One year there was the question of railway amalgamation generally, and lines which were partly in and partly outside the Free State had to be left over for further consideration.  Then, in another year, there was a disaster, small in itself, but relative to this line a very big one.  Last year was definitely upset by the coal strike, the repercussion of which was very disastrous from the point of view of this particular railway.</P>
      <P>One could hardly say that there has been any year in which one could get a clear view of the working expenses and the receipts of this railway as they are likely to be in normal times.  This year, I think, will show a nearer approach to that.  The increase in the fishing around Lough Swilly, to which Deputy Law has referred, and which was the most gratifying sight that met my eyes during the election period, will undoubtedly bring one element of the traffic back to something approaching normal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. WHITE Mr. WHITE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WHITE</NameTxt>
      <P>That affects only a small portion of the railway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree: but at any rate we will get some better perspective in respect of the whole line. This matter has been raised very definitely in the other Parliament, because in introducing the corresponding Estimate in the Northern House, the Prime Minister indicated that, as far as Northern Ireland was concerned, the grant was made with provision that between now and the beginning of the next financial year some effort would be made to call together the railway companies to discuss their future and to ascertain. whether it was possible to induce them to bring forward a scheme of amalgamation which would bring back some of the prosperity they used to enjoy. He added that the Government intended to invite a conference to discuss the whole matter so as to prevent any other lines having to close down. There are no negotiations at the moment.  A certain approach has been made to me, and I shall certainly meet some of the representatives of the company quite soon.  The matter does <Col N="346" /> come to a head this year, and it can hardly be postponed any further, unless by reason of something outside our own control, such as a coal strike, or some other matter which would again come in to serve as an obstruction.</P>
      <P>I would point out that this is stated to be an advance to the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company in respect of the working of the three other railways that are mentioned.  I want to have it clearly understood that the lines owned by the Free State Government are the three lines mentioned, and not the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway, with which we have nothing to do.  I had occasion before the dissolution to meet some of the Deputies from Tirconaill who were interested and who were rather violently agitated about the question of transport there, and to discuss with them the difficulties of the whole transport situation in Tirconaill.  If Deputies are still interested, or any of the new Deputies are more interested than their predecessors, I would be prepared to meet them when things are a little more advanced and put before them, in a small conference, much better than I could in the House, the points about which difficulties will arise, without giving them anything that could not later be given to the House.  Deputy Davin has alluded to the suggestion which was made when the Railways Bill was going through of applying the amalgamation system to the Donegal railways.  Deputy White has properly answered him by pointing out that there was a difficulty, because the headquarters of the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company and a portion of the line were outside our territory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the question of the headquarters could be easily settled by transferring the headquarters to some suitable place in Tirconaill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>A certain amount of agreement is required in regard to that.  Deputy Davin, in connection with another matter on the Railways Bill, wanted to have what I described as &ldquo;compulsory agreement,&rdquo;<Col N="347" /> which I did not think was possible to arrive at.  The same thing would apply with regard to this.  At any rate, there is a technical difficulty there.  It is very easy to talk about amalgamation.  If anybody gets a map of Donegal and follows the boundary line and these railways he will see the difficulty of getting a physical connection between the three railway systems we are now discussing and the amalgamated system in the Free State.  He could then let his thoughts wander on and see if there was any other possible method of amalgamation by a junction of these lines with any other lines, inside or outside our territory, and reflect on what would be the economic advantages, or disadvantages, of any of the amalgamations that might be thought of, and what would be the political objections to any of the said amalgamations.</P>
      <P>I would be prepared to discuss this in detail afterwards, when I find out what the proposition of the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Company's directorate is, if they have any concrete proposal to put before me.  In the meantime, we must simply face up to the situation, that while expenditure has in fact been brought down through the action of the very energetic manager who is operating the system, the receipts are not sufficient to meet the necessary expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the three lines I am concerned with there is a very definite examination every year, and an inquiry into the whole expenditure, and a very watchful eye is kept upon any items where there does seem to be any possibility of reduction.  If Deputy White has any special item in mind, it is a very simple matter to give me that in detail in a letter, and I can have the matter looked into to see if there is actually any question of a decrease.  The line last year suffered considerably through the coal strike.  There is an increase of over £4,000 in the cost of coal.  Notwithstanding that increase, there is a reduction on the total expenditure for the year of £3,000.  In other words, if it had not been for the advent of the coal strike, there would be a decrease in the working expenses of £7,000.  There was, unfortunately, on the other hand <Col N="348" /> a decrease in receipts.  Even the decrease in receipts depended on the coal strike, because a quarry from which a certain amount of traffic was derived had to close down.  There was also a certain loss in receipts for the carriage of coal over the system.  Part of the loss may be put down to increased motor competition, but I do not think it is as much as Deputy White has in mind.</P>

      <P>Some of it may be put down to that, but if Deputy White saw the analysis which I can put before him he would agree that it is an item to be considered, but that it is not an item upon which attention is to be riveted to the exclusion of other items.  For instance, the decline of the fishing industry is another important item in connection with the fish carried over the system.</P>

      <P>There is another item which represents a loss in the railway working, but which does not represent a loss to the Donegal community. There is a loss in passenger receipts, due to the fact that, even allowing for the extra people going by bus, a large number of people are not now travelling to Derry city to do their shopping, but are doing it in the towns in Donegal.  That may represent a loss to the railway system, but not to the Donegal community.  It is one of the things we will have to take into consideration when recognising that the Border difficulties are there and are going to remain for some time.  On the whole, the situation is a simple one.  There is a railway system which has to be kept open for the good of the community.  There is an examination yearly into the expenditure, and every item is scrutinised.  There is a very definite attempt by the management to keep the expenditure as low as possible. On the other hand, the receipts are not up to the moneys that have to be expended. Both Governments have agreed <Col N="349" /> that a subsidy is necessary in the circumstances, and this is the Vote for the subsidy put forward by this Government. That is the situation at present, and I simply have to repeat what I said before, that we will have to tackle the whole question of transport in Donegal. We have specially to tackle this question of the three Government lines associated with the Londonderry and Lough Swilly system, and I think we are more definitely approaching it this year than ever before.  It is only some obstacle outside our own control that can interfere.</P>
      <P>I should like just to emphasize what Deputy Davin has said in one other respect.  The Deputy alluded to the management of the railway up there.  I have a report prepared in the second month of this year and there is one paragraph in that which I think should be quoted, in justice to the management of the line.  The report states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>From our review of the working and of the conditions that obtained in the year 1926, it is clear that energetic steps have been taken to meet the abnormal circumstances that arose, and we think it is due to the general manager to say that the enterprising spirit with which the difficulties have been faced has resulted in the confinement of the losses within narrower limits than might have been the case.</P>
      <P>I think, undoubtedly, that anyone who knows the working of the line and the general manager in question would agree that the railway has been as well served as any railway system in the country could have been served, and it is not through any fault of the general manager that the expenditure has not been brought down even to a lower point than the accounts for the last year show.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £466,000 he granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1928, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Revenue Department.</P>
    <P>Deputies will notice that there is not any very substantial change in the amount of the estimate this year as compared with last year.  The activities of the Revenue Department cover a very wide field.  There is not merely the actual collection of the customs, revenue, income tax, death duties and various stamp duties, but the main part of the administration of old age pensions. That is a very substantial duty. As a matter of fact, about half the travelling and subsistence costs in connection with the work of the Department arise in connection with old age pensions work.  In addition to those main functions of collecting taxation and administering old age pensions, there are a great many other duties: the prevention of the importation of all sorts of forbidden articles, obscene literature, lottery advertisements, plumage of birds, shaving brushes from certain countries, dangerous drugs, certain types of matches, the regulation of the importation of explosives and firearms, plants of various sorts from countries where there is disease, or plants likely to bring disease.  There is also the enforcement of the Merchandise Marks Act, which enables and requires the revenue authorities to detain goods that are marked in such a way as, amongst other things, to give the impression that they are manufactured here when not manufactured here. There is also the enforcement of health and quarantine regulations and certain duties in connection with alien immigration; duties in connection with wreckage and the disposal of it; the registration of ships and fishing boats, and also, on an agency basis for the Department of Industry and Commerce. duties in connection with the engagement and discharge of seamen.  In certain places also light dues are collected, <Col N="351" /> and in Cork and some other harbours, harbour dues are collected by the Revenue Authorities.  In other years there has been a considerable increase in the staff required by the Revenue Commissioners.  There is no substantial change this year, because of the fact that no taxation changes were made or contemplated in the Budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister for some information regarding a large number, a couple of hundred, I think, of young men who were employed when the tariffs first came into existence.  I do not raise this matter in any critical spirit, but I think that some statement is due from the Minister, and that he should let these men know what is the intention of the Revenue Commissioners regarding their future conditions of unemployment.  I saw circulars issued some time ago that these men were employed on a year's probation, at the end of which, if they were found satisfactory, they were to be considered for permanent appointment. The salary attached to the position is £3 per week, and the employment is temporary.  I suggest to the Revenue Department that the conditions of the work which these people are carrying out are bad for the State and not fair to the men concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had an opportunity from time to time of seeing the work some of these men do, and I do not think I am unfair to anybody when I suggest that men who are entrusted with very important work of this kind, where the salary is small, are thrown in the way of temptation in many matters.  I think the Minister knows perfectly well what I am referring to.  In any case the men, such as they are&mdash;they number about 200&mdash;are entitled to know, after being employed so long, why their position is not more secure and why the conditions under which they were originally employed, have not been complied with.  I hope the Minister will <Col N="352" /> make up his mind to take a decision in the very near future and let these men know where they stand, whether or not they are going to be placed on a permanent basis or whether or not they are to be left with the miserable wage of £3 per week with the usual deductions.</P>

      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to an item in this Estimate&mdash;the Estate Duty Office &mdash;with regard to taking out administration and making registration in that office.  I think they have acted in a high-handed way in overcharging for stamp duties and registration.  I would refer to one case particularly, in regard to the registration of a coursing club.  About three weeks ago, the club made out an agreement and sent it on to the Estate Duty Office.  They got a reply from the Commissioners asking them to forward a sum of £7 10s. to get the club registered.  If they act in that way in every case, I think the people will not stand it. They should be fair and honest with every person.  About four or five months ago, to my own knowledge, there were six coursing clubs registered in the Estate Office, and the usual fee was only ten shillings.  I cannot see why they should now charge a coursing club £7 10s. to be registered, which sum they demanded to be forwarded to them within ten days.  I think that is very unfair and very unjust to the people.  It shows that the Commissioners are carrying on in a very high-handed manner, in trying to force people to pay them money which they are not entitled to get.  I would ask the Minister to look into this matter and see that justice and fair play are given to all parties.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin has referred to the position of temporary preventive men.  I want to follow that up by referring to another class of men under sub-head A&mdash;the case of Customs watchers.  I was approached some time ago, on behalf of these men, to make representations to the Minister. I hesitated doing so.  but finally promised to do so when the Estimates would come forward.  I think there is a case that I would ask the Minister to <Col N="353" /> take into special consideration and meet the claims of these 77 men.  They are seeking certain ameliorations in their conditions, and primarily they are seeking to be placed on the establishment. There is one point particularly which was placed before me, and which I consider requires to be stressed.  Deputy Davin has referred to the temporary preventive men, to the particular responsibilities they are faced with, and&mdash;shall I say&mdash;the temptations which low-wage men in their positions are liable to succumb to, in certain circumstances. That applies equally, and perhaps with more insistence, to these watchers.  They are men who are employed usually in guarding goods in Custom warehouses, on ships, and they are placed more or less in control for the time being, and there is a certain responsibility.  Although it may not be what one would call a high executive post, it is undoubtedly a position, where men ought to feel they are secure and have the protective value that is usually ascribed to superannuation expectations.  These men are not entitled to superannuation.</P>
      <P>It has often been claimed in regard to the provision of superannuation, that it is a protection, that men have a particular regard for hopes of superannuation, and that it is thereby an insurance for their good behaviour while in the service.  I put that point to the Minister, and ask him to give consideration to the claim of this small group of men who in all kinds of weather are required to follow Customs officers. When these officers are obliged to leave and to transfer their attention to other work, the watchers are left more or less, to keep guard.  I, therefore, press the Minister, without going into detail, to give consideration to the case this small group of men is making, and I leave it at that, with the hope that consideration will result in the satisfaction of the demands of this body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. ANTHONY Mr. ANTHONY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ANTHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to an item which comes under the Merchandise Marks Act, and to ask the Minister to see that the best efforts of his Department be directed against imported printing and lithographic matter not bearing an imprint of the <Col N="354" /> place of origin.  It is common knowledge in the South that agents from foreign firms are touting for orders.  In many cases, whilst they do not suggest that these orders will be executed at home, the merchants, traders and professional men who give the orders are led to believe that the printing and the lithographic work will be executed in the Free State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I have not at the moment with me the figures as regards imported printing and lithographic matter coming into the Saorstát, but I shall in the near future have occasion to refer to the matter when, possibly, the fiscal policy of the Saorstát will come up for consideration.  What we complain of in Cork is this: That notwithstanding the fact that a large amount of imported printing and lithographic matter does not bear an imprint denoting its place of origin, it gets through the Custom House and is delivered to the consignee. I do not suggest for a moment that that is intentional on the part of the officials, but the fact remains that when officials in the execution of their duty hold up some of this imported printing and lithographic matter, in answer to the urgent appeal or demands of the consignees, they frequently release this matter without further inquiry.  That is having a very injurious effect on the printing and lithographic industry of the South, and what I am stating as applying to Cork in this respect applies equally to Dublin and throughout the whole Saorstát. The country at the moment is being absolutely flooded with imported printing and lithographic matter.  One of the Deputies, on a Vote yesterday, mentioned imported prayer books and printing of that kind.  One of these days it will be a matter for very serious consideration for this Dáil to see whether something should not be done to prevent, or at least to limit, further importation into the country of printing and lithographic matter.  I have not by me the figures with regard to unemployment in the printing and kindred trades, but without being too indefinite I should say that the figure is nearly fifty per cent. of those engaged in the industry.  The fact that people are being thrown out of employment is <Col N="355" /> largely due to the fact that imported printing and lithographic matter is coming in without apparently any attempt being made to stop it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JASPER WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the observations that have been made in connection with the Estate Duty Office.  I wish to make a few references to the Stamp Duty Office in which the practice has been growing up of charging something like £7 10s. Od. under a law which is exactly the same as was in force when the charge was only 10s.  I think that the Stamp Office would need to be looked after in that respect.  In the Estate Duty Office things are rapidly drifting into a state of chaos.  The chaos is brought about <Col N="356" /> in this way.  If at the present time an executor under a will takes out probate in this country&mdash;it often happens that he has to take it out in England, and I might say that things have come to such a pass that men go to England to do so for their own protection&mdash;it means that he has to take out two grants of probate.  He then proceeds to sell the property left to him.  He divides the property amongst the legatees. It may be that in a year or two years afterwards a demand is made upon him for £100 or £200, being the valuation that some official sent down two years after has put on the estate. That is a kind of thing that ought to be stopped because every day it is having the effect of making the administration of estates in Ireland almost impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every day it is forcing people to leave this country with their money. They take their money away and live out of the country.  They are afraid to put their money into the purchase of property in this country because they fear that if they do so complications may afterwards follow and prevent them, if they so desire, from realising their property.  That has happened. Money is flowing out of the country every day.  It is going from the South of Ireland and from my own impoverished constituency.  It is going over to England.  Very often it is being sent thereby Free State officials and others who have seen these instances of maladministration of the Estate Duty Office in Ireland.  People have seen these instances of estates having been divided up and of claims being put in long afterwards&mdash;claims for the payment of estate duty long after the estate had been administered.  I realise, of course, that the Estate Duty Office. like the Income Tax Office, is a good cockshot for anyone, but it is an office that, I think, could be greatly improved. These claims for the payment of estate duty ought to be made at the earliest opportunity so that the executors can carry out their duties and not have all this money wending its way across to England, as is happening at present.  If an executor takes out administration here he has to pay, first, the full estate duty on the Irish and the English assets.  The Irish may predominate. <Col N="357" /> What he does now is, he takes out a grant first in England and then comes back to Ireland and takes out a grant as regards the residue with the least possible delay, and all because he is afraid of what may happen here. I think that as regards the taking out of administration and probates, executors ought to be met in a reasonable manner.  At present the work is not conducted in a reasonable manner.  As regards the Estate Duty Office, I express the hope that the work there will. be carried out on lines different to those prevailing at present.  If the work is carried on in an improved manner it will help to restore confidence in the people as well as in every public department we have.</P>

      <P>I desire to call the attention of the Minister for Finance to the regulations made in the beginning of this year with regard to motor-cars used for business purposes and coming into the Free State.  Those of us who reside in the Border counties have been brought more into contact with this than those who live further south.  It is a matter that affects our trade very much, especially farmers.  The regulation is that duty must be paid on a car entering the Free State and absolutely without any hope of return.  The Custom officer on duty on the first morning that regulation came into operation told the people coming across the Border that he had been instructed that farmers coming into the Free State in motor cars to attend one of our fairs fell into the same category as other business people if they were found asking the price of a beast on one of our fairs and that they were liable on conviction to the forfeiture of their cars and a fine as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result has been that the fairs of Monaghan and Clones especially have suffered very much from this.  The time the fair starts is usually before the trains arrive, and people come across the Border in motor cars.  On the first morning that the regulations came into force in the town of Monaghan, where there are usually from forty to fifty cars conveying cattle buyers, there were only four.  This was repeated in the other Border towns.  We feel that this is a point very well worth considering. <Col N="358" /> A few minutes ago the Minister for Industry and Commerce made the point, I think very properly, concerning railways, that trade might be altogether judged from the revenue got from the railways.  Our trade depends upon people coming in to do business with us.  We want people to come in and do business with us, and to give them facilities to do so in every possible way.  I bring this matter to the notice of the Minister, and I ask him if the same arrangement that holds good in regard to us farmers going out of the Free State into Northern Ireland, and which was in operation on this side before the beginning of the year, could not now operate so that the farmers and dealers on the other side, but only a few miles away, could now come in to our fairs and pursue their business there as traders as usual.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister for Finance to consider sympathetically the case of the nine clerical officers, the particulars of which I have placed before him for his consideration, at the earliest possible moment.  I think if he will consider that case, that the minimum salary of £70, plus bonus, has been paid to these nine men who passed in fairly high places in the examination held for these appointments, while their co-examinees received salaries of £90 plus bonus, he will see that something should be done.  These men are discharging satisfactorily the work entrusted to them; they were aged from 23 years upwards when they came into the service.  Boys entering the Civil Service at 18 years of age receive the same remuneration, and I think the Minister will find that the attitude towards the men for whom I plead was taken upon the plea that they had not before entering the Civil Service been on ordinary clerical work that came within the accepted terms.  I ask the Minister to consider as sympathetically as he possibly can the case of these nine men who, if these salaries are continued, will not reach the maximum until they are 42 years.  I think, in view of the very sympathetic attitude which we had yesterday on the remuneration of Civil Service officials, that a payment, such as a minimum of <Col N="359" /> £70 and bonus to men who qualified educationally and satisfied their departments in every way, is not satisfactory, and I hope that the Minister will at least put these men on an equal footing with their co-examinees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in the secretariat to which Deputy Cooper referred was due in part to the increased duties in connection with the Betting Tax which came into operation after last year's Estimates, and in part to the temporary increase in connection with the double tax relief agreement.  As Deputies know, the old system of getting relief from double taxation has been departed from and a new system has been initiated.  While that new system will save a good deal of work, at the time of transfer, when some of the complications of the old system were added on to the new, temporarily there has been an increase of work owing to the change over.  Then there were some officers on loan&mdash;an officer lent to the Land Commission had to be replaced.  With reference to Preventive men, an examination has been held, and of the temporary Preventive men 69 have been established.  I agree with Deputy Davin it is undesirable to have any great number of unestablished men upon this duty.  I think the duties of Preventive men are ordinarily as responsible, although not so varied, as the duty of, say, a policeman, and that consequently the keeping of a great number of Preventive men unestablished is not a desirable thing.</P>
      <P>So far as &ldquo;Watchers&rdquo; are concerned, I have not given any consideration previously to their case, as I have in the case of Auxiliary Preventive men.  The duties of the &ldquo;Watchers&rdquo; are lighter, and, I think, less responsible than the duties of the Preventive men.  There is also the fact that in the British Service at least the custom has been to employ ex-servicemen and people with pensions as Watchers.  However, I shall examine the case of the Watchers and see if there is anything that can be done in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was not able to understand Deputy Vaughan's complaint, and the only thing I could do would be to ask him <Col N="360" /> to see me about it so that I might find out exactly what is wrong, if there is anything wrong, and find out exactly what it is he complains about.  I think Deputy Anthony was complaining about an excess of printed matter being allowed to come in and that it was matter that could be detained under the Merchandise Marks Act.  If any cases are cited to me of printing that should have been detained under that Act being allowed in, I shall see that steps are taken to put an end to that, but if on the printed matter there does not appear anything that would mislead the public as to its origin, I do not think it can be detained under the Merchandise Marks Act.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wolfe complained of the Estate Duties Office.  At any rate he introduced a new note, because generally complaints have been made in regard to the collection of income tax, and I have not previously had a complaint in connection with the collection of estate duties.  The Deputy complained that the administration of the office is causing loss of revenue to the country.  Now if such loss is occurring, I would be most anxious to stop it, and I should like the Deputy to give me two or three cases where he says the executor or administrator was not fairly treated, and enable me to conduct an investigation into the matter.</P>
    <P>It would not be possible to return to the old regulations as to the admission of motor cars across the Border.  There is no doubt the old regulation was unfair to people who had to use cars here that paid duties, where people living across the Border and owning cars who did not pay duty were actually competing with them from day to day. If there is any hardship imposed by the existing regulations I would be always willing to consider it and to see if any means to obviate that hardship could be found.  I could not hold out any hope to the Deputy that we will go back to the old arrangements.</P>
